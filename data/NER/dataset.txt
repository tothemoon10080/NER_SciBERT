A	O

Firstly,	O
a	O

a	O
better	O

of	I-PAP

a	O

that	O

Secondly,	O
an	O

to	O
the	O
shale	O

but	O
beyond	O
a	O

rate,	O
it	O
can	O
inversely	O
affect	O

Thirdly,	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
a	O

in	O
a	O

In	O

The	O

Nevertheless,	O
the	O
function	O

remain	O

We	O

whether	O

a	O

We	O
showed	O
that	O

was	O
upregulated	O
in	O

regions	O
of	O
human	O
aortic	O

and	O
calcified	O

Furthermore,	O

reduced	O
hVIC	O
in	O

calcification,	O
osteogenic	O
differentiation,	O
and	O
apoptosis,	O
whereas	O
overexpression	O
of	O
PALMD	O
had	O
the	O
opposite	O
effect.	O
RNA-Seq	O
of	O
PALMD-depleted	O
hVICs	O
revealed	O
that	O

reduced	O
glycolysis	O

Having	O
established	O
the	O

we	O
examined	O
whether	O
glycolysis	O
itself	O
could	O
regulate	O
hVIC	O
osteogenic	O
differentiation	O
and	O
inflammation.	O
Intriguingly,	O
the	O
inhibition	O
of	O
PFKFB3-mediated	O
glycolysis	O
significantly	O
attenuated	O
osteogenic	O
differentiation	O
and	O
inflammation	O
of	O
hVICs.	O
However,	O
silencing	O
of	O
PFKFB3	O
inhibited	O
PALMD-induced	O
hVIC	O
inflammation,	O
but	O
not	O
osteogenic	O
differentiation.	O
Finally,	O
we	O
showed	O
that	O
the	O
overexpression	O
of	O
PALMD	O
enhanced	O
hVIC	O
osteogenic	O
differentiation	O
and	O
inflammation,	O
as	O
opposed	O
to	O
glycolysis,	O
through	O
the	O

The	O

may	O

We	O

that	O

The	O

is	O
undertaken	O
at	O

Consistent	O
with	O

literature	O

on	O

we	O
find	O
that	O

(emergence	O

In	O

We	O

that	O

originate	O
almost	O

that	O

Moreover,	O
only	O

However,	O

Consequently,	O

The	O

This	O
