The combustion synthesis behavior of Mo–Si–B powder was investigated. Test specimens with nominal compositions including MoSi2, Mo(Si0.975B0.025)2, Mo(Si0.95B0.05)2, Mo(Si0.925B0.075)2 and Mo(Si0.9B0.1)2 were employed. The combustion mode, propagation velocity of combustion wave, combustion temperature and combustion product structure were studied. The results showed that the combustion wave propagated along a spiral trajectory till reaching the bottom of the compacts. The combustion temperature was increased by the addition of boron, to as high as 1922K in the case of the Mo(Si0.95B0.05)2 sample. However, the flame-front propagation velocity decreased as a result of the addition of boron. The X-ray diffraction results showed that the combustion products of the Mo(Si0.975B0.025)2 and Mo(Si0.9B0.1)2 samples were composed of MoSi2 with minor MoB. Those of the Mo(Si0.95B0.05)2 and Mo(Si0.925B0.075)2 samples were composed of MoSi2 with minor MoB and MoB2. And traces of Mo2B5 were identified in the Mo(Si0.95B0.05)2 sample.Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi Although MoSi It has been shown that the room temperature fracture toughness and high-temperature strength of MoSi Recently, Mo–Si–B system intermetallics have been attracting a great deal of attention as a promising candidate material for containing Mo In addition, due to their high melting points, chemical stability, extremely high hardness, good corrosion resistance, and excellent high-temperature strength, molybdenum borides have attracted considerable interest for structural applications Combustion synthesis technology is a chemical reaction in a certain atmosphere in order to ignite powder compacts. The process is highly exothermic. A strong exothermic reaction at the surface liberates enough heat to heat the adjacent layer of reactants and the reaction becomes self-sustained In order to investigate the effect of boron on the combustion synthesis behavior of MoSi Molybdenum (3–5 The combustion synthesis experiments were conducted in a steel combustion chamber with a glass window, under an atmosphere of pure argon (99.99%, 0.1 A color CCD video camera was used to record the combustion synthesis images. Windows Movie Maker software was applied to analyze the combustion synthesis images and the combustion mode, and to calculate the propagation velocity of the combustion wave. Thermocouple wires (WRe3–WRe25 with a diameter of 0.1 The typical combustion images recorded from the samples with the nominal composition of MoSi  The flame-front propagation velocity of compacts was deduced from the combustion images recorded by the Windows Movie Maker software. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the combustion products are shown in This study presents an experimental investigation of the combustion characteristics, combustion temperature, flame-front propagation velocity and combustion products by using combustion synthesis technology. The combustion synthesis reaction is ignited locally at a point where the sample contacts with the ignition coil, and then quickly spread to the entire sample in a spiral way. The combustion temperature of the sample with the nominal composition of MoSi The combustion product of the sample with a molar ratio of Mo: Si The project was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province No.BK2009096 and Youth Foundation of China University of Mining and Technology No. 2008A046 and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation No. 20090461154.
