In this study, the Box-Wilson statistical experimental design method was employed to evaluate the effects of important variables such as bridging liquid (oil) concentration, salt (CaCl2·2H2O) concentration and stirring speed on the agglomeration of bituminous coal. Response function coefficients were determined by the regression analysis of experimental data and the predictions were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The optimum kerosene concentration, CaCl2·2H2O concentration and stirring speed were determined as 30wt%, 1M and 1683rpm, respectively, when considering combustible recovery and ash content.
                  In addition, contact angle and solution surface tension measurements were carried out to evaluate of agglomeration success with the contact angle values and surface tension values. The surface tension of CaCl2
                     2H2O solutions and the average contact angle increased with increasing CaCl2·2H2O concentration.Modern mining methods and cleaning processes increase the fine coal particle concentration continuously, which create several problems in dewatering, drying, handling transportation and storage. Significant quantities of these fine coals are lost in the waste stream, which results in a substantial loss of valuable energy and causes considerable environmental problems It is known that the electrokinetic behavior of the particles affects the process recovery and the selectivity in the concentration process; based on the surface properties, such as froth flotation, flocculation and oil agglomeration. Coal recovery and separation efficiency, which are achieved by oil agglomeration, depend on a number of factors including the surface properties of the solid, the nature of the agglomerates and certain properties of the aqueous medium Another aspect of the aqueous medium that deserves special consideration is the presence of multivalent cations, which form metal hydroxy complex ions in intermediate pH (6–8) ranges and colloidal precipitates of metal hydroxides in higher pH (>9) ranges Wettability characteristics of minerals have substantial influence over the efficiency of beneficiation and processing methods such as agglomeration, aggregation, flotation, dust controlling and solid–liquid separation  is the solid–oil surface tension (mN is the solid–water surface tension (mN is the oil–water surface tension (mN When a particle is placed in an oil–water interface, it may be drawn into the aqueous phase ( In this study, the Box-Wilson experimental design method was used in order to investigate the effects of important variables on combustible recovery on agglomeration of bituminous coal sample taken from Zonguldak. This experimental design is a response surface methodology used for evaluation of a dependent variable as functions of independent variables. The oil concentration, CaCl The coal sample, which was bituminous, was obtained from TTK Zonguldak coal washery and ground to <106 In the experiments, kerosene used as bridging liquid was characterized as having a density of 0.780 The experiments were performed in a 400  ash content of clean coal, ash content of feed, mass of clean coal, mass of feed. Contact angle ( A Box-Wilson statistical experimental design method was used to determine the effects of major operating parameters on combustible recovery and ash content. More information about this method is given in related literature The combustible recovery or ash content (  the predicted response function (combustible recovery or ash content), constant, linear coefficients, cross-product coefficients, quadratic coefficients. The combustible recoveries and ash contents obtained from the experiments that consisted of six axial ( Experimental results were modeled using a Statistica 5.0 regression analysis program to determine the coefficients of the response function (Eq. The effects of operating variables on the combustible recovery and ash content were determined by obtaining projections of the response functions on certain planes of known parameter values. Variation of the surface tension of CaCl It is shown in In order to determine the effect of stirring speed on combustible recovery and ash content at a CaCl As shown in As seen in  As can be seen in As can be seen in And also, the ash content of the product decreased with increasing the surface tension of solution. It could be based on the insufficient attaching of kerosene to the mineral matter surfaces that had poor hydrophobicity at these solution surface tensions. A similar graph representing variation of combustible recovery and ash content with kerosene concentration at constant CaCl It can be shown in As can be seen in Variations of combustible recovery and ash content with kerosene concentration at different levels of CaCl It can be seen from In an electrokinetic study performed for Zonguldak coals, the isoelectric point (iep) value of coal was found to be pH 4. In the same study, it was also found that the zeta potential values of coal were −50 and +15 The effect of CaCl As shown in As observed in The combustible recovery and ash content as a function of CaCl  Also, The conclusions obtained from this study are as follows: The Box-Wilson statistical experimental design procedure was seen to be applicable in modeling to evaluate the effects of important variables on the combustible recovery and ash content of agglomerated product in oil agglomeration of bituminous coal. Response function predictions determined by regression analysis were in good agreement with the experimental results. The surface tension of CaCl The combustible recovery increased with an increase in stirring speed up to 1750 The combustible recovery increased with the increasing kerosene concentration up to 30 The combustible recovery decreased with the increasing salt concentration at low stirring speeds (500 and 816 Considering combustible recovery and ash content, the optimum kerosene concentration, CaCl
