High-entropy CoCrFeNiAl0.3 alloy thin films were prepared by magnetron sputtering technique. The thin film surface was very smooth and homogeneous. The synchrotron X-ray experiment confirmed that (111) type of texture existed in the thin film, and the structure was face-centered cubic nanocrystals with a minor content of ordered NiAl-type body-centered cubic structures. Interestingly, the elastic modulus of the thin film was nearly the same to the bulk single-crystal counterpart, however, the nanohardness is about four times of the bulk single-crystal counterpart. It was found that the high hardness was due to the formation of nanocrystal structure inside the thin films and the preferred growth orientation, which could be promising for applications in micro fabrication and advanced coating technologies.In recent years, high entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted tremendous research interests due to their unique alloy designing concept in the field of materials science and metallurgical engineering Among existing reported HEA systems, CoCrFeNiAl As shown in  To systematically investigate the thin film growth process, four kinds of thin film with increased deposition time of 15 To further identify the phase structure in the thin film, synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering experiment was conducted on the thin film at room temperature. The thin film on a silicon substrate for synchrotron experiment was cut to be a size of 3  As shown, the HEA thin film prepared by magnetron sputtering technique is mainly composed with nanocrystals, indicating that the microstructure of the HEA thin film is completely different from that of the traditional HEA bulk samples, which are generally composed with large grains. Nano-grained metals usually exhibit a very high strength and hardness In summary, it is found that magnetron sputtering technique can be an efficient way to prepare high-quality nanocrystalline HEA thin films with smooth and homogeneous surface morphology for coating purposes.
