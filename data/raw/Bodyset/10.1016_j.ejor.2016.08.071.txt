A decomposition method is developed to optimize a mineral value chain composed of multiple mines and a material flow circuit. In the proposed decomposition method, the upstream mine production schedule and the downstream material flow plan are optimized simultaneously to maximize the expected NPV of the entire mineral value chain. The proposed approach is tested through a practical-scale case study and the test results show that the proposed method can effectively optimize the production schedule of each mine in consideration of downstream constraints and market uncertainty. Through the observation of the test results, we show that optimizing a mineral value chain in an integrative manner and considering market uncertainty can avoid overinvestment in strategic assets and overestimation of long-term profitability. The proposed decomposition method is not limited to the setting of a specific mineral value chain and can be easily extended to integrate more impacting factors.A typical mineral value chain (MVC) consists of single or multiple mines and a material flow circuit, as shown in In the literature, optimization in the mining industry usually focuses on mine production scheduling (MPS) and material flow planning (MFP). MPS at a given mine optimizes which areas of the mine deposit should be extracted and when, while a MFP problem optimizes the downstream plans over the planning horizon, such as the transportation of materials, the processing rate and the capacity of mills, smelters, stockpiles, and so on. A multi-mine MVC, as in In MPS, the objective is typically to maximize the expected net present value (NPV) of the valuable material mined during the planning horizon subject to mining precedence constraints and mining capacity constraints. In mining engineering, a mineral deposit is modeled by a large number of mining blocks, and the extraction of a block is a task to be scheduled. The number of binary variables used to model real-world MPS is in the order hundreds of thousands or millions. Ongoing research in MPS focuses on designing algorithms to search for a near optimal solution for the very large numbers of mining blocks involved. A review of research on MPS can be found in In MFP, the production schedules of mines considered are typically treated as fixed. The objective of a MFP is to maximize the expected NPV given the fixed production schedules of the mines involved subject to the transport capacity of each arc and the processing capacity of each node in the material flow chart of MVC. The complexity of MFP depends on the structure of MVC and the factors considered. The structure of a MVC is determined by the material flow circuit, and can be expanded when other features, such as outsourcing, closed-loop processing, and so on, are considered. The details include the nonlinear relationship between input and output at each part in the MVC, resource allocations (e.g., labor, equipment, facilities, etc.), setup costs, operational risks, and so on. When market uncertainty is considered, a sufficient number of market scenarios have to be integrated in the model. Hence, the size of the MFP problem depends on the number of market scenarios considered. The complexities described above make it difficult to integrate MPS and MFP to search for the best solution for the entire MVC. In the literature on MVC optimizations, some work can be found that optimizes part of a MVC by treating the outputs of the other parts as fixed. Most of the existing methods for MVC optimization described above are capable of optimizing very specific forms of MVCs, while ignoring some substantial impacting factors, thus leading to suboptimal plans. As a consequence, the resulting poor investments in strategic assets may have a considerable impact on a company’s long-term profitability. In the work presented in the following sections, a dynamic-material-value-based decomposition method (DMVBD) is developed to allow the optimization of the MPS and the MFP models of a MVC to be synchronized through iteration. This leads to a final solution for each of the MPS and MFP close to the best solution for the entire MVC. DMVBD developed herein has the following advantages. First, it is easy to integrate DMVBD with the optimizers already employed by the company for solving independent MPS and MFP problems, such as Earthworks multimine scheduler, ECSI maximiser, MinMAX planner, Whittle strategic mine planning, and so on ( The paper is organized as follows. In The DMVBD proposed herein is applicable for optimizing MVC with single or multiple mines and a material flow circuit, as introduced in This section focuses on a general form of the MPS model that optimizes the extraction schedule while considering geological uncertainty. A mineral deposit is represented by an orebody model, which is comprised of a number of mining ‘blocks’. A block is an indivisible unit for generating the extraction schedule. The examples of orebody models can be found in our case study in                      The MPS model is formulated as A material flow circuit with a typical structure is outlined in this section to demonstrate DMVBD. However, similar to the MPS model, our MFP model can be easily extended to account for a more complex material flow circuit. In addition to the symbols defined for the MPS model, the following are defined for the MFP model.                      The MFP model is formulated as In the proposed DMVBD, the MPS model(s) and the MFP model are solved separately and synchronized through iteration. Because DMVBD is not limited to specific forms of each individual model, various solution methods can be used to solve a MPS model and a MFP model. In this work, the focus is on the steps of DMVBD. The solution methods for solving individual models used herein are described in In DMVBD, the material value,    IF Set Set GOTO Step 2; ELSE STOP; END IF The proposed DMVBD is tested in a case that includes two copper mines (Mine A and Mine B), a number of material stockpiles and a processing plant. Mine A and Mine B contain 40,044 blocks and 136,094 blocks, respectively. Twenty simulated orebody scenarios are available for both mines and 17 predecessors are considered for each block. The cost of mining a block depends on the depth of its location and is ranged from To implement DMVBD, the control parameters are set to The algorithms are programmed using Matlab R2015b and CPLEX 12.51. The algorithms are tested on a platform of Intel Xeon X5650 with two 2.67 gigahertz processors and 24.0 gigabytes RAM. The MVC plan, including the production schedules of all mines and the material flow plan, obtained by DMVBD is compared with the MVC plan obtained by a local optimization method (LO), in which the value of each type of material is estimated based on constant commodity prices, mining costs, and processing costs. With the estimated material values, the decision maker first generates the production schedule at mines and then optimizes the material flow plan based on the obtained schedule. In LO, each mine optimizes its MPS without considering other mines and the downstream material flow circuit.    The numerical results in our case study show that, although the MFP model is a black box to the MPS models, by properly adjusting the material value for each period, the proposed method can automatically adjust the MPS to account for the downstream congestions and the market fluctuation. We repeat the test with various parameter settings and commodity price fluctuations. The test results are similar and the conclusion holds. Given that the life of a mineral value chain usually lasts for decades, it is important to integrate all the parts of a MVC when optimizing strategic decisions and forecasting long-term profitability. Otherwise, as shown in the numerical results in Another issue concerns decision-makers is whether and how the fluctuation and the uncertainty of the market affect strategic decisions. In order to answer the questions, we design another numerical test in which the MVC is optimized with a constant commodity price equal to 4000 ($ per tonne) and the other settings are the same, as in the case in In this work, a dynamic-material-value-based decomposition method is developed to optimize a mineral value chain in consideration of both upstream (geological) and downstream (market) uncertainties. In the proposed method, different parts of a mineral value chain are optimized in an integrative manner. The numerical test shows that, by using the proposed method, both the upstream mines and the downstream processing circuit are optimized for the best solution of the entire mineral value chain so that a higher long-term profitability is obtained. Through the observations of the test results, it is concluded that the over-investment in strategic assets might occur if different parts of the mineral value chain are optimized separately or if the market uncertainty is ignored. This paper shows that ignoring the market uncertainty might lead to severe overestimation in long-term profitability. The proposed method makes it possible for the decision-makers to optimize a mineral value chain with a complex structure. By extending the MFP model, we can integrate more impacting factors, such as operational uncertainties, nonlinear transformations of materials, resource allocations, and so on.
