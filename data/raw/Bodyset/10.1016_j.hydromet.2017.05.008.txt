The current standard for the recovery of uranium from phosphoric acid is the so-called URPHOS process, where the solvent is a synergistic mixture of 0.5M di-2-ethyl-hexyl-phosphoric acid (HDEHP), which is used as a cation exchanger, and 0.125M tri-n-octyl-phosphine oxide (TOPO), which acts as a neutral donor.
                  Here, the full synthesis of a novel family of “autosynergistic” molecules that contain a phosphoric acid group, similar to HDEHP, and a phosphine oxide group, similar to TOPO is described. These new bifunctional ligands were tested for the selective recovery of uranium(VI) from a 5M phosphoric acid solution. The association of components of HDEHP and TOPO (a cation exchanger+a neutral donor) in a single molecule improves uranium extraction and its selectivity over iron in comparison to a synergistic mixture of the extractants.Wet-process phosphoric acid (WPA) is an important unconventional source of uranium. The quantities of available uranium vary within a deposit and between different mineral fields (from 20 to 200 The URPHOS system is a successful uranium recovery process that uses a synergistic combination of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as a cationic exchanger and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as a neutral donor ( A large number of studies have been launched to develop new processes or to improve existing ones ( Another approach is the use of a single molecule or an “autosynergistic” molecule that combines both cationic exchanger and neutral donor functions in a same molecular architecture, although this has been less described in the literature. For example, a combination of phosphoric acid and phosphine oxide functions separated by a polyether chain ( The concept of combining a neutral donor with an acidic extractant to form bifunctional molecules that achieve the selective extraction of uranium from phosphoric acid has been recently explored. Indeed, a new family of bifunctional molecules has been synthesised and studied for the extraction of U(VI) in phosphoric solutions based on amidophosphonic acid ( The present work builds upon these recent investigations of combined solvent systems with the development of bifunctional extractants based on a phosphine oxide-phosphonate moiety. Such bifunctional extractants can be assimilated to a mimic of the HDEHP/TOPO synergistic mixture in one entity, where the phosphonate group acts as the cationic exchanger, similar to HDEHP, and the phosphine oxide moiety can be considered as a donor-solvating group, similar to the TOPO in the synergistic system ( The general ligand synthesis procedure and their characterizations are reported in supporting information. The first aqueous phase was prepared from a mixture of 250 The second aqueous phase was prepared from a genuine industrial phosphoric solution (4.5 Extractions were performed at 25 After phase separation by centrifugation (4000 ammonium oxalate 0.3 sodium carbonate 1 The same experiment was also conducted in a glove box under similar conditions; however, in this case, the initial aqueous phases were spiked with Distribution ratio ( The products were synthesised according to The corresponding (dialkylphosphoryl)-methyl-(dialkylphosphonate) compounds (4) were then submitted to monosaponification with aqueous potassium hydroxide, resulting in the formation of compounds 5. The introduction of various alkyl functions on the methylene bridge of compounds 4 by alkylation using a halogenoalkyl compound and sodium hydride can also be performed. At this stage, compound 4 was alkylated by reaction of iodooctane with sodium hydride, affording compounds 6, which can be converted to compounds 7 after monosaponification. The ligands ( Previous studies on amidophosphonate extractants showed that the combination of a C8 chain on the amido part (R) and a C4 chain on the phosphonate function (R’) is the best compromise between lipophilicity and viscosity ( Preliminary screening tests were performed with compound group 5, but no reliable extraction data could be obtained due to the formation of a third phase; in contrast, a third phase was not observed with the corresponding amido-phosphonate ligands ( To avoid the formation of a third phase, α-alkylated bifunctional ligands by introducing an alkyl chain on the central methylene bridge have been synthesised. Furthermore, for the amido-phosphonate ligand DEHCNPB, the monoalkylation of the carbon bridge provides much better selectivity for uranium towards iron ( Extraction experiments for ligand group 7 indicate that the introduction of an octyl group on the methylene bridge between the two phosphorus atoms prevents the formation of a third phase, as observed for the corresponding non-alkylated ligands (5); this might be achieved mainly due to the increase in the lipophilicity of the ligand. The extraction of U(VI) and iron from a synthetic phosphoric acid solution (5 Furthermore, the distribution ratio for U(VI) obtained with ligands (7) are > Interestingly, a remarkable enhancement in the uranium extraction was obtained for ligands 7d and 7e, where the n-octyl chain is substituted by an ethylhexyl chain on the phosphoryl group. This behaviour has been already observed with amidophosphonate based ligands. A set of experiments was performed starting from an industrial phosphoric acid solution obtained by the action of sulfuric acid on calcium phosphate rocks (wet-process phosphoric acid [WPA]) ( The extraction experiment was carried out by placing a volume of the genuine phosphoric acid in contact with an equal volume of a 0.1-M solution of ligand 7d (DEHPNPB) diluted in dodecane. The DEHPNPB ligand was chosen for its extraction performance and, also, to compare it with the behaviour of the corresponding amidophosphonate ligand (DEHCNPB). The results are summarized in the The affinity for uranium and the trends already observed for the synthetic solutions were confirmed for the extraction experiment performed using a genuine industrial phosphoric acid solution. The results clearly show that the ligand exhibits good extraction behaviour with distribution ratio values of ~ For other impurities (Mo, Zr, V, Al, and Ti), it was not possible to measure distribution ratios with accuracy (due to very low values, interferences, or difficulties in the stripping of those elements from the organic phase). Nevertheless, the extraction of aluminium, vanadium and titanium was very low for both extractants ( An efficient way to synthesise, in high yield, a new family of bifunctional ligands bearing a cationic exchanger based on a phosphoric group similar to HDEHP and a donor-solvating group based on a phosphine oxide moiety similar to the TOPO in the URPHOS synergistic system has been reported. These “autosynergistic” molecules exhibit higher extraction efficiency for U(VI) towards Fe(III) from a concentrated phosphoric acid solution compared to the use of two molecules in a synergistic ratio. Moreover, the selective extraction of uranium from phosphoric acid is better than the HDEHP/TOPO system even in the presence of many impurities, as demonstrated in tests with a genuine industrial phosphoric acid solution. Even if the selectivity is lower for the multifunctional ligand with a phosphoryl group in comparison to the amido-derivative, the new phosphine oxide-phosphonate extractants should pave the way towards the efficient extraction of uranium(VI) from concentrated phosphoric acid.
