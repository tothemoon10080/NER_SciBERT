Carpal fractures excluding the scaphoid can cause morbidity that is disproportionate to their incidence because they are easily overlooked and are often harbingers of a wider wrist injury. Failure to recognize a more global injury pattern can result in undertreatment and permanent wrist dysfunction. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, familiarity with carpal topography to guide the physical examination, and judicious use of specialized radiographic views and ancillary imaging techniques.
