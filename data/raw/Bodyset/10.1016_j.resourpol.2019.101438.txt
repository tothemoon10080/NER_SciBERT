Current industry practice aims to develop mine designs with a fixed system configuration for a single set of inputs; without regard for uncertainty. Uncertainty is a key element of mining which causes variability in the inputs to the decision making process. Various sources of uncertainty exist in mining projects which may stem from volatility in commodity prices, unknown geological conditions, variable costs or unpredictable productivities. Design approaches that attempt to leverage this uncertainty are proposed and compared in this paper; namely, flexible, robust and operational designs. An analysis of these system configurations reveal that a flexible system configuration generates more value than a robust system configuration, which in turn generates more value than a fixed system configuration. However, a flexible system configuration cannot be practically implemented due to constant change. A robust configuration provides a solution where change can be handled and the analysis of the flexible system configuration provides an optimal frontier (value potential) to compare alternatives. An operational system configuration can be generated by analysing the system configurations generated by flexible and robust design. This paper uses a case study to develop and compare these modelling methodologies and proposes an operational system configuration; as a best fit.A mining operation generally consists of several different design options which may include different mining operation fleets, processing plants, stockpiling options and product choices. Several alternative design options generally exist from which a single system configuration is selected which dictates the production capability. For an open pit mine, this system configuration is typically made with reference to a single set of input parameters and conditions, with minimal regard for uncertainty. However, the reality is, there is large variability in actual parameters and conditions. Sources of variability include, volatility in commodity prices, unknown geological conditions, variable costs or unpredictable productivities. In general, current mine planning packages uses a set of average values for input variables such as commodity price, equipment utilisation, mining and processing cost to generate ‘optimal’ designs that disregard input variable uncertainty. Making a decision with uncertain information is a common reality, however making a decision without adequately considering and analysing the input variables can lead to failure. Consideration of flexibility in the optimisation process can accommodate the impact of these uncertainties and mitigate the possible down side risk or leverage the upside potential. The commonly accepted objective of mine optimisation is to maximise the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project for a single set of agreed inputs ( The manual iteration of these six planning steps likely leads to suboptimal solutions. Methods which optimise multiple steps simultaneously have been proposed ( Whilst these methods provide significant value potential, they generally consider a deterministic representation of the inputs and do not allow for variability. The benefits of considering uncertainty in mine design were first discussed in Introducing design options to the optimisation process in order to provide flexibility is a potential solution to realise value from uncertainty. Research into methods that include design options in the system configuration has been studied by de Neufville and his colleagues in various industries ( Recent research has focused on including the system configuration and uncertainty in the optimisation model ( This paper builds on the A mathematical model is used to integrate four of the six planning steps; mining and milling capacity, capital and operating costs, cutoff-grade and mine production schedule. MCS, CS and MIP methods are used to model alternative design methodologies. Uncertainties are simulated as inputs to the MIP model. The MIP model allows for ‘go’ or ‘no go’ decisions for implementation of design options to be determined. An optimised MIP model determines the optimal execution timing of design options together with the production schedule. MCS allows distributions which are too laborious or impossible to be solved by closed form analytical equations and CS is used to estimate geological uncertainty. CS uses a MCS type simulation to model uncertainty by conditionally controlling variability between spatial attributes to ensure equally probable realizations which reflect the geological variability and spatial continuity of the mineralisation. Four types of design options are dynamically incorporated in the model. These are mining options, pre-processing stockpiles, processing plant options and product types. Mine options represent the physical extraction capacity (upper bound) on the annual tonnage or effective flat haul. Pre-processing stockpiles are locations that store material over periods. They can be long term low grade, fluctuating demand stores or be used to model a waste rock storage limit. Processing plant options represent the physical and/or chemical process to remove gangue material. Processing plants may contain multiple different circuits. These circuits may have different beneficiation characteristics and individual capacity limits. Product options are related to different types of material which can be sold, each with its own capacity, grade specifications and payoff functions. These can be used to model alternative marketing strategies. A graphical example of this design option network is provided in These elements are combined in an optimisation model to determine the optimal design for each model type. A comparison of model features is shown in A MIP mathematical formulation is proposed for generating alternative system configurations by including uncertainty. This model builds on earlier work by Further, model performance is improved by modifying how binary variables behave, the inclusion of additional model bounds that do not impact model optimality and variable reduction strategies. Additionally, the revised model format allows the same underlying mathematical model to be used for fixed, flexible, robust and operational modes. The following section presents the revised mathematical model with detailed explanations.                                                              The objective function maximises the equally weighted net present value (NPV) of all simulations (or a single scenario for a flexible model) where value is determined by; adding the revenue from material directly processed for sale, adding the revenue from stockpile material processed for sale, subtracting the variable cost of mining, reclaiming and processing this material, subtracting the fixed cost of operating an option, subtracting the capital cost of introducing the option and subtracting the disposal cost of the option. The constraints can be divided into four categories: production, design option, stockpiling and product limiting constraints.  The production constraints limit quantities and grades of material production over time. The amount of material extracted from a bin has an upper bound based on the resource model constrained by Constraint 1. The physical scheduling dependency on block access is enforced by Constraint 2 and 3. Constraint 2 sets  Each design option is reflected by an integer variable (if it can be executed multiple times) or a binary variable (if it can be executed only once). An upper capacity limit on an option is enforced by Constraint 8 (pre-stockpile) and Constraint 9 (post-stockpile). A capacity limit on individual process plant circuits is applied by Constraint 10. The capital cost and disposal cost of each design option is captured by Constraint 11 and 12 respectively. Option dependency relationships are handled through Constraint 13.  Mathematically handling stockpiling creates a non-linear problem, thus a linear approximation utilising a material bins concept is implemented. This tracks the flow of material into a stockpile bin and out of a stockpile bin. Material in the resource has exactly one stockpile bin it can enter based on the grade limits of the primary element. The average grade extracted from a stockpile bin is predetermined in the model generation phase. Constraint 14 ensures the material leaving the stockpile must not exceed the material entering the stockpile. Constraint 15 limits the total amount of material on a stockpile.  Constraint 16 provides an upper bound to the quantity of product that can be produced. Constraint 17 and 18 apply a lower and upper bound respectively to the grade of material produced by controlling metal content.  These constraints further bound the solution space of the model in the optimisation process whilst not violating model optimality and improve solution time. They utilise specific knowledge of the mining problem to improve the quality of the linear relaxation solution which reduces model computation time. The first cut (19) requires any option These constraints enforce non-negativity and integrality of the variables as required. Solving for optimality is possible with this formulation, however the computation time can be significant when applied to typical resource models where multiple pushbacks and benches are modelled. An investigation of several strategies to reduce the number of variables in the mathematical model formulation resulted in the inclusion of four variable reduction algorithms. The first, determines a late start period on the execution of an option based on whether the remaining time in the model would allow payback. The second, is an early start restriction that removes any parcel which cannot be mined by a period The problem size reduction was applied to a model with a resource model containing six pushbacks with 71 benches that contained a total of 1224 grade bins. The design options in the model consisted of two mining options, five processing plant options, three stockpiles and seven decision points (represented 11 years of project life). On average, this results in a 65% reduction in linear variables and 57% reduction in binary variables in the model as shown in This case study uses an actual executed feasibility study for a mining project. Due to commercial sensitivities, a proxy financial model is constructed with comparable outcomes. The investment decision in the feasibility study is contrasted to an analysis where uncertainty is included. The project is a mid-size gold deposit in a developing country. A three dimensional resource block model with over 1.5 Million cells was constructed to represent the geology. An ultimate pit limit optimisation using the Lerchs-Grossman technique was developed to guide the pushback design. Material with similar characteristics is then grouped by pushback and bench (20 m spacing). Vertical and lateral sequencing constraints are implemented between the pushbacks. From a metallurgical perspective, a gravity circuit can be used to capture a large portion of gold with the remainder amenable to leaching. Thus, Carbon in Leach (CIL) or Dump Leach (DL) processing options are considered as appropriate. Three alternative system configuration options are included in the optimisation; (a) different mining extraction rates (capacity), (b) different CIL process plant capacities and (c) alternative process routes (CIL vs dump leach). The alternative design options are shown in The network configuration defines how material flows, in and out of each option as outlined in For uncertainty analysis, variability is included in the gold price, mining cost, processing cost, mine utilisation, process utilisation and administration cost by MCS and geological uncertainty by CS models. MCS variables are estimated with @Risk™ software as per the parameters in The geological representation used in the feasibility analysis is based on a single Kriged model. Geological uncertainty is modelled by combing the Kriged model for the minor shear geological unit (narrow high grade structure with limited variability) with one hundred CS simulated models of the main geological structure. A cross section comparison between the Kriged and CS models is shown in Seven decision points are used to represent a twelve-year time horizon in the model, as shown in The mathematical model was developed in a custom code written in Visual Basic. NET and solved in Gurobi 6.5.0™. The computational performance is shown in The system configuration recommended by traditional modelling methods in the feasibility study is shown in An optimal system configuration for average deterministic input variables was developed by running a single flexible mode model. This indicates a key change to the feasibility system configuration which an increase in the plant capacity and an extended mine life as shown in An ‘optimal frontier’ for the project was generated by running the flexible mode for all simulation scenarios. Each run of the model generates the best system configuration for that simulation. An analysis of these system configurations can generates design insights, as shown in A system configuration which can handle variability in parameters with a single system configuration can be generated by running the robust mode. In this modelling mode the 25th, 50 A practical system configuration which can be committed to in the short term but allows flexibility into the future can be generated by an operational mode of the model. An operational mode is a hybrid between a robust system configuration (in early periods) and a flexible system configuration (in later periods). The system configuration is manually selected for the first three periods by analysing outcomes of the other model modes with optimisation used for the later periods of the model, shown in For each system configuration, a Value at Risk Graph (VARG) is generated based on the performance of the system over the simulated scenarios, this is shown on a single graph in It can be seen that the design of the feasibility system configuration significantly underperforms alternative modes with an NPV of $139.1M. A fixed system configuration for the same deterministic parameters ( To finish, a comparison of the alternatives with the actual project values is provided in This research outlines an approach to include uncertainty in the design optimisation process to provide better decision making ability for managers. This allows plans with reasonable levels of operational flexibility over time to be developed. The methodology outlined involves the use of multiple model modes - fixed, flexible, robust and operational system configurations to analyse the best system configuration. This methodology is implemented to a case study of an actual feasibility study and demonstrates the additional value potential. Improvement to the feasibility system configuration was made possible by including the design options in the optimisation process using a flexible mode for a single deterministic scenario ENPV of $268.6M (+$1.9M). This recommended a delay in the commencement of the operation by one period. By including flexibility into the system configuration in the later periods and only fixing the configuration in the early periods it was possible to generate an operational strategy which generated an ENPV of $274.2M (+$7.3M). This was achieved by implementing the suggested configuration from the robust mode for the first three years with full flexibility to modify the system configuration in the later years. Next, a system configuration with full flexibility demonstrated an ENPV of $285.5M (+$18.6M) however, this serves as an upper bound on the potential value of the system configuration which is useful for comparing alternative designs but is unlikely to be achieved (as it assumes perfect information is available for management in order to make optimal decisions in every period). Finally, a back analysis of the operational system configuration confirmed additional value was likely by including system configuration and uncertainty in the optimisation process.
