Materials of the same mechanical properties can still vary in quality and conformity to standards. In this study, the quality and conformity of carbon steel AISI 1035 under varying heat treatment conditions was investigated. The sample was prepared by cutting carbon steel AISI 1035 into rectangular shapes of 55 mm by 10 mm with a notch of 2 mm deep and angle of 45o. The steel is of varying thickness of 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm were placed in a furnace and heated to temperature to 573 K. The hardness and impact test were thereafter carried out using the Brinellâ€™s hardness test and Charpy impact test. In addition, the test for quality and conformity expressed as a function of the standard deviation and mean of the samples were determined using the t and chi square distribution respectively. Results obtained indicates that the strength and hardness of carbon steel AISI 1035 reduces with increase in temperature. The successful completion of this work provides design data for the quality and conformity control of carbon steel AISI 1035.
