The flow behavior in hydrocyclones is extremely complex, leading the designers to rely on empirical equations for predicting cyclone performance. A number of classifying cyclone models have been developed and used in mineral comminution circuit simulators in the past. The problem with these empirical cyclone models is that they cannot be used outside the range of conditions under which they were developed. A semi-mechanistic hydrocyclone model is developed using the dimensionless approach based on both the fluid mechanics concepts from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and the wide range of industrial cyclone performance data. The improved model consist a set of equations for the water split to underflow (R

                     , Q gives a very good fit to the data. The alpha model shows reasonable correlation for the cyclone design and operating conditions. Additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model by comparing the predictions of the model equations with the experimental results.Feed slurry is introduced under the high pressure tangentially into the hydrocyclone. This creates the centrifugal force and the flux of particles toward the radial positions, thus leading to phase separation. Although the design and operation of the hydrocyclone is simple, the flow behavior is complex. This poses a challenge when developing a mathematical model that can be applied for the design and the optimization of this device. As a result many designers rely on empirical equations for predicting cyclone performance. In addition to capacity, hydrocyclones are usually modeled in terms of partition curve properties namely; cut-size, flow split and sharpness of separation. One of the first comprehensive models that were used to predict the performance of industrial hydrocyclones was developed by Lynch and co-workers at University of Queensland ( The The Other hydrocyclone models include The problem with the above-mentioned empirical cyclone models is that they cannot be used outside the range of conditions under which they were developed. Furthermore, any change to the design of the cyclone (e.g. cone angle, body length etc) means that the empirical constants have to be refitted. In view of this shortcoming, inputs from mathematical models based on fluid mechanics are highly desirable. Alternatively multi-phase flow in cyclones can be modeled more fundamentally by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CFD provides a means of predicting velocity profiles under a wide range of design and operating conditions. There are numerous numerical studies on the flow and the particle motion in hydrocyclones ( In this paper, the development of improved semi-empirical hydrocyclone model is attempted by collecting an extensive historical data base. Inputs on particle classification mechanism elucidate from CFD were used to understand and identify the key flow variables that affect the cyclone performance when classifying the particles by size wise. Although historical data covered a wide range of conditions further tests were performed at both full scale and pilot-plant to fill the gaps, especially at low to moderate feed solids concentration and for different cone sections. A new cyclone model structure based on a dimensionless approach that incorporates the variables suggested to be important from the CFD is reported and model validation results are given. A large number of data sets containing the performance of hydrocyclones when operated under different conditions and various designs was compiled and used for the development of the model. The composition of the data includes larger portion of the historical data, the data collected from series of tests conducted with pilot and laboratory size cyclones to fill the gaps in the database such as hydrocyclones operating at low feed solids and the data from hydrocyclones fitted with various cone angles. The following is a summary of researchers who have extensively measured the hydrocyclone performance data used for the development of the new model reported in this work.           A review of the historical database indicated a number of gaps such as: Most of the previous historical data has feed solids concentration in range of 40–70 Some of the historical data sets from The historical data has a limited range of data on cone angle affect. Limited range of data for large diameter cyclones below 40 Additional experiments were performed covering the conditions that were missing in the database complied from historical data. The additional experiments performed included. Work was conducted using a 10 37 tests on a 20 For the tests by A summary of the data used for model development is given in The efficiency curves for 479 data sets have been plotted to check the data quality. It has been found that most of the data sets appear to be good as far as the efficiency curve is concerned, but only a few data sets have obvious measurement errors. Some data sets appeared have poor efficiency curves for modeling studies. As reported elsewhere by authors ( In a hydrocyclone, the tangential velocity is the key velocity component in separating the particle in a centrifugal field. The tangential velocity of the fluid in a given cyclone increases as radius decreases from the cyclone wall and reaches a maximum and then decreases as the air-core is approached. The free vortex condition where there is complete conservation of angular momentum is thus being approached.  Further the tangential velocity of the fluid near the wall of cyclone can be deduced as The parameter The multi-phase turbulence analysis discussed by authors ( Further an attempt was made to test and use a simple empirical correlation for diffusion coefficient calculations available in the literature for hydrocyclones. To this end, a number of equations were tested and analyzed (  Usually the variation in cone angle changes the flow reversals and the locus of zero vertical velocity (LZVV) near the bottom of the conical section of hydrocyclones. It is important to consider slurry rheology to understand the separation mechanism for hydrocyclones ( Based on CFD studies conducted in dense medium cyclones & hydrocyclones by the authors ( A model that describes viscosity as a function of solids concentration was initially considered for the development of a semi-mechanistic cyclone model as an independent variable. This was defined as given in Eq. Though the Eq. The additional effect of the fine fraction below 38 Apart from influencing slurry viscosity, the feed solids concentration also changes the settling rate of particle in liquid–solid systems. Where   Eq. The development of an improved hydrocyclone model is attempted by collecting an extensive data base as described in the data collection section. Inputs from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on particle classification mechanism from were considered to understand and identify the key flow parameters that affect the cyclone performance while separating the particles by size basis. Using the experimental data and inputs from CFD a new cyclone model structure based on the dimensionless approach was then formulated. The most commonly changed variables for cyclones in industrial practice are A number of additional compound dimensionless groups like Reynolds number, G-forces, viscosity ratio, turbulent diffusion coefficient (related to the flow reversals in the cyclone) are defined in order to develop various cyclone model structures to predict the accurate values of The conditions of flow in cyclone in general can be expressed in terms of Reynolds number Where Whenever The major driving force for the separation of solids particles in a hydrocyclone is the centrifugal force generated by the rotational flow of slurry. In general, the higher the centrifugal force the less underflow water split (R Where To some extent, the turbulence dispersion of fine particles also causes the entrainment between the coarser particles and flow along with water to underflow. In order to account for these effects on Where θ is the cone angle, A generalized model for industrial hydrocyclones, which includes equations for water split to the underflow ( reduced vortex finder, reduced spigot, reduced inlet, reduced length of the cylindrical section, Normalized turbulent dispersion coefficient (cone angle), The diameter of the cyclone The operating variables consider were the relative slurry viscosity, the hindered settling factor, G-forces, relative particle density, Taking into account all the practical hydrocyclone models developed by other researchers, together with the current state-of-art models and latest test results, the following equations, were investigated: The The water split equation The alpha equation The throughput equation The relationships were investigated using the EXCEL SOLVER (Multiple linear fitting routine) by minimizing the sum of the squares of error between measured values to the predicted model values. The fitting routine estimates the parameter values in the equations tested. A very large number of equation forms were investigated. Each one was assessed in terms of goodness of fit, fitting statistics, improvement over existing parameters, and practical utility. The final model equations, presented below, are those which were found to be the best according to these criteria. Values of the material-geometry dependent system constants for the model equations are needed to be fitted for the given material and cyclone diameters. The following relationships were found to be the best for predicting the cut-size, water split, capacity and the sharpness if separation. The water split, The cut size equation Volume throughput, Q The Sharpness of separation, α A comparison of the water split predictions results for the model in Eq. The high powers on the relative vortex finder, relative spigot, cone angle, cylindrical length, inclination, and feed solids represented in terms of a hindered settling factor and viscosity in the new water split equation suggests that these have a high influence than the G-forces or the deportment of water in the hydrocyclone. A comparison of the predictions results for cut-size in Eq. A comparison of the predictions results from the new volumetric throughput or capacity to those of the Nageswararao model is given in The equation for predicting the sharpness of separation is given in Eq. The slurry viscosity and density are interrelated and their effect on sharpness of separation cannot be easily decoupled Nageswararao did not develop an explicit equation for predicting the sharpness of separation. Therefore the authors have compared their predictions with results what is obtained using The standard error for the new sharpness of separation model predictions is 23.4% whereas the 224 additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model. The data sets which were used to validate the model were not part of the model development data sets. The application-dependent system constants were refitted to each set of data in all cases, but the parameter values in Eqs. These data sets comprise 122 tests conducted in 4, 6 and 10 These data sets comprise 22 tests from  Nearly 80 data sets of the JKTech were used to validate further the cyclone model equations. These data sets were used for the model validation process. These tests were carried out with 381, 25.4, 15, 10  The model developed in this study offers a number of advantages including: Significant improvement in underflow water split ( Influence of hydrocyclone inclination, feed slurry viscosity and particle density on the hydrocyclone performance are included in the model equations An equation for sharpness of the separation is included that allows prediction for changes in particle deportment with improved cyclone operation The effect of solids concentration on hydrocyclone performance was accounted for through the viscosity and particle hindered settling rates terms leading to improved model predictions for changes in feed solids concentration. An explicit term has been included which accounts for differences in feed slurry viscosity for a range of particle size distributions and solids concentrations. This term takes into account the influence of fine particles on viscosity. Improved predictions of the performance of hydrocyclones can be made using this new model because in addition to the influence of key design variables terms that account for most of the fluid and particle flow characteristics have been included. The data used to develop the model in this work has a wide range of feed solids concentration from low (3%) to high (70%) solids by weight.. This new model is also implemented into JKSimMet 6.0 version as a potential model for industrial classification predictions. Although the new model predicts the performance of hydrocyclones reasonably well it has a number of limitations/requirements that should be taken into account when using this model; Model parameters need to be fitted at least to one set of experimental data for a given feed material and design conditions. Although the model can be applied to sub 10 This model is unaccounted the fish-hook phenomena The prediction of sharpness of the separation still requires further work due to some scatter observed in the results. Though this average particle density based model equations have potential for application to minerals with different density components in the feed further work is required to improve predictions for such feed materials. An improved empirical hydrocyclone model was developed from a data base comprising historical data from hydrocyclone tests performed by numerous researchers and additional tests were performed by the authors to capture variables that were not included in the historical data base inputs on particle classification mechanism from CFD were considered to understand and identify the key flow parameters that affect the cyclone performance in the application involving particle classification by size. The new cyclone model structure is based on the dimensionless approach makes it possible to combine geometry dimensions and as well as flow terms in simple equations that can be used to predict performance measured by efficiency curve properties and capacity. The following conclusions can be made from the n new cyclone model developed in this work: An extensive data base covering a wide range of cyclones is collocated from historical experimental data sets and additional experiments. Experiments on 10 and 20 Inputs from CFD studies were considered in understanding the flow pattern of fluid and solid particles inside cyclones. Tangential velocity, turbulent diffusion, slurry viscosity and particle hindered settling correlations were identified from CFD as the key inputs to the particle classification mechanism for the Empirical model. A new cyclone model structure based on a dimensionless approach has been developed. The approach used to develop the model is based on multiple linear fitting routine for model parameters estimation. The model for 224 additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model by comparing the predictions of the model equations with the experimental results. The data sets which were used to validate the model were not part of the model development data sets.
