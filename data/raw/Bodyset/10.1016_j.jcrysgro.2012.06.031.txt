The advantages of heterogeneous nucleation on a concave spherical surface of radius R over a planar surface occur primarily when 2R<10r⁎ (r*: nucleus radius) and diminish rapidly when 2R>10r*. This is similar to nucleation on convex spherical surfaces, where the disadvantages of nucleation over a planar surface occur primarily when 2R<10r* and diminish rapidly when 2R>10r*. The substrate size 10r* thus provides an approximate borderline that distinguishes between curved and planar surfaces for nucleation. The advantages or disadvantages of nucleation over a planar surface are most outstanding when the concave (advantageous) or convex (disadvantageous) surface shows a specific contact angle with the nucleus. The nanoscale nature of the threshold size 10r* presents a clear fundamental support to surface nanopatterning for directed nucleation. A minimum depth is required for a nanoscale crater to be a favourable nucleation site.Recent advances in materials processing have permitted the fabrication of patterned surface nanostructures by a variety of means Planar, convex and concave surfaces are the three most commonly encountered catalysing surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation in nature. The general characteristics of heterogeneous nucleation on planar substrates are described by Volmer's classical flat substrate model Heterogeneous nucleation on concave sites received special attention right from the beginning which led to seminal developments in understanding the effect of the thermal history on heterogeneous nucleation. Volmer The purpose of this study is twofold: to reveal the unknown important features of heterogeneous nucleation on concave surfaces by comparing with heterogeneous nucleation on both convex and flat surfaces using a novel approach developed recently Consider the formation of a spherical-cap embryo of radius The geometric quantities and relationships that are necessary for the subsequent development of Eq. Using Eq. A recent novel analysis of nucleation on convex spherical surfaces satisfied the two necessary conditions It was realized according to the definitions of Substituting Recall the expression of Eqs. It is clear from Eq. This is the first time that the requirements of both Following Fletcher Eq. Eqs. As a point of reference, A distinct feature noted from Small contact angles favour nucleation. This is also clear from The noticeable size effect defined by Apart from controlled surface nanopatterning, directed nucleation or surface activity may be enhanced or retarded through the selection of appropriate substrate materials. Another important size-and-contact-angle effect for nucleation on a concave surface is that each such crater is required to satisfy a minimum depth The volume of the nucleated material that needs to fill the crater, i.e. Substituting Finally, it should be pointed out that as in Ref.  The advantages of heterogeneous nucleation on concave spherical surfaces of radius R over planar surfaces occur primarily when 2 The nanoscale nature of the threshold size 10 The maximum advantage (for concave surfaces) or disadvantage (for convex surfaces) of nucleation on a curved surface over a planar surface occurs when the substrate shows a specific contact angle with the nucleus. This offers an additional option for controlled surface nucleation. A minimum depth is required for a spherical crater to be a favourable nucleation site below which a greater driving force will be needed to permit nucleation with a smaller The complex expressions of The formulation and analysis of the nucleation problem considered are based on the use of Young's equation (first line of The work was supported in part by the
