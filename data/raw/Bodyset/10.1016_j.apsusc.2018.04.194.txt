The adsorption of sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate (SDD) and butyl xanthate (BX) on sphalerite (1 1 0) surface in the absence and presence of water molecules was simulated using density functional theory (DFT). The results indicated that both the SDD and BX can chemically adsorb on the sphalerite surface in the absence of water molecules. However, the presence of water molecules on sphalerite surface significantly increases the adsorption energy of SDD and BX, which is detrimental to SDD and BX attachment on sphalerite surface. Particularly, the presence of water molecules changes the adsorption of BX on sphalerite surface from chemisorption to physicalabsorption, but the adsorption of SDD on sphalerite surface is still very strong like that of chemisorption. The results of DOS comparison analysis, electron density and Mulliken population analysis also confirmed the adsorption of SDD on sphalerite surface is more easy and stable than that of BX adsorption.Flotation is a selective separation process first introduced for the recovery of minerals from ores. One of the most significant accomplishments is the processing of complex polymetallic ores containing the sulphide minerals of Cu, Pb and Zn Normally, cyanide, such as NaCN, is the most effective depressant for the selective depression of sphalerite during the froth flotation process; however, the use of cyanide is strictly restricted due to its potentially disastrous environmental consequence In To date, the information on the adsorption of SDD and xanthate on the sphalerite surfaces in the presence of water molecules is scarce. In order to illuminate the fundamental aspects of the depression of sphalerite by SDD at an atomic level, the adsorption of SDD and butyl xanthate (BX) on sphalerite (1 1 0) surface in the absence and presence of water molecules were fully investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) methods. The computation was performed using Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program. CASTEP is a first-principle pseudopotential method based on density-functional theory (DFT), which uses plane wave (PW) basis sets and ultrasoft pseudopotentials in its computational processes Firstly, a (2 × 2) ZnS (1 1 0) surface super-cell with 6 atomic-layer slabs and 20 Å vacuum layer was constructed and further performed geometry optimization. Then, the optimized molecules (SDD and BX) were respectively positioned onto the ZnS (1 1 0) surface with about 1 Ǻ distance to simulation their interaction without water molecules, as shown in In the case of the ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the presence of water molecules, two water molecules were firstly positioned at the site between Zn and S atoms of the ZnS (1 1 0) surface, and the other computational detail was the same as that of the adsorption of SDD and BX without water molecules, with the initial model shown in The adsorption energy of the molecules (SDD and BX) on ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the absence and presence of water molecules was calculated by Eq. (1): The negative value of the calculated After geometry As shown in From Combining the results of Flotation is performed under a water bearing system, and thus the adsorption of water molecules on mineral surface has an important effect on its hydrophobic property, which in return affects subsequent adsorption of collector As shown in Again from To illuminate the nature that the adsorption of SDD and BX on ZnS (1 1 0) surface, DOS comparison analysis of SDD and BX adsorption in the absence and presence of water molecules was performed, with the results shown in As shown in As shown in To further illustrate the adsorption difference of SDD and BX on ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the presence of water molecules, an electron density analysis of SDD and BX adsorption was performed, with the result shown in It can be clearly seen from The Mulliken bond population analysis of the chemical From It can be seen from the results and discussion above that: Both the SDD and BX can chemically adsorb on the sphalerite surface in the absence of water molecules, and the adsorption of SDD on ZnS (1 1 0) surface occurs more readily than that of BX adsorption. However, the presence of water molecules on sphalerite surface significantly increases the adsorption energy of SDD and BX, and is detrimental to SDD and BX attachment on sphalerite surface. In the presence of water molecules, the distance between the interactional S atom and surface Zn atom after SDD and BX adsorption is significantly increased. Despite of the increase in interactional distance between S1-Zn after SDD adsorption, this distance(2.48 Å) is near to the radius sum of Zn and S atoms (2.43 Å), which indicated that the adsorption of SDD on ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the presence of water molecules is still very strong like that of chemisorption. However, the distance between S1 and surface Zn after BX adsorption was significantly increased to 3.66 Å, which is far beyond the radius sum of Zn and S atoms (2.43 Å). It was indicated that the adsorption of BX on ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the presence of water molecules is a physical DOS analysis shows that the adsorption of SDD and BX on the ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the absence and presence of water molecules mainly involves the interaction of S3p3s orbitals of SDD and BX with the Zn 3d 4s orbital of ZnS. For the SDD adsorption, the presence of water molecules leads to the overlapped DOS peaks of S 3s 3p with Zn 3d orbitals and S 3p with Zn 4s orbitals shift toward to the direction of Fermi level (E The electron density analysis shows that there are much electron cloud overlap for the SDD adsorption on ZnS (1 1 0) surface in the presence of water molecules than that for BX adsorption, suggesting a stronger adsorption stability of SDD than BX.
