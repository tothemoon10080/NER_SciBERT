ZnO thin films were grown on GaAs(001) substrate to study the feasibility of making As-doped textured ZnO films for possible optical device application using radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering. It was demonstrated that highly c-axis oriented ZnO crystal with uniformly doped As could be grown using this deposition technique. Crystallinity was shown to improve with higher processing temperature. Photoluminescence spectroscopy, supplemented by cathodo-luminescence imaging, showed that the ZnO films have good optical quality with strong near band emission peak at 3.3eV and spatially homogeneous luminescence indicating possibility of producing As-doped ZnO films with good crystallinity and optical properties using the technique used herein.ZnO is regarded as a potential candidate material for optical devices such as blue, violet and ultra violet (UV) light emitting diodes (LED) and laser diodes (LD) due to its wide band gap energy of 3.3 ZnO films have been grown on various substrates such as Si, SiO In this paper, rf magnetron sputtering has been adopted to explore the feasibility of growing ZnO films on GaAs(0 ZnO films were deposited on GaAs(0 The film thickness measured by stylus profilometer was in the range of 0.7â€“1 Since the processing temperature seemed to control the grain size and surface morphology of the deposited film through grain growth, the main concern now is the structure and quality of ZnO crystal deposited on the GaAs(0 Though the ZnO films showed (0 When As is doped into the ZnO film, As is supposed to substitute O in ZnO to form a p-type semiconductor. However, at lower temperatures it is possible that not enough activation energy is available for the substitution. In this case, As may exist as interstitial impurities causing tensile strain in inter-atomic bonding and thereby resulting in higher To verify the presence of As in ZnO, SIMS analysis was carried out firstly and the As concentration measured from a sample prepared at 623 So far, it was shown that ZnO films could be grown with good As the growth temperature increased, however, the situation developed differently as shown in To clarify this point, EDX analysis were carried out and it was found that the As content increased from 0.91 Optical properties explained above were supplemented by room temperature CL image (see Feasibility of growing p-type ZnO thin films on GaAs(0 This work was supported by Bluetron Co.
