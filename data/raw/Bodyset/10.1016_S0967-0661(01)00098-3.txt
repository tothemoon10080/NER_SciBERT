The mineral and metal processing industries continue to provide opportunities for the beneficial application of advanced control and examples of successful implementations. This issue contains six review papers selected from the IFAC Workshop on Future Trends in Automation in Mineral and Metal Processing in 2000. In general, these papers reflect how the practice of control engineering requires a lot of attention to be paid to the description, characterization and modeling of processes. The availability of adequate measuring instruments also has a major bearing in all cases too. The success of different types of control strategies probably depends less on the process itself than on the knowledge and expertise of those doing the implementations. The papers by Schlang et al. and Takahashi address the modeling and automation of rolling mills. Both advocate the combined use of analytical and neural-net models. Several methods for control have been considered and implemented. Hodouin et al. review control in mineral processing and classify applications of model-based and AI methods as mature, active or emerging. Milling and flotation seem to be the processes in which both methods are the most active and mature. Bergh et al. review the situation in copper hydrometallurgical control. There are evidently not many applications in this area—to some extent because of a lack of appropriate measuring devices and their poor reliability. Craig et al. describe how operational issues, production planning and scheduling, and quality control are important in the application of automation. The control of continuous casting is also hindered by a lack of key sensors. The paper by Jämsä-Jounela looks at the present and future of automation in mineral and metal processing. Amongst her results is evidence of an interesting peak of activity in artificial intelligence during 1991, when AI accounted for around 70% of publications.
