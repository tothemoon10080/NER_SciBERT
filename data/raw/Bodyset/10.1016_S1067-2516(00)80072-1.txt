Fractures of the neck and body of the talus present as one of the most challenging and rare injuries. These fractures are often associated with other ankle, foot, and skeletal injuries, which complicate their treatment. The clinical course of 50 patients with a mean age of 29 years with a severe talus fracture between 1992 and 1997 is presented. According to the Hawkins classification there were 16 (32%) of type I, 14 (28%) of type II, 9 (18%) of type III, and 11 (22%) of type IV. Forty-three patients (86%) underwent operative treatment: 27 (63%) by open reduction and internal fixation with screws, seven (16%) by external fixation, five (12%) with percutaneous screws, and four (9%) by closed reduction with K-wire fixation. Mild osteoarthritis of the talocrural joint was seen in 14 patients (28%) and severe osteoarthritis in 10 patients (20%), five of whom required subsequent arthrodesis of the ankle joint. Arthrodesis of the subtalar joint was observed in 4 cases. Avascular necrosis with collapse of the talar body was seen in four patients (8%). The function of the ankle joint was evaluated according to the Weber score. Patients with talus fractures of Hawkins' type I and II had considerably better outcomes (with 95% being excellent or good) than individuals suffering dislocated fractures with involvement of the articulating surface with 70% good results in Hawkins' type III and 10% good results in Hawkins' type IV fractures. For the evaluation of the vitality of the talus body in cases with titanium implants, the authors used magnetic resonance imaging and intraosseous phlebography in cases with stainless steel implants. The displaced talus fractures must be treated by closed and, if necessary, open reduction with internal fixation. The initial postoperative management should consist of ambulation without weightbearing until radiographic appearance of trabecular bone in the fracture zone, indicating revascularization, can be manifested.
