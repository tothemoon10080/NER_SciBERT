The experiment results were further validated through SEM and EDX results.Cyanide leaching is considered as a common and prevalent method to recover gold, a precious metal, in the form of For gold adsorption from solution, carbon in pulp (CIP) and carbon in leach (CIL) processes have become strongly established in the gold mining industry in the 1980s. The percentage of annual global gold production by activated carbon-based processes increased from zero in the 1970s to almost 70% by the turn of the century Unlike activated carbon, in current years, graphene and graphene oxide were used as adsorbents to remove some Modeling of adsorption on porous material plays a huge role in providing a better understanding of adsorption phenomena, isotherms, and isosteric heats, and predicting the thermodynamics of adsorption systems In this study, Samples of adsorption were analyzed by using electron microscopy instruments including SEM-EDX (model: ProX, nitrogen adsorption quality using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (model: JW-BK132F), ICP-OES (model: VISTA-PRO) and FT IR (Nicolet IR100). Furthermore, centrifuge instrument (model: DOMEL Centric 350) and heater stirrer (model: Labtech) were used. Chemicals used in this study were all produced and prepared by Merck Co. Gold and silver extracted by smelting and amalgamation, grinded up to an optimum size fraction and then dissolved in nitric acid 65%. Silver was dissolved in nitric acid solution in the form of nitrate while gold was precipitated as dark brownish particulates and then filtered. The obtained gold (50 mg) was taken in Erlenmeyer flask and then sodium cyanide as alkaline agent at pH of 9.5–11 was added. After agitation for 24 h, almost all of gold precipitates were dissolved into solution in the form of gold cyanide complex Graphene oxide was synthesized via modified Hummers & Offeman methods. Then, activated graphene was produced from graphene oxide with the aid of controlling temperature at the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH). After preparing activated graphene, it was completely agitated and dissolved within 5 ml isopropyl alcohol. Activated carbon was initially washed for 3-times within isopropyl alcohol and then 4 mg/ml of dissolved solution was prepared and dispersed for 30 min. After dispersing both solutions (i.e. activated carbon and activated graphene) and agitating for 30 min, mixing was continued till active carbon was completely loaded on activated graphene surface. Then, the obtained product was separated by using centrifuge and dissolved again in isopropyl alcohol. In this process, 0.5 g of functionalizing agent was dissolved and mixed for 24 h. Consequently, the obtained composite was separated by the means of centrifuge and then used for all the experiments.  Adsorption capacity was calculated using the following formula: where q (mg/g) is adsorbent capacity, C Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption on active sites of adsorbent surface. This model is described as below: where Freundlich isotherm is derived for describing heterogeneous adsorption with diverse adsorption sites or various natures of adsorbed ions. Equation below describes the nature of Freundlich isotherm; where k and n are Freundlich constants representing adsorbent capacity and intensity, respectively. Temkin isotherm assumes that the adsorption heat of all molecules decreases linearly with the increase in coverage of the adsorbent surface, and adsorption is characterized by a uniform distribution of binding energies, up to a maximum binding energy. This model can be described by equation below as: where Pseudo-first order kinetic model is described as: where Pseudo-second order kinetic model describes the adsorption process as: where Thermodynamic parameters including Gibbs free energy where R (8.314 J/mol.K) is ideal gas constant, T (K) is absolute temperature, For activated carbon, the following surface characterization was found: BET surface area: 980 m In order to assess the capability of new composite on    Functionalized graphene/carbon activated composite with TB ligand (tetra butyl ammonium) was prepared for adsorption studies.  Adsorbent dosages were changed from 2.5 mg to 100 mg for functionalized composite and from 30 mg to 200 mg for activated carbon. During the tests, pH,  Batch adsorption tests were carried out on Furthermore, Adsorption kinetic models were determined for activated carbon and functionalized graphene/activated carbon composite. Activated carbon adsorption kinetic models were examined under following conditions: 0.1 g of activated carbon, Regarding the results of The effect of temperature on Results of In this paper, two types of adsorbents including activated carbon and functionalized graphene/carbon activated composite were synthesized and used for None.
