In the recent years, several silver leaching technologies have been investigated in order to find out an alternative and sustainable leaching process; one of these alternatives is the thiosulfate. The main research line is focused in the use of thiosulfate with copper as a catalyst and ammonia as a cupric ion stabilizer; however, the ammonia is also another toxic reagent. For that reason, an alternative-new leaching system using thiosulfate–nitrite and copper ions was investigated in this work. This new leaching system is able to dissolve silver without the use of cyanide or ammonia due to the cupric–ammonia complexes in-situ production, which is possible through the reaction of the nitrite and the cupric ions at neutral pH and NO2:Cu molar ratio of 30:1, according to silver leaching experiments and thermodynamic predictions.
                  On the other hand, the effect of sulfite concentration was studied in the leaching solution revealing that the reductive ability of the sulfite ions has a negative effect on the silver leaching kinetics and recovery. It was also found that an increase in the pH of the leaching solution from 7 to 9.6 promotes the precipitation of copper hydroxide species which inhibits the silver leaching kinetics.
                  Finally, copper–ammonia complex formation was also confirmed in the silver leaching by the UV–Visible spectroscopy technique. The solid leaching residues obtained at neutral pH were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy showing the formation of a copper hydroxysulfate species called antlerite; this result was also confirmed by species distribution diagrams.Cyanidation is the process traditionally employed worldwide for the extraction of silver and gold. This method is simple, economic and efficient; for that reason, it has been used for more than 100 The thiosulfate system has been studied extensively in the last years due to the fact that it is a very attractive and cheap reagent for the silver and gold leaching, furthermore, this reagent has the ability to produce strong complexes with these metals and easily leach the ores when is catalyzed with cupric ions ( On the other hand, the proper maintenance of the pH and potential conditions and the control of the thiosulfate, ammonia and copper concentrations in the leaching solution can achieve high extractions of gold and silver with low consumption of reagents ( As mentioned above, the catalytic effect of the cupric ions in the leaching solution of thiosulfate–copper–ammonia favors the silver and gold leaching kinetics from 18 to 20 times; this increase is mainly attributed to the formation of a copper–ammonia complex, the so-called cupric tetraamine Cu(NH On the other hand, an excessive increase of the cupric ion concentration in the leaching solutions has the disadvantage of promoting the thiosulfate degradation to polythionates that compromises the gold recovery and the process profitability ( In addition, ammonia has other important implications in the precious metal leaching kinetics: the ammonia absence causes a decrease in the leaching kinetics due to the accumulation of sulfur layers on the precious metal particle as a result of the thiosulfate degradation. This suggests that the ammonia prevents the gold passivation due to its preferential adsorption on the gold surface, generating a gold–ammonia complex ( One way to partially reduce the thiosulfate degradation is adding a small amount of sulfite ion to the leaching solution to react with the polythionates as shown in the next reaction ( From a mechanistic point of view, the presence of the sulfite or bisulfite ions in alkaline solutions can cause an equilibrium reaction between the hydrogen sulfide ions and thiosulfate contained in the leaching solution, according to the next equation ( This equilibrium is important because without the presence of the sulfite ion, the reaction would be favored to the left, producing hydrogen sulfide (HS For this reason, reaction However, an excess of sulfite can decrease significantly the oxidation ability of the leaching solution and have a negative effect in the silver leaching kinetics ( In the last decades, the leaching process with nitrogen species catalyzed (NSC) with pressure has been studied for the recovery of silver, copper, zinc and iron from refractory sulfide ores, this method is an alternative to the cyanidation process ( This process uses a leaching aqueous solution that contains: sulfuric acid and sodium nitrite under oxygen pressure ( The nitrous acid reacts in the acid medium to form NO The NO The main objective of this research was to evaluate the thiosulfate–nitrite–sulfite–copper alternative leaching system for silver dissolution in order to find the optimal conditions to accelerate the silver dissolution kinetics and to improve the understanding of the phenomena that controls the silver leaching process. This section describes all the materials, equipment, reagents, leaching solution composition and the experimental methodologies used in this research work. Leaching solutions were prepared with analytical grade reagents and deionized water. The reagents were: metallic silver (99.999%, 1–3 The experimental work was divided in four main sections: In order to elucidate the predominant species in the thiosulfate–nitrite–copper–silver system, nitrite system and nitrite–copper system, Pourbaix and species distribution diagrams were calculated at room temperature using the Medusa© Software and considering the equilibrium data contained in the Hydra database of the same software ( These diagrams were used to determine all the species that can be formed in the leaching solutions at different pH and potential conditions. All silver leaching experiments were performed in an agitated batch reactor (250 The solid residues formed were microstructurally characterized to elucidate their morphology and local chemical composition by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Phillips, XL30ESEM) and by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (EDAX, Genesis). In order to determine the predominating solid products, some solid residues were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Phillips, X'PERT PW3040). Cupric tetraamine formation was studied by UV/Vis spectrophotometry using different leaching solutions containing: a) 0.05 A quartz cell with 3 In this section, silver leaching tests complemented with thermodynamic diagrams, solid residue characterizations and liquid UV/Vis spectroscopy are presented and discussed in an attempt to understand the controlling phenomena and find the best conditions to accelerate the silver leaching kinetics with the thiosulfate–nitrite–sulfite–copper alternative system.   Predominant production of ammonia at pH above 9 Predominant production of ammonium ion at pH below 9 Both cathodic reactions can take place in the presence of an anodic reaction; this anodic reaction in the thiosulfate–nitrite–sulfite alternative leaching system corresponds to the metallic silver oxidation to the complexes [Ag(S On the other hand, the nitrite reduction shown in Eqs. The thiosulfate leaching test shown in  Therefore, in order to understand the nature of the thiosulfate–nitrite–sulfite–copper system, the effect of each reactant and their concentration was evaluated at different pH in the silver leaching.  The redox potential registered in the leaching experiment carried out at natural pH was 0.302 Nevertheless, it is important to mention that there is perhaps a slight benefit to leaching at pH Another important fact to notice is that the mixture thiosulfate–copper by itself is capable to leach silver; however the silver recovery was lower than that of the leaching system with thiosulfate–nitrite–sulfite–copper ( Experiments to study the sulfite–copper system were carried out. This system can leach silver but in small amount (0.3% approximately), the pH condition measured in the experiment being slightly acid (5.46); moreover, when the pH of the solution is increased up to 9.9, the solution does not have any silver recovery and the potential increases with the time, from 0.283 Silver leaching experiments were carried out employing the nitrite–copper system. The same pH effect observed in the other studied systems occurs in this system, i.e., it was only possible to detect a silver recovery (0.8% approximately) in the experiment performed with the natural pH of 5.5. As in the case with sulfite, the solution with nitrite becomes acid; nevertheless, when the pH was increased up to 9.9 the silver recovery decreased to 0%. The change in the pH condition from 5.5 to 9.9 promotes the precipitation of cupric ions as the copper hydroxide species mentioned before ( In order to confirm the theory that cupric tetraamine could be produced from nitrite and copper, an extensive thermodynamic study was performed for different nitrite and copper concentrations. A nitrite:copper molar ratio of 30:1 (1.5 With the results obtained up to now for the silver leaching with the nitrite–copper system at pH of 5.5, it is possible to say that silver can be leached by two pathways: a) predominant ammonium ions and a low ammonia concentration are generated from the reduction of nitrite ions, according to Eqs. With this information, different leaching experiments (shown in the next section) were performed varying the reactant concentrations.  According to the thermodynamic diagram shown in A species distribution diagram ( In order to support the last statement, the solid residue formed at 350 These copper sulfide and copper hydroxide layers may act as barriers for the direct contact between the fluid reactants and the unreacted silver sites. Furthermore, according to  Up to now, the sulfite concentration was not changed. In order to identify the copper–ammonia complexes and the copper solid residues formed in the silver leaching experiment without sulfite (curve C, In order to verify the formation of copper hydroxysulfate species in the leaching system without sulfite (curve C, Finally, in order to verify the cupric–ammonia complex formation in the leaching solution of Three different copper solutions were analyzed: A) 0.05 In this work, an analysis of the effect of the thiosulfate, nitrite, copper and sulfite on the silver leaching kinetics was carried out and complemented with thermodynamic diagrams, SEM–EDS and X-ray diffraction characterizations of the solid residues and UV/Vis characterization of the copper–ammonia complexes present in the leaching solutions. The results showed that thiosulfate ions act as the complexing agent for the silver ions, the sulfite ions decrease the oxidative ability of the leaching solution and the nitrite ions act as the oxidizing agent; however, the addition of copper ions in the leaching system is important to form cupric–ammonia complexes which catalyzes the silver dissolution; its formation in situ is possible without any addition of ammonia, this system becoming thus sustainable, attractive and innovative. On the other hand, the sulfite presence in the leaching system is detrimental for the silver leaching kinetics due to its reducing effect, which decreases the oxidative ability of the leaching system reaching a silver extraction of 60% with 0.2 Leaching experiments carried out at pH For that reason the best leaching system studied consists of 0.1 Gabriela Alvarado Macías is grateful to CONACyT (México) for the postgraduate scholarship received.
