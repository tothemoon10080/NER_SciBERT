The leaching kinetics of the cobalt present in zinc plant purification residues (cobalt filtercakes) was investigated in the presence of the aromatic reducing agent — phenol — without any pretreatments. As such, the effects of particle size (−75+53 to −180+150μm), reaction temperature (25 to 85°C), phenol dosage (2 to15%) and sulfuric acid concentration (0.5 to 2.0M) on the dissolution rate of cobalt and manganese were investigated. The experimental data conformed well to the shrinking core model, and the dissolution rate of cobalt was found to be controlled by diffusion through the product layer. Due to the low percentage of cobalt (<1%) in the filtercake, SEM and XRD studies did not show any cobalt-containing phases. It was demonstrated that sulfuric acid with phenol addition can effectively dissolve cobalt and manganese present in the filtercake. The activation energy of the reaction was calculated as 22.92kJ/mol. The order of the reaction with respect to H2SO4 concentration, particle size, and phenol dosage was found to be 0.61, −1.88 and 0.70, respectively. The optimum conditions for the leaching of cobalt and manganese were found to be as 2.0M H2SO4, 85°C, −75+53μm, and 10% phenol at the stirring speed of 600rpm, which correspond to more than 97% cobalt and ~100% manganese recoveries. The rate of cobalt leaching based on shrinking core model can be expressed by a semi-empirical equation as:

                                 .Cobalt is one of the least abundant industrial metals as compared to copper and nickel, but is being widely used in many applications such as turbine blades for aircraft engines, hard facing alloys, magnets and superalloys because of some unique properties such as ferromagnetism, varying crystal structure with temperature, and wear and corrosion resistance properties ( With ever-increasing demand for cobalt, primary resources are exhausting and hence the intermediate and secondary resources have come to the forefront. Different types of cobalt resources are listed in Cobalt is present in zinc concentrates in low concentrations (0.001–0.005 Few papers have been published on the recovery of cobalt from zinc plant purification residues.  Reductive leaching of cobalt from sea nodules has been also considered by a number of investigators (   The selection of appropriate reducing agent is critical for the acid leaching. Inorganic reagents such as coal lignite (  It is realized that the sea nodules are one of the major sources of cobalt, and hence significant amount of research has been carried out for the extraction of cobalt from sea nodules. The average percentage of cobalt in the nodules is less than 1%, which is approximately of the same order as in cobalt filtercakes. The consumption of reducing agent for the treatment of filtercake was dealt with respect to sea nodules based on similar cobalt percentage present in the source. The abovementioned discussions hold true for manganese as well, since manganese is also reductively leached from sea nodules and also cobalt filtercake. In order to obtain a high leaching recovery of manganese in acidic solution, reducing agents are required. Different reductants such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO Majority of investigators have studied the reductive leaching of manganese using organic reductants, including glucose and sucrose ( The electrolytic production of zinc in Iran has been discussed elsewhere ( It should be noted that the permanganate purification is not a common practice in zinc operations, and therefore this process is an alternative to activated zinc dust cementation or alpha nitroso beta naphtol purification strategies. Generally when cobalt is precipitated using permanganate, it does not start precipitating significantly until all the manganese has precipitated. The consensus seems to be as the cobalt is oxidized it adsorbs onto the freshly precipitated MnO Cobalt purification filtercake was used as the starting material in the present work. Cobalt and manganese were directly leached from the filtercake without any pretreatments. Aromatic reducing agent phenol was used for reductive dissolution of cobalt and manganese. The dissolution kinetics was studied as a function of the factors affecting the leaching process. The average consumption of reducing agent has been reported to be 0.2 The chemical assay of the cobalt filtercake as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer AA-300 model) was as follows (wt.%): 0.98 Co, 6.74 Mn, 32.48 Zn, 12.34 Ca, 0.038 Ni, 0.047 Cd, 0.075 Cu, 0.16 Fe and 0.39 Pb. Mineralogical analysis performed using X-ray diffractometry indicated that gunningite (Zn,Mn The effects of temperature, sulfuric acid concentration, particle size, and phenol dosage on the dissolution rate of cobalt and manganese were studied. For each experimental condition, the experiment was repeated twice, and the arithmetic average of the results was used in the plotting of extraction curves. The deviation was within ± The values of the employed parameters for leaching experiments are given in The leaching experiments were performed in a 2 In order to determine the kinetic parameters and rate-controlling step for the leaching of cobalt, the experimental data were analyzed on the basis of the shrinking core model ( If the reaction is followed by the surface reaction, Eq. The reaction between manganese dioxide in the filtercake and sulfuric acid in the presence of phenol has been proved to be as follows ( Chemical reactions involved in phenol/Co Upon sulfuric acid leaching of the filtercake in the presence of phenol as reducing reagent, cobalt and manganese transform to cobalt (II) and manganese (II) sulfates, respectively. The effect of stirring speed on the rate of cobalt and manganese dissolution in the range of 200–1000 The temperature effect was examined in the range of 25–85  The effect of acid concentration in the range of 0.50–2.0  Four different particle sizes (−   From the  No filtration problem was observed in any of the experiments. It was shown that activation energy and the order of reaction values with respect to H The reductive dissolution of cobalt and manganese from zinc plant purification residues in sulfuric acid solutions and the factors affecting the kinetics were investigated. It was found that the leaching kinetics of cobalt in the presence of phenol was controlled by shrinking core model for diffusion through product layer. The activation energy was calculated as 22.92 Manganese dissolved faster and ~ The optimum leaching conditions were determined as 2.0
