An analysis is given of experimental methods and pitfalls for the determination of the economic benefits of milling control strategies. Four particularly important aspects that influence results are external effects, reference conditions, measurements and sampling, and the influence of people. The benefits to be obtained are those associated with dynamics and those associated with operation at optimum operating points.
