This study aims to the industrial scale development of Bauxite Residue leaching for Scandium recovery, by optimizing a hydrometallurgy method and taking account appropriate design concepts for process intensification. Approaching the design issue either by adapting arithmetic methods, or using related software, showed inconsistent convergence, which is caused by the process particularities and non-conventional characteristics (i.e., feed flow-rates dependent on reflux ratio, hybrid of continuous and intermittent processes, etc.). Seeking also for process economic viability, typical cost-based objective functions showed to deviate from optima with a real economic sense. To deal with both challenges, necessary modeling simplification for advanced Leaching with Mineral Acids (LMA) was made, coupled with commercial economics and profit-based objective functions. Under the design aspect, additional constraints were introduced for the Pregnant Leach Solution (PLS) that were arisen from the subsequent Resin ion eXchange (RX) and the avoiding of colloidal silica gel formation. The optimized leaching resulted to the highest possible: solids-to-liquid ratio; molarity for RX-complying PLS; and temperature for acceptable [Si] (e.g., SL = 33.3 %, CFA

Also, the developed simulation model can have expanded application for different LMA cases, and the introduced economic evaluation method is suitable for the production of various internationally traded commodities. Tanks and Equipment Nomenclature is visually presented in the Streams Nomenclature Physical and Chemical Properties Economic Magnitudes The recovery of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) [ The broad context of CRMs has been recently investigated by the authors [ However, concerning process economics, an interesting result arises when comparing the economic potential ( This comparison can function as a rule of thumb for the economic feasibility of any recovery, while marginal cases request more scientific research in either the cost reduction, or efficiency enhancement, or both as the optimization (opt.) of their quotient. For simplification reasons, the most significant cost for the production of a low grade material is usually this of the primary processing stages, coming from the large quantities of the entire resource and not the much less quantities of the ingredient CRM to be recovered. Another assumption is that the production of any higher grade of the material will add approximately equal amounts to both sides of the inequality; however, the scientific research for cost effective materials upgrading, or market distortions, can overset this approximation and shift the According to this rule, the assessment of Greek BR ( This study attempts to cope with the industrial process opt. challenge, as expressed with the ( The composition and physical properties of the Greek BR have already been presented in previous works [ The process streams are defined as heterogeneous mixtures of liquid and solids. Each stream contains: water (H The Process Flow Diagram is illustrated in The raw alkaline BR (BRi in the The leaching pulp is bottom-pumped to the Solids Separations subunit. In case of leaching with mild acidic conditions the partial Neutralization / Precipitation process does not participate ( Similarly to the LML, the Separations Material Losses (SML) stream contains ambient vapors of the acidic solutions, and CO The leaching method [ Two different modes of unit operation ( The laboratory developed method offers two chemically optimized sets of values for the following parameters:  These balances are described by the eqs.(B.1)-(B.3) of The concentration (as Molarity, at Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP)) of the remaining free sulfuric acid in the leachate, or PLS, after the BR-FA neutralization reaction, has been experimentally investigated. Preliminary experimental results for ambient leaching, with residence time beyond the substantial kinetic effects, and without partial neutralization/precipitation for the leachate (i.e., 6(L) The mixing balances of eqs.(B.1)-(B.3) are combined with the mass balances of eqs.(B.4)-(B.16) of The elemental balances either for the main, or trace elements, as Sc, are based on the experimentally known efficiencies of leaching and optional precipitation ( The enthalpy balances exploit BR analysis and thermo-chemical data [ Preliminary opt. trials using typical cost-based objective functions converged to optimal process conditions without a real economic sense, since the cost (total and unit) was minimized either at low Sc production rates for a given BR capacity, or at a much higher BR capacity with unacceptably low leaching yield for a given Sc production rate. This uncommon situation is explained by the following particularities: the raw material (BR) is a no-cost extractive waste (or, by-product); the operating cost is minimized when the extraction is limited to the low fraction of the “easily” dissolved Sc, from the goethite content of Greek BR [ An intermediate investigation by using advanced investment indices (NPV and IRR) as objective functions showed that they do not focus directly on the involved technical conditions. The opt. for the low level technical variables of the production showed ambiguous ability for convergence. The problem has been resolved by applying commercial economics while also including technical variables in profit per BR unit objective functions. According to the original microeconomic analysis of the Appendix C [ For the implementation of the opt.’s, a mathematical generator of elemental concentrations in the leachate ( The detailed description of the concentrations generator is shown in Also, according to The standard analysis [ The analytical pre-processing of eqs.(B.1)-(B.12) subsystem (Appendix B) and the formulating of correlations for the physicochemical properties (Section S3 of the SM) facilitated effectively the system solution. Applying appropriate software for the entire non-linear system becomes substantially more successful when suitable initial values are offered by eqs.(B.20)-(B.21) and the boundary of in Eq.(B25) is taken into account. A more effective algorithm involves the following steps: (i) Section S3 correlations provide initial values for the free acid concentrations to eqs.(B.1)-(B.14), (ii) linear solving of eqs.(B.1)-(B.13), or (B.1)-(B.12) for The parametric variation of the reduced per BR unit consumption of fed Acid ( In addition to the mass balance results, the enthalpy balance processing (Section S4 of the SM) gives the energy demand for the leaching reactor (L) and the tanks assembly (SN) of the partial neutralization/ precipitation. In case of the “with precipitation” operation mode, the ambient operation of both reacting systems requires cooling of (L), and heating or cooling of (SN). If the alkaline additive is limestone, the neutralization is endothermic and requires heating of (SN) offered by heat integration with the exothermic process of (L), ( Furthermore, the objective functions of §3.4 (analogues of economic terms) are graphically presented in  The opt.’s of the three objective functions have emerged an approximately common set of optimized conditions, with both technical and economic feasibility, shown in Under this concept, this work resulted the same trends for the It is also worth noting that this is a global optimum for both the profit percentage analogue ( System process analysis facilitates the transfer of the well-known leaching technology to an innovative industrial design. It reveals limitations and implications of the introduced concept and allows the process simulation for the entire range of performing conditions. The proposed non-conventional PLS recycling can approach the accurate laboratory leaching conditions in industrial scale, while favors significant savings in concentrated acid and water consumption. It also achieves a substantial process intensification by multiplying Sc concentration in the leachate/PLS, when allowed by the limitations of the subsequent RX stage. Process analysis revealed a parametrically varied upper limit for the reflux ratio, under steady-state conditions, since the constant Solids to Liquid feed ratio ( Furthermore, the opt. task using the typical process-economics objective functions for the total, or unit, cost led to optima showing very low BR conversion, since both serve the minimization of the concentrated acid consumption, which is the overwhelmingly main cost, in a process where the raw material (BR) is a waste with no or negligible cost. Additionally, an intermediate investigation of using the advanced investment indices (NPV and IRR) as alternative objective functions showed that they do not focus directly on the involved technical conditions of the production and their arithmetic opt. for the low level technical variables is of ambiguous ability for convergence to “high” local optima, or even worse to the global optimum [ Instead of applying modern economics for investment assessment, this work adopts the classic microeconomics theory for profit maximization with an additional concept for the optima approaching. Under this concept, suitable proportionality terms of the pertinent economic magnitudes have been expressed as objective functions of exclusively technical variables of operation. The constrained opt. of these terms has led to feasible values of the technical conditions that maximize the annual accounting profit, viz. the most feasible commercial criterion, with the plant capacity, the price of consumables and the final product price participating in an approximately separate amplification factor. On the other hand, this model presumes: a Keynesian concept of an orders-based production; an abundantly available raw material, as BR; and an inexpensive and quick installation plant. These presumptions have functioned for this economic model as a significant relief from the questioning of cash flow uncertainties that could be similar to those being usually met in NPV assessment [ The findings of this work will be used and tuned by the forthcoming operation of a Sc-oriented BR leaching plant with an advanced RX unit for Sc isolation (II-VI Inc.), installed in the premises of MYTILINEOS S.A. (former ‘Aluminum of Greece’) under the context of European project SCALE [ The well-known hydrometallurgy process for common metals recovery has been transformed to an innovative industrial design for optimized recovery of trace elements as Sc. The system process analysis offered significant facilitation to investigate scaling-up from laboratory experiments under accurate conditions to an intensified industrial state. The concept of a non-conventional PLS recycling transfers the laboratory specifications to industrial scale; allows significant raw materials savings; and substantially intensifies the process when allowed by the limitations of the subsequent RX process. The selected process opt. method has arisen from the classic microeconomics theory for profit maximization with combined exploitation of an equivalent opt. concept. The application of this theory with reasonable assumptions results to simple optimized magnitudes that separate the performance of the technical variables from the plant capacity, the price of consumables, and the final product price. The economically optimized, technically feasible and RX (SIR) compatible leaching conditions have the following trends: the highest treatable solids to liquid ( The research leading to these results has been performed within the SCALE project and received funding from the  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The optimized mild conditions for the Sc-oriented ambient leaching of the Greek BR are located in the vicinity of the experimental data that have already presented in the Fig. 8 and §3.9 of [ By assuming sufficient level of confidence for the linear interpolation between the 1 M and 2 M values and by having ascertained the linearity between the Confronting the problem of the best ( The arithmetic scanning of the Regarding the N interval [1 cycle, 3 cycles], the kinetic leaching model of the generalized Eq.(5) in [ The effects of leaching Temperature and Pressure have been presented in [ Another option for the operation of the leaching unit is the The The The analytical mathematics processing of the overall mass balances Instead of using algorithmic procedures with matrices or determinants, the parametric linear subsystem of eqs.(B.1)-(B.12) is analytically processed with convenient substitutions allowing the easily emerging of physical meanings and of the related limitations. Under this scope, a minimum simplification level has been added, as far as the system to be analytically manageable. Therefore, it is assumed: Concentrated Acid and Water Consumption From eqs.

Note C.6: The orders-based annual production (u) is proven to be much more significant than the annual cost (Ct) for the best total profit (Pr), since it participates with a power greater than 1 in the approximant ratio to be minimized (Ct/u Note C.7: For products that are suitable for long-term stocking, there is the possibility for an over-enhanced annual production. If the capacity (e.g., raw material throughput, or net product output) is given, then the optimization task concerns mostly the processing conditions and it is economically expressed as enhancement of the annual production (u) at the expense of the total annual cost (Ct), or it could be mathematically expressed as minimization of Note C.8: Proof of the increasing of optimum annual production with increasing of the positive real exponent ξ in the function For the simplistic case where Ct and u are both dependent real functions on one real technical variable F (either a single variable, or multiple variables in the form of a dimensionless technical number), and there is an optimum (minimum) for the continuous and smooth objective function  The annual production u is a physical magnitude, so u Since: Therefore, by assuming that there is a minimum of Application of the commercial economics to the BR leaching process economics and their transformation to technical terms Previous BR leaching techno-economic studies [NTUA, II-VI Incorporated, Utilization of Red Mud as Alternative Resource of Rare Earths (REEs), Joint Project 2014–2016, Internal Reports of Phase I] has shown that mineral acid solvent, which is Therefore, the unit cost for the BR leaching process, with mineral acids, for Sc recovery is described as:  = (mols of acid per L of acid feed) x (L of acid feed per kg of dry BR feed) x (kg dry BR per time-unit)= = C   which is Therefore, the single acid passage case is translated to techno-economic terms as: Consequently, the minimization of the unit-cost in technical terms is equivalent to    Note C.9: The bigger plant capacity clearly increases the best total profit, with the Sc content of the resource and the leaching efficiency to be much more significant for it, but the capacity does not even appear to the percentage profit case for capacities being big enough. For capacities exceeding certain order of magnitude, the non-solvent annual cost is a low proportion of the total annual cost and therefore the total cost can be reasonably approximated to the consuming solvent (acid) cost.  Sc concentration in the PLS ( and for Consequently, there is here, equivalently to the efficiency terms, a minimization of the The prerequisite at both cases is: Conclusively, the use of Sc concentration in the PLS, instead of leaching efficiency, simplifies the optimization.  The It is: Therefore, where:  Note C.10: The relative specific recovery represents the mg of recovered Sc per liter of consumed acid, for a given fed acid molarity [  In case of BR recycling, with  the leaching efficiency for Sc ( In case of PLS recycling, with  and For the with precipitation operation mode the general Eq.(C12) is also valid, if the cost of the neutralization additive (e.g., limestone) is considered to be much less than the cost of acid. If it is not, then the cost of the alkaline additive can be transformed to equivalent cost of acid and Conclusively, although the BR recycling significantly enhances the Sc concentration in PLS, it uses multiple quantities of fresh acid that reduce disproportionally the Supplementary material related to this article can be found, in the online version, at doi: The following is Supplementary data to this article:
