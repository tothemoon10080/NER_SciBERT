Epitaxial GaN films were grown on sputtered ZnO buffer layers of thickness 25–200nm over c-plane sapphire by reactive sputtering of GaAs in nitrogen at 700°C. The epitaxial quality and microstructure have been studied by high resolution X-ray diffraction in phi (ϕ) and omega (ω) scan geometries. The surface morphology of epilayers was studied by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and their crystalline quality was assessed by Raman spectroscopy. These studies have shown that ZnO buffer layers of 50–100nm facilitate growth of GaN epilayers of high crystalline quality, compared to those grown on thinner and thicker ZnO buffer layers.GaN based high brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes have been followed by the realization of GaN based high frequency power transistors, solar blind photodiodes, UV-LEDs and detectors, high electron mobility transistors and numerous other electronic devices During the last few years, GaN films have been sputter deposited using Ga In an earlier work ZnO buffer layers of different thicknesses (25, 50, 100 and 200 High resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements were performed on ZnO buffer layers as well as the GaN films deposited over the buffer layers. These measurements were carried out in ϕ and ω scan geometries using PANalytical X'Pert MRD system. The incident beam optics had a 4-bounce hybrid monochromator, which ensured CuKα The structure of ZnO buffer layers of different thicknesses and the GaN films deposited over them was studied by powder XRD. All the ZnO buffer layers and the GaN films exhibited a single peak due to (0002) reflection of the corresponding wurtzite structures (results not shown). The 25 The ϕ scans of asymmetric The mosaic tilt and twist angles are important microstructural parameters in characterizing the epitaxial quality of films, which can be estimated from the FWHM of the ω-scans of (0002) and The surface morphology of GaN epilayers deposited on ZnO buffer layers of different thickness was investigated by AFM and FEGSEM. Both the AFM and FEGSEM images of GaN films deposited on bare sapphire substrate are presented in   The studies presented in this work show that ZnO buffer layers of thickness ~ FIST (PHYSICS) IRCC SPM facility of IIT Bombay is acknowledged for providing the facilities for AFM measurements and the Centre for Research in Nanotechnology and Science (CRNTS), IIT Bombay is acknowledged for providing the facilities for FEGSEM and Raman spectroscopy studies.
