Improving the accuracy of the measurements in building automation systems without increasing operational costs is an essential step if the overall comfort and energy efficiency of buildings are to be improved. Data reconciliation and gross error elimination have emerged as key techniques for reducing both random noise and gross errors on the outputs of sensors. This paper focuses on using actuator control signals and simulation based on computational fluid dynamics to achieve the level of redundancy that is necessary for simultaneous data reconciliation and gross error elimination to be applied air-conditioning systems.
