This Special Issue of the International Journal Mineral Processing presents a collection of papers that were presented at the This conference gathered about 40 participants from 13 countries with a diversity of scientific backgrounds including chemical, food process, civil, environmental and mechanical engineers, metallurgists and mathematicians from both academia and industry. Naturally, each of the disciplines represented a different view on solid–liquid separation systems. Traditionally, meetings on solid–liquid separation are subdivided into sessions on flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and other unit operations. In order to stimulate discussions that would highlight different perspectives, the chairmen of this conference preferred to apply a slightly different schedule. Session 1 was assigned to The scientific programme is only one of the ingredients that make a meeting a success. We would like to thank the United Engineering Foundation, in particular Barbara Hickernell and Herm Bieber, for organizing this event, and acknowledge support by the helpful staff of Cresta Sun Hotel at Davos. Participants experienced exceptionally fine weather conditions during the conference and were able to use the conference breaks for excursions into the spectacular alpine mountains surrounding Davos.
