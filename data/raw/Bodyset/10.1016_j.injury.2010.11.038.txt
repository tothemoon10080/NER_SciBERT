Multilevel fractures of the lower limbs are infrequently observed events. Floating knee injury was described in 1975 by Blake and McBryde. The patient, a 20-year-old bricklayer, was the victim of a road traffic accident involving collision of his motorbike with a light vehicle on 23 February 2008 at 5 On the left lower limb, after reaming, a locking antegrade intramedullary nail (Trigen™, Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN, USA) was used for the femur, then the tibia. The same procedure was used for the right lower limb fractures. The four fracture sites thus underwent closed internal fixation, without use of a pneumatic tourniquet for the leg fractures. During surgery, 7 Fraser et al. The Karlström and Olerud score, The simultaneous occurrence of ipsilateral fractures of the femur and tibia causes isolation of the knee joint from the rest of the lower limb skeleton called “floating knee”. It is an extremely serious injury, causing immediate local and general complications that can result in death of the patient in the short term. Treatment is definitely emergency surgery, always with poor functional outcome. We report the highly unusual case of a young adult who presented polytrauma with bilateral floating knee. This case is underreported in the literature. This supports our treatment strategy for all fractures of the lower limbs: locking intramedullary nailing has a predominant place, even in the case of open fracture (Gustilo stage 1–3A), because it is for us the best treatment for the majority of shaft and metaphyseal fractures with less general and local post-operative complications. In case of floating knee and other multiple long bone fractures we recommended this surgical treatment in emergency.
