Here, the substrate decay and mineralization rate for 100cm3 of a 2.0mM phthalic acid solution in 0.10M Na2SO4 of pH 3.0 have been studied by electro-Fenton (EF) and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF). The electrochemical cell was a stirred tank reactor containing a 3cm2 boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and a 3cm2 air-diffusion cathode that generates H2O2. Cu2+ and/or Fe3+ were added as catalysts with total concentration of 0.50mM and a constant current density of 33.3mAcm−2 was applied. In EF with Cu2+ or Fe3+ alone and SPEF with only Cu2+, phthalic acid decayed slowly and poor mineralization was reached because the main oxidant was OH produced at the BDD surface from water oxidation. In contrast, the substrate destruction was largely enhanced using SPEF with 0.50mM Fe3+ since a high quantity of oxidant OH was produced in the bulk induced by photo-Fenton reaction. This treatment led to an almost total mineralization by the photolysis of generated Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes. In all cases, the decay of phthalic acid obeyed a pseudo-first-order reaction. The combination of Cu2+ and Fe3+ as catalysts accelerated the mineralization process in SPEF because Cu(II)-carboxylate complexes were also removed with OH formed from photo-Fenton reaction. The best SPEF process was found for 0.125mM Cu2+
                     +0.375mM Fe3+, giving rise to 99% mineralization with 40% current efficiency and 0.294kWhg−1 TOC energy consumption. Eleven aromatics and six short-linear carboxylic acids were identified as oxidation products. A plausible reaction sequence for phthalic acid mineralization involving all the detected products was finally proposed.Phthalic acid and phthalate derivatives are major industrial materials used to manufacture plastic products like toys and bottles, also being widely used as plasticizers, adhesives, films, polymers, etc. However, some studies revealed that these compounds could affect the male reproductive systems producing a testicular atrophy Several authors have reported the removal of phthalic acid and some of its esters by TiO Over the last fifteen years, several electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) based on Fenton's reaction chemistry are being developed for water remediation The most common EAOP is electro-Fenton (EF) in which a small catalytic amount of Fe The optimum solution pH for EF is 3.0, close to the optimum value of 2.8 for Fenton's reaction The use of an undivided cell with a high O An alternative EAOP is photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) which includes the simultaneous irradiation of the treated solution by EF either with a UV lamp or with inexpensive and renewable sunlight ( It has been found that SPEF is more potent than PEF with an artificial UVA lamp because the greater intensity of UVA and UVB of sunlight photodecomposes more rapidly the generated Fe(III)-carboxylate complexes by reaction In previous work, we have checked the synergistic action of adding small amounts of Cu This paper presents a comparative study on the mineralization of a phthalic acid solution of pH 3.0 by EF and SPEF with Fe Analytical grade phthalic acid was purchased from Lancaster. Pyruvic, maleic, tartronic, succinic, acrylic and oxalic acids were of analytical grade supplied by Panreac and Avocado. Anhydrous sodium sulphate, used as background electrolyte, was of analytical grade purchased from Fluka. Hydrated Fe(III) sulfate and pentahydrated Cu(II) sulfate, used as catalysts, were of analytical grade supplied by Probus and Panreac, respectively. Organic solvents and other chemicals employed were of LC–MS, HPLC or analytical grade purchased from Teknokroma, Merck and Sigma–Aldrich.
