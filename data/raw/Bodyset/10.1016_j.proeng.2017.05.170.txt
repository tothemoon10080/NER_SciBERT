Stress concentration is a direct result of stress redistribution around an excavation, that may lead to rock bursting under specific geomechanical conditions. This paper presents a case-study of a rockburst that took place in the shaft station area of the Provence coal mine in Southern France. The mined coal seam has a 2.5 m thickness and a 10Â° dip angle. The rockburst occurred in 1993 at the shaft station level, where it is surrounded by several longwall panels that were excavated between 1984 and 1994. The area of the shaft station is at 1000 m depth. A very thin layer of stiff limestone occupied the middle of the exploited coal seam. A large-scale finite difference numerical model of the mine has been constructed by using FLAC3D. The model simulates the area of the shaft with its irregular pillars and the longwall panels excavated between 1984 and 1993. The excavations were performed in two steps. Firstly, the galleries of the shaft station area were excavated in order to determine their effect on the failed pillar. Then, the longwall panels were excavated year by year to detect the stress and strain energy increments induced on the pillars. The origin of the rockburst was analysed based on different rockburst criteria. The results show that the vertical stress increased in the shaft station pillars due to excavation of longwall panels. In addition, we found that the small pillars have higher burst tendency than the large ones. Finally, the Burst Potential Index (BPI) was found to be able to estimate the pillar burst tendency based on the energy storage rate (ESR), however, this criterion (BPI) is based on calculating the stress and the energy changes in the vertical direction only.
