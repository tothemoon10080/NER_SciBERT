A 52-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department (ED) complaining of knee pain after falling. Upon admission to the ED, vital signs of the patient were normal. Physical examination revealed mild swelling and tenderness on the right patella, limitation of motion of the knee, and difficulty walking. Neurovascular examination was within normal limits. Bedside ultrasonographic examination (Mindray® M5, Color Diagnostic Ultrasound System, China) was performed before X-rays (  Patellar fractures account for 1% of all skeletal fractures and is most common between the ages of 20–50. The anteroposterior x-ray helps assess the fracture pattern and the direction of displacement, while the lateral and Merchant views assist in understanding the amount and location of comminution. In case of failure of direct radiography, other techniques can be used including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or scintigraphy. Bedside ultrasonography in the diagnosis of fractures is frequently used by emergency medicine physicians. In our case, standard anteroposterior and lateral knee radiographs were obtained after ultrasonographic examination (
