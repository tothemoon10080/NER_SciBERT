This short communication presents the kinetic characterization of 85 batch flotation tests based on an inversion approach, extending the work reported by Vinnett et al. (2019). For first-order systems, the mineral recovery R(t) as a function of time t can be expressed as

                      is the maximum recovery, k is the rate constant and F(k) is the flotation rate distribution. An arrangement of this expression allows the estimation of R∞F(k) by discretizing the integral term. A linear system is solved by a regularization approach that accounts for the fitting error of R(t) and the roughness of R∞F(k). Thus, R∞
                      is obtained, given

The feed had different ratios of primary and secondary Cu minerals, leading to a variable Cu feed grade from 0.3% to 1.2%.
