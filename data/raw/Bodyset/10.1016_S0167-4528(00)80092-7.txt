The processes and fluxes of two foundry plants were analyzed in order to determine the amount and kind of wastes generated from the different activities. The main fractions are molding and core sands, furnace dusts coming from cycloning and bag filtering, exhaust limes, furnace refractors, metallic shotting and sludges. Molding and core sands can be treated and recycled in production operations. A representative sample was collected from different sections of the foundries and it underwent to a treatment cycle in order to evaluate the potential recovery efficiency. The obtained product was chemically and physically characterized. The results show no substantial difference from the values measured employing the fresh silica sands thus validating hypothesis of recycling.
