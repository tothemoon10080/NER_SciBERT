The influence of Mg value in the MoO3–Mg–C mixture on the molybdenum carbide formation and the mechanism of reactions during mechanochemical process were investigated. In keeping with this aim, magnesium and carbon contents of the mixture were changed according to the following reaction: 2MoO3
                     +(6−
                     x) Mg+(1+
                     x) C=(6−
                     x) MgO+Mo2C+
                     x CO. The value of x varied from 0 to 6. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) results for sample with stoichiometric ratio (x
                     =0) revealed that in the early stage, carbon reduced the MoO3 to MoO2 and subsequently highly exothermic magnesiothermic MoO2 reduction occurred after magnesium melting. Also, it was indicated that the exothermic reaction temperature shifted to before magnesium melting in the 11h-milled sample (x
                     =0) and all the exothermic reactions happened, simultaneously. According to the experimental findings, molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) was synthesized in the mixture powder with stoichiometric ratio (x
                     =0) after 12h milling process and the type of reactions was mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR). However, at lower Mg content in the MoO3–Mg–C mixture (0<
                     x
                     ≤2), the magnesiothermic reduction occurred in MSR mode and activated the carbothermal reaction. Further decrease in Mg value (2<
                     x
                     ≤3) resulted in MSR mode magnesiothermic reaction and gradual carbothermal reduction. In samples with lower magnesium contents, partial molybdenum oxide reduction proceeded through a gradual mode magnesiothermic reaction.In recent years, transition metal carbides are widely used in industry because of some outstanding properties in mechanical hardness, thermal stability, and especially catalytic performance, which has been extensively studied over the past three decades Currently, many processes are available for the synthesis of molybdenum carbide and each process varies in the characteristics of the powder produced and the processing cost. Mo Mechanochemical activation is a solid state powder processing method which involves inducing chemical reactions in a mixture of reaction powders at room temperature or at least much lower temperatures. An increase in the kinetic of reaction during high energy milling can be a result of microstructural refinement, repeated cold deformation and fracture of particles In our previous works The aim of this work is to explore the possibility of in-situ synthesis of molybdenum carbide powder via mechanochemical method by using the MoO Combination of carbothermic and magnesiothermic reduction of MoO In the above reaction, The precursor materials were magnesium (Merck, 99.7% purity, particle size The precursor materials were milled in a planetary ball mill for various times at room temperature. Details of ball mill machine and milling conditions are given in In this study, the amounts of the remaining C (free carbon) were calculated to understand carbothermic reduction progress. For removing probable Mg and MgO, the obtained powder was leached with 18% hydrochloric acid for 1 XRD analysis was carried out using Cu-Kα radiation to identify different phases of the starting powders and mechanically alloyed powders. The diffractometer (Philips X-ray diffractometer) was operated at 40 To investigate the effect of Mg amount in the Mg–MoO The first aim was to ensure that the molybdenum oxide could be reduced during the mechanochemical process; in this regard, sample S1 was ball-milled for different times. The general form of the reaction taking place in the Mg–MoO This reaction includes two stages: first, reduction of MoO ∆H◦ and ∆G◦ of samples containing different amounts of Mg (0   In this group (A), it is assumed that all amount of the carbon is used to form molybdenum carbide compound as a carbon agent and there is no excess value of carbon to play the role of a carbothermal reduction agent. It is well-documented in the literatures In order to identify reactions' sequence in the MoO The first exothermic peak on the DTA curve appears at 450–500 The evidence to support this notion could be obtained from the weight changes and TG curve as shown in The intensive endothermic peak at about 650 Although the information obtained from the DTA experiment is valuable to help in unraveling the reaction mechanism, it may not be fully reliable since the experimental conditions differ considerably in the DTA and mechanochemical processes, which could have significant influence on the reaction kinetics and mechanism Based on the DTA analysis results and consistence with reports by Manukyan et al. Generally, in these samples, the Mg values are insufficient for reduction of whole MoO XRD patterns of this group (S2 and S3) milled for 12 Therefore, it was expected that the high temperature resulting from MSR mode reaction would activate the carbothermic reaction. Absence of free carbon after the 12 In order to have more detailed information, the samples S2 and S3 were studied by TG method after the 11 With regard to By considering the calculated It is worth mentioning that the amount of free carbon after the 12 Thermodynamic evaluations of samples in this group ( Presence of the large amount of free carbon for samples S5, S6 and S7 after 20 In both samples S6 and S7, with lower Mg content ( Considering reaction mechanism, the summary of the discussion is shown schematically in Mechanochemical reduction of molybdenum oxide in the presence of various carbon and magnesium contents was successfully performed for formation of molybdenum carbide (Mo Based on the thermal analysis of unmilled sample ( According to the amount of Mg in the MoO The mixture powder with 6 The mixture powder with 4 The mixture powder with 3 The mixture powder with 0
