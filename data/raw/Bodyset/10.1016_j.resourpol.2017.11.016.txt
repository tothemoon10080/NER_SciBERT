The fundamental objective of production planning is to create a mechanism for the implementation of the mining cutoff grades and short-term production planning. One of the most important parameters in open pit design is a determination of the optimal cutoff grade. Optimum cutoff grade results in maximizing profits or maximizing the net present value. Given that in determining the cutoff grade with the goal of maximizing profits, a constant value is obtained for the entire life of the mine. The annual income of the mine will be the same throughout its lifetime, and the time value of the money has not been neglected; which is the main disadvantage of this optimization process. While in optimization with the goal of maximizing net present value, the optimal value will be a function of the time and will be greater in the early years of the mine and will gradually decrease. Optimization of cutoff grades with the aim of maximizing the net present value over the life of the mine is important due to its dependence on the economic parameters, the design of the open pit mining and fundamental issues. Maximizing the net present value is a nonlinear programming problem. To determine the optimal cutoff grade Lane method is commonly used. Lane provided his method to determine the optimal cutoff grade by considering factors such as the capacity of the mine, concentrator and load capacity of the treatment plant, the time value of money and distributing grade. The procedure of the Lane method for cutoff grade calculation is complicated and time-consuming. Considering the widespread use of heuristic methods in optimizing parameters, In the present study genetic algorithm, which is a smart algorithm, is used to determine the optimal cutoff grade. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of the genetic algorithm and Lane's theory in optimizing the degree of limit based on maximizing the net present value. Using separate programming based on the genetic algorithm and considering the capacity limitations and the proportion between the parameters of mining to smelter and refining in the mine is done. For this purpose, consider precision of 0.001%, optimum cutoff grades, the amount of output per unit and the net present value are calculated. The optimum cutoff grade at the beginning of the life of the mine is equal to 0.506% and at the end of the life of the mine to 0.222% using the genetic algorithm. Using the Lane model at the beginning of the life of the mine the optimum cut-off grade from 0/503% to 0/220% reaches at the end of the mine's life. The net present value of earnings over a lifespan of 7 years mine in the genetic algorithm and Lane model is $ 93,467,914 and $ 94,408,000 respectively. Also, the amount of mining, the amount of processing and the amount of refinery obtained by the genetic algorithm method are compared to the Lane model. The results of the research indicate high speed and very low error of genetic algorithm and also a convergence of results with the Lane method.A grade of the ore and waste defines the boundary between simple means; it is a technical and economic scale which is determined by various parameters such as geological features (such as grade distribution), technical limitations of operations and financial parameters. The cutoff grade strategy for an open pit mine has an impact on annual liquidity flows and the net present value of the project. Therefore, in each given period, the allocation of materials sent to the processing unit and the production of the product in the refinery unit for sale to the cutoff grade depends (  According to Lane algorithm for cutoff grade optimization, mining operations including three stages of mining, concentrate production, smelter, and refining are taken into account. Each of these steps associated with costs and each one also has a limited capacity. Moreover, fixed costs are also included. Considering the expenditure and income in these operations, operating profit is calculated from the following equation ( In which, To maximize the NPV, the value of In the above three modes, Genetic Algorithm is a mathematical algorithm in which a set of mathematical objects, often referred to as strings of constant length characters, which call these strings a chromosome. Based on the Darwinian evolution theory, the survival of the superior generation with respect to the compatibility factor was first introduced by Darwin in 1852 and generates a new generation using various genetic actions. Among the inspirational optimization techniques of nature, The genetic algorithm is the evolution of them. This algorithm is included in the class of random optimization algorithms. This algorithm is particularly suited to optimizing complex issues with an unknown search space. Genetic algorithms have been very successful for classical optimization methods for solving linear problems, convex, and some similar difficulties, but genetic algorithms are much more efficient for solving discrete and nonlinear problems ( Genetic Algorithms (GA), to gain a robust search engine and optimization approach, implements the origin of natural evolution with the genetic proliferation of characteristics which called the principle of “survival of the fittest”. The important characteristic of a genetic algorithm (GA) is that it specifies simultaneously many feasible answers and explores various areas in the desired space chosen by the researcher ( The main idea of the genetic algorithm is taken from Darwin's theory of evolution (1859). Those natural traits that are more compatible with natural laws, Have a greater chance of survival. Darwin's evolutionary theory has no analytical and definitive proof. But it has been empirically and statistically confirmed. Among other people, human society, animal, and plant community create a new generation through mating. The chance for a person to survive in a new generation depends on the specific chromosomal composition of that person in the new generation. Usually, new generation people are more compatible with nature. In rare cases it is possible, an inventory with excellent characteristics and high compatibility may be produced. In short, in each generation, reproductive opportunities are better represented, and species with unfavorable characteristics are gradually eliminated. As a result, by the passing of time, people of different generations evolve In nature, the combination of better chromosomes, Better generations will emerge. Sometimes there are mutations in the chromosomes, which may lead to better next generation ( To apply the genetic algorithm, first, the problem parameters are coded as binary strings. Each answer corresponds to a matching fitness that identifies the quality of the response to other members of the population. The more fitness the answer is, the chance for more survival and reproduction and it will appear in later generations. A simple algorithm of three operators selection, crossover, and mutation. Each strand of the zero ones consists of a pink code encoded by the answer to the optimization problem. The genetic algorithm generates the next generation from the current generation using a crossover and mutation operators. This cycle continues until the condition is met (       A correct route for an issue is commonly named a chromosome or an individual in genetic algorithm (GA) approach. In the first stage of the algorithm, an initial population, demonstrating deputies of the possible route, is generated to commence the search procedure. The components of the population are coded into chromosomes that are bit-strings. With the aim of another index that named fitness value, the robustness of the strings above is assessed that illustrating the restrictions of the issue. Chromosomes are chosen for further genetic manipulation by their own fitness value. It is worth mentioning that the process of selection is chiefly dependable on guaranteeing the survival of the best-fit chromosomes. Further choosing of the chromosomes strings the genetic treatment procedure including two stages is implemented. In the previous stage, the crossover operation which recombines the genes of each two chosen chromosomes is utilized. Different kinds of crossover operators are carried out in previous works. The points for the crossover of each two chromosomes are collected casually. The next stage in the genetic utilization procedure is called mutation process, which the bits of the chromosomes are changed at one or more randomly chosen positions. The operation of mutation aids to defeat issue of trapping at a local optimum. The off-springs generated by the genetic utilization procedure are the following population to be assessed ( In this study, a real-coded genetic algorithm was used to optimize the objective functions. To implement genetic algorithm optimization, limitations of the parameters should be defined. Therefore, three restrictions including limitations of extraction, processing, and smelter were employed and considering these limitations several penalties for improving the precision were defined. In the coding section of the genetic algorithm, you must split the window opened in MATLAB software into five sections, which include: problem definition, parameters settings, initialization, main loop, and outputs. In the definition section of the problem, for the implementation of the genetic algorithm, the target function is called, and the number of variables in the problem and the size of the variables matrix are determined. In the parameters setting section, respectively, the upper and lower limits of the variables, population numbers, maximum repetitions, crossover percentage and crossover number, the percentage of mutations, and the number of mutations and the matrix of upper and lower limit variables are written. To begin, the genetic algorithm needs an initial value and the number of the target population, this value can be randomly generated. In the main ring section, for the best answer in each replication, a zero-dimensional matrix is ​​defined as the maximum generation production and one, and the number of generations (from one to the maximum number of generations production) is applied to the crossover and mutation operators to get the population from solutions. To apply any of the mutation and crossover operators, Separately, a function is defined to run them, and the required parameters are referred to as input data to the function, the following is for the implementation of the intersection function: the number of crossovers, the main population and its number, and the space generated for storing generations produced from the crossover, as well as for the mutation operator, include, the main population and their number, the number of mutations, the number of variables and their upper and lower limits, and the space created to store generations produced by the mutation operator. The total population, include, the main population, the produced population results from the crossover operator, and the produced population results from the mutation operator, and this population is arranged according to their value, which is achieved by their target function, and separated by the size of the main population, and considered as a better population. The first member of the new population is the worst member of the population because the goal is to maximize the objective function. The first step in the implementation of genetic algorithm optimization is defining all the inputs, variables and parameters in the form of a matrix. In this algorithm, the number of variables (n Three penalty functions are considered for the genetic algorithm, Relationships 9–11 are the penalty functions of the genetic algorithm. In these relationships:          Finally, the objective function is coded, and the value of the objective function is achieved by applying all the limitations. In Eq. In this regard:    After executing the program, the value of the best answer for each repetition and other parameters that are required is displayed, and the final value of the best answer is determined. In To apply the genetic algorithm, the optimal grade of the deposit is calculated hypothetically. In solving this problem, we are going to find a combination of mining capacity, concentrator and a refining unit that will provide the maximum benefit and net present value. The advantage of this program is finding out the optimum cut-off grade based on the maximum net present simultaneously. To solve this problem 300 randomly, populations are generated as initial population, and they used in the first optimization loop. In this algorithm, the number of variables needed to solve, according to the mine life, is equal to 28. To produce a new generation in the genetic algorithm, the crossover rate is equal to 0.8, and the mutation rate is equal to 0.6. The uniform selection function is also used to provide a better result. Maximum iteration number in the genetic algorithm is considered as 600. To consider the effect of the limitations on NPV, different restrictions are considered. These limitations including the capacity of the concentrator and refinery, the capacity of mining and concentrator, and the capacity of the refinery and mining. It should be noted that in a case of contravention, the violation has taken place. Running the genetic algorithm for more than 20 times results in a decrease in error for both of the cutoff grade and the net present value as close as possible to zero. But, there is no reduction was observed in the objective functions including the capacity of the mine, concentrator, a refining unit, and grade. Thus, after optimization, the net present value of hypothetical deposits increased to $ 371,037,926. To check the validity of the proposed model, the optimal cutoff grade of ore was calculated theoretically using a method based on the Lane theory. The results of this method are shown in In this paper, a genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal cut-off grade to maximize the net present value. One of the most important parameters in open pit production planning is a determination of the optimal cut-off grade. For this purpose, the cut-off grade should be optimized for different years of the project life, to optimize profits or net present value. For this purpose, different values for hypothetical deposit were considered. The genetic algorithm implemented and in each year due to the limits, the maximum net present value and the optimal cut-off grade was calculated. In the genetic algorithm, the correct set of parameters (mutation and crossover rates) are effective in achieving the optimum solution, as well as genetic algorithm parameters are critical to achieving fast and accurate results. So the genetic algorithm converges to the optimal solution more quickly, and in most applications also provided better results.
