We report the use of a molybdenite (MLN) and glucose oxidase (GOD)-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE)-based glucose biosensor with the aid of hydroquinone (HQ) as a mediator. It was fabricated through covalent bonding of GOD and MLN using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a covalent reagent. The biosensor exhibited a fast and linear response toward glucose from 1.0 to 135 mM by using a cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurement, with a detection limit of 100 Î¼M. The repeatability, reproducibility and applicability were also investigated in this research. The results show that MLN is a good platform for GOD immobilization.
