The comminution of Al scrap was investigated under different processing conditions to assess its ability to tailor powders for the powder metallurgy (PM) industry. Specifically, the influence of the circumferential velocity and ventilation power over the properties of the pulverized particles was highlighted. These parameters controlled the residence time and deformation experienced by the feedstock chips, which, in turn, governed the size, morphology and composition of the pulverized particles. The pulverized chips consisted of heavily passivated oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) particles with varying contents of Fe, Si and Mn, depending on the extent of oxygen accumulation and contaminants embedding taking place during comminution. Upon screening, the −140 mesh pulverized powders were also characterized. The passivation layer thickness and Al2O3 dispersoids content of these powders ranged, respectively, from 6.81±0.31nm to 7.58±0.38nm and from 2.13±0.11wt% to 5.20±0.11wt% as circumferential velocity decreased, while they ranged from 4.96±0.41nm to 8.67±0.36nm and from 2.02±0.09wt% to 7.12±0.09wt% as ventilation power decreased. These tendencies highlighted that the oxygen enrichment process occurring during comminution changed from a passivation layer thickening regime to an Al2O3 dispersoids accumulation regime, for a residence time of ~210s. Furthermore, all pulverized powders contained nanograins whose fractions depended on the comminution parameters used.Faced with the growing depletion of natural resources, the processing of scrap materials have become a necessity in order to reduce our carbon footprint and ensure the sustainable development of human activities Tearing off into single pieces of the plate-shaped material by a combination of bending and flexion Deformation by bending of the torn pieces leading to initial crack formation Failure of the pieces and compaction of the fragments Formation of dense ball-shaped particles via extensive compaction In addition, fine particles were emitted by abrasion, i.e. compressive shearing, throughout processing. The magnitude of each individual stage of the deformation sequence is however determined by the design of the comminution chamber and the residence time of the material within the chamber. In that context, investigating the influence of the operating parameters on the comminution behavior of a single Al scrap appeared essential to close the knowledge gap remaining for this type of comminution process. Consequently, the present work aims at investigating the comminution of particulate Al scrap under different processing conditions and at assessing the usability of the resultant particles as feedstocks for the PM supply chain. Firstly, this research work will establish the process-structure-property relationships for set ranges of circumferential velocity and ventilation power and discuss the comminution mechanism of Al scrap particles. Secondly, it will evaluate the suitability of pulverized powders for the PM supply chain by characterizing the −140 mesh pulverized powders resulting from all comminution conditions tested. In doing so, the effects of the circumferential velocity and ventilation power used on the critical properties for PM processing, including the powders morphology, microstructure, composition and passivation layer, will be highlighted. The scrap material used as feedstock in this investigation has been previously introduced elsewhere The material feedstock was milled in an industrial comminution line using a Turbo 900/5 pulverizer from Guidetti Inc. The chips were carried through the pulverizer by ventilation transport and comminution was performed in air using high-speed steel hammers rotating inside a cylindrical chamber covered with steel teeth-walled cuirasses. To establish the process-structure-property relationships, the comminution trials were conducted according to the sets of normalized circumferential velocity and ventilation power detailed in The residence time distribution (RTD) of the chips processed within the comminution setup was established for each comminution condition tested using additions of Al The particle size distribution (PSD) of the +8 mesh, −8/+40 mesh and −40 mesh pulverized particles were determined by screening through a set of stacked laboratory sieves following MPIF standards The morphology of the pulverized particles was described quantitatively through sphericity measurements, recorded by light optical microscopy (LOM) using a SZ-CTV series Olympus stereo-microscope equipped with a Clemex Vision software. The particles sphericity was represented graphically as confidence domains in which lied 95% of the particles population. These confidence domains were established by measuring the sphericity of over 500 particles for each fraction of the discrete mass-based size distribution of the pulverized particles, and determining the corresponding interval of 95% confidence. Subsequent mathematical processing of these 95% confidence intervals enabled to construct the composite confidence domains reported for all comminution conditions considered. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the morphology of the −8/+40 mesh pulverized granules were performed using a Hitachi SU3500 microscope. The chemical compositions of the +8 mesh, −8/+40 mesh, −40 mesh and −140 mesh pulverized particles were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The procedure detailing the samples digestion and the range of calibration standards used for elemental quantification has been described elsewhere Quantification of the oxygen content of the particulate materials was performed by inert gas fusion (IGF) using a Leco ONH 836 instrument. The samples analyzed included the separate size fractions of the mass-based PSD of the pulverized particles, the −140 mesh pulverized powders as well as high purity (> The microstructures of the −140 mesh pulverized powders were investigated by LOM using an Epiphot 200 Nikon microscope. The procedures for the preparation and chemical etching of the metallography samples have been described by Hendrickx et al. Dark-field transmission electron microscopy (DF TEM) observations, including SAED patterns, of the −140 mesh pulverized powders were carried out using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 TEM microscope operated at 200 The passivation layer thickness of the feeding particles and of the −140 mesh pulverized powders was quantified by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling. The equipment description and operating conditions of both techniques as well as the procedures for sample preparation have been described in another work The comminution response of Al scrap was conditioned by the circumferential velocity and ventilation power selected. Specifically, these parameters controlled the residence time and deformation of the feeding chips as they passed through the comminution line. Hence, the relationships between the comminution parameters and the RTD of the chips are highlighted in The circumferential velocity and ventilation power also tailored the properties of the pulverized particles including their size, shape and composition. The relationship between the particles morphology and the comminution parameters is quantitatively represented in For the sake of discussion, the sphericity domains of the pulverized particles reported in By contrast, the range II-III boundary shifted gradually towards larger particle sizes with decreasing circumferential velocity ( The results presented in The effect of the circumferential velocity and ventilation power on the extent of contamination occurring during comminution was highlighted via the compositions of the +8 mesh, −8/+40 mesh and −40 mesh pulverized particles summarized in The relationships between the PSD of the +8 mesh, −8/+40 mesh and −40 mesh pulverized particles and the comminution parameters tested are highlighted in In addition to the PSD, the size dependent profiles of the oxygen content of the pulverized particles highlighted in In this section, the capability of comminution processing to tailor powders for the PM supply chain using different circumferential velocity of the hammers and ventilation power was investigated by characterizing the −140 mesh pulverized powders produced. From this point, the designation of pulverized powders will strictly refer to the −140 mesh fraction of the pulverized particles. The compositions of these powders for the sets of circumferential velocity and ventilation power tested were summarized in To quantify the accumulation of deformation within the particles as function of the circumferential velocity and ventilation power used, the microstructures of each pulverized powder were characterized through the GSD histograms presented in In this work, the nanoscale component of the pulverized powders microstructure was investigated for each set of circumferential velocity and ventilation power tested via the TEM observations presented in The dependence of the powders nanostructure to the circumferential velocity and ventilation power used was further supported by the XRD analyses reported in In addition to the properties investigated above, the passivation layer of the pulverized powders was also of paramount importance for their processing through the PM supply chain. Using the HR-TEM micrographs presented in According to both TEM and XPS results, the passivation layer grew thicker as circumferential velocity ( The extensive deformation experienced by the particles during comminution also led to the accumulation of oxygen in the form of Al The accumulation of oxygen within the pulverized powders was further characterized by establishing, in In order to characterize quantitatively the kinetics of the layer thickening phenomenon occurring during comminution, the growth rate of the oxide scale was calculated for each comminution parameter considered based on the results presented in Overall, the pulverized powders investigated in this work exhibited thicker passivation layers than that of atomized Al powders, which typically possessed a 3–4 This work established the process-structure-property relationships of the comminution processing of particulate Al scrap and assessed the usability of pulverized powders as feedstocks of the PM supply chain.
