Sulphur dioxide removal efficiencies were measured in a pilot-scale column packed with Pall plastic rings at 20°C and atmospheric pressure with sulphuric acid solutions (1.6–6.6 M) containing hydrogen peroxide (0.13–0.74 M) as the scrub solution. Different sulphur dioxide partial pressures up to 500 Pa were fed in the inlet air. A mathematical model previously developed to determine the kinetic parameters from laboratory experiments was used to predict the absorption rates. It was found that calculated results agree fairly well with experimental data for a wide range of operating conditions of gas and liquid flow rates, gas phase composition, H2O2 and H2SO4 concentrations of the solution. This model can provide predictions of the absorption performances of industrial packed columns and appears to be really helpful to design scrubbers for SO2 abatement with hydrogen peroxide solutions.
