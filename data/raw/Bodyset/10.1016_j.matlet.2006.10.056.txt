High surface area nanosheet TiO2 with mesoporous structure were synthesized by hydrothermal method at 130 °C for 12 h. The samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, SAED, and BET surface area. The nanosheet structure was slightly curved and approximately 50–100 nm in width and several nanometers in thickness. The as-synthesized nanosheet TiO2 had an average pore diameter about 3–4 nm. The BET surface area and pore volume of the sample are about 642 m2/g and 0.774 cm3/g, respectively.The synthesis and characterization of nanostructured materials (nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, and nanosheet) have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and novel applications In this study, high surface area nanosheet TiO Titanium (IV) butoxide (Aldrich) was mixed with the same mole of acetyacetone (ACA, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Japan) to slowdown the hydrolysis and the condensation reactions The crystalline structure of the samples was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU RINT 2100). The microstructure of the prepared materials was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6500FE), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-200CX), and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption (BEL Japan, BELSORP-18 Plus).     From the above data we can deduce the growth process of the nanosheet TiO In summary, high surface area nanosheet TiO The authors would like to express their gratitude to Prof. S. Isoda and Prof. H.
