A mathematical model has been developed for an open circuit two-compartment tube mill grinding cement clinker. Samples were collected of the feed and product, and inside the mill. In the laboratory, sizings were done between the top size and 2 Î¼m, and the breakage distribution function of the clinker was obtained by using a twin pendulum apparatus. Modelling and simulation studies were carried out using the JKSimmet computer programme developed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Center. In order to confirm the validity of the approach an extra sampling survey was performed while the circuit was operating at different conditions. The product size distribution of the mill was predicted for the new conditions using simulation based on the model which had been developed. The observed and calculated size distributions agreed closely for the new conditions.
