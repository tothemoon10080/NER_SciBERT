South Australian low-rank coals contain high levels of water-soluble and ion-exchangeable ions that can be deleterious to coal combustion and gasification. The presence of sodium causes the formation of low melting point bonded deposits that can produce severe fouling and slagging in many processes using these coals. Approximately 70% of the sodium present in Bowmans coal is water-soluble and can therefore be removed by simple water leaching, however the remaining 30% is organically bound, predominantly to carboxyl groups. Ion exchange using sulphuric acid at pH 2 is necessary to remove this sodium, but this can generate large volumes of acidic wastewater if multiple washing stages are used with fresh water each time. Using a simple laboratory procedure, the continuous counter-current ion exchange leaching of sodium from this coal was simulated which reduced the sodium level from 1.30% on a dry basis (db) to 0.15% (db) after three stages of counter-current washing at a total coal:water ratio of 1:2. The effectiveness of interstage dewatering on the efficiency of sodium removal was highlighted. The agreement between predicted and measured values of moisture and sodium in coal was excellent.
