Metal extraction pH isotherms and extraction and stripping kinetics have been determined with Versatic 10 acid and LIX® 63 and modifier TBP in an attempt to develop synergistic SX systems for the separation, purification and recovery of nickel and cobalt from leach solutions.
                  The combination of LIX® 63 with Versatic 10 acid resulted in significant synergistic shifts for nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, and manganese and antagonistic shifts for calcium and magnesium. With the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system, the ΔpH50 values of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese compared to Versatic 10 acid alone were found to be 2.79, 3.50, >2.0, 1.99 and 1.17 pH units, respectively. The ΔpH50(Mn–Ni) and ΔpH50(Mn–Co) values were found to be 1.96 pH and 2.53 pH units, respectively, indicating easy separation of nickel and cobalt from manganese, calcium and magnesium. The extraction and stripping kinetics of cobalt, copper, zinc, and manganese were fast and the extraction and stripping kinetics of nickel were slow with the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 synergistic system. The nickel stripping kinetics increased with the addition of TBP. Within 2 min, the stripping efficiency of nickel increased from 18% with no TBP to 91% with 0.5 M TBP addition. The addition of TBP to the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 system also improved the nickel extraction kinetics.
                  It is proposed that in the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 synergistic system, LIX® 63 plays the role of an extractant and Versatic 10 acid a synergist for nickel while LIX® 63 plays the role of a synergist and Versatic 10 acid an extractant for cobalt.LIX® 63, an aliphatic α-hydroxyoxime with the active component 5,8-diethyl-7-hydroxydodecan-6-one oxime ( The extraction of nickel with α-hydroxy oxime/carboxylic acid mixtures was of considerable potential commercial interest in the 1960s and 1970s due to the fact that separation factors of up to 50 were observed for nickel over cobalt in sulphate solutions and the ability to extract nickel in preference to ferric ion, which was then unmatched by any existing commercial SX reagents or reagent combinations ( Much research has been carried out to separate nickel and cobalt from other metals using synergistic SX systems ( Efforts were made to use commercially available reagents for the development of synergistic systems to separate Ni and Co from Mn, Mg and Ca using Versatic 10 acid and LIX® 63, which resulted in the development of novel SX processes ( The synthetic solution, simulating a laterite leach solution after iron precipitation and containing 3 g/L Ni, 0.3 g/L Co, 0.2 g/L Cu and Zn, 2.0 g/L Mn, 10.0 g/L Mg and 0.5 g/L Ca, was made by dissolving the required amount of analytical grade metal sulphates in distilled water. Industrial grade Versatic 10 acid was supplied by Shell Chemicals, Australia and LIX® 63 containing 70% of the active component was supplied by Cognis, Australia. TBP (tri-butyl phosphate) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The reagents were diluted in Shellsol 2046, also supplied by Shell Chemicals, Australia. For the determination of extraction pH isotherms, fresh organic and the synthetic leach solutions were mixed at an A:O ratio of 1:1 and 40 °C. After mixing for 5–10 min when the pH was stable at each target pH point, samples were collected at 0.5 pH intervals. For the determination of extraction kinetics, an ideal extraction pH for each system was determined from the pH isotherms. A preliminary extraction test was conducted with an A/O ratio of 1:1 at 40 °C and the selected pH to determine the amount of ammonia solution required for pre-equilibration. The organic solution was pre-equilibrated with the pre-determined amount of ammonia solution. The synthetic laterite leach solution and the pre-equilibrated organic solution were mixed at an A/O ratio of 1:1 and 40 °C. Samples of the solution mixture were taken at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 10 min. For the determination of stripping kinetics, a loaded organic solution was prepared by the extraction of metals from the synthetic laterite leach solution at an A:O ratio of 1:1 and 40 °C with an ideal extraction pH. The loaded organic solution was mixed with the strip solution at an A/O ratio of 1:1 and at 40 °C. Samples of the solution mixture were taken at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 and 5.0 min. The organic and aqueous phases of the collected samples were separated using separating funnels. The organic samples were stripped with 100 g/L sulphuric acid and all aqueous samples were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Metal extraction pH isotherms were determined using the synthetic laterite leach solution and organic solutions containing 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid alone ( The metal pH It is very interesting to note that the shape of the nickel and cobalt isotherms varied with the change in LIX® 63 concentrations. The cobalt pH isotherms changed at low pH when the LIX® 63 concentration was < The metal extraction sequence was found to be Cu The ΔpH In terms of selectivity of nickel and cobalt over manganese (ΔpH The extraction kinetics of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese using the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system are shown in The stripping kinetics of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese from the loaded 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system using a strip solution containing 5 g/L Ni and 10 g/L sulphuric acid at 40 °C are shown in  Although the above tests showed fast stripping kinetics of cobalt with the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 system, the long-term resistance of the system to cobalt poisoning has not been demonstrated. To verify this, parallel tests were conducted with 0.35 M LIX® 63 and the 0.50 Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 systems to demonstrate the effect of Versatic 10 acid on the stripping of cobalt from LIX® 63. The organic solutions were loaded with an aqueous solution containing 0.5 g/L Co at an A/O ratio of 1:1, 40 °C and pH 7.0 for the LIX® 63 system and pH 5.8 for the LIX® 63/Versatic 10 acid system. All the cobalt was extracted in both systems. The loaded organic solutions were mixed with the raffinate for up to 76 h in containers with air bubbling at flowrates in the range of 0.3–0.5 L/min. Organic solution samples were taken before mixing, at 26 h and at the end of the tests (76 h). The organic solution samples were stripped with 100 g/L sulphuric acid and the strip liquor was assayed for cobalt ( This cobalt stripping ability, most probably, can be attributed to the different extraction mechanism or different complexes formed in the two organic systems. A chelating/oxidation reaction occurred in the pure LIX® 63 system, forming a very stable Co(III) chelate complex in the presence of oxygen ( The relatively low cobalt stripping efficiencies in the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system at the beginning of mixing were probably attributed to the displacement of a small amount of de-protonated LIX® 63 associated with the cobalt by Versatic 10 acid. Once all de-protonated LIX® 63 was displaced, the cobalt stripping efficiency approached 100%.  The findings that nickel and cobalt may form different metal/organic complexes in the same organic system are of great interest. In other words, one reagent may act as an extractant for some metals and act as a synergist for others. In the current system, most probably, LIX® 63 acted as an extractant for copper and nickel and a synergist for other metals including cobalt, zinc and manganese while Versatic 10 acid acted as an extractant for cobalt, zinc and manganese and a synergist for copper and nickel. As modifiers have been used in copper solvent extraction to increase the stripping kinetics of LIX® extractants, modifiers were tried to investigate the possibility of accelerating the nickel stripping kinetics with the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 system. The stripping kinetics tests were conducted using the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system with TBP as a modifier at different concentrations. The stripping kinetics of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese from loaded 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63 system with the addition of 0.5 M TBP are shown in While the stripping kinetics of nickel, in particular, increased with the addition of modifier TBP, the effect of the modifier on the pH isotherms and extraction kinetics of the metals with the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 system were unknown. Tests were carried out to determine the effect of TBP using the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63/0.5 M TBP system. The metal pH isotherms with this system are shown in The extraction kinetics of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese with the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 M LIX® 63/0.5 M TBP system are shown in The combination of LIX® 63 with Versatic 10 acid resulted in significant synergistic shifts for nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, and manganese and antagonistic shifts for calcium and magnesium. With the 0.5 M Versatic 10 acid/0.35 LIX® 63 system, the ΔpH It is proposed that in the Versatic 10 acid/LIX® 63 system, LIX® 63 plays the role of an extractant and Versatic 10 acid a synergist for nickel while LIX® 63 plays the role of a synergist and Versatic 10 acid an extractant for cobalt. This is supported by the difficulty in nickel stripping with both LIX® 63 and LIX® 63/Versatic 10 acid systems, and by the cobalt poisoning with LIX® 63 system and easy cobalt stripping with the LIX® 63/Versatic 10 acid system in the presence of oxygen. This means that in an organic system containing different reagents, one particular reagent may play a role of an extractant with some metals and a solvating reagent (synergist) with others.
