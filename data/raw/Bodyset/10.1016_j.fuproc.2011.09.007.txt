Enhanced desulfurizing flotation of high sulfur coal was investigated using the sonoelectrochemical method. The supporting electrolyte used in this process was calcium hydroxide and the additive was anhydrous ethanol. The effects of treatment conditions on desulfurization were studied by a single-factor method. The conditions include anhydrous ethanol concentration, sonoelectrolytic time, current density, and ultrasound intensity. For the coal sample with a particle size of −0.076mm, the optimal experimental conditions achieved for anhydrous ethanol, sonoelectrolytic time, current density, and ultrasound intensity are 2.1mol/L, 20min, 15×10−3
                     A/cm2, and 1.2W/cm2, respectively. Optimal conditions cause a sulfur reduction of up to 75.4%. The raw and treated coals were analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and a chemical method. Pyritic sulfur, organic sulfur, and ash are partially removed. Compared with enhanced flotation by ultrasound or electrochemistry, desulfurizing flotation of high sulfur coal by sonoelectrochemistry is an effective technology.The increasing demand for coal has led to more extensive mining of coal seams, so that the mined coal has high sulfur content. Reducing sulfur content in coal prior to its use in many applications is essential. To this end, researchers have focused on searching for simple, economic, and efficient desulfurization methods as this has become an issue of worldwide concern. The process of enhanced desulfurizing flotation of coal using electrochemistry involves simple technology; this process has been reported in several published articles In recent years, the integration of electrochemistry and sonochemistry has given rise to an interdisciplinary method called sonoelectrochemistry. Research in this area has attracted considerable attention, and some of the advantages reported in literature include the improvement of electrochemical progress while obtaining results superior to those obtained by electrochemistry alone High sulfur coal from the Tunlan coal plant in Shanxi, China was used for the experiment. By screening, the coal was separated into samples of different granulometry. For the coal sample with a particle size of − Electrolytic power was provided by a DH1722 DC-regulated power supply.

These results indicate that enhanced flotation by sonoelectrochemistry can partially remove organic sulfur, pyritic sulfur, and sulfate sulfur.
