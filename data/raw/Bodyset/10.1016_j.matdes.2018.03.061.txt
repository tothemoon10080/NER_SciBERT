Despite its high structural strength and degradability, the potentiality of pure iron foam for bone scaffolds is low due to its lack of surface bioactivity. This work aims to provide a surface bioactivity to the iron foam by developing a calcium phosphate (CaP) conversion coating. Silver (Ag), known for its antibacterial property, was then incorporated onto the CaP coating via co-deposition (Ag/CaP-c) and post-treatment (Ag/CaP-p). By tuning the Ca/P ion ratio and Ag concentration during the coating process, an optimum coating parameter was obtained. All coatings were found to enhance mineralization ability and mechanical integrity of the iron foam over time. Electrochemical and immersion tests indicated that the coatings regulated the degradation rate of the iron foam via a variation of coating resistance and capacitance. Silver ions were released slowly from the Ag/CaP coating during the immersion test indicating a potential long-term antibacterial property of the coating. Details on the coating design and process optimization, the effects of three different simulated physiological solutions, and the mechanical property of the coated iron foam are discussed in this report.Porous biomaterials have been long known to provide a suitable scaffolding structure that accommodates tissue formation and promotes diffusion of nutrients to and metabolites out of the cell/scaffold structure [ Nonetheless, improving bioactivity of absorbable metals is still one of the main necessities in developing suitable temporary medical implants [ Another challenge with medical implants is the high risk of microbial growth on the implanted devices, especially on a high surface area like scaffolds [ Therefore, this work aims to develop optimized CaP and Ag/CaP conversion coatings on pure iron foam and to study their in vitro biomineralization behavior, degradation and mechanical properties. The results will give an implication for design in-term that the optimized coating process can be used as a benchmark for further development of bioactive silver containing CaP-based coatings on porous iron and other absorbable metals. Open porous pure iron foam sheets (purity 99.9%, nominal pore size A previous study on CaP conversion coating of magnesium alloys indicated a strong influence of Ca In order to identify the microstructure, morphology and elemental composition of the coatings, a scanning electron microscope (SEM, QUANTA 250, FEI, USA) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, SwiftED 3000, Oxford Instrument, UK) was used. Phase analysis was also done by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000, USA) with Cu Kα radiation (λ Degradation or corrosion behavior of the samples was evaluated by means of electrochemical and static immersion tests. The electrochemical tests were performed in modified Hanks' solution (MHS) at 37 The static immersion tests were performed in two different solutions at 37 A compressive test was done on 5 specimens of each group (with a dimension of 10 In comparison to that of the as received (uncoated) samples ( When 0.2 The XRD patterns show a decrease of Fe peaks strength of all coated samples compared to that of the uncoated one ( The XPS survey scanning spectra indicate that the chemical composition of all coatings consisted of O, P, Ca and Fe, and also Ag for the Ag/CaP coatings ( The polarization test results indicate a shift toward the positive direction for corrosion potential ( There was nearly no difference in either weight gain nor weight loss for all samples after being immersed for 1 Although there was not as much degradation product and precipitates on the uncoated sample as on the coated ones, a number of outer precipitates, mainly clusters of white particles appeared on the degradation layer ( The Ag/CaP-c coated samples showed similar surface morphology after 1 The stability and the amount of Ag The uncoated samples showed a lower weight gain ( All the coated samples showed higher weight gain ( Finally, a higher compressive strength was observed on the coated samples when compared with that of the uncoated ones ( Based on the coating process and phase composition of the CaP and Ag/CaP coatings, the following reactions could have been taken place during the coating formation: CaP conversion coating process As compared with the CaP-based conversion coating process on magnesium alloys in our previous study [ Cathodic reactions [ The above reactions greatly increased the local pH and Fe Ag/CaP-c coating process When compared with Ca Ag/CaP-p coating process During the Ag post-treatment process, the incorporation of the Ag into the CaP coating is mainly dominated by ion exchange reaction with calcium ions [ In addition, a small amount of Ag As for other orthopedic implants, a stable bioactive bone–implant interface is required during the bone remodeling process. It is noticed that after immersion in MHS, the surface of uncoated samples has similar Ca and P content as in that of coated samples indicating a mineralization also occurred on the former. However, due to its higher degradation rate, the degradation product and mineralization layer easily fell off the substrate and a gap between the corrosion layer and the substrate is clearly visible ( The solution refreshment accelerated the degradation rate of the uncoated sample, but it helped the deposition of the mineralization layer ( It is regarded that the first several weeks after surgery is the period of high risk of microbial infection on the medical implants [ The porous structure of the iron foam has a similarity to that of human cancellous bone. It is generally accepted that the compressive strength of struts in cancellous bone is ~136 Additional features of surface bioactivity and antibacterial property have been developed onto pure iron foam by means of Ag containing calcium phosphate (Ag/CaP) coatings using a simple conversion coating method followed by a post-treatment method.
