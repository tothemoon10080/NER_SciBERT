Characterization of different phosphates and correlation of their computed unit cell dimensions with the type of ionic substitutions were conducted. Correlation of ASI with the a-axis of synthetic apatites showed two trends for carbonate apatite and for hydroxyapatite and fluoroapatite, signifying close correlation between their chemical reactivity, crystal dimensions and type of substitution. Natural phosphates proved to be apatitic, typically francolite. Higher correlation coefficients with an a-axis of natural apatites and their concentrates were established. The ASI increased linearly with a decrease in the length of the a-axis and an increase in the degree of carbonate substitution, which is the key factor in the chemical reactivity. Higher solubility of concentrates was attributed to physical and crystallographic reasons. Statistical correlation of agronomic measures with maize plants in alluvial soil with phosphates and neutral ammonium citrate solubility endorsed the interrelation between rock reactivity and agronomic response, exhibiting good correlations between greenhouse measures and solubility. The effectiveness of the Egyptian phosphates in supplying available phosphorus depended upon the degree of carbonate substitution and the physical characteristics of the ore. Consequently, correlation between physicochemical characteristics of different phosphates and their crystallographic structures could be correlated with their natural chemical reactivity as direct fertilizers.
