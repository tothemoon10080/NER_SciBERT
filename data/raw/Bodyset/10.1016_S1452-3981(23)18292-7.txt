The corrosion inhibition effect of extracts of kola plant and tobacco in mixed form on the protection of mild steel specimens immersed in acid chloride solution was studied at ambient temperature by gravimetric and potential monitoring methods. The electrode potential monitoring was performed using a digital voltmeter and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Extracts of kola plant and tobacco in different concentrations and combinations were used as ‘green’ inhibitors. There was significant reduction in the weight loss and in the corrosion rate of the test samples, particularly at the added extracts concentration of 100%. Some very good inhibitor efficiency values were obtained which suggested good corrosion inhibition performance of the added extracts at the concentrations used. Potential measurement values recorded showed in most cases, a reduction in active corrosion reactions for some combinations of the extracts. This behavior was attributed to the protective film provided on the steel’s surface by the complex chemical constituents of the plants extracts. The best corrosion inhibition performance for mild steel was obtained using the combined extracts of kola leaf and tobacco at100% concentration with an inhibitor efficiency of 91.27%. The combination of kola leaf, nut and tobacco at the same concentration was effective at an inhibitor efficiency of 82.78%.
