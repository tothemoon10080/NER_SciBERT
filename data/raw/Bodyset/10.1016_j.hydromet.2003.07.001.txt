The rate of alkaline decomposition of tetrathionate has been measured in nitrogen and air-saturated solutions of varying ionic strength and type of buffer. The rate increases significantly in high ionic strength buffer solutions and is not affected by oxygen. For gold-leaching solutions containing ammonia and ammonium ions, the decomposition of tetrathionate is faster than for carbonate- or phosphate-buffered solutions. These findings explain the discrepancies obtained in the previous studies of this reaction.Tetrathionate has been identified as a product of thiosulfate oxidation during gold leaching of ores using ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions pH=8.9 pH=11.5 pH=13 However, the kinetics and proposed mechanism published recently by The kinetics for the alkaline decomposition of tetrathionate determined by In this technical note, the decomposition of tetrathionate has been measured by the appearance of thiosulfate using a technique previously developed by the authors It should be noted that the solutions used by Zhang and Dreisinger (and in  In the leaching of gold ores using ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions, the solution pH is buffered by the ammonium/ammonia equilibrium shown in As shown above in In summary, the present technical note has shown that the alkaline decomposition of tetrathionate is dramatically affected by the ionic strength of the solution and type of buffer used. These findings are able to explain the discrepancies obtained in previous studies of this reaction. For gold leaching solutions containing ammonia and ammonium ions, the decomposition of tetrathionate is significantly faster than for carbonate- or phosphate-buffered solutions. Hence, it should be clear that care must be taken in choosing buffers to study such reactions.
