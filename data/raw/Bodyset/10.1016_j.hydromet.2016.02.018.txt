Innovative applications of dioctyl phthalate (DOP) as a synergist for the extraction of lithium chloride from saturated MgCl2 solutions were investigated using tributyl phosphate (TBP) as the extractant and FeCl3 as the co-extractant. The effects of solvent concentration, HCl concentration, phase ratio, Fe/Li molar ratio, and other factors on Li extraction were analyzed. The preliminary results demonstrated that a single-stage Li extraction efficiency of >90% was obtained with a low TBP concentration of 40% (V/V) and 20% (V/V) DOP without phase separation problems. A Li extraction efficiency of 99.5% was obtained via a three-stage simulation of countercurrent extraction. A study on the mechanism revealed that TBP and DOP molecules associated with the Fe-Li complex through hydrogen bonding. Compared with the traditional TBP–kerosene system, the proposed system prevented the formation of the third phase and significantly reduced the TBP concentration, resulting in less severe causticity to the equipment and reduced aqueous loss of TBP during the extraction process.Lithium is considered an important metal for the energy industry and is the lightest active metal, exhibiting wide industrial applications in lithium batteries ( The use of tributyl phosphate (TBP) as an extractant and (FeCl Using organic esters as modifiers can effectively alleviate phase separation problems and simultaneously increase the selectivity of Cu/Fe and the stability of oxime, the applications of which have become increasingly advanced in the process of copper extraction ( DOP, acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), and tri-n-butyl citrate (TBC) are widely used plasticizers with low to negligible solubility. The present study systematically investigated the extraction of Li from salt lake brine by adding these ester plasticizers into the TBP-sulfonated kerosene-FeCl Lithium chloride monohydrate (> The instruments used included the following: a strong shaker (SR-2 DW; TAITEC), a centrifuge (TDL-40B-W; Shanghai Anting Scientific Instrument Factory), inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (ICAP6500 DUO; America Thermo Scientific, USA), and a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrophotometer (670; Thermo Nicolet Corporation, Madison, USA). Li extraction was conducted by mixing different volumes of aqueous and organic phases in a 25 mL funnel with a PTFE stopcock. The mixture was mechanically shaken for 6 min to obtain equilibrium. Then, the organic phases were centrifuged. Approximately 5 mL of the organic phases were stripped with 10 mL 6 mol·L The hydrogen ion concentration in the aqueous phase was adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The concentration of HCl in the aqueous phases was determined using a 0.03 mol·L To determine the effect of solvent concentration on Li extraction efficiency, experiments were conducted by changing the synergist (DOP, ATBC, and TBC) and the extractant (TBP) at a volume ratio of 1:1 (synergist:extractant). The solvent volume concentration ranged from 30% to 80% (diluted in sulfonated kerosene). For example, a system with 30% solvent contained 15% synergist and 15% TBP by volume. As shown in The effect of the TBP/DOP ratio on Li extraction efficiency was evaluated by changing the TBP/DOP ratio (V/V) from 1/5 to 5/1 at a solvent concentration of 60% TBP/DOP. As shown in The Li/Mg separation factor initially increased and later decreased as the TBP/DOP ratio (V/V) increased, reaching a maximum at a TBP/DOP ratio of 1/1. From the data, it is inferred that Li extraction reached equilibrium with TBP at the TBP/DOP ratio of 1/1. When the TBP/DOP ratio continued to increase, excessive TBP led to extraction of Mg in the aqueous solution because of the high Mg concentration. Thus, the Mg concentration increased in the loaded organic phase, and the Li/Mg separation factor decreased. Therefore, appropriate DOP addition not only prevented the formation of the third phase but also improved the separation factor of Li over Mg. The coordination of DOP with Li The characteristics of the extraction reaction in this system are presented as follows: The distribution ratio, D  To determine a suitable concentration for the TBP extractant, experiments were conducted using different TBP concentrations in the organic phase. The TBP concentration ranged from 15% to 65% (V/V) in sulfonated kerosene. The DOP concentration was maintained at 20% (V/V). The solvents and feed solution were mixed in a phase ratio of 2/1 at an initial HCl concentration of 0.05 mol/L. The results of single-stage extraction experiments at different TBP concentrations are shown in Therefore, a TBP concentration of 40% (V/V) is suitable for the quantitative extraction of Li and its separation from Mg. To establish the equilibrium extraction time, Li extraction using 40% (V/V) TBP and 20% (V/V) DOP was performed at different organic-to-aqueous volume ratios. The initial concentration of Li ([Li] Optimization of the hydrochloric acid (HCl) concentration in aqueous solutions was necessary to prevent the hydrolysis of Fe The effect of the Fe/Li molar ratio on the extraction behavior was investigated using 60% TBP/DOP (2/1, V/V). The results are shown in  To determine the loading capacity of TBP/DOP for Li, experiments were conducted using 40% TBP (1.47 M) and 20% DOP (0.50 M) organic phases. Aqueous solutions with Li concentrations ranging from 0.49 g/L to 8.7 g/L (7.06 × 10 The effect of the Cl To determine the number of stages required at a chosen volume phase ratio, extraction isotherms were obtained with 40% (V/V) TBP and 20% (V/V) DOP in sulfonated kerosene using salt lake brines. The organic phases were equilibrated with the feed solution containing 2.604 g/L Li and 0.05 mol/L HCl at different phase ratios (O/A = 1/2 to O/A = 20/1) for 10 min, while the total volume of the phases was kept constant. The McCabe–Thiele plot ( The analysis of the raffinate and loaded organic phase is shown in The effect of the phase ratio (O/A) on the efficiency of stripping lithium from the lithium-loaded organic phase was examined. The phase ratio (O/A) changed from 1/2 to 30/1, whereas a HCl concentration of 6 M and a contact time of 6 min were maintained. The efficiency of lithium stripping as a function of the phase ratio is shown in Based on the extraction characteristics and mechanism analyses ( The apparent equilibrium constant K The distribution coefficient Therefore, Eq. and its log form is the following: Extraction experiments were conducted by varying the DOP volume concentration at a constant TBP volume concentration of 40% and varying the TBP volume concentration at a constant DOP volume concentration of 20% in sulfonated kerosene. The Fe(III) concentrations in the raffinates shown in The IR spectra of the TBP/DOP organic system consisting of 40% TBP and 20% DOP before and after extraction are shown in As shown in The inset in The 40% (V/V) TBP/20% (V/V) DOP extraction system with the optimal synergist DOP obtained an increased Li distribution ratio (4.6) and Li/Mg separation factor in a single-stage extraction. The same system also yielded increased Li extraction efficiencies (99.5%) for the three-stage countercurrent simulation extraction.
