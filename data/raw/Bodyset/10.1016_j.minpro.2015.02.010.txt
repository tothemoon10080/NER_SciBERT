Experimental studies of flotation of quartz particles, under various conditions and cells (setups), are presented. Pure and well-characterized quartz samples were treated with a commercial alkyl ether monoamine as flotation collector with bubbles in various sizes: coarse bubbles (400–800μm); nanobubbles (200–720nm); and their mixtures. The nanobubbles were generated by selective separation from microbubbles, which are formed together after depressurizing-cavitation of the saturated water in air (as in pressure flotation or dissolved air flotation), at 66.1psi saturation pressure. Flotation with single nanobubbles was not effective due to their very low lifting power or practically nil buoyancy. Yet, size-by-size flotation recoveries with coarse plus nanobubbles, compared with coarse bubbles, enhanced by 20–30 % the very fine quartz fractions by 20–30% (8–74μm; Sauter diameter—D32) and slightly lowered the recoveries of coarse particles (67–118μm; D32 diameter). Flotation of quartz samples (composites) having wide particle size distribution and results in a mechanical cell validated the overall recovery enhancement of the fines. Fine particle capture (nanobubbles enhanced the contact angle of quartz) and aggregation of the quartz ultrafines (proved with micrographs) by the nanobubbles are the main mechanisms responsible for the higher recoveries. The effect on flotation of the coarser quartz fractions, at bench scale, may be explained in terms of a reduced rising velocity of the coarse bubbles, in the presence of nanobubbles, decreasing the degree of bubble carryover. It is expected that the use of collector-coated nanobubbles (tailor-made “bubble-collectors” and flocculants) will broaden options in fine mineral flotation. The future sustainable forms (cheaply produced) of nanobubble generation on a large scale and their injection in cells are envisaged.Basic and applied research involving nanobubbles, namely generation forms, basic studies, and applications is, by far, one of the fastest growing areas nowadays ( Despite the literature on nanobubbles becoming vast, nanobubble interfacial properties and their applications in many areas, including ore flotation, are interesting areas to explore ( It is believed by a number of authors ( One of the major (and old) technical challenges in the area of mineral processing is the recovery of the fine (< Flotation devices, namely Jet (Jameson) flotation cell and “Microcel” type column, claim that a substantial amount of bubbles < In addition, a number of recent studies have reported some advantages in mineral flotation in the presence of nanobubbles ( The main claims are as follows: i. The nanobubbles would increase the contact angles and, subsequently, enhance the probability of flotation (coal, phosphates), mainly the bubble–particle attachment and stability ( The formation and separation (by splitting off from microbubbles) of a fraction of nanobubbles during depressurization of saturated air (66.1 This is a continuation of the work by Quartz powder was prepared from Brazilian quartz crystal rock by roll crushing (100% < Two different composite samples of quartz particles were prepared by blending all the previously separated fractions. Composite sample 1 had equivalent amounts of all fractions (20% of each fraction), and composite sample 2 was made up using different amounts of each fraction, as shown in Flotigam EDA 3B (Clariant®), a commercial flotation quartz collector that corresponds to an alkyl ether monoamine, with chemical formula R–O–(CH Here, coarse bubbles corresponded to bubbles generated by passing air through a fritted glass plate. The diameter of bubbles (measured photographically) varied between 0.4 and 0.8 The bubbles were generated by depressurizing air-saturated water solutions at a high flow velocity through a steel needle valve (2-mm internal diameter: Globo 012 — Santi®) into an empty glass column (50 The depressurization followed by cavitation occurred, and both micro- and nano-bubbles are generated. Thus, a procedure was carried out by simply leaving the microbubbles levitate and abandoning the glass column, for 3 The flotation of quartz was conducted with classified-sized fractions and with the composite samples, prepared by blending all the quartz fractions studied as described in Thus, flotation tests were carried out with different setups: Flotation with coarse bubbles in a Hallimond tube; Flotation in a Hallimond tube with coarse and nanobubbles; and Flotation in a Denver type cell with and without injection of nanobubbles. The flotation tests were performed in a 0.2-L capacity typically modified Hallimond tube with 270-mm height and 18-mm inner diameter ( The procedure ( The bench-scale flotation experiments were performed using a 2 In the tests conducted with nanobubbles, a nanobubble bearing aqueous dispersion was previously prepared by depressurization (P All flotation tests were executed in duplicates at room temperature (297 Quartz (rock crystal) mineral particles were chosen due to their high purity and because they were easily obtained. These particles were carefully manually broken in an agate mortar, and two particles (approximately 0.5-cm long) were selected for the studies.  The experimental setup consisted of a system injecting the saturated water with air through a needle valve into a flat acrylic cell and a stereomicroscope (Zeiss Stemi SV11) coupled to a digital camera (Sony NEX-3). The cross-section of the flat cell was rectangular and 1.5 Optical microphotographs of hydrophobic (with 1 The rising velocity of bubbles generated in the Hallimond tube fritted glass was measured by monitoring the time taken by a cloud of bubbles to surpass a certain distance (10 The first finding is that no flotation was attained with the nanobubbles alone. This was already expected because of the extremely low lifting power of the minute bubbles and insignificant buoyancy in water (     The results obtained may be explained by various mechanisms that appear to be operating simultaneously. Most important is the role in enhancing quartz contact angle and aggregation of the fines/ultrafines. Thus, quartz recoveries, assisted with nanobubbles, appear to be a result of the following phenomena: Adsorption of amine molecules onto quartz particles, with the polar head toward the surface (electrostatic interaction), turning particles hydrophobic; Adsorption of amine molecules onto the nanobubbles by the hydrophobic tails surrounding the bubbles (hydrophobic interaction). Here, bubbles become charged, depending on pH and adsorption density ( Adhesion of the coated bubbles with amines onto the coarser bubbles: The nanobubbles may adhere ( The contact angle at the quartz/bubble interface increased as a result of adhesion of the collector-coated quartz particles with nanobubbles; Adhesion of nanobubbles (coated or not with amine molecules) onto coarser bubbles; The nanobubbles, jointly with amine, reduce the coarse bubble size and decrease the rising velocity of these bubbles; and Aggregation of hydrophobic quartz particles and flotation of the aggregates by the consortium nanobubble–coarse bubbles.    Regarding the entrainment of quartz by rising bubbles (hydrodynamic carryover), this should follow the lifting capacity of the nano-coarse bubble units. The injection of small bubbles appears to be an interesting alternative, and many scientific articles have proved that fine particle capture (magnitude and kinetic) is enhanced in the presence of microbubbles, nanobubbles, or both. Here, similar to recent articles, the injection of nanobubbles (200–720 The authors would like to thank all the Brazilian Institutes supporting this research, namely
