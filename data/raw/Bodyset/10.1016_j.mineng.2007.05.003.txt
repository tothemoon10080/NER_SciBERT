The reverse flotation separation of kaolinite and diaspore has been achieved by using the collector dodecylamine (DDA) and depressant cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) at pH 5.5–8.5. The flotation results have been explained by adsorption measurement, solution chemistry and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At pH 5.5–8.5, the main components at the diaspore/water interface are

The absorption of CPAM on all the crystal planes of diaspore prevented the majority of DDA cationic species from adsorbing on the diaspore surface, and thus, depressed diaspore flotation. The adsorption ability of the CPAM cation group on the negatively charged sites on the kaolinite surface was weakened by the inductive and steric effect of methyl in CH2N+(CH3)3 groups, which made CPAM have a insignificant effect on the adsorption of DDA on the kaolinite surface and its cation flotation.China has about 2500 million tonnes of bauxite reserves, and more than 98% of the bauxite is of the diasporic type ( Froth flotation is one of the most widely used processes for beneficiation ores containing valuable minerals. It is especially useful for separating finely ground valuable minerals from the associated gangue or for separating valuable minerals from one another. For diaspore bauxites, flotation is applied to obtain high quality material for Bayer Technology by increasing the Al Direct flotation has been shown to be an efficient method for the desilicating of diasporic bauxite ( In this paper, the reverse flotation separation of kaolinite and diaspore has been investigated by single and artificial mixed-mineral flotation tests in the presence of DDA and CPAM. Adsorption measurement, solution chemistry and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also adopted for further study on the interaction of the reagents and minerals. Handpicked diaspore was obtained from Mianchi Bauxites, Henan Province in China. Kaolinite was obtained from the geological museum of China. They were 92% in purity by mineralogical analysis, chemical analysis, and X-ray diffraction. Diaspore and kaolinite were ground in porcelain to pass 0.076 Dodecylamine (DDA) of analytical quality was used as a collector. Solutions of HCl and NaOH were used to adjust the pH of the system. Cationic polyacrylamides, of molecular weight ∼1.1 Mineral particles (3 The concentration of DDA in solution was measured by UV–vis spectrum using a UV-3000 spectrometer (Japanese). All calculations were made using the Gaussian03 (  To increase the differential flotation of kaolinite and diaspore, CPAMs were selected as depressants of diaspore. The results are given in The flotation results of diaspore and kaolinite at different pH values in the presence of collector DDA and regulator DA-5 are shown in Based on the flotation results of the single mineral tests, artificially mixed minerals (a diaspore to kaolinite mass ratio of 1) were adopted to further investigate the depressing effect of DA-5 on diaspore. The flotation results are presented in The adsorption of DDA on the surfaces of diaspore and kaolinite in the absence or presence of DA-5 is shown in To better understand the interaction of CPAM with diaspore and kaolinite, the dissolution equilibria of diaspore and kaolinite were studied. The equilibrium constants and solubilities of diaspore and kaolinite from the literature are listed in To distinguish more distinctly the composition and concentration of aqueous Al species in diaspore solution, the molar ratio The expression of molar ratio For example, the molar ratio of Al(OH) The effect of pH on the molar ratio of dissolved cationic and anionic ion species of diaspore is shown in  Equilibrium constants, as well as solubility of DDA, are listed in The optimized geometries used in the DFT calculation of DDA cation, CPAM-amide group and CPAM- cation group are shown in  The crystal structure of diaspore [a-AlO(OH)] consists of hexagonal close-packed oxygen sheets with aluminum atoms filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstice sites ( Kaolinite [Al DDA was mainly present in the form of At pH below 5.5, the The structure of a kaolinite sheet is composed of one silica tetrahedral layer and one aluminum octahedral layer. The silica tetrahedral is slightly hydrophobic (similar to talc) due to the absence of hydrogen bonding sites at the surface. On the other hand, the hydroxyl groups at the aluminum octahedral surface layer are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the head group of DDA. At low pH, the apex oxygen atoms in the silica tetrahedral are hydrolyzed and form dangling OH groups, and naked O anions at the surface, therefore providing extra hydrogen bonding sites, consequently the adsorption of DDA is increased, leading to better recovery. As pH increases, the amount of extra hydrogen bonding sites decreases accordingly, thus recovery decreases. CPAM polymers have two kinds of functional groups in their molecules. One is the CPAM-cation group On the tetrahedral silicate layers of kaolinite, there are many Si The The reverse flotation separation of kaolinite and diaspore was achieved at pH 5.5–8.5 by using dodecylamine as a collector and cationic polyacrylamide as a depressant. At pH 5.5–8.5, DDA was mainly in the form of The CPAM polymer had two kinds of functional groups in its molecule. One was the CPAM-cation group Compared with the DDA cation species, the adsorption ability of the CPAM cation group on negatively charged kaolinite surfaces was weakened by the inductive and steric effects of methyl in CPAM-cation group, which made CPAM have little effect on the adsorption of the DDA cation on the kaolinite surface. At pH 5.5–8.5, the main compositions in the diaspore/water interface are The authors thank the Chinese Important Basic Research Program (2005CB623701) for the financial support of this research.
