This chapter examines the main strategies of copper recycling and their industrial practice in treating scrap. It focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Copper scrap is smelted in primary and secondary smelters. Primary smelters mainly smelt concentrate but are well-adapted to smelting all grades of scrap. Smelters with isasmelt, Mitsubishi, Noranda, reverberatory, and top blown rotary converter smelting furnaces are particularly effective. Scrap is also recycled to the converters in primary smelters. The heat from the converter's exothermic iron and sulfur oxidation reactions are useful for melting scrap. Secondary scrap smelters use blast furnaces, top blown rotary converters, and electric furnaces for smelting low-copper grade scrap. The main smelting product is molten black copper, which is converted to rough copper, then fire refined, and cast into anodes. Secondary copper refining is similar to primary copper refining. Since the scrap might contain more impurities than concentrates, larger electrolyte purification and slime treatment facilities may be required. Scrap recycling slows the depletion rate of the Earth's copper resources. It also avoids energy expenditure in mining and milling. The chapter provides the flowsheet for secondary scrap smelting/refining.
