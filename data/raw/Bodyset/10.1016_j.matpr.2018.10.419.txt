High-strength aluminum alloys are promising materials for automotive structural parts since they offer a great potential to reduce vehicle weight and greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, 7000-series aluminum alloys recently became object of many investigations. However, one major drawback of these alloys is their poor corrosion behavior, which is a crucial aspect and currently limits its application in automotive industry. One approach to influence this factor, without changing the alloying system, is the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process. Within this contribution, a multilayered material consisting of discrete layers of AA7075 and AA1050 will be manufactured via ARB. The influence of the ARB process on the resulting mechanical properties of the multilayered material will be evaluated applying tensile tests and it will be compared with the initial condition of both single layered materials. Furthermore, the effect of the combination of these two aluminum materials on the corrosion behavior will be investigated
