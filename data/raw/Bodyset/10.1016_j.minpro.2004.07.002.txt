A grinding rate of a gibbsite powder sample was examined by using a planetary ball mill and it was well correlated with the specific impact energy, which was calculated by Discrete Element Method (DEM). This implies a fact showing the confidence of the simulation result. Based on this result, an optimum rotation-to-revolution speed ratio and rotational direction of the pot to the revolution disk were investigated by the simulation work. A significant large specific impact energy is obtained when the mill pot is rotated at around the critical speed ratio in the counter direction to the disk revolution at around the critical speed ratio.A planetary ball mill is known to install pots on a disk, and both are rotated simultaneously and separately at high speed. Such high-speed rotation of both the pot and the disk makes the balls to move strongly and violently, leading to large impact energy of balls that improves grinding performance. This mill has been used not only grinding but also mechanical alloying (MA) ( In order to comprehend the grinding as well as MA and MC phenomena and to provide the general law of scale-up for a planetary ball mill, several investigations have been made from the viewpoint of the experimental and mathematical analyses ( In this paper, firstly, confidential results of the simulation work were confirmed in correlation with an experimental work regarding the effect of the rotation-to-revolution speed ratio on the grinding performance using a gibbsite sample ground by three kinds of planetary mill. Based on this result, simulation results on the optimum rotation-to-revolution speed ratio and their directions were discussed. Grinding devices used in this work were three kinds of planetary ball mill: Pulverisette-7 (Fritsch GmbH, Germany), Pulverisette-5 (Fritsch GmbH, Germany) and PM-1200 (Seishin Enterprise Co., Ltd., Japan). Each mill is designed by fixing a rotational-to-revolution speed ratio [ The ground samples were characterized by using a laser diffraction particle size distribution analyzer (Laser Micronsizer, LMS-30, Seishin Enterprise Co., Ltd., Japan). Each median diameter of the ground sample at arbitrary times [ The computer simulation of ball motion used in this work was based on DEM which is one of the most popular and reliable methods for simulating solid particle behavior. The colliding velocity and interactive force of a ball against another ball and/or the mill pot wall can be calculated from this method, so that the ball motion during grinding can be reproduced precisely. The authors have applied it to describe the three-dimensional motion of the grinding media in the mills loaded with the sample powder ( The specific impact energy of balls [   The specific impact energy of balls,  According to the ball motion in the figure, the motion shifts from cascading ((a) This critical speed ratio [  A planetary ball mill used in this section was the same as previous section. The mill was driven in both the normal and counter directions to the revolution of the disk.   The present work has showed firstly the effect of the rotation-to-revolution speed ratio on the grinding rate of a gibbsite sample using three different scales of planetary mill. The grinding rate was correlated with the specific impact energy of balls simulated by the DEM. Secondly, the optimum rotation-to-revolution speed ratio and its direction of the pot to the disk were discussed on the basis of the simulation results. The followings are the summary of this work. The grinding rate is well correlated with the specific impact energy This implies that the computer simulation in the present work shows a confidential fact for the grinding performance. The optimum rotation-to-revolution speed ratio is estimated by the computer simulation and Eq. The counter rotational direction of the pot to the disk is effective for improving the grinding performance rather than the normal rotational direction. ball diameter [mm] pot diameter [mm] specific impact energy of balls [J/(s.g.)] centrifugal force of rotation [N] centrifugal force of revolution [N] pot depth [mm] grinding rate [s grinding resistance [g/J] distance from the rotating shaft to the centroid of ball that contacts with the mill wall (= mass of a ball [g] rotation speed of the pot [rpm] revolution speed of the disk [rpm] number of collision of balls within a second [s number of balls charged in the pot [–] revolution radius [mm] rotation-to-revolution speed ratio (= critical ratio of rotation-to-revolution speed [–] grinding time [s] simulation time [s] pot volume [cm relative speed of balls on collision [m/s] sample weight charged in the pot [g] frictional coefficient [–] density of ball [g/cm angular velocity of revolution [rad/s] angular velocity of rotation [rad/s]
