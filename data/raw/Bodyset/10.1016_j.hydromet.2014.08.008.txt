In the present research work, dissolution kinetics of natural magnesite is carried out using formic acid as a leaching agent. The effect of various reaction parameters such as temperature, acidic solution concentration, particle size and liquid to solid ratio was studied regarding the leaching kinetics of natural magnesite. The findings show that the dissolution process is controlled by the chemical reaction (intrinsic) at the liquid-solid interface;

                  The apparent activation energy of the leaching process of magnesite with the formic acid was found to be 42.08 kJ mol−1 over the reaction temperature range of 318 to 348K.Magnesium, the 6th most common element, does not occur freely in nature because of its high reactivity. It is abundant in magnesite, periclase, asbestos, meerschaum, serpentine, talc and epsomite ( A wide range of studies have been reported on leaching and dissolution kinetics of rocks with a variety of leaching agents ( From leaching investigations of naturally occurring magnesite materials in acetic acid, gluconic acid, citric acid and lactic acid solutions, it was found that leaching kinetics were driven by chemically controlled mechanisms ( Magnesite ore deposits are found abundantly in the Khuzdar areas of Balochistan (Pakistan). The Khuzdar area consists of a number of Kraubath type magnesite deposits associated with alpine type bela ophiolite dating from the cretaceous period ( Therefore, the current research work was intended to investigate the leaching reaction kinetics of the indigenous magnesite ore by formic acid. The product formed (magnesium formate) can be used in animal feed formulations and in general chemical applications ( Samples of magnesite involved in the current study were collected from the Khuzdar area in the province of Balochistan (Pakistan). Samples were ground in a ball mill followed by a mortar grinder. Different size fractions (500–707, 250–354, 177–210 and 125–177 Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi-1800) was used for the determination of Mg in natural magnesite samples. Scanning electron microscope (JEOL JED-2300) was used to observe the particle morphology of raw magnesite. Leaching studies of magnesite samples were investigated in a reactor made up of glass with 500 To find loss on ignition, magnesite rock samples were heated to 950 Chemical reactions occurring in the reaction vessel containing magnesite and formic acid solution is represented as:(a) Formic acid ionization The ionization constant of formic acid is p The reaction temperature was varied from 45 In order to find the influence of concentration of formic acid on the leaching of magnesite, the concentration of formic acid was varied from 2% to 10% at a temperature of 65 Various experiments were performed to probe the particle size impact. The leaching kinetics of magnesite were performed using 4 sample sizes (500–707, 250–354, 177–210 and 125–177 Hydrometallurgical processes usually involve solid–liquid reaction systems. In solid–liquid reactions, the leaching kinetics is governed ( Diffusion from fluid films Ash to product layer Chemically controlled reactions The outcome was examined from the shrinking core model to evaluate the rate-determining step and reaction conditions affecting leaching kinetics of magnesite. On these grounds, a general reaction of solid with fluid can be expressed as: Only two controlling mechanisms (diffusion from fluid films or chemically controlled reaction) may be considered during the reaction if no ash/product layer is produced. If the conversion fraction of natural magnesite is For the film diffusion controlling mechanism, For the chemically controlled reaction, For the ash layer diffusion controlled, Statistical and graphical methods were applied to test the soundness of the experimental data. It was inferred that the experimental results for the dissolution reaction of magnesite follow a surface chemical reaction. The integral rate for the surface chemical reaction can be expressed as: Using the conversion values for various reaction temperatures, the apparent rate constant In Eq. The value of activation energy (42.08 In order to find the validation of the kinetic model (Eq.  Organic acids can be used as attractive solvents for selective leaching and beneficiation studies for various rocks as these acids have some advantages over the mineral acids. The results indicate that formic acid can be employed as a solvent for leaching of magnesite. A formic acid concentration of 8% with a liquid/solid ratio of 14:1 The kinetic data analyzed on the basis of different reaction kinetic models illustrates that the dissolution process of natural magnesite in formic acid is controlled by surface chemical reaction. The energy of activation of the leaching reaction is 42.08 In the dissolution reaction of magnesite in formic acid solution, the reaction product formed (magnesium formate) can be used in various animal feed formulations as well as in various more general chemical applications.  activation energy (J reaction time (min) reaction temperature (K) energy-dispersive X-ray analysis scanning electron microscope atomic absorption spectrophotometer The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and improvement to the manuscript.
