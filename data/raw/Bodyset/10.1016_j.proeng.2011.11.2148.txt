In order to provide scientific basis for the forecast of coal spontaneous combustion in the early stage, the concentration of significant gases released by the 2-2 coal samples of Shendong mine in different temperatures, i.e. CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and C3H8 etc., were measured by temperature programmed oxidation(TPO). The results show CO can be regarded as the main significant gas of spontaneous combustion of 2-2 coal sample, assisted by C2H6, C3H8, C2H4, C2H2, to conclude the condition of coal spontaneous combustion. If CO is detected, showing coal has oxidized, subsequently, if C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, and C2H2 are detected in turn, showing the temperature of coal has reached 90째C, 100째C, 110째C and above180째C respectively.
