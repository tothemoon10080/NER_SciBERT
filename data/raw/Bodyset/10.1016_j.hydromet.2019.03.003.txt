The influence of sulfate versus chloride media on the adsorption of rare earth elements (REE) by strong acid and iminodiacetic acid resins was investigated. For the strong acid resin, Lewatit MonoPlus SP 112, the adsorption constants recorded for La, Sm and Er from MgSO4 solution were much lower compared to the values recorded from MgCl2 solution. The adsorption isotherms constructed for Sm from 0.5 M MgSO4 and 0.5 M MgCl2 solution also showed a substantial decrease in the equilibrium resin capacity that could be attained from sulfate solution. In addition, it was determined that the extraction strength of Sm from 0.5 M MgSO4 solution was unaffected by a change in solution pH from 1 to 3, despite the significant change in the aqueous speciation of SO4
                     2− and Sm3+ over this range. For the iminodiacetic acid resin, Purolite S930Plus, a similarly large decrease in the La adsorption constants was recorded from MgSO4 solution compared to MgCl2 solution which resulted in a large shift in the extraction curve to higher pH (pH50 = 1.9 in 1 M MgCl2 solution and 2.8 in 1 M MgSO4 solution). For both resins the decreased adsorption strength of the REE in sulfate solution also resulted in a decreased selectivity for the REE over key impurity ions. For instance the selectivity of the strong acid resin for Sm over Al was more than halved in MgSO4 versus MgCl2 solution, whereas the selectivity of the iminodiacetic acid resin for La over Mg decreased by an order of magnitude in MgSO4 versus MgCl2 solution (pH 4).The rare earth elements (REE) are essential to many modern technologies such as phosphors for lighting and displays, permanent magnets for electric motors and generators, and battery and fuel cell technology ( Ion exchange is a versatile technology with proven efficacy in hydrometallurgical applications for metal recovery ( In the recovery of REE from alternative resources the solutions produced are predominantly acidic sulfate media. However, no previous studies have looked at how sulfate ions may affect the recovery of REE by cation exchange materials, despite some available evidence indicating that the impact of sulfate ions may be significant. For instance, the formation constants for the REE-sulfate complexes are appreciable (logK The first part of this work investigates the impact of sulfate ions on the ion exchange of the REE, as well as the common impurity ions Fe(III) and Al, by the strong acid resin Lewatit MonoPlus SP 112. Strong acid resins display many favourable properties for the recovery of REE values from aqueous solutions including a high exchange capacity, fast exchange kinetics, high adsorption strength for the REE and a high selectivity over monovalent and divalent cation impurities ( The second part of this work investigates the impact of sulfate ions on the ion exchange of REE by the chelating iminodiacetic acid resin Purolite S930Plus. Iminodiacetic acid resins are effective adsorbents for REE from solutions that have a low acidity (pH > 2), from which problematic impurity ions such as Al and Fe(III) have been removed (note, iminodiacetic acid resins display a similar adsorption strength towards the REE and Al while Fe(III) is adsorbed in preference to the REE) ( The chemical reagents MgCl For experiments investigating the impact of MgCl For experiments investigating the extraction of La versus pH with the iminodiacetic acid resin, Purolite S930Plus, stock solutions containing 0.8 mM La in HCl (pH 1) and 1 M MgCl Element concentrations of solutions were measured before and after contact and the ion exchange mass balance was determined by analysis of the strip solutions. Elemental concentrations were determined by ICP-MS (Perkin-Elmer Elan 9000, for La, Sm and Er) or by ICP-OES (Perkin-Elmer Optima 5300DV, for Al and Fe). All adsorption models were fitted by performing a least squares regression between the modelled and experimental data. Speciation modelling was performed using The Geochemists Workbench software. The impact of sulfate ions on the ion exchange of La, Sm, Er, Fe(III) and Al by the strong acid Lewatit MonoPlus SP 112 resin was investigated by comparing the percent extraction obtained from MgCl In these equations R denotes the resin functional groups and R It is apparent from comparison of The impact of anions on the adsorption of metal cations by ion exchange materials has been investigated previously.( For all metals considered in this study, the formation constants for sulfate coordination (logK To confirm that anion complexed species such as MCl To isolate the impact of sulfate ions from other variables that may affect the adsorption process, the extraction of REE, Fe(III) and Al was performed from solutions of fixed pH (2.0) and fixed Mg concentrations (0.5 M MgX, where X = Cl First, it can be seen from A consequence of the smaller sulfate weighting factors for Fe(III) and Al versus the REE is a decrease in the separation factors between the impurity metals and the REE as sulfate concentration increases. This has been illustrated in The above results clearly demonstrate that sulfate ions have a significant impact on the extraction of the REE. For example, the percent extraction of Sm decreased from 89% in 0.5 M MgCl Because the sulfate ion is weakly basic (i.e. the pK To understand why no change in Sm extraction was observed from MgSO Iminodiacetic acid resins such as Purolite S930Plus are effective adsorbents for the REE only from solutions that have a low acidity (pH > 2). High solution pH is also necessary to minimise the concentrations of Al and Fe(III) impurities; Al displays similar adsorption properties to the REE and Fe(III) is adsorbed in preference to the REE on iminodiacetic acid resins.( To determine the impact of sulfate ions on REE adsorption by Purolite S930Plus, La was chosen as a representative example. Other REE were not included as previous studies have demonstrated very little difference in the adsorption properties between the REE using iminodiacetic acid resins.(  To explain this observation it is necessary to understand that in the presence of high Mg concentrations the ion exchange of La for H In order to correctly model the data shown in The La adsorption constants obtained from 1 M Mg solution decrease considerably as the sulfate concentration increases; that is logK To investigate how the sulfate ion impacts the performance of the iminodiacetic acid resin in practice, the loading isotherms for La were determined from 1 M MgCl This work highlights the negative effect that sulfate ions can have on the adsorption of REE by both strong acid cation exchange resins and iminodiacetic acid chelating resins. For the strong acid resin, a substantial decrease in the REE adsorption constants (versus Mg) was recorded from MgSO For the iminodiacetic acid resin, the adsorption constant obtained for La (versus H This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
