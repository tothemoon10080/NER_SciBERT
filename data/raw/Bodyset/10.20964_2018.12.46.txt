The present paper proposes a simple analysis method to measure cathode material contents in Lithium-ion batteries. The total amount of nickel, cobalt and manganese was firstly determined by the EDTA titration method. Then, a dual wavelength method was used to determine the respective contents of nickel and cobalt, and finally the remained content of manganese was determined by subtraction. The standard deviation of this new method is about 1Ã—10-4, and the relative standard deviation is about 0.5%, which is much lower than the traditional inductively coupled plasma method (ICP) (10-3 and 4.3%, respectively). Therefore, this newly proposed method is a more convenient, quick and accurate for analysis of ternary cathode materials of Lithium-ion batteries in industrial production.
