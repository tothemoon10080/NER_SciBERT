This paper discussed the injury mechanism and management of a patient who had concomitant ipsilateral hip and knee dislocations and contralateral open leg fracture.
                  A 32-year-old man presented with ipsilateral fracture-dislocations of the left hip (Pipkin's type IV) and knee (Moore II) joints and contralateral open fracture of the leg bones after a car accident. After emergency resuscitative measures, the hip joint was reduced and Pipkin's fracture was fixed using Ganz approach with lag screws; knee joint was reduced closely and tibial plateau fracture was stabilized with lateral buttress plate and a transarticular spanning fixator. The open fracture on the other leg was de-brided and fixed with an external fixator. There was no instability in both joints after fixation when he was examined under anesthesia. The fractures united after 3 months and the patient had no residual instability of hip and knee. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of osteonecrosis in the hip joint after 6 months. At one-year follow-up, he had satisfactory functional outcome with almost normal range of motion at both joints.
                  Ipsilateral hip and knee dislocations are rare injuries and more caution is needed for early diagnosis. A timely appropriate intervention can provide good functional outcome to the patient in this situation.
