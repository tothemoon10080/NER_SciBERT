Experiments confirmed that the homogeneous co-precipitation of impurities As, Sb and Bi in a copper electrolyte can be obviously improved under certain conditions. In commercial copper electrorefining operation, by improving the homogeneous co-precipitation, the percentages of the impurities As, Sb and Bi dissolved from the copper anode and then deposited into the anode slimes were increased from 17.6%, 49.4% and 36.5% to 69.3%, 93.0% and 68.1% respectively. It was found that there are two control-steps in the homogeneous co-precipitation, namely oxidation of antimony from Sb(III) to Sb(V) and the formation of arsenato antimonates. When the arsenic concentration is over 7g/L in the copper electrolyte, the rate of oxidation of antimony from Sb(III) to Sb(V) can be increased markedly, which results in the faster formation of arsenato antimonates provided that the mole ratio of Sb/As/Bi in the anode is suitable for arsenato antimonates formation. Moreover, to properly understand the homogeneous co-precipitation, the compounds contained in copper anode slimes were classified according to their formations.In copper electrorefining, the impurities of arsenic, antimony and bismuth are dissolved with copper from the anode to the electrolyte. If no electrolyte were eliminated from the electrorefining circuit, the impurities would gradually accumulate in the electrolyte, which would result in a variety of intolerable problems such as contamination of the cathodes and passivation of the anodes. In order to assure the cathode quality, the electrolyte must be bled and treated â€” typically using the conventional purification scheme shown in Therefore, a number of methods have been proposed for the purification of the copper electrolyte, such as with stannic acid ( It is well known that a part of the impurities arsenic, antimony and bismuth dissolved from the anode can spontaneously precipitate from the electrolyte to the anode slimes during copper electrorefining and the volume of the copper electrolyte withdrawn to be purified per ton cathode (VPTC) is diverse in different copper refineries. Even in the same refinery with the same anode, the VPTC is not the same under different electrorefining conditions ( Recently, it was found that the combination of As(V) and Sb(V) can form arsenato antimonic acid (AAAc) ( To confirm the homogeneous co-precipitation of arsenic, antimony and bismuth impurities in the copper electrolyte, the test were first performed in the copper electrorefining system containing 50 cells with about 500 The high-arsenic solution was gradually added to increase the arsenic concentration in the electrolyte, which contained the basic components: 47.5 During the test, the composition of the electrolyte was analyzed every day to observe the change of impurities As, Sb and Bi. The total content of the elements was determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) (PS-6 PLASMA SPECTROVAC, BAIRD, USA). The valence of the elements was determined by standard chemical methods.  It is well known that antimony and arsenic dissolve electrochemically from copper anodes as trivalent ions and then oxidize to pentavalent ions by the air (O When As(III) was oxidized to a certain extent, the oxidation of Sb(III) took place and the rate of formation of arsenato antimonates was increased above their rate of dissolution from the anode. Thus the concentrations of antimony and bismuth decreased until a new balance between the dissolution and the precipitation was established in the electrolyte. This indicates that there are two control-steps; namely antimony oxidation from Sb(III) to Sb(V) and the subsequent formation of arsenato antimonates which can be expressed as follows (  The method was then applied in the commercial operation system of 150,000 To properly understand the homogeneous co-precipitation mechanism in the copper electrolyte, the classification of arsenic, antimony and bismuth in copper anode slimes is necessary. In copper anode slimes, arsenic, antimony and bismuth and other impurities are found in many compounds ( It has been well documented that Sb(V) plays a substantial role in the formation of floating slimes ( Although As Commercial tests confirmed that the homogeneous co-precipitation of arsenic, antimony and bismuth impurities in the copper electrolyte can be remarkably improved by addition of a high-arsenic solution provided that sufficient antimony is present. For copper electrolyte purification, the most economical, simple and convenient way is to form arsenato antimonates in the presence of sufficient Sb(V) whilst maintaining an arsenic concentration above 7 The authors acknowledge financial support from the
