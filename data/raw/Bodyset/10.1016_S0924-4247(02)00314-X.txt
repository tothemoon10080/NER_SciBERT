Room and elevated temperature tensile, creep and high-cycle fatigue properties of electrodeposited LIGA Ni microsamples have been measured and are being used to predict the reliability of LIGA Ni MEMS structures. Tensile specimens with dimensions of hundreds of microns have been LIGA fabricated and characterized in terms of their underlying microstructure, elevated temperature tensile and creep strength and their high-cycle fatigue performance. The stiffness of these LIGA Ni structures was found to be reduced by the introduction of porosity during the plating process. The strength of these structures was observed to decrease dramatically at temperatures above 200°C. At stresses significantly below the yield strength, substantial creep deformation was observed at moderately elevated temperatures. The fatigue life of the LIGA Ni microsamples increased with decreasing stress amplitude in a manner comparable to what has been reported for wrought Ni. An apparent fatigue limit was observed for the LIGA Ni microsamples, but the importance of underlying microstructure and component geometry on the fatigue life was also highlighted.LIGA (an acronym from the German words for lithography, electroplating, and molding) is a micromachining technology used to produce microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) made from metals, ceramics, or plastics The room temperature tensile behavior of LIGA Ni structures have been characterized in a growing number of studies (see for example Dog-bone shape microsamples were prepared using the LIGA process at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD). The microsamples were electrodeposited into PMMA molds using a commercially available Ni-sulfamate solution operated at a pH of 3.5–4, a bath temperature of 55 Tensile tests were conducted using the microsample tensile machine and non-contact interferometric strain displacement gage (ISDG) first introduced by Sharpe A typical stress–strain curve of the room temperature tensile behavior of the LIGA Ni microsamples tested in this study is shown in As shown in The elevated temperature tensile curves are shown in Creep tests have also been conducted at temperatures ranging from 265 to 400  The SEM micrograph in the middle of This effort was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Material Command, USAF, under agreement number F30602-99-2-0553.
