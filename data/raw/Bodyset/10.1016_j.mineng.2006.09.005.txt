This special issue deals essentially with the physical processing of ores and minerals, from their comminution, to separation by magnetic, electrical and gravity techniques. The papers have been selected from those presented at three conferences, held in Perth, Western Australia, from March 12th to 17th 2006.   Twenty-nine papers from the conferences were published in draft form on Proceedings CD-ROMs, which are available via the conference web-sites, and authors were invited to submit their final papers for peer-review after the conference. Those accepted are published in this special issue.
