The objective of this work was to understand the origin of the stresses and the nature of the grinding mechanisms in a high-shear ball mill. The ball mill used was a Dynomill and the grinding media consisted of zirconium oxide beads. The ground powder was a poorly water soluble product. The particle size distribution was analyzed with laser diffraction.
                  A population balance model enabled to calculate the breakage function from the experimental data. The breaking parameters were used to determine the grinding mechanism at different grinding conditions. The grinding mechanism depends on the orientation and intensity of the forces applied on the particles. The grinding mechanisms were determined from the grinding experiments and correlated to the movement of the grinding media in the grinding chamber and the applied mechanical stresses.
                  The observed grinding mechanisms are cleavage and some fracture for coarse particles

                  The grinding mechanisms are related to the movement of the grinding media in the grinding chamber. Cleavage and abrasion of particles are the result of compression forces and shear in the centrifuged packed bed of grinding beads. The grinding mechanism does not change when changing the operating conditions and the packed bed of media is similar in the studied ranges of operating conditions.The latest research in grinding focuses among others on the development of models to predict the grinding behavior of particles ( The present work uses PBM for further investigations of the grinding behavior of particles using a ball mill (Dynomill, Bachofen AG, Switzerland). The grinding mechanism depends on the material properties of the product, such as particle strength and size, and on the orientation and intensity of the forces exerted onto the particles. The forces result from the movement of grinding media in the grinding chamber. The grinding mechanisms are determined from the grinding experiments and correlated to the movement of the grinding media in the grinding chamber and the applied mechanical stresses. The objective is to understand the origin of the stresses and the nature of the grinding mechanisms in a high-shear stirred ball mill. This study concentrates on a single product that is a poorly water soluble compound. The nature and intensity of the applied stresses on the particles affect the particle size reduction process. In comminution the following three main breakage mechanisms have been identified ( Abrasion occurs when stress is applied on particles along the tangential axis (shear). Particle breakage in this cases gives a bimodal particle size distribution comprising fine particles that are released from the surface of the initial particle and particles with a size close to that the initial particles. Cleavage of particles occurs when intense stresses are slowly applied on a particle (compression). This produces fragments of sizes 50–80 Fracture occurs through rapidly applying intense stresses (impact). The particle size distribution in this case will range between 20 and 70 The particle size distribution as function of time provides information on the evolution of all particles and fragments during the grinding process. The breakage mechanisms can be determined from the particle size evolution by determining the probability for formation of fragments with a specific size after breakage of the initial particle. Besides this method other methods have been described in literature for determination of the particle breakage behavior. In order to obtain a precise description of the grinding process both the qualitative analysis of experimental data and the non-cumulative breakage function have been applied in this work. All three main breakage mechanisms have been used to describe the breakage behavior of particles from different size classes. Experiments were carried out using a Dynomill from Bachofen AG (Basel, Switzerland) to study particle breakage mechanisms. The ball mill was operated in a recirculation mode. The ground product is a suspension of poorly water soluble organic powder in water. Samples were taken from the stirred vessel at different times during grinding. The particle size distributions of the samples were measured with a laser diffraction particle size analyser (LS230 equipment from Beckman Coulter) ( As discussed in the previous paragraph the probabilities for formation of particles with a certain size after breakage of an initial particle need to be calculated. Population balances are used to calculate these probabilities from the experimental data. The quantity of particles in size class The differential equation Many studies ( This solution (Eq. The grinding mechanisms can be studied by comparing the experimental data with the characteristic behavior of the grinding mechanisms as illustrated in The initial particle size distribution of the material slowly shifts to smaller particle sizes during the first 5 In a later stage during grinding, smaller particles appear and the distribution becomes bimodal. The particle size measurements have been complemented with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures taken from samples dried at room temperature at different grinding time. The formation of intermediate sized particles is observed after circa 30 Finally, all intermediate sized particles break down to the final particle size. The difference between those particle sizes is not big and breakage can therefore be classified as a cleavage process. SEM picture ( The qualitative analysis of the trends of the breakage mechanisms can also be studied using the population balance model as described in paragraph 3. The breakage behavior illustrated in Coarse particles that are present at the start of the grinding process sustain a complex breakage mechanism. From Particles of intermediate size mainly reduce in size due to abrasion and cleavage as shown in The smallest particle classes are the hardest to break. These particles require more specific energy to break. This means applying a higher stress for a longer period of time. Therefore, particles of smaller sizes undergo mainly cleavage.   Grinding media accelerated from the stirrer towards the grinding chamber. Grinding media pressed against the walls by centrifugal forces. Grinding media in the bed of centrifuged beads with different velocities. The forces applied on the product particles leading to breakage are therefore mainly tangential forces in the centrifuge bed of particles. The movement of the grinding media results in slow but high energy forces typical of shear and compression processes. Those forces are known (cf. paragraph 2) as the origin of respectively abrasion and cleavage mechanisms. This confirms the above studies of the grinding mechanisms. The PBM study was used to investigate the effects of rotation speed and grinding media size on the breakage mechanisms. The varying conditions result in different stress distributions in the ball mill due to a different kinetic energy of the grinding beads. The resulting fragment size distributions are presented in The study from  The movement of the fluid in the grinding chamber is different from the one of the grinding media. The fluid motion depends on its viscosity, density and the stirrer size and tip speed. It is therefore, accepted that the maximum speed of the fluid is the tip speed of the impellor. The motion of the grinding media follows partially the movement of the fluid, depending on the ratios between the grinding bead size and the stirrer size and between the bead density and the fluid density. Cases calculated by The study made by The present paper uses slightly higher fluid Reynolds number In laminar disc agitator regime, the flow pattern of the grinding media should be closely similar to the one calculated by The objective of the work was to determine the grinding mechanisms in a stirred ball mill by using population balances. The main grinding mechanisms are cleavage and some fracture for coarse particles The mechanism of grinding itself is not varying when changing the operating conditions; the motion of grinding media and thus the characteristic forces are of same nature in the studied ranges.
