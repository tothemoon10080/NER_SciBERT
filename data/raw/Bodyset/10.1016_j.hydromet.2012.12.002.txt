There is a competitive reaction of zinc and silica in the alkali leaching process of zinc oxide ore, leading to low zinc leaching rate. To increase leaching rate of zinc, the effect of sodium silicate on the solubility of zinc oxide of the Na2O–ZnO–SiO2–H2O equilibrium system is studied by adding Na2SiO3 and ZnO to NaOH solution. Results show that zinc oxide equilibrium concentration increases with temperature from 25 to 75°C at the same molar ratio of Na2O to SiO2. The equilibrium concentration of zinc oxide initially increases and then declines with the increasing concentration of Na2O. This leads to the maximum ZnO concentration, which increases with temperature but decreases with the increasing dosage of sodium silicate. The precipitate of disodium zinc silicate (Na2(ZnSiO4)) generates due to the reaction of silicate SiO3

                     2− in the solution of Na2O–ZnO–H2O equilibrium system. High zinc leaching rate can be obtained when the Na2O concentration is lower than the values indicated by the “peak” points at higher molar ratios of Na2O to SiO2 and temperatures.Zinc oxide ores become more and more important nowadays due to a decrease in the extraction of zinc from sphalerite ores ( To date, many investigations have been carried out to treat low grade zinc oxide ores with alkaline based on some advantages during the process ( To increase zinc extraction with suppression of SiO To illustrate the mechanism of the reaction between SiO Analytical grade NaOH and Na  It can be seen that the variation of ZnO equilibrium concentration is similar to the change of Na  As indicated by this equation, the precipitate of Na It could also be observed from To confirm the reaction in the slurry, precipitate composition is identified using XRD.  Experimental results of ZnO equilibrium concentration indicate that zinc oxide equilibrium concentration increases with temperature from 25 to 75 This work was financially supported by the
