The main avenue towards improving cyclic stability of Si-based anodes for Li-ion batteries has been the incorporation of graphene-based ‘buffer’ interlayer. In this context, we bring to the fore a concept concerning the existence of a lower limit to the dimensional scale of Si, below which the effectiveness of graphene-based interlayer towards improving cyclic stability of Si-based electrodes may cease. Our studies have indicated that the concerned effectiveness of graphene-based interlayer breaks down for Si-dimension ≤ ∼50 nm, because the, otherwise, relatively constraint free dilation/contraction (upon lithiation/delithiation) of Si at Si/graphene interface (unlike at Si/Cu interface) no longer remains unconstrained.Despite possessing significantly higher specific Li-storage capacity and better safety aspects compared to graphitic carbon, Si is not yet able to replace the former as anode material for Li-ion batteries. The problem lies in the huge dimensional changes during lithiation/delithiation of Si, which causes colossal stress developments primarily due to constraints towards dimensional changes, and concomitant fracture/disintegration of the electrode [ For addressing the above concerns, one of the more sought after avenues has been the use of graphene-based interlayer/additive (along with nanoscaled Si); but with the actual role(s) of such interlayer/additive being subject to various speculations and debates [ Against this backdrop, the presently reported work throws important insights into the above aspects; especially, for the latter ( Amorphous Si (a-Si) films having different thicknesses ( As interlayer between a-Si and Cu, large area few layers graphene (FLG) film were grown on cleaned 25 μm thick Cu foils (2 × 2 cm; Sigma Aldrich) via AP-CVD at 1000 °C for 30 min using methane gas as precursor under continuous flow of N The a-Si based electrodes (with/without FLG interlayer) were electrochemically cycled in CR2032 coin cells against Li foil as counter-cum-reference electrode using glass microfiber filter paper (Whatman®; Grade GF/D) as separator and LP-30 ( SEM ( The cyclic stabilities for the a-Si film electrodes, having different film thickness and in the absence/presence of FLG interlayer, when galvanostatically cycled in Li ‘half cells’ at C/2, are presented in The presence of graphene-based interlayer ( In a nut shell, the electrochemical cycling results indicate that even though the presence of graphene-based interlayer between a-Si film and current collector improves the cyclic stability of the thicker a-Si film electrodes, the same has no notable impact in the case of the thinnest a-Si film electrode used here ( The adhesion at Si/graphene interface is known to be weaker, as compared to that at the Si/Cu interface [ In this context, thin-film mechanics predicts that the presence/occurrence of biaxial stress in a film ( If the above hypothesis is valid, it is likely that the ‘defect’ creation in the graphene-based interlayer ( In summary, electrochemical lithiation/delithiation studies with film electrodes having varied a-Si film thicknesses ( As a bigger picture, this work rests all speculations/beliefs concerning the possibility of definitely improving the cyclic stability of Si-based electrodes in the presence of graphene-based interlayer/additive, especially upon lowering the dimensional scale of Si. Rather, our observations-cum-analysis indicate that, in the presence of graphene-based interlayer, Si of dimension/thickness greater than 50 nm is desirable in the above context. On a different note, this is also advantageous in terms of the overall capacity of the Si-based electrode. With respect to the present set of results, ∼83% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a fairly high current density of C/2 for our 100 nm thick a-Si/graphene electrode ( The authors would like to thank The following is the Supplementary data to this article: Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
