The authors regret the need of a corrigendum with the following changes: Section 1. Introduction The third paragraph: “Technological innovations have been made and the introduction of amorphophallus products into the minerals processing industry have been successful. Galactomannan (KGM) is made from the root of the amorphophallus or trigonella plants and is a new high molecular weight polysaccharide, used as a powerful water-soluble dietary fiber supplement in food additives, medicine, chemicals, etc. (Zhou et al., 2012). Amorphophallus and trigonella plants are widely grown in China Southern and Japan (Jiang et al., 2012).” should be replaced by: “Technological innovations have been made and the introduction of trigonella products into the minerals processing industry have been successful. Galactomannan (KGM) is made from the root of the trigonella or dioscorea plants and is a new high molecular weight polysaccharide, used as a powerful water-soluble dietary fiber supplement in food additives, medicine, chemicals, etc. Trigonella and ​dioscorea plants are widely grown in China Southern and Japan (Jiang et al., 2012).” Section References The last reference (Zhou et al., 2012) should be deleted.
