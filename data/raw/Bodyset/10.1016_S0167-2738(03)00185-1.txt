Thin film Ni3Sn2 anodes were deposited on a Cu substrate by e-beam evaporator at room temperature. The deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). They were tested as anodes for thin film rechargeable lithium batteries. These film electrodes exhibited an excellent cycle performance over 500 cycles. Ni3Sn2 films remained without undergoing any crystallographic phase change during cycling.Rechargeable thin film batteries have become the topic of widespread research for use in low power applications in the field of micro-electronics and micro-systems An ideal new anode materials should show insignificant volume change during Li insertion/extraction, as well as thermal and chemical stabilities, which leads to negligible capacity fading over many cycles. Tin-based materials were the subject of an extensive investigation Ni In this paper, the preparation of Ni Ni In this work, Ni-Sn alloy powders were also tested. The powders were prepared by mechanical alloying followed by annealing at 350 and 500 °C for 1 h under argon gas flow. Mechanical alloying was carried out with a commercial Spex-8000 high-energy ball mill with hardened steel balls and vial. The average composition of the deposited films was Ni  To investigate any changes in the microstructure or morphology of the film electrodes during cycling, the surface of the films was observed before cycling and after 500 cycles with SEM. SEM indicates that the surface of the film electrode after 500 cycles is devoid of any cracks, while the morphology of the film surface after cycling appears to be changed (see The reversible capacity of the present Ni The above results, though preliminary in nature as obtained with the Li/ Ni It has been shown that Ni This work was supported by The Korean Ministry of Science and Technology through the research program for ‘National Research Laboratory’.
