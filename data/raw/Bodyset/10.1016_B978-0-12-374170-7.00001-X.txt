This chapter summarizes recent advances in several areas of practical application beyond those described in earlier chapters. These include the metallacarborane-based extraction of radionuclides from radioactive waste; the development of carborane-containing materials such as ionic liquids, liquid crystals, nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, gas separation and storage materials, electroactive systems, carborane-based networks and supramolecular assemblies, films and monolayers, biomaterials, and ceramics; molecular-scale cars and other nanomachines; carboranes as noncatalytic agents in synthesis; and the application of carboranes in gas chromatography and other analytical techniques.
