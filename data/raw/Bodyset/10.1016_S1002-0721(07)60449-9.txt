Abstract
                  Cerium carbonate powders were produced in a submerged circulation impinging stream reactor (SCISR) from Ce(NO3)3 · 6H2O. NH4HCO3 was used as a precipitant in the reaction. Cerium carbonate powders were roasted to produce ultra-fine cerium dioxide (CeO2) powders. The optimal conditions of such production process were obtained by orthogonal and one-factor experiments. The results showed that ultra-fine and narrowly distributed cerium carbonate powders were produced under the optimal flowing conditions. The concentrations of Ce(NO3)3 and NH4HCO3 solutions were 0.25 and 0.3 mol · L-1, respectively. The concentration of PEG4000 added in these two solutions was 4 g · L-1. The stirring ratio, reaction temperature, feeding time, solution pH, reaction time and digestion time were 900 r · min-1, 80 °C, 20 min, 5∼6, 5 min and 1 h, respectively. The final product, CeO2 powders, was obtained by roasting the produced cerium carbonate in air for 3 h at 500 °C. The finally produced CeO2 powders were torispherical particles with a narrow size distribution of 0.8∼2.5 μm. The crystal structure of CeO2 powders belonged to cubic crystal system and its space point group was O
