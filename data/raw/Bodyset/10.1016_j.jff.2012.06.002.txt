While the consumption of fruit and vegetables is protective against cardiovascular disease, the relative efficacy of specific plants is poorly substantiated. In addition, although most plants are consumed in a ‘processed’ state (i.e., including cooking), the bioactivity of processed forms of plants is also generally unknown. Effects on elements of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were studied in a selection of 131 dietary plant species, fungi or varietals, across 44 families, after standardised processing. Products were tested for in vitro inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and of angiotensin II (AngII) binding to its receptor (AT1R). The results indicated that ACE inhibition activity was weakly correlated with AngII to AT1R inhibition and that ACE inhibitory activity was positively correlated with total polyphenolic content. These results highlight that processed forms of dietary plants exhibit broad capacity for in vitro modulation of RAS. Furthermore, considering the extensive ACE inhibitory activity reported for peptides derived from many dietary proteins, this implicates broad potential for RAS regulation by several dietary factors. With RAS elements also known to function in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, there is a need to understand the physiological role of dietary factors on GI function, blood pressure regulation and salt excretion.High level health claims include recommendation of consumption of fruit and vegetables for protection against cardiovascular disease (CVD) ( The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to play a fundamental role in regulating peripheral electrolyte homeostasis, fluid volume and blood pressure in mammalian systems ( Inhibition of ligand binding to the AT While an abundance of RAS-regulatory activity is observed for dietary peptides, the corresponding RAS-regulatory activity of dietary plants is less well understood. Furthermore, the effects of cooking and other common processing treatments associated with consumption of plant foods, on bioactivity represents an additional unknown dimension in the endeavour to identify the specific dietary plants important for physiological function. The aims of the study were therefore to examine processed forms of a broad selection of common, edible plants extracts for their capacity to inhibit ACE activity and antagonise AngII binding to the AT Fresh forms of the dietary plants and fungi listed in Plant samples were dispersed at 20 The enzyme mixture contained 250 Samples were analysed in at least duplicate using a single batch of ACE enzyme and the within and between day coefficient of variation for repeatability, based on the positive control VAP at 2 The capacity for inhibition of binding of radio-labelled angiotensin II analogue ( Plant products were dispersed at 50 The assay was conducted in a final volume of 75 Total polyphenol content of selected Stage 1 plant products was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay method ( Total nitrogen was determined in a Leco FP-2000 nitrogen analyser (St. Joseph, MI, USA). Stage 1 processed plant products were ground using a mortar and pestle before accurately weighing 100–300 IC A broad range of commonly consumed dietary plants were subjected to a standardised processing method involving mechanical dispersion, ‘cooking’, ultrasonication and drying ( The ACE activity assay method was validated with the reference ACE inhibitors captopril and VAP. The measured IC The AT The Stage 1 plant products were systematically screened in the assay and the results are summarised in The correlation between capacity of individual plant products for ACE inhibition and AT A selection of 24 plants species and varietals from 11 families were randomly selected for evaluation of TPP content. The ACE inhibitory activity was found to correlate significantly with TPP content ( Total nitrogen levels of the sub-set of lead AT The principal aim of this study was to determine the extent of RAS-regulatory activity in commonly consumed plants.

Specifically, fluid and buffer transport are regulated in the GI system by angiotensin II (AngII) ( Bioavailability of dietary plant metabolites based on detection in plasma (  These results potentially could be used as a basis for selection of individual or combinations of ‘lead’ plant foods with ACE and AT From this preliminary study of 131 plant foods screened for RAS modulation following processing, strongest ACE inhibitory activity (IC No competing financial interests exist.
