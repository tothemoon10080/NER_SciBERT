The possibility to remove cobalt cations from a simulated waste water by ferrite formation co-precipitating it with Fe+3 and Fe+2 precursors was evaluated. The incorporation of the cobalt ion to the ferrite structure was studied using different formation parameters: formation temperature, iron precursor, aging period, NaOH addition, mixing speed. The particle magnetization was increased by controlling the synthesis parameters. Two magnetic filter designs were tested to separate the ferrite from solution with an efficiency of 99% using the static fluid design.
