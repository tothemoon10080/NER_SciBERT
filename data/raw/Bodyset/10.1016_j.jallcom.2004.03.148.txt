The microstructure and tensile deformation characteristics in the commercial 5083 Al alloy after equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) at 373 and 473K were investigated and compared with those of one reannealed at 473K for 1h after ECAP at 373K. All specimens revealed nano-structure with grains of ∼300nm and no distinct grain boundaries except the reannealed alloy. The strength in the alloy pressed at 373K was much higher than that of as-received alloy but the elongation to failure was significantly smaller, while, in case of pressing at 473K, the improvement in strength was found concurrent with slight work hardening, without sacrificing much of the elongation. The tensile properties of the reannealed alloy were in between those of ones pressed at 373 and 473K. These tensile deformation characteristics were analyzed based on the observations of deformed microstructure and fracture surface by TEM and FE-SEM, respectively.A number of research studies have been recently attempted to obtain the nano-structure in metallic materials by imposing severe plastic deformation (SPD). Among SPD techniques, particularly, the equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) has been widely used to produce the bulk nano-crystalline materials without residual porosity and volume change Among Al alloys, the 5083 Al alloy is a representative non-age-hardenable Al–Mg based alloy which possesses many interesting characteristics as a structural material, such as low price, moderately high strength, good corrosion resistance, high formability in conjunction with superplasticity, etc. A commercial 5083 Al alloy (Al–4.4%Mg–0.7%Mn–0.15%Cr (in mass %)) was supplied in the form of an extruded bar. Cylindrical samples of  Typical true stress–strain curves obtained for as-pressed 5083 Al alloys are shown in TEM micrographs of the deformed microstructure in the vicinity of fracture surface in the alloy pressed at 373 and 473  The nano-structure of ∼300 This work was supported by Korea Ministry of Science and Technology through ‘the 21st Century New Frontier Research and Development Program’, and by Korea Institute of Industrial Technology and Kwangju Metropolitan City through ‘the Advanced Elements and Materials Industry Development Program’.
