β-FeSi2 thin films were grown on Si(100) and Si(111) substrates at room temperature by magnetron sputtering and β-FeSi2/Si heterojunctions were thus prepared. The target and substrates were cleaned by a neutral molecule source (NMS). Surface properties of β-FeSi2/Si heterojunctions were characterized with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Crystalline structures of the films were determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). β-FeSi2 films were found to be polycrystalline in nature, and structural parameters were evaluated from the XRD pattern. Surface morphology and crystallinity of the template layers were found to depend on the surface conditions of the substrate. AFM observations showed that the surface structure of the film grown on (111) oriented substrates appears to be more ordered than that of films grown on (100) substrates.The demand to use photovoltaic devices for energy applications has been increasing continuously. For the practical production of photovoltaic devices, easy to find, cheap and recyclable properties of the materials are as important as the device's lifetime It has been reported that β-FeSi β-FeSi The surface morphology of β-FeSi In this study, β-FeSi The ratios of Fe and Si were observed to depend on the penetration depth (measured from the surface of the films). These results were obtained by using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), with electron energies of 5, 10, and 15 keV. EDS results for β-FeSi The resistivity of the β-FeSi The smooth surfaces of the coated regions showed distinct changes after 4–5 months. The SEM images of β-FeSi  β-FeSi
