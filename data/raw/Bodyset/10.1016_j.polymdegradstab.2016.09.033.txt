A well-established model for simulation of the chain-scission process of polylacticacid (PLA) during thermal processing has been simplified and revised. The key assumption in the new model is that the total number of monomer units is invariant as reactions progress. Surprisingly, this seemingly obvious assumption appears to have been previously overlooked. The revised model no longer requires solution of simultaneous differential equations and, for isothermal conditions, an analytical solution is readily available. The present model is in excellent agreement with the more complex model and experimental results for PLA degradation reported in the literature. This simplified model has potential to be applied to other thermoplastics.In 1997, a statistical model was proposed by Wachsen et al. The effect of temperature on degradation and recombination is expressed using the Arrhenius equation (Eqs. Considering only the first three moments, the differential equation system (Eq. To close Eqs. Eq. An important point, that appears to have been overlooked in studies that have made use of the Yu et al. model (Eq. This analytical resultis in a convenient form for prediction of degradation of polymeric materials such as PLA during melt processing As Eq. For all of the models, the number-averaged molar mass Since enforcing Eq. To sum up, the model for thermo-chemical degradation of PLLA proposed by Yu et al.
