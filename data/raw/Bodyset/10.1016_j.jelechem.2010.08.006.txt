The process of Ag+ ions extraction from nitric solutions by bulk liquid membranes containing di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid and tri-n-octylamine accompanied with silver(I) electrodeposition from perchloric acid solutions is studied at galvanostatic electrodialysis. The effects of the current density as well as of composition of the liquid membrane and aqueous solutions on the rate of the silver(I) transport are determined. More than 90% of silver ions was extracted from the feed solution containing 0.01moll−1 AgNO3 and about 40% of metal was electrodeposited during 1h of electrodialysis. Sound adherent silver coatings have been deposited on platinum and copper cathodes.Silver is widely used in different branches of industry as corrosion protection material, as a decorative metal, for enhancing electrical conductivity, reflective and antifriction properties; in the production of medical instruments. Currently silver coatings for industrial application are usually electrodeposited from cyanide solutions Membrane extraction is a promising technique for removal of valuable metal ions from diluted solutions Di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) is an important acidic extractant in hydrometallurgy. D2EHPA has been used commercially for the extraction of cobalt, zinc and rare earth metals To concentrate and to accelerate the ions transfer through liquid ion-exchange membranes, an electric current may be used. The driving force of the electroassisted transfer process is based on the Gibbs energy of ionic transfer of the metals between two immiscible liquid phases Purin The experiments were carried out in a four-compartment Teflon electrodialysis cell in the system: The solutions of D2EHPA (technical grade, contents of the main substance ∼63%) with the admixtures of tri- It was found in the preliminary experiments that without electric field application the transport of silver(I) through the liquid membranes practically was not observed. The imposition of an electric field allows to extract Ag In D2EHPA organic solutions in the presence of TOA an ion pair is formed, which consists of an organic cation and an organic anion Silver(I) ions are extracted by D2EHPA due to the interfacial cation-exchange mechanism: The extracted complex partially dissociates in a polar organic solvent The schematic diagram of the transport process is presented in Silver(I) cations are transferred by diffusion to the interface feed solution/liquid membrane and interact with the carrier. The extracted compound AgR diffuses in the organic phase and dissociates at the polarized 1,2-dichloroethane/water interface. The carrier’s molecules return back according to their concentration gradient. Hydrogen ions permeate across the membrane in the same direction as Ag The amine first reacts with nitric acid to form the amine salt Oct  The kinetics of silver(I) transport and electrodeposition is presented in The increase of silver(I) content in the feed solution from 0.01 to 0.1 The increase of nitric acid concentration in the feed solution from 5 The influence of perchloric acid concentration in the cathodic solution on the silver(I) permeation and electrodeposition rates is illustrated in The effects of D2EHPA and TOA concentrations in the liquid membranes on the silver(I) permeation rate is illustrated in Solutions of technical D2EHPA contain significant amounts of admixtures of strongly associated monoalkylphosphoric acid The increase of TOA concentration in the liquid membrane leads to a rise of the electrical conductivity whereas the increase of D2EHPA concentration reduces the electrical conductivity and raises the voltage of galvanostatic electrodialysis ( Silver coatings were deposited on the platinum and copper electrodes at different current densities from 0.05 The liquid membranes containing di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid and tri- The author is grateful to N.V.
