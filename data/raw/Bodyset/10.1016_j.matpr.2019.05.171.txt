To evaluate the comparative effect of different sodium chemicals on carbothermal reduction of barite at high temperature catalytic carbothermal reduction of pink barite in the presence of sodium chloride, sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate has been investigated. For this purpose sodium chloride, sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate (separately) ranging from 1.0 to 5.0% by weight of barite were mixed in heterogeneous mixture of pink barite and coal. Mixture was isothermally heated for the carbothermal reduction of barite at high temperature. Results show that sodium nitrate significantly increases the yield of barium sulphide (60%) than comparative to sodium carbonate (52.3%) and sodium chloride (40.1%). The obtained results can be useful in barium industrial practice and help to improve the economy of country.
