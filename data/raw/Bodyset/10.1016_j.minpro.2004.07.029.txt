Based on the physical model of classification in vaned rotors, the fundamental difference between the exclusive use of a forced vortex flow (i.e. classification at the outer edge of the vanes) and the combined use of forced vortex/free vortex flow (i.e. classification in the interior vane free area) is derived.
                  The classifier used for the comparison is a CFS-HDS model. Results received from this classifier equipped with a Convor-wheel with constant radial velocity of the flow in the interior vane free area are compared with results from a classifier wheel designed for classification at the outer edge of the vanes.

Classification in vaned rotors can be described as the equilibrium of two forces acting on an individual particle: the drag force the radial velocity component follows the continuity law the circumferential velocity component develops in accordance with a solid body rotation between the vanes the outer edge of the vanes for the interior vane free area for for classification at the outer edge of the vanes for classification in the vane-free interior area  It is characterized by vanes that reach into the area of the fines discharge. This prevents the development of a free vortex flow, the circumferential velocity follows the law of solid body rotation and therefore decreases on its way to the fines discharge.  The a.m. classifier wheels had been installed in a CFS/HD-S 85 classifier model ( The restriction to a maximum circumferential velocity of 120.6 m/s has a practical background: this allows the use of standard construction materials (e.g. carbon steel or similar), and even the use of abrasion resistant materials such as ceramics or hard metals, when processing abrasive substances. The radial velocity in the classifying zone (outer edge of the vanes for solid body rotation, radius of the fines outlet for classification in the interior vane-free area) has been chosen in such a way, that—for a given geometrical size of the equipment—acceptable airflow rates can be achieved. Finally, the range of the product to air ratio was selected in accordance with practical experience for the expected fineness. Test material was limestone with a feed size of  In Linear regressions on the function   To characterize the efficiency of the rotors compared, the fines efficiency number  Together with the efficiency, the operating costs are crucial for the economic viability of a classification. Expenses for maintenance, especially when processing abrasive substances, and the pressure drop of the classifier represent the most important operating cost factors. In The influence of the product to air ratio can be disregarded. The increase of pressure drop for the pneumatic transport of the higher mass flow of product is nearly compensated by the finer Thus, classifying rotors can be tailored to a specific application. To reach low pressure drop, Convor wheels with A comparison of Convor classifying rotors (classification in the vane-free interior area) of varied intensification factors Under practical conditions, Convor rotors have a higher potential for finest cuts. The efficiency of classification is comparable with both kinds of rotors.
