Roof and rib falls are still a leading cause of injuries in underground coal mines. When numerical simulation method is adopted to study this phenomenon, the influence of regular laminations on strength and size effect should be carefully considered because rock mass of roof is usually laminated. In order to get an insight into the influence of different lamination factors on size effect, cubic rock specimens with different sizes, stress directions, lamination orientations and lamination spacing were tested under true tri-axial conditions with 3DEC. The results show that regular lamination can cause size effect even without considering size effect of the intact rock and rock joints. The influence of lamination orientation on size effect is distinct and is orientation-dependent while the influence of lamination thickness is minimal. Changing dip or stress direction will affect the influence of orientation and size effect as well.
