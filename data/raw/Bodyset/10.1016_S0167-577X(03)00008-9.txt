The vanadium-doped SnO2 nanoparticle was synthesized by the co-precipitation reaction and subsequent calcination from the vanadium(III) chloride and tin(IV) chloride. The crystal size, pore size distribution, micrograph and properties of the nanocrystalline powders were examined by differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), desorption isotherm (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal treatment of the precipitate powder at 600 °C led to the formation of V–SnO2 nanoparticle of ∼10 nm in crystal size. Most of the pores in the nanoparticle are about 5–15 nm in diameter. Effect of doped vanadium on the crystal size of the nanoparticle was discussed.SnO The vanadium chloride (VCl The nanoparticles were examined by TG/DTA, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The average crystal size of the powder was calculated from diffraction peak half-widths using the Scherrer formula. Adsorption study of the nanoparticles was performed on Autosorb-I static volume adsorption analyzer using N The precursor of vanadium-doped SnO Thermal analysis of the nanocrystallite precursor was carried out after the drying process of 105 °C for 2 h.
