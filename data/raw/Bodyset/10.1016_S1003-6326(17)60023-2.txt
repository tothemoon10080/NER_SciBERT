The magnetism of pentlandite surface was enhanced through the selective precipitation of micro-fine magnetite fractions on pentlandite surfaces. This was achieved through adjustment of slurry pH and addition of surfactants. The results showed that at pH 8.8 with the addition of 100 g/t sodium hexametaphosphate, 4.5 L/t oleic acid, and 4.5 L/t kerosene, significant amount of fine magnetite particles adhered to the pentlandite surface, while trace amount of coating was found on serpentine surfaces. Thus, the magnetism of pentlandite was enhanced and pentlandite was well separated from serpentine by magnetic separation under the magnetic field intensity of 200 kA/m. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and zeta potential measurement were performed to characterize changes of mineral surface properties. Calculations of the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Ocerbeek (EDLVO) theory indicated that, in the presence of surfactants the total interaction energy between magnetite and pentlandite became stronger than that between magnetite and serpentine. This enabled the selective adhesion of magnetite particles to pentlandite surfaces, thereby enhancing its magnetism.
