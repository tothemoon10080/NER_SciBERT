Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, hereditary disease caused by mutations in the For elucidation of Interestingly, In summary, we developed a zebrafish model system for functional analyses of HPP symptoms related to the nervous system and craniosynostosis. Establishment of diverse molecular techniques paves the way for future tissue-specific investigations and helps providing new molecular insights into consequences of
