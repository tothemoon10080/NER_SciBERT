Coal flotation depends on coal's natural properties (wettability), the floatability acquired from the use of reagents, and particle size effects. Although the flotation of coal is less complicated than the flotation of ores (especially polymetallic sulfide ores), the list of parameters that affect it is still considerable. It is convenient to categorize these parameters into four groups: characteristics of coal, characteristics of pulp, application of reagents, and flotation circuits and machines. In this chapter, both the advancing and receding contact angles measured at an oil droplet in water (through water) are plotted versus the carbon/oxygen ratio. The data in the chapter shows that coal oxidation increases its hydrophilicity. The chapter illustrates the effect of time of weathering on the flotation properties of three different coals (Illinois No. 6, Pittsburgh No. 8, and Upper Freeport). Two size fractions, – 6.4 mm + 0.6 mm, and –0.6 mm are either kept in inert conditions of argon or in oxidizing conditions of an exposed stockpile. The coarse coal fractions are dry ground before flotation below –0.6 ram, and both fractions are floated in a 2–1 Denver cell using dodecane as a collector and MIBC frother.
