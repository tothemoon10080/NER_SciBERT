The kinetics of Au3+ chloride complex ions reduction using Fe2+ chloride ions was investigated by stopped-flow method. The influence of initial concentrations of Au3+ chloride ions, Fe2+ ions, chloride ions, neutral salt (NaClO4), pH of the solution and temperature was investigated. Activation energy was determined to be 42.36 kJ/mol. Moreover, the kinetic equation was postulated. Obtained solid phase was analyzed using SEM techniques. Particles size varies in the range from 0.5 to 5 Î¼m. It was shown that gold can be removed from the solution by the reduction of Au3+ chloride ions and filtration of precipitant.
