Gallus domesticus eggshell was investigated for its ability to remove copper from aqueous solution in an up-flow packed column. The sorption performance of eggshell in the column was examined by varying the bed height (15–25cm) and flow rate (5–20ml/min). The column was regenerated using 0.01M EDTA solution and sorption–desorption studies were carried out for five cycles.Natural materials that are available in large quantities, or certain waste products from industries, may have potential as inexpensive heavy metal sorbents (  Copper solution (100 The effect of bed height on the copper sorption characteristics of eggshell was examined at a flow rate of 5 In the second stage of sorption studies, the effect of flow rate was studied. Earlier breakthrough and exhaustion times were observed at higher flow rates. The breakthrough curves also became steeper, and the mass transfer zone shorter as the flow rate increased. At a lower flow rate of 5 The column regeneration studies were carried out for five sorption–desorption cycles at 5 A decrease in breakthrough time was observed as the cycles progressed, indicating the gradual deterioration of the sorbent due to continuous usage ( The elution curves obtained for cycles 1, 3 and 5 are shown in This study shows that eggshell is an effective sorbent for copper removal. Both bed height and flow rate affected the copper sorption characteristics of the eggshell. The column regeneration studies indicated that the reusability of eggshell for copper removal is viable.
