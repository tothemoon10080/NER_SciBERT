The chalcopyrite bioleaching mechanism was studied to determine its direct or indirect nature. At the same time, a study of possible causes that diminish the dissolution rate and inhibit the attack of this sulphide mineral was carried out. An electrochemical study of the mineral was also performed, which included the elimination or dissolution of possible diffusion barriers formed on the mineral surface.
                  Results of these studies showed that the oxidation state of the dissolved iron (Fe3+) was fundamental to chalcopyrite bioleaching because Fe3+ controlled the relative rate of the oxidation reactions. In addition, the attack of chalcopyrite was controlled by elemental sulphur and intermediate, nonstoichiometric, copper sulphides forming on the chalcopyrite surface, which are less reactive than the original sulphide. Intermediate sulphides caused an important barrier effect at low temperature (35 °C). At higher temperature (68 °C), these intermediate sulphides do not constitute a diffusion barrier due to their dissolution.
                  Microbial attachment to the pyritic phase of the copper ore was related to the dissolution rate of the mineral due to the liberation of Fe2+ after the attack of the pyrite by contact bioleaching.
                  It was concluded that the bioleaching of chalcopyrite concentrate is a cooperative effort involving the simultaneous contact bioleaching of the pyritic phase of the mineral, possibly by an indirect mechanism via thiosulphate, and the indirect bioleaching of chalcopyrite, probably by a mechanism by way of polysulphide and elemental sulphur.Microbial oxidation of copper sulphides is fundamental for copper extraction from low-grade concentrates. Bioleaching processes are particularly suitable for the treatment of secondary copper sulphides but are very inefficient for attacking chalcopyrite (CuFeS Review of the technical literature on the chalcopyrite bioleaching reveals concurrence on some important aspects of this phenomenon although there is far from total agreement on the subject and there is no universally accepted theory on the mechanism of chalcopyrite bioleaching. The first attempt to explain a possible mechanism of bioleaching was carried out by According to this mechanism proposed by This proposed mechanism is based on interdisciplinary studies involving mineralogical and semiconducting properties of chalcopyrite (CuFeS  Indirect bioleaching, whereby the microbial action is restricted to the renewal of the bioleaching reagent, Fe Contact bioleaching, which entails attachment of microorganisms to the mineral surface and these organisms prepare the medium and facilitate the mineral attack through an electrochemical dissolution involving Fe Cooperative bioleaching, which entails cooperation between microorganisms attached to the mineral surface and free bacteria in solution. The attached microbes, through contact bioleaching, release chemicals to the solution that constitute the energy source for the organisms that are free in solution. The principal aim of the present work is to study the mechanism involved in chalcopyrite dissolution. For this, a chalcopyrite concentrate was bioleached at two different temperatures (35 and 68 °C) and parameters such as the Fe A copper sulphide flotation concentrate supplied by Rio Tinto Metal (Huelva, Spain) was used. Chemical analysis of the sample was: 18.9% Cu; 34.6% Fe; 0.01% Zn; and 36.8% S. X-ray diffraction analysis of the ore showed chalcopyrite as the major component (54.6%), pyrite (FeS The microorganisms used, the conditions and procedure of their culture, the description of the bioleaching tests, the microbial attachment control, the electrochemical measures, and the two-step bioleaching tests are described in a paper published in this same issue of Hydrometallurgy entitled: “New information on the pyrite bioleaching mechanism at low and high temperature”. Before carrying out the second bioleaching test, the chalcopyrite residues from the first bioleaching test were washed with a CS The results obtained during the chalcopyrite bioleaching at 35 and 68 °C are shown in The copper dissolution curves show that both the kinetics and the efficiency of leaching were directly related to the Fe These observations confirm the importance of indirect bioleaching involving polysulphide and elemental sulphur, as proposed by Mineral dissolution ceased when the microbial growth reached a maximum, corresponding with a decline in capacity of Fe jarosite precipitated in the presence of high concentrations of ferric iron and sulphates as a consequence of the pH increase intermediate copper sulphides less reactive than the original chalcopyrite a sulphur layer formed as a by-product during the copper–iron sulphide dissolution The copper leaching efficiency achieved with thermophilic microorganisms was higher than that obtained with mesophilic bacteria. Other authors have observed these differences between thermophilic and mesophilic microorganisms as well An EDS analysis carried out on several particles of chalcopyrite previously attacked by bioleaching detected sulphur concentrations higher than that corresponding to the chalcopyrite composition; this sulphur can be associated with either the presence of a thin layer of elemental sulphur on the ore or the formation of intermediate copper sulphides enriched in sulphur. The differences found in the bioleaching process at 68 and 35 °C could be related to the high sulphur-oxidizing activity of the thermophilic culture and, possibly, to a microbial selection of iron-oxidizing microorganisms in the mesophilic culture. This was confirmed by TEM studies of the microbial populations. The selection likely occurred at the beginning of the process, because the cells found sufficient concentration of soluble Fe It can be concluded from these observations that the differences between thermophilic and mesophilic microorganisms were consistent with a greater chemical dissolution of the mineral with increasing temperature and a higher Fe Microbial attachment to the mineral surface during the first hours of the test According to studies performed by others, the electrostatic force between the mineral surface and the microorganisms is the fundamental factor in the initial attachment. As electrostatic repulsion increases, attachment decreases Microbial attachment during the entire bioleaching period occurred in three distinct steps an initial step of maximum attachment (66%); a second step in which the proportion of newly attached cells decreased with respect to free cells in solution; and a final step in which an equilibrium between attached and free cells (25%) was reached. These results are similar to those obtained with pyrite (see the results in this same issue of Hydrometallurgy) and the interpretation is exactly the same in that the active sites on the mineral surface influences the attachment of the microorganisms to the mineral and the Fe As in the case with pyrite, chalcopyrite bioleaching takes place in two steps. In the first step, pyritic phase dissolution occurs by the attack of microorganisms initially attached to the pyritic phase via the mechanism of contact bioleaching The anodic chalcopyrite polarization curves at 35 and 68 °C from the rest potential (+327 mV) When the scan direction is reversed towards negative potentials (reduction), the current decreases to +700 mV. A small wave is observed at +400 mV (peak C), which is related to the reduction of ferric to ferrous iron. At +200 mV a new peak (D) associated with the reduction of S When chalcopyrite, which was biologically attacked, is subjected to polarization To improve the leaching kinetics, an attempt was made to eliminate elemental sulphur formed on the mineral surface of bioleached residue using carbon disulphide (CS When the dissolution of the sulphur layer was not achieved, chalcopyrite was strongly passivated and the bioleaching tests that were carried out in two steps were very inefficient. Nevertheless, the attack of the pyritic phase continued during the second bioleaching For chalcopyrite leaching, the oxidation state of the dissolved iron (Fe The magnitude of the initial microbial attachment on the pyritic phase of the copper concentrate was related to the dissolution rate obtained during the leaching process. This was due to Fe Chalcopyrite leaching was controlled by the formation of elemental sulphur and intermediate copper sulphides, both of which are less reactive than the original chalcopyrite. Elemental sulphur and intermediate copper sulphides exert a severe barrier effect at low temperature (35 °C), whereas at high temperature (68 °C) these compounds do not affect the reagent diffusion. Two-step bioleaching showed that pyrite did not present diffusion problems during its attack since the leaching reaction produces sulphate instead of S The bioleaching of the copper concentrate took place by means of a cooperative bioleaching strategy in which the contact bioleaching of the pyritic phase of the concentrate, possibly through the indirect mechanism via thiosulphate, and the indirect bioleaching of chalcopyrite, possibly through the indirect mechanism via polysulphide and elemental sulphur, simultaneously occurred.
