A mathematical model for enargite bioleaching at 70Â°C by Sulfolobus BC in shake-flasks has been constructed. The model included (1) the indirect leaching by Fe3+ and Fe3+ regeneration by suspended Sulfolobus, and (2) the direct leaching by the attached Sulfolobus. The model parameters were optimized using genetic algorithm (GA). Simulations of the ferric leaching and bioleaching processes were done using this model. The dynamic changes of the concentrations of Cu2+, As3+, As5+, Fe3+ and/or Fe2+, as well as ferric-arsenate precipitation were accurately predicted.
