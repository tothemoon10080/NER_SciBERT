The search for suitable additives for boron suboxide (B6O) materials which could improve densification, reduce sintering temperature and tailor the microstructure has been of great importance. In an earlier study it was shown that transition metal borides qualify as sintering aids for B6O, but partial segregations of the boride secondary phases were found. In this work, efforts have been made to understand the chemical interaction between the B6O and boride phase. A reaction couple of sintered B6O, nickel and green compact B6O were assembled and heat-treated at 1850°C for 20min. XRD and SEM examinations of the reaction zone show the formation of nickel boride, diffusing into the B6O matrix and a substantial grain growth of B6O at the interface.In single crystalline form boron suboxide (B Attempts made to improve the fracture toughness by making polycrystalline B Thermodynamic considerations predicted that transition metals could be possible candidates as liquid phase sintering aids In an earlier study Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the interaction between B The starting B The milled B Pure B After the heat treatment, cross-sections of the reaction couples were polished using diamond slurry and were characterized using X-ray diffraction (PW1830; Philips; Cu Kα radiation, 2 Furthermore, B The phase analysis of the reaction zone shows the complete transformation of the metallic nickel into nickel boride, which agrees with the chemical reaction given in Eq.
