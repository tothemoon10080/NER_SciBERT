ZnO thin film was initially deposited on InP substrate by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering and the diffusion process was performed using the closed ampoule technique where Zn3P2 was used as the dopant source. To verify the junction formation of ZnO thin films, the electrical properties were measured, and the effects of Zn3P2 diffusion on ZnO thin films were investigated. It is observed that the electrical property of the film is changed from n-type to p-type by dopant diffusion effect. Based on the results, it is confirmed that ZnO thin films can be a potential candidate for ultraviolet (UV) optical devices.Recently, II–VI semiconductor materials have been of great interest due to application for luminescence devices such as a light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) In order to develop optical devices based on ZnO, however, reproducible p-type ZnO films with high quality as well as epitaxial ZnO films are necessary. It was known that the fabrication of p-type ZnO films is difficult because of the problems such as self-compensating process on doping and low solubility of the dopants In this paper, we report that ZnO layers deposited on p-InP substrate by rf magnetron sputtering exhibit change in electrical properties from n-type to p-type by dopant diffusion process. The structural and optical properties of diffused ZnO layer are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrical properties of diffused ZnO layer are analyzed by current–voltage ( The initial substrate of p-type InP has 3×10 The thickness and cross-sectional image of ZnO thin film was confirmed by field emission SEM (FESEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) scan in the In order to investigate the electrical properties of ZnO thin films, current–voltage (  In order to investigate the optical properties of ZnO homojunction deposited on p-type InP substrate after annealing, PL measurements were performed at room temperature and the results are shown in In order to examine the crystallinity of ZnO thin films, XRD analysis was performed and the results are shown in  The free carrier concentration versus depletion depth is extrapolated from the In this paper, the formation of p–n ZnO homojunction on p-InP substrate has been investigated. The ZnO thin film is formed by rf magnetron sputtering and is changed to p-type ZnO layer by dopant diffusion process. From the PL measurement, a strong emission peak was observed at 3.24
