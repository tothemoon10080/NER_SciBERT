The traditional (bio)electrochemical sensors for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection require expensive external power sources which restricts their practicability. In this research, a novel self-powered bioelectrochemical sensor using bioanode as the electrical supplier and CoMn2O4 nanoparticle modified graphite cathode (CoMn2O4@GE) as the sensing element was developed for H2O2 determination. Electrochemical tests revealed that the CoMn2O4@GE exhibited attractive electrocatalytic activity towards H2O2 reduction, due to the large catalyst surface area and abundant Mn3+/Mn2+ and Co3+/Co2+ electroactive sites. Under the optimized conditions (flow rate 5 mL min−1, pH 7.0) and external load of 300 Ω, the proposed sensor demonstrated a wide linear detection range between 1 and 1000 mM with a high sensitivity of 13.2 μA mM−1, a detection limit of 40.2 μM (S/N = 3) and a fast response time within 5 s. Furthermore, the sensor presented good reproducibility, acceptable selectivity and excellent long-time stability. This study will provide a new approach for sensitive, rapid, in situ, and real-time monitoring of H2O2 for wide range applications.The accurate and rapid detection of hydrogen peroxide (H A (bio)electrochemical sensor is usually a three-electrode system, which consists of a counter electrode, a reference electrode and a working electrode decorated with enzymes (e.g., horseradish peroxidase) [ (Bio)electrochemical sensors based on microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology have emerged as an attractive new sensing tool in recent years, due to their unique advantages to achieve self-powered, in situ, remote and long-term monitoring of various analytes [ In this work, we developed a novel self-powered bioelectrochemical sensor based on MFC technology for H All the reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade and used as received.
