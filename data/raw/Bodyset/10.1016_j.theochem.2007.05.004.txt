The geometric and electronic structures of non-IPR metallofullerenes La@C72 were studied using density functional theory. The geometric optimization show that among four possible configurations for La@C72, the most favorable endohedral position is off-center site along the C2 axis in Î± plane pointing to the 5, 5 bond, the fusion of two pentagons. The calculations of electronic properties show that the spin densities are distributed onto all the carbons of C72. And La ion has little distribution to molecular orbitals.Endohedral metallofullerenes, with atom(s) inside the carbon cage, have attracted wide attention because of their unique structure and numerous applications. Experimental The empty C Very recently, Wakahara et al. All calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) The electronic configuration of La is 4f According to the X-ray crystallographic results from Ref.  For La@C Known from the discussion above, La@C  To better understand the electronic structure of this endohedral fullerene, the total density of state (TDOS) of La@C At last, the vertical ionization potentials (VIPs) and the vertical electron affinities (VEAs) of non-IPR C All-electron relativistic density functional theory calculations of non-IPR metallofullerenes La@C We thank the Key Laboratory of Coal Science and Technology (Taiyuan University of Technology), Ministry of Education, for the software.
