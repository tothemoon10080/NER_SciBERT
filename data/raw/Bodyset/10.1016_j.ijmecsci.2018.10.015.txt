This paper investigates the buckling problem of a multiply connected bar-chain (MCB) system. Unlike the Hencky bar-chain that comprises rigid bars connected to each other by rotational springs, this MCB model has rigid bars connected by both direct and indirect neighbouring rotational springs that simulate the long range interactions between bars. The buckling loads of the MCB with two-neighbour and N-neighbour interactions are analytically obtained for simply supported, clamped-clamped and clamped-free boundary conditions. By continualizing the discrete equations associated with MCB, a nonlocal continuum model is constructed to predict the buckling behavior of nonlocal bars with short and long range interactions. It is shown that this continualized nonlocal model (CNM) is equivalent to a stress gradient type of Eringen's nonlocal media. By comparing the solutions between CNM and MCB, it is shown that CNM is a simple nonlocal continuum model that is able to capture the scale effect of a generalized lattice that includes multiple interactions among its components. The closed form expression of the length scale of CNM is derived in terms of the rotational spring stiffnesses of MCB.Lattice system is in principle based on a periodic arrangement of atoms or units interacting via springs and thereby forming a discrete spring network model Inspired by the multiple interactions between elements in topological mechanical materials, studying lattice system with direct and indirect neighbouring interactions is of interest. Axial vibration problem of lattice system comprising mass points multiply connected by lateral springs has been treated by Challamel et al. Furthermore, we shall establish a nonlocal continuum model by continualizing the difference equations associated with MCB for describing the buckling behavior of structures with built-in scale effect.	The continuum approach can be used in which the structure is considered in an average sense. The link between the lattice system with multiple interactions and nonlocal continuum models has already been mentioned in the open literature. A general problem of N-neighbour interaction lattice system was studied by Eringen and Kim In this paper, the buckling loads of MCB system with two neighbouring and N-neighbouring interactions are analytically calibrated for simply supported, clamped-clamped and clamped-free boundary conditions. By using a continuous approximation of the discrete equations for MCB, a nonlocal continuum model is established. Later on, the solutions of the continualized nonlocal model (CNM) are compared with exact MCB solutions and it is shown that the CNM is able to capture the scale effects of the generalized lattice that includes multiple interactions among its components. Consider a MCB with two neighbouring interactions with simply supported ends as shown in The potential energy of the MCB due to the deformation of internal rotational springs may be expressed as: By letting The work done by the axial load By minimizing the total energy with respect to  For The physical representation of the boundary conditions are shown in For The bending moments given by For Based on the relationship between shear force and bending moment Regarding the different boundary conditions, one may assume the general solution for  By substituting For the special case of β    These above mentioned results are the same as the conventional analytical solution for a bar-chain system with direct neighbouring interactions By replacing ( Correspondingly, the general solutions should be The substitution of In order to asymptotically converge to the continuum beam for infinite number of segments Note that In addition, we could physically assume that the weighting positive coefficient For the two neighbouring interactions, the constraint β Later on, we shall establish a CNM that could efficiently approximate the buckling behavior of the two neighbouring interactive bar-chain system.

The values of the buckling loads decrease with increasing number In view of For clamped-clamped boundary conditions, the transverse displacement field has to vanish: For the MCB, the transverse displacement and the rotational angle satisfy the following relationship: The displacement can be integrated from the first-order difference The displacement can be equivalently re-expressed as: Then we have For
