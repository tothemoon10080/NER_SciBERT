Non linear modelling of data in photomineralization kinetics of organic micropollutants, by photocatalytic membranes immobilizing semiconductors (TiO2 particularly) has been previously applied to methane, phenol and to 2,4-dichlorophenol as model molecules, by using a four parameters kinetic modelling based on substrate disappearance and total organic carbon (TOC) in laboratory scale experiments, as a function of initial concentration of substrate and of irradiance.
                  In the present paper, the photocatalytic degradation of diclofenac as model molecule was investigated in a pilot plant module, fitted with 2–3 concentric membranes. Maximum allowable quantum efficiencies corresponded to equal distances between 3 membranes immobilizing photocatalyst. This arrangement fully behaves as if a photocatalyst nanopowder would be homogeneously suspended in the reactor, but obviating all drawbacks of a nanopowder suspension.Photoinduced grafting and graft polymerization onto polymers have been investigated since the early 60's of the last century, as an elegant and powerful method to modify surface properties. The systematic interpretation of their kinetics, from the photochemical point of view, however, dates to about 20 years later Combination of photocatalysis in the presence of semiconductors From the point of view of mechanisms of surface photochemical reactions that take place in heterogeneous systems, the validity of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model has been assumed to hold, but also criticized Modelling of photocatalytic reactions, in a wide range of concentrations, and over all the kinetic concentration profile of Total Organic Carbon (TOC), leading to full mineralization, has been systematically considered Photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), as a model molecule, has been widely studied in literature It is well known that, after the first act of radiation absorption by the semiconductor, photogenerated holes react with hydroxyl groups of water to give hydroxyl radicals The modelling of the two kinds of data has been considered According to the model, mineralization of substrate The conservative balance of carbon has to be accounted for and verified experimentally from TOC analysis. Integration of Eqs. At The characteristic plateau of TOC content In most cases, both The values drawn from Eq. By using the optimised parameters reported in Section Quantum yields Previous work with a range 0.10–4.4 W cm To explain the behaviour of these curves a competition kinetics of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with themselves to give hydrogen peroxide, accompanied by the reaction of these radicals leading to mineralization of substrate may be first envisaged, such as given by  and its rate  At low photon flows, at which the concentration of hydroxyl radicals formed by irradiation onto the semiconductor surface is relatively low, This hypothesis obviously corresponds to stating that each absorbed photon, in the optimal conditions of a membrane photoreactor, should give rise to a hydroxyl radical, at every In order to verify preliminarily the suitableness of kinetic model defined by Eq.  To sum up, only the model given by both The photocatalytic mineralization of 2-[2,6-(dichlorophenyl)amino]phenyl acetic acid (diclofenac (DCF)) and its modelling by hydrothermal anatase nanocrystals either free or immobilized in porous silica matrix (TS), to evaluate the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been previously investigated In the present paper, some pre-industrial pilot plant experiments on DCF solutions are presented, with the purpose of comparing kinetic data obtained by a pre-industrial module with those of modelling and testing operative experiments on this pre-industrial module. TiO The module was connected to a 1.5 m The absorbed power per unit membrane length was 0.3 W cm During irradiation course aliquots were withdrawn and analysed for TOC determinations. The experiments were carried out in four different conditions: By running 3–5 kinetic curves of TOC As observable in In the present paper, specifically, annular industrial membrane modules have been used and applied to mineralize pharmaceutical compounds and residues, by employing DCF as model molecule. The presence of a sorbent in a membrane structure, such as the structure which has been obtained by the photografting method used to manufacture the photocatalytic membranes employed in the present work, or the equivalent method employing ceramic supports and membranes, affords an alternative concept in membrane science and technology, since the endothermic step of creating a molecular size cavity for the reacting species is virtually eliminated. At the same time, the thinnest of all conceivable membranes may be realized, consisting in a monolayer where the adsorbed molecules interact directly with their surroundings. Finally, comparison of results of the present paper with those of the previous one
