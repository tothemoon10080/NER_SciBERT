The solubility of zinc oxide in sodium hydroxide solution was measured in a closed polytetrafluoroethylene vessel from 25 to 100 Â°C. The ZnO solubility was determined by employing the method of isothermal solution saturation. The results show that only ZnO solid exists in the equilibrium state in the low concentration alkali regions, and the solubility of zinc oxide is almost invariable with temperature. With the increase of alkali concentration, equilibrium solid turns from ZnO to NaZn(OH)3 suddenly, this mutation is called invariant point, 3: 55ents on the X-ray intensities from Ti3-2aL ce dynamics of the compounds AlCo and AlNi []tweight. The alkali concentration of the invariant points increases with increasing temperature, but the solubility of NaZn(OH)3 decreases with increasing alkali concentration at the same temperature. At the same Na2O concentration, the higher the temperature is, the higher the solubility of NaZn(OH)3 is.
