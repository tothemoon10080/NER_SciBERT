The paper shows: (a) the results of pyrite oxidation by gaseous oxygen in water suspension at high temperatures in an autoclave and (b) the results of simultaneous leaching of Mn4+ from pyrolusite ore by H2SO4 and FeSO4, the products of pyrite oxidation. It was shown that both processes occurred successfully with almost complete pyrite oxidation and a high degree of leaching of manganese. Both processes occur according to the laws of first-order reactions compared to the quantities of FeS2 and MnO2 in suspension, with activation energies of 65±0.8 kJ/mol and 97±0.5 kJ/mol, respectively.The chemical affinity of manganese toward oxygen, particularly of its lowest oxide, is significantly higher than is the case with a number of metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni) The above mentioned features make the pyrometallurgical processing of manganese ores expensive. Therefore, manganese and ferromanganese can economically be obtained only from ores in which the manganese content is over 35% Special difficulties are encountered in applying hydrometallurgical processing if manganese is found in the ore in the form of MnO In order to investigate the feasibility of the above idea pyrite oxidation by gaseous oxygen has been studied first, and then simultaneous manganese leaching by the products of its oxidation (FeSO The experiments of pyrite oxidation by gaseous oxygen and simultaneous pyrite oxidation, and manganese leaching from pyrolusite ore by the products of its oxidation, have been carried out in a 5-l stainless steel autoclave with electric heating. The autoclave enabled: (1) automatic temperature regulation and maintaining it constant within ±1.5°C; (2) introduction of oxygen and keeping the values of A flotation pyrite concentrate with the following content (%) has been used: 46.50 S; 42.80 Fe; 3.75 Al After the suspension of pyrite concentrate or the mixture of pyrite concentrate and pyrolusite ore was put into the autoclave and when the working temperature was reached the oxygen was introduced and reaction time measured from that moment. The quantity of iron, sulphuric acid and manganese leached into the solution, as well as of other reaction products, followed by a continuous taking of suspension samples at set intervals, was determined by standard methods of chemical analysis. The phase content of solid reaction products was determined by X-ray and DTA analysis. The chemical processes of pyrite oxidation in water suspension by gaseous oxygen have been determined on the basis of: determining reaction products in the solution and the solid residue by chemical analysis, DTA and X-ray analysis, as well as by calculating the reactions' standard Gibbs' energy (Δ Within the idea of the simultaneous leaching of tetravalent manganese by the products of pyrite oxidation according to reaction 2, the given chemical reactions (3–9) show that the quantity of reducer FeSO From the point of view of the possibility of MnO The oxidation degree of pyrite and the products of pyrite oxidation have been investigated to show their dependence on: temperature (110–200°C), partial pressure of oxygen (202.6–1013.0 kPa), quantity of pyrite concentrate (20–100 g/l) particle size of pyrite concentrate (100% −74 μm to 100% −833 μm) concentration of free H As with all autoclave processes, temperature is the most important factor in their intensification and degree of reaction. In this particular case temperature influence (110–200°C) has been investigated in the neutral suspension with 20 g/l of pyrite, particle size 100% −833 μm), The results ( Kinetic curves showing the influence of: (1) partial pressure of oxygen (200°C, 20 g/l FeS The increase in partial pressure of oxygen ( With the increase in the quantity of pyrite concentrate ( The increase in the rate and degree of pyrite oxidation can be obtained by grinding the pyrite concentrate due to augmentation of reaction surface ( The free H The quantity of pyrite and free H Experimental results of the dependence of the reaction degree of pyrite on temperature ( The activation energy ( Within the given results of oxidation in water suspension by gaseous oxygen at high temperatures in the autoclave, the process of simultaneous leaching of manganese from pyrolusite ore (MnO Depending on the values of working parameters the investigation has focused on: the degree of manganese leaching and the quantity of H The influence of the following working parameters has been investigated: partial pressure of oxygen (202.6–1013.0 kPa), quantity of pyrite in the mixture (20–50%) leaching temperature (200–230°C) The results obtained are given in The quantities of remaining H With the increase in pyrite quantity ( For the ore used, obtaining the theoretical quantity of manganese leached by the products of pyrite oxidation is not possible without 30% of FeS The quantity of leached manganese as well as the quantity of the remaining H At the same time, high leaching degree of manganese is followed by a small quantity of H From the results ( The same reaction order for manganese leaching as well as for pyrite oxidation is logical with respect to the fact that both processes occur simultaneously and that oxidation occurs before leaching. Rate constants have been calculated from the plots, slopes ( On the basis of the experiments, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Complete oxidation of FeS (2) A high leaching degree of manganese amounting to 93–99% can be obtained by the products of pyrite oxidation from the suspension of pyrite and pyrolusite ore in carrying out these processes simultaneously. (3) It was proved that manganese leaching is highly selective with respect to iron leaching (1–2 g/l) under given conditions and followed by a small quantity of the remaining free H (4) The reactions of pyrite oxidation and manganese leaching are first-order reactions with respect to the quantities of unoxidised pyrite and unleached manganese from the ore, with activation energies amounting to 65±0.8 and 97±0.5 kJ/mol K, respectively.
