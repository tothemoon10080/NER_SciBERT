An innovative in situ reaction technique is developed for the synthesis of Al2O3/Al and Al2O3/Cu composites. This technique provides a new approach overcoming the problems of loss and agglomeration of reinforcement particles when the particles are added directly into their matrixes by a conventional ex situ technique. The experimental results have shown that the presence of network Al(Cu)–CuAl2 eutectic, which is detrimental not only to the fracture toughness, but also to the stability of the microstructure, can be reduced from the final product by introducing two or more oxides into the synthesis. Moreover, the network CuAl2 phase can be eliminated entirely only by changing Al matrix into Cu matrix when Al amount is not excess in the Al–CuO preforms. The mechanisms of formation or absence of Al(Cu)–CuAl2 eutectic in the Al2O3/Al and Al2O3/Cu composites are explained based upon thermodynamics of the systems. The modification of the microstructures in the in situ synthesis Al2O3/Al, Al2O3/Al–Si–Cu, Al2O3/Al–Si–Cu–Mn and Al2O3/Cu composites can be understood in the light of thermodynamics.Particle-reinforced metal matrix composite prepared by melt in situ synthesis is a new technique, in which element and compound powder or preforms are put into a molten metal. The required reinforced particles can be synthesized directly using the radiative action between the reactants in the melt. There are several obvious merits using this technique: (1) the in situ reinforcements are more homogeneous in microstructures and more thermodynamically stable; (2) the in situ formed reinforcements are free from contamination, which leads to strong interfacial bonding between the reinforcements and the matrix; (3) this new approach has been applied to a wide range of matrix materials (including aluminum, copper, iron, titanium and nickel) and different second phase particles (including carbides, borides, oxides, nitrides, and their mixtures) Recently, the displacement reactions between metal oxides, such as Fe Since both Al and Cu are face-centered cubic structure, and the difference of their lattice parameters is not very large Commercial pure Al (98% purity), analytical reagent CuO, SiO The specimens were etched in a solution of mixed acids (2  Considering the equilibrium state of the reaction, the equilibrium constant In the processing of composite II, the CuO and SiO With reference to the reactions described in Eqs.  As we know, it is necessary to make composition modifications by adding alloying elements like Cu, Mg, Fe, Ni and Mn to the Al–Si alloys in order to improve the mechanical properties of the alloys Although the amount of the network CuAl Comparing The higher the The Al  A novel technique, with which Al The network CuAl The network CuAl The authors acknowledge the supports by the Cultivation Fund of the Key Scientific and Technical Innovation Project,
