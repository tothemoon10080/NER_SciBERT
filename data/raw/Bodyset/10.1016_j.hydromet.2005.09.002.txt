This special issue collects selected papers from the symposium on Teaching and Learning Hydrometallurgical Science and Engineering held during the 2002 Annual Meeting of The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS) in Seattle, WA (February 17â€“21, 2002). Additional papers from the symposium will appear in a later issue of the journal. The goal of the symposium was to bring together people from academia and industry to discuss the issues and challenges involved in: (a) educating students and practicing engineers and scientists in hydrometallurgy, and (b) learning and integrating the science and engineering of hydrometallurgy. This was the first such meeting and it is hoped that future symposia on this important topic will follow. The editors thank the authors for their contributions and the referees for their many thoughtful comments.
