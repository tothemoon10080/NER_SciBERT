Carbon material was produced from the graphitization of glucose at high temperature in flowing argon. The produced carbon material was characterized using Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and XRD. Carbon slurry of the produced carbon was made in ethanol by using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as surfactant. Carbon slurry was coated homogeneously on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass by a doctor blade technique and applied as counter electrode for dye synthesized solar cell. The current density (J) and open circuit voltage (V
                     OC) of fabricated cell was 8.30mAcmâˆ’2 and 0.77V respectively. The efficiency of the cell was 3.63%, which is comparable to 5.82% of cell with platinum counter electrode under the same experimental conditions.Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention due to ease of fabrication, low cost and high conversion efficiency Among all the materials carbon materials (carbon black, graphite, carbon nanotubes, graphene etc.) have been studied by many researchers Carbon material was produced from the graphitization of glucose (Glucon-D, Heinz) (5 The produced carbon from the graphitization of glucose at 1400 FEG-SEM of carbon produced by glucose ( The redox reaction Higher current density was observed in carbon based counter electrode as compared to platinum. This is due to the availability of higher catalytic sites for redox reaction in carbon electrode than platinum. As observed from the FEG-SEM images, carbon has highly porous structure and hence in the carbon film higher active sites are obtained than platinum possessing a dense film as shown in Carbon material was produced by graphitization of glucose in flowing argon at high temperature. The produced carbon showed flake like particles and each flake was made of small carbon particles. The particle size ( The authors are grateful to SAIF department IIT Bombay.
