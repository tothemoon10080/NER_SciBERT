A copper sulfation reaction from a molybdenite concentrate (42%Mo and 3.6%Cu) was conducted with sulfuric acid by microwave heating (190â€“240C) in a batch-type process at ambient pressure. A minimum energy consumption of about 0.9 (MWh/ton) was required to decrease the copper content of the molybdenite concentrate from 3.6% to less than 0.1% (>95% sulfation) in less than 15 minutes. The sulfation time decreased by increasing the power supply level, but there were restrictions of gas transport, froth generation and acid entrainment. A slurry containing 1.8 acid ton/conc. ton was required to avoid solid roasting during the leaching process. Elemental sulfur and cupric sulphate were generated from copper minerals leaching while molybdenite and pyrite dissolution were minimum. After the bulk copper sulfation it was found that elemental sulfur, present in the original concentrate and generated by leaching, reacted with sulfuric acid to produce SO2. This reaction was responsible for a significant acid consumption up to 3 times higher than the stoichiometric requirement for copper sulfation. From results of sulfation kinetic, gas evolution rate, chemical and mineralogical analysis, the basic chemical reactions for sulfation of copper sulfides were identified, and a diffusion controlled leaching model showed a good agreement with experimental data from microwave assisted copper sulfation.
