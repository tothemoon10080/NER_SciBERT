Selenium disulfide (SeS2)–based composites have received much attention as a promising cathode material for high-energy lithium metal batteries due to their higher theoretical capacity (1342 mAh g−1) than that of selenium (675 mAh g−1) and less severe shuttle effect than that of sulfur. However, Li–SeS2 batteries still suffer from two main challenges: (1) the development of stabilized lithium metal anodes maintaining the functional interface during cycling and (2) the high-performance SeS2 cathodes allowing long cycle life with good rate capability. Herein, we report a dense, stable LiF-rich, and conductive Li3N-rich protection layer formed in situ on lithium metal surface by the co-presence of pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquid and LiNO3 in the electrolyte. Such unique protective layer led to little morphological changes of lithium anode over cycling and effectively mitigated the growth of lithium dendrites and the unwanted side reactions with soluble cathode intermediates. The protected lithium metal anode also showed good cycling stability of repeated plating/stripping over 400 h at a practical current density of 2 mA cm−2, which is important for the safe operation of lithium metal batteries. When paired with 3D interconnected hierarchical SeS2 cathodes, Li–SeS2 battery showed good cycling performance over 500 cycles with much improved Coulombic efficiency (>98.9%) with the capacity decay of less than 0.08% per cycle after stabilization. These findings suggest a promise of stabilized lithium metal anode through the in situ formation of protective layer coupled with functional cathode design, taking one step closer toward the development of high-energy Li metal batteries with long cycle life.Rechargeable batteries with high energy density have received much attention for emerging technologies such as all electric vehicles with long driving ranges [ Recently, selenium sulfide (Se Without effective stabilization and protection, bulk Li can be further degraded by interacting with liquid electrolytes during cycling, which results in continuous Li dendrite growth and evolution of dead Li [ The commonly used electrolytes for Li–SeS In this work, SeS Selenium disulfide (SeS Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were observed by FEI Quanta 200F (Field Emission Instruments, USA). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images were obtained using FESEM (FEI Sirion 200). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using a Tecnai G2 20 Twin (Field Emission Instruments, USA). The content (wt%) of selenium disulfide in the nanocomposite was determined via a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (Discovery, TA Instruments). The samples were put in a platinum pan and heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min The as-prepared SeS The comparison of XRD, TGA and the electrochemical performance of bulk sulfur and selenium disulfide are demonstrated in The SEM images in As schematically demonstrated in N Furthermore, the internal microstructure of SeS Supplementary video related to this article can be found at The following are the supplementary data related to this article: The synthesized hierarchical SeS The shuttle effect is caused by the dissolution and diffusion of soluble intermediates towards Li metal anode and is exacerbated at a low current density, which is a key challenge to be addressed to achieve a long cycle life of high-energy Li–SeS Cycling performance of Li–SeS Based on the above results, cycled Li–SeS To further evaluate the synergistic effect of Py As shown in The proposed formation pathways of stable and conductive SEI layer in E3 are shown in The EIS results of Li–SeS The suppression mechanism of shuttle effect in Li–SeS The Li plating/stripping measurement of symmetric Li/electrolyte/Li cells were performed to investigate the cyclability of Li metal anode with various electrolytes. Three symmetric Li/Li cells with E1, E2, and E3 electrolytes were assembled and cycled under the same current density of 0.5 mA cm Additionally, two more symmetric Li/Li cells with E2 and E3 electrolytes, respectively, were assembled and tested at a practical current density of 2 mA cm In summary, we demonstrated the stabilization of Li metal anode via in situ surface protection by the co-presence of Py The authors declare no competing financial interest.
