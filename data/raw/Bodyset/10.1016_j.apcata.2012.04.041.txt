Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) using H2/CO/CO2 syngas mixtures over cobalt and iron based catalysts was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. CO2 rich feeds produce products that are mostly light hydrocarbons with higher molar paraffin to olefin (P/O) ratio, whereas CO rich feeds shift the product composition to an FT type product with higher olefin product selectivity over both iron and cobalt based catalysts. Although the P/O ratio for FTS is strongly dependent on the operating conditions, the experimental evidence shows that the linear relationship between P
                     (n+1)/O
                     (n+1) and P
                     (n)/O
                     (n) holds for a large number of experiments. It is also shown to be independent of the type of the reactor, the composition of the syngas, reaction conditions and the kind of catalyst. Two features about the ratio of ξ

                        n>2 are higher than 1, fairly constant and independent of chain length n; (2) with chain length n

                  A simple vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) model indicates that the ratio of P
                     (n+1)/O
                     (n+1) to P
                     (n)/O
                     (n) changes in a range of (1, 1/β), where β is the variation of the vapor pressure coefficient, which is related to the incremental energy of vaporization per CH2 unit of the hydrocarbon chain. Our experimental results support the expression when the chain length n
                     >2. But with chain length n
                     =2, this expression is unable to explain the relationship between P

                     2/O
                     2. Another model, based on quasi reaction equilibrium, is developed to explain the linear relationship between P
                     (n+1)/O
                     (n+1) and P
                     (n)/O
                     (n). We assume that the reaction of C
                        n+1H2n+2
                     +C
                        n
                     H2n+2
                     =C
                        n+1H2n+4
                     +C

                     H2n
                      reaches quasi-equilibrium. Because the experimental results are quite close to the equilibrium calculations, we postulate that the product distribution might be determined by considering reaction equilibrium.The conversion of syngas to mainly straight chain hydrocarbons with wide carbon number distribution via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is becoming a promising route to meet the continuously increasing demand for liquid fuels and chemical feed-stocks Hydrogenation of CO The Various models which consider diffusion With the aim of developing a novel and generic relationship among FT experiments were carried out in two micro-FBRs of the same kind (internal diameter of 8 Two syngas mixtures which consisted of H Syngas 1: named “CO syngas”, a mixture of H Syngas 2: named “CO Both of the two syngas mixtures contained 10% N Approximately 1 Briefly, the operating procedures for FT reaction were set as follows: once the reduction was completed, the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The CO One gram of iron catalyst was loaded into the other micro-FBR. The detailed information about the procedures of the iron catalyst reduction and FT reaction and the analysis method for the experiments has been described in our previous work Each of the reaction conditions, as shown in In our previous work the results of FT CO/CO In this paper, only the products of α-olefin and n-paraffin were taken into account, because of the following reasons: (1) based on our analysis results, the major FTS products in our experiments were straight chain α-olefins and n-paraffins; and (2) in order to be consistent with the references’ data The light α-olefin and n-paraffin product formation rates as a function of syngas composition as shown in  The results from We conclude that the linear relationship between In order to see if the trend is general, we used data from the open literature Combining all the data from (1) with The values of With With When we re-plot the data in It is worth noting that the data from Refs. Based on the comparison between the authors’ work and the literature results, the linear relationship between (1) with Some researchers considered plotting the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution of olefins and paraffins separately Substituting Eqs. Eqs. If the olefin chain growth factor is increased the paraffin chain growth factor will increase as described by Eqs. Any of the factors that can affect the olefin product spectrum and change the olefin chain growth factor will also act on the paraffin spectrum so that the paraffin chain growth factor will change as described in Eqs. Therefore, the experimental results provide some insights on the limit of the variability of the product distribution in FTS to improve or change the product selectivity for the design of the FTS process and FT catalyst. We will next develop two simple models which may be able to explain the results. For FTS, if the hydrocarbon chain is postulated to be formed stepwise by the insertion or addition of CH In our present work, the low temperature FT reaction conditions over cobalt and iron catalysts are shown in All or the majority of the products leave the reactor in the vapor phase. There is a liquid layer on the catalyst surface. At the interface, the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium. Many previous studies claim that α-olefins and to some extent n-paraffins are the major primary products of FT synthesis If we suppose that the secondary reaction rate of α-olefins is a function of the concentration of α-olefins on the catalyst surface, then: At the interface, wax and vapor are in equilibrium and thus the mole fraction of an olefin with chain length We can rearrange to obtain the following equation to express the At steady state, the following equation can be obtained to express the ratio of Caldwell and van Vuuren Substituting Eq. Based on Eq. The explanation of the model results from Eq. If If If  The expression of Eq. Based on the data from With With chain length The VLE based model developed previously can explain only that the ratio of If we subtract Reaction If we assume that this reaction reaches quasi-equilibrium, the equilibrium constant for Reaction If one compares Eqs. Eq. The Gibbs Free Energy and enthalpy of formation involved in each reaction can be evaluated from the standard energy of formation of each compound using the following thermodynamic equations: Based on Eqs. Based on The values of the With chain length With chain length It is both predicted from the calculation and found from the experimental data that Because the equilibrium constant FTS experiments over iron and cobalt based catalysts were carried out in a fixed-bed micro reactor. Two feed gases, one of composition H The data show that the product selectivity is strongly dependent on the syngas composition ( Based on the comparison between the authors’ work and the literature results, the linear relationship between By considering a VLE based model, a new expression describing the ratio of A model based on a quasi thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is introduced to explain the linear relationship between By focusing on the paraffin to olefin ratio with different chain length The authors are grateful for the support received from
