The wrist surgeon must be conversant with the many methods of treating scaphoid nonunions. Cancellous bone grafting combined with K-wire fixation is a relatively straightforward technique that has been shown in several studies to predictably produce healing of scaphoid nonunions. Although there may be a trend toward early use of vascularized bone grafts for the treatment of scaphoid nonunions, it would seem reasonable to reserve that procedure for cases in which the vascular supply to the scaphoid fragments is compromised, and for which there is little hope that a nonvascularized bone graft will succeed.
