The laws of motion of particle groups in a jigging process are studied. These describe the macroscopic phenomena that occur during jigging. During jigging the heavier and bigger particles concentrate at the bed bottom while lighter and smaller particles move to the upper part of the bed. Particles with equivalent properties tend to concentrate at a certain position centered around the inherent height of their distribution. The particle distribution variance gradually diminishes to some asymptotic value. The state equation group of the jigging bed is deduced and a calculation method, called the Î» value judgment method, is proposed. The method is used to calculate the layer number and the inherent height of each particle group. A mathematical expression for the particle distribution variance is also given.
