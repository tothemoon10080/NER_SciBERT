Anti-osteoporotic effects of the newly synthesized coumarin–pyridine hybrids were evaluated in primary cultures of rat calvarial osteoblasts in vitro. Compounds 6a, i, j and k were potent in stimulating osteoblast differentiation and mineralization as assessed by the alkaline phosphatase production and alizarin red-S staining assay, respectively. These compounds were also found to be nontoxic in osteoblast cells as compared to the control group in an MTT assay. Furthermore, the effect of these compounds on the transcript levels of osteogenic genes revealed that the compound 6j robustly enhanced mineralization of the osteogenic genes in calvarial osteoblasts. In this context, compound 6j was selected as a potential lead for further structural optimization in the development of new anti-osteoporotic agents.Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder, due to the unequal coupling between osteoclast mediated bone resorption and osteoblast mediated bone formation Coumarins are an important class of plant secondary metabolites which possess a diverse range of biological activities Interestingly, recent report suggests that the pyridine ring containing compounds may modulate anti-osteoporotic activity The synthesis of target and intermediate compounds is outlined in Mice calvarial osteoblast cultures were performed using 25–30 calvariae from 1 to 2 day old mice pups (both sexes). Calvarias were surgically isolated from skull; sutures were segregated and adherent tissue material cleaned by gentle scrapping. Isolated calveriae were pooled and kept for repeated digestion (15 min/digestion) with 0.1% dispase and 0.1% collagenase-1 was used to release cell. Supernatant of first digestion was discarded, cells from the next three digestions were pooled and cultured in α modified essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (complete growth medium). For experiment 70–80% confluent mice calvarial osteoblast were used At 70–80% confluent mice calvarial osteoblast was used for trypsinization and 2 × 10 For mineralization mice calvarial osteoblast were seeded onto 12-well plates (10,000 cells/well) in osteoblast differentiation medium. Mice calvarial osteoblasts were cultured with or without compound 18 for 21 days and after every 48 h media were changed. At the end of the experiment, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The fixed cells were stained with alizarin red-S (40 mM, pH 4.5) for 30 min followed by washing with water. Stained cells were first photographed under light microscope, and extraction of alizarin stain was carried out by using 10% (v/v) acetic acid with shaking at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were scrapped out from wells, centrifuged (20,000 × Mice calvarial osteoblast was used to test toxicity of synthesized compounds ( The synthesized compounds ( After ALP activity, the most active compounds In order to further validate and identify the most potent osteogenic agent, we further examined the effect of compounds on the expression of osteogenic genes (Runx-2, BMP-2 and COL-1) in calvarial osteoblasts by quantitative PCR (qPCR) In terms of structure activity relationship (SAR), in general most unsymmetrical coumarin–pyridine hybrids ( A series of coumarin–pyridine hybrids were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-osteoporotic activity in calvarial osteoblast cells. Out of all compounds screened, compounds All reagents were commercial and were used without further purification. Chromatography was carried on silica gel (60–120 and 100–200 mesh). All reactions were monitored by TLC; silica gel plates with fluorescence F254 were used. Melting points were uncorrected. The 2-alkyl phenol (1.0 equiv.) and hexamethylenetetramine (1.2 equiv.) were dissolved in TFA and the solution was heated at 120 °C for 3 h.
