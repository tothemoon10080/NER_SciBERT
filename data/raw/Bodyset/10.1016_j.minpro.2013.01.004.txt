The process on leaching of rare earth from the lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores with ammonium sulfate solution was elucidated and optimized with the chromatographic plate theory. The effects of the flowrate, the packed ore height, the concentration of leach reagents and leach reagent consumption on leaching performance were examined with column elution. It was found that the relationship between the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) and leaching flowrate can be described by the van Deemter equation. There is an optimum flowrate in the leaching process. It provides a scientific approach to leaching the lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores with high efficiency and low reagent consumption, and is applied to optimize the leach process and extraction conditions, to improve the rare earth received rate and to reduce the NH4+â€“N pollution.The weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth is a new-type exogenesis rare earth mineral, which was first found in China ( This kind of rare earth ore occurs in the crust of weathering mineral deposit and the grade of the rare earth are low ( However, with years of exploitation on weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth, the amount of the rich ore are sharply reduced, the ores resource become poorer and become the lean ore, whose rare earth grade less than 0.05%, has received more and more attentions in recent years, but there are some practice problems, such as the impurity in the ores become more complication, the permeability of the rare earth ores becomes worse, the leach liquor concentration of the rare earth ore becomes lower caused by leach effect being worse and leach selectivity being lower ( Thus, in order to provides theory basis for making reasonable and full using of these lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore (less than 0.05%) ( The experimental lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore sample, is collected from Zudong Rare Earth Mine area located in the Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, China, the main chemical composition of ore sample is listed in  The partitioning of rare earth ore sample has been determined by Jiangxi Analytical and Testing Center, Nanchang, China with ICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, SCIEX ELAN 9000 type), the analysis result is listed in As shown in The existing state of rare earth in the LN lean rare earth ore was determined with the sequential fractionating extraction methods ( The rare earth exists mainly with ion-exchangeable phase, which account for 81.67% from The leaching reagent used in this experiment was the (NH The experiment was processed in apparatus which is similar to the glass column used in chromatographic experiments ( The leaching experiments were carried out in room temperature. The system pH is 4.5. The RE The rare earth content of ion-exchangeable phase was determined by column elution method ( The total rare earth content of the rare earth ore analytical methods: acidifying and purifying the ore sample after being fused with sodium peroxide and sodium hydroxide. And then, the rare earth content can be determined by arsenazo (III) spectrophosphorimetry ( The rare earth partitioning analytical methods: acidification of the ore samples after being fused with sodium peroxide and sodium hydroxide. And then, determine rare earth partitioning of the ore samples by ICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, SCIEX ELAN 9000 type). In this research, the process on leaching of rare earths from the weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore was similar to ion-exchange chromatographic column elution process, so the packed rare earth ore is appropriately called a stationary phase, and the lixiviant solution is commonly described as a mobile phase ( For the lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores leach system, the mass transfer in the leaching process can be modeled with the plate theory treatment. The efficiency of leaching was expressed by the height equivalent to a theoretical plate ( From the leaching curves constructed with experiment datum, the The theoretical plate height given as: The number of theoretical plates ( In the equations above, These expressions assume a Gaussian (symmetrical) peak. In these expressions the units for the quantities inside the brackets must be consistent so that their ratio is dimensionless. The numerator is a volume, then peak width also is expressed in terms of volume. A number ( The changes of In the equation above, The van Deemter equation was the result of the first application of rate theory to the chromatography elution process. This equation relates the variance per unit length of a separation column to the linear mobile phase velocity by considering physical, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. These properties include pathways within the column, diffusion (axial and longitudinal), and mass transfer kinetics between stationary and mobile phases. The van Deemter equation is a hyperbolic function that predicts that there is an optimum velocity at which there will be the minimum variance per unit column length and, thence, a maximum efficiency. In order to know the effect the leaching flow-rate has on From the diagram, it can be seen that the leaching curves are different under varying flowrates. The  The purpose of this experiment is to discover the role that packed ore height plays on From the diagram, the From In this experiment, the effect of leaching reagent concentration on The calculation of The effects of leaching reagent consumption on The leaching curve is shown in Again the The process in leaching of the lean weathering crust elution-deposited rare earth ores could described with chromatographic plate theory. The effects of the flowrate ( The results will help find a scientific novel approach to the lean weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores with high efficiency and low reagent consumption and is applied to optimize the leach process and extraction conditions, to improve the rare earth received rate and to reduce the NH The work presented in this manuscript was funded by the
