The ultrafine grained WC–10Co–0.45Cr3C2–0.25VC alloys were fabricated through planetary ball milling and low pressure sintering. The effects of the cobalt particle size, milling speed and sintering temperature on the microstructure, hardness and fracture toughness of the ultrafine grained alloys were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing. The results showed that the mechanical properties of the low pressure-sintered alloys substantially depend on the milling speed and sintering temperature. At the same time, the hardness and fracture toughness of the samples can be increased from 1703MPa and 8.90MNm−3/2 to 1789MPa and 11.21MNm−3/2, respectively, when the cobalt particle size is reduced from 17μm to 1.4μm.WC–Co cemented carbides have been widely used as machining, cutting, mining and drilling tools, as well as wear parts and chip-less forming tools, due to their unique combination of extremely high hardness, excellent wear resistance and good toughness To fabricate the final ultrafine grained cemented carbides, one of the significant procedures is preparing fine and homogeneous WC–Co composite powders. Many techniques have been developed to synthesize WC–Co composite powders, such as spray conversion process Sintering is another important procedure to obtain dense and ultrafine grained cemented carbides, since WC grain growth occurs during the conventional pressure-less sintering In principle, many factors will affect the microstructures and mechanical properties of WC–Co materials during the fabrication process, including shape and granularity of the starting WC particles, composition of the WC–Co powders, selection and content of the grain growth inhibitors, mixing/milling conditions, overall carbon stoichiometry, and sintering conditions In this paper, planetary ball milling method plus low-pressure sintering was used to fabricate nanocrystalline WC–Co composite powders. The effects of the cobalt particle size, milling speed and sintering temperature on the microstructure, density, fracture toughness and hardness of the ultrafine grained WC–Co materials have been studied. The ultrafine WC powders used in this study have an average grain size of about 0.2 The density of the sintered specimens was measured by Archimedes methods, while Micro-Plus laser diffraction particle size analyzer was employed to measure the powder size. The sintered alloys were grinded and polished by diamond pastes, followed by broken up using a hammer. The microstructures and fracture surface of the prepared bulk samples as well as the composition of certain phases were studied using a JEOL-6510 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an FEI Nano230 SEM equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The mean grain size of the sintered specimens was derived from the linear intercept method measured on the 30 Hardness was measured by Vickers indentation with 30 The porosity of alloys was calculated as follows:       It can be seen from The effects of the cobalt particle size on the Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of the alloys 1 and 2 have also been shown in   It can be seen that finer initial cobalt powders can effectively reduce the WC grain size, residual porosity, local WC grain growth and cobalt pooling of the fabricated alloys, compared to the coarser cobalt powders. This improved microstructural homogeneity is directly due to the better distribution of the cobalt throughout the formulated powders. Mort and Riman Homogeneous microstructures result in a high performance of the mechanical properties such as the hardness and fracture toughness, as presented in It can be seen from The results of the hardness and fracture toughness measurements showed that the alloys milled at 300 Higher hardness is a great advantage for WC–Co cemented carbides used as cutting, mining, chip-less forming tools and wear parts. A higher hardness usually results in greater wear resistance and increase in the tool life. At a low intensive milling speed of 200 One of the most important factors during fabricating ultrafine grained WC–Co cemented carbides with high mechanical properties is the controlling of the sintering process. In the present work, liquid phase sintering has been used since the lowest sintering temperature of 1400 The results in It can be seen from This paper studied the effects of the cobalt particle size, milling speed and sintering temperature on the microstructure, hardness and fracture toughness of the ultrafine grained WC–10Co–0.45Cr This work is supported by the
