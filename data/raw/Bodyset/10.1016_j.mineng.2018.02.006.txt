The recovery of nickel from the sulphide deposits is becoming more expensive and thus increasing attention is being paid to the nickeliferous laterite ores. One option being considered for the extraction of nickel would be the production of a concentrate by reduction and magnetic separation of the ferronickel alloy. The utilization of methane as a reducing agent offers some environmental benefits when compared to carbon. In this paper, thermodynamic modelling has been used to investigate the pyrometallurgical reduction of a saprolitic laterite ore by methane. The effects of methane additions, temperature, and ore composition on the nickel grade and nickel recovery were determined. It was found that nickel recoveries of 90% could be achieved at about 1000 °C with nickel grades of about 60%. The majority of the reduction was due to the carbon in the methane.As the nickel sulphide ore deposits become more difficult to mine, the nickeliferous laterite ores are becoming the major source for the global nickel metal supply ( A typical nickeliferous laterite ore deposit consists of two primary nickel bearing layers: limonite and saprolite. For the purpose of this paper, the study will be limited to the saprolitic ores. In the saprolitic layer, the nickel is substituted for magnesium in the major mineral, garnierite ((Mg,Fe,Ni) For this reason, it is of interest to investigate new processing techniques, which may offer a more economical and perhaps environmentally friendly route for extracting the nickel. For example, heap leaching or nitric acid leaching processes have been proposed and claim to offer reduced processing costs, but have not achieved commercial application ( Worldwide, the metallurgical industry is a major contributor to the global emissions of carbon dioxide. In many pyrometallurgical processes, carbon based fuels are employed as a source of energy, but additionally carbon is used as a reducing agent. Carbon is abundant, has a high energy density but results in carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to the carbon dioxide generation issue, coals contain organics, sulphur and ash, which have additional environmental consequences. Alternative reducing agents include: other metals, hydrogen, and methane (CH For the production of an equivalent amount of metal, the utilization of methane should result in a fifty percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in comparison to carbon. There is a paucity of information in the literature on the use of methane as a reductant for the nickeliferous laterites. The current work attempts to address this issue by developing a thermodynamic model to investigate the selective reduction of the saprolitic laterite ores by methane to produce ferronickel, which could be further concentrated by, for example magnetic separation. This model is based on previous models for the reduction of a laterite ore by carbon and hydrogen, and also on activity data available in the literature ( Several researchers have investigated the thermodynamics of the reduction of laterite ores by carbon, carbon monoxide or hydrogen ( Several previous works have examined the selective reduction of a laterite ore or similar material by coal, carbon monoxide or hydrogen (  Some experimental work has also been conducted on the reduction of other metal oxides by methane, and by hydrogen-enriched methane. The garnierite in the saprolitic ore will undergo dehydroxylation at temperatures between 550 and 650 °C as follows ( The dehydroxylation of the saprolitic ore results in the formation of both pyroxene ((Mg,Fe,Ni)SiO Some iron oxide will also be reduced and a ferronickel alloy will be formed. For example, the reduction of the iron silicates, such as fayalite (Fe However, this process requires elevated temperatures and increased reduction potentials. The decomposition of methane into carbon and hydrogen as well as the production of carbon monoxide in an actual reduction process leads to the majority of the metal oxides being reduced via these reducing agents. Carbon, hydrogen or carbon monoxide will reduce the hematite (Fe In a reduction process, it is important to quantify the utilization efficiencies of the reducing agents. Since methane (CH In previous thermodynamic models, ideal behavior of the species was assumed and there was no attempt to incorporate activity coefficients into the model. In this paper, an existing model created by The composition of the saprolitic ore used in the modelling of the reduction process by methane is displayed in  The objective of the present work was to produce a ferronickel alloy that could be magnetically concentrated and therefore, the amount of magnetite should be minimized. Thus, calculations were performed for the stoichiometric requirement for the reduction of all of the hematite to wüstite and all of the nickel oxide to metallic nickel as given by the following reactions: For the saprolitic ore, the stoichiometric requirement would be 0.076 kmol of CH  For the saprolitic ore, the amount of methane added, according to the stoichiometric prediction of reactions        The effect of silica content on the nickel grade and recovery is shown in  Since methane is composed of both carbon and hydrogen, it would be useful to know the utilization efficiencies of these two reducing agents, according to Eqs. Carbon deposition occurred for high methane additions and low temperatures, as shown in One of the objectives of the present work was to produce a ferronickel alloy that can be concentrated by magnetic separation. Therefore, the formation of magnetite is significant as it will dilute the nickel grade of the magnetic concentrate. In the saprolitic ore, the NiO is assumed to exist in two forms: NiO in MgSiO In an actual ore, there is likely a distribution of nickel in the different silicates and thus the behavior will be intermediate between these two reduction scenarios. As a first approximation, the nickel distribution in the saprolites could be assumed to be determined by reaction Experimental research has been performed on the reduction of various types of saprolitic ores by hydrogen or carbon-based reducing agents (  The gaseous reduction of the saprolitic ores by methane was studied using a thermodynamic model generated using the Equilibrium module of HSC Chemistry® 6.1. Nickel recovery begins at a temperature of about 600 °C and a methane addition of about 0.125 kmol of CH The stoichiometric methane requirement to convert hematite to wüstite and nickel oxide to nickel metal for this saprolitic ore was 0.076 kmol/100 kg of ore. Although the nickel grade was high at 80%, the recovery was very low at 36% and a very high reduction temperature of almost 1100 °C was required. This was attributed to the high stability of the nickel oxide, which resulted in a large amount of the methane being used to reduce the iron oxides. Increasing the methane addition to 0.199 kmol/100 kg of ore resulted in metallic nickel being formed at about 700 °C and the nickel recovery was about 80% at 900 °C and 90% at 1000 °C. Here the nickel grade was about 60%. For a large range of reducing conditions, where nickel recoveries close to 100% and nickel grades of 20% could be achieved, the hydrogen efficiency was only 17.5% and the carbon efficiency was 55%. These efficiencies reflect the relatively high stability of the nickel and iron oxides. Carbon deposition was predicted to occur at high methane additions and low temperatures. At low methane additions, magnetite formed in small amounts across the whole temperature range. At typical reducing conditions for high nickel recoveries, the amount of magnetite formed was negligible. On cooling, some reversion to magnetite occurred and quenching or cooling in a controlled atmosphere may be necessary to prevent reversion to magnetite. The effect of ore composition was investigated at 800 °C. With regards to nickel oxide content, the nickel grade increased while the nickel recovery remained constant with increasing nickel oxide content. With increasing hematite content, the nickel recovery decreased and leveled off at zero percent. On the other hand, the nickel grade increased slightly up to 40% hematite and then decreased rapidly to zero percent. Both nickel grade and recovery decreased with increasing magnesia content because of the increasing formation of olivine. Similarly, the nickel grade and recovery decreased with increasing magnesia to silica ratio. The nickel grade increased with increasing silica due to the formation of iron silicate, but the nickel recovery decreased owing to the formation of olivine. A comparison of the model results with the experimental results available in the literature indicates that reduction potential and ore composition, in particular silica content, have significant effects on the nickel recovery.
