The mineral industry has been using cyanidation to recover gold from ores for more than a century; however, a systematic study of the best reactant addition strategy in a cascade of agitated leaching tanks is not available in the open literature. A phenomenological mathematical model of the gold cyanidation process, calibrated with a set of industrial data from an Australian plant, together with an economic performance index is used to analyze this problem. The simulated results show that the best compromise between the two antagonistic effects, cyanide consumption and gold recovery, which are both function of cyanide concentrations, leads to a reagent distribution that depends on the leaching and cyanide consumption kinetics, pulp feed characteristics, and economic factors such as the gold market value. For the specific studied plant, in the operating range of low cyanide consumption and fast gold dissolution, all the cyanide must be added in the first tank; however, in the operating conditions of high cyanide consumption, cyanide has to be distributed in the first, second and third tanks.cyanide concentration in the liquid (mg/kg) gold concentration in the liquid (mg/kg) gold concentration in the ore (mg/kg) solid concentration in the pulp (g/g) total cost function ($/h) reference value of the total cost function ($/h) relative cost function liquid holdup (kg) ore holdup (kg) number of reactors in the cascade price of gold ($/g) price of cyanide ($/kg) price of cyanide destruction ($/kg) cyanide flow rate added (kg/h) liquid flow rate (kg/h) ore flow rate (kg/h) dissolution rate of gold (mg/kg rate of cyanide consumption (mg/L net volume of the reactor (m ore density (g/cm liquid density (g/cm scaling factors of the kinetic constants circuit entrance zero order kinetic constant of cyanide consumption first order kinetic constant of cyanide consumption tank number in the cascade kinetic constant of gold dissolution optimal value circuit exit Leaching by cyanide solutions in aerated alkaline pulp has been the main process for gold extraction from ores for more than one century. In spite of the fact that in the last decades the automatic control of the free cyanide concentration in the leaching section of conventional gold extraction processes has emerged as an useful technology, the cyanide distribution strategy along the leaching cascade is still empirically selected ( Stage reactant distribution in a cascade of reactors is already employed by the chemical and biochemical industries and systematic studies of optimal distribution strategies are documented ( The mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of gold leaching and gold recovery in agitated tanks by activated carbon using the process of carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp have received a lot of attention since the 1970s and several papers are available, such as: The problem of optimal design of the number and size distribution of reactors in a gold ore leaching plant was recently addressed ( The paper is organized as follows. Section The process model used to assemble the steady-state simulator to design optimal cyanide distribution strategies is based on equations developed in other studies to describe the gold leaching and recovery processes ( Cyanidation of gold ores is a complex heterogeneous process, where the leaching behavior of gold depends upon the nature of the gold bearer as well of its distribution within the ore with respect to its ability to be reached by the liquid phase. Also it depends on the quality of the gold surface exposed to cyanide. Some attempts have been made to relate the kinetic rate to the particle size ( The cyanide consumption kinetics is also described by a lumped kinetic model, assuming an average rate for the particle population. Two superimposed effects are assumed to explain the rate of cyanide consumption. The first one is related to the reaction with metal species contained in the mineral phases. It is modeled as a zero order process, since, for a given mineralogical composition of the ore, the cyanicide exposed surfaces are constant. The second one, described as a first order process, explains the cyanide consumption effect due to the free cyanide content itself, such as the losses by hydrolysis to hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, and the oxidation to cyanate or cyanogens ( The rate equations that describe the gold leaching process are calibrated with data from a plant that treats about 400 The leaching section of the plant was sampled at each hour, simultaneously with the entry and the outlet side of each tank, during 37 The ore flow rate time evolution was measured in the entrance of the comminution-leaching section of the plant, but not in the leaching-adsorption circuit entrance ( The fitted kinetic models for the three-tank plant described above are ( The process simulation was performed by sequential numerical resolution of Eqs. A performance criterion is required to tune the cyanide addition strategy. The following cost function that includes the cyanide cost, the residual pulp treatment cost, and a penalty for the loss of non-dissolved gold is used ( In a first simulation run, the normalized cost function (Eq. To study the effect of continuous variations of the cyanide addition in the first and second tanks (Qcn The optimal cyanide distribution (Qcn The optimal cyanide distribution pattern described above is valid for the specific ore investigated. It is interesting to study how this pattern varies with the kinetic parameters involved in the cyanidation process. The cyanide consumption kinetics may strongly depend on the slurry chemical composition, in particular chemical species, such as iron and copper-bearing minerals, consume cyanide and can significantly change the process profitability. Also the gold dissolution kinetics may vary with the type of ore and the particle size distribution. In order to analyze the sensitivity of the optimal cyanide distribution pattern to the changes of the cyanide consumption and gold dissolution kinetics, several simulation tests were carried out, multiplying the reference values of the coefficients of Eqs. To study the sensitivity of the optimal tuning to the gold dissolution kinetics, the reference value of the kinetic constant is multiplied by a factor To study the sensitivity of the optimal tuning to the cyanide consumption kinetics, first, the reference value of the zero-order kinetic coefficient is multiplied by a factor As shown by the above results, the gold price is also a key factor in the tuning of a leaching circuit that treats a relatively simple ore, without cyanide-soluble copper, reactive sulfides, preg-robbers, and polysulfides, in a conventional cascade of agitated tanks as in the present case. As a consequence, this factor must be taken into account not only for the global development of gold mines, but also for the current tuning of the leaching operations in these plants. The economic importance of a proper tuning of the cyanide addition to the leaching circuit, can be roughly understand by simply saying that a decrease by 1% of the gold recovery in the leaching plant, a value which corresponds to only a decrease of the overall plant recovery of approximately 0.4%, corresponds to an annual loss of 350,000$ for a gold at 10 A steady-state simulator of a gold leaching circuit, previously calibrated to experimental data from an Australian plant, was used to systematically demonstrate that a better cyanide distribution in a leaching reactors cascade could be achieved. This study shows that there is an optimal tuning of a gold leaching circuit, which makes a trade off between the gold recovery and the reagent cost. The optimal tuning depends upon the cyanide reagent price and the cyanide reject treatment cost, and is sensitive to the gold market value. When the gold value is high, it is economically important to improve the gold recovery by increasing cyanide concentrations in the tanks. The optimal tuning of the leaching plant depends also on the extent of dissolution performed before the leaching circuit, a parameter that may vary and must be taken into account in the search for optimal leaching plant tuning. For the specific plant analyzed in this study, the simulated results show that in the case of low cyanide consumption and fast gold dissolution kinetics, the optimal distribution of the cyanide consists in feeding all the cyanide in the first tank. However, a parametric analysis conducted with respect to the gold dissolution and cyanide consumption rates shows that, in the case of very high cyanide consumption, additions in the second and even in the third tanks are required. It is expected that the results and the methodology presented in this work will be helpful to understand the reactant distribution in other leaching plants and will be useful to improve the cyanide control.
