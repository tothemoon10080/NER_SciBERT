The key measurement instruments in the control of the base metal flotation are the on-line elemental analyzers like the Courier X-ray fluorescence analyzer. The calibration of the analyser is one of the key factors in the operation of the X-ray fluorescence analyser. The quality of the analyses is limited by the quality of the calibration of the assay calculation model. The co-linearity of the measurement information is problematic for the multi-linear regression used in the assay calculation and calibration. In this study two new regression methods are introduced for the assay calculation and calibration: Principal Component Regression and Partial Least Squares regression. These methods utilize the idea of internal structure of data - latent structure that handles the co-linearity internally.
