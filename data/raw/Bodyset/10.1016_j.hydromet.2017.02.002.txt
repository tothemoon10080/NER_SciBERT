An ionic liquid reagent Cyphos IL 101 (trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride) was studied for the recovery of cobalt and manganese from the synthetic nickel laterite leach solution containing chloride. It is shown that cobalt and manganese were effectively extracted from the solution containing 100g/L Cl with 0.5M Cyphos IL 101 in the pH range of 1.2–4.5, while no significant nickel, magnesium and calcium were extracted. This could lead to a simple and economical recovery of cobalt and manganese from nickel literate leach solutions. For comparison, tests with other reagents including Aliquat 336 (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and Alamine 336 (tri-octyl (decyl) amine) which have similar molecular structures were also carried out and it was indicated that Cyphos IL 101 was advantageous for its higher extraction of cobalt and manganese. The effect of pH, chloride concentration, organic concentration and A/O ratio on the metal extraction was studied. Metal stripping tests showed that cobalt and manganese were readily stripped using water. Zinc stripping was very difficult with water and it was only achieved from a low Cyphos IL 101 concentration or using ammonia as the strip reagent. A process for the recovery of cobalt and manganese from laterite leach solutions containing chloride using Cyphos IL 101 has been proposed.In processing nickel laterite ores using acidic leaching, cobalt and nickel are extracted into leach solutions together with impurities, such as iron, aluminium, copper, zinc, manganese, magnesium and calcium ( Cyanex 272 (di-2,4,4-trimethylpentyl-phosphinic acid) has been used in DSX processes to recover cobalt in laterite leach solutions due to its high selectivity for cobalt over nickel ( It has been reported that in the former Bulong nickel laterite operation in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 80–95 Cyphos IL 101 (trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride) is an ionic liquid reagent which has been widely investigated in hydrometallurgical applications ( Cyphos IL 101 was kindly provided by Cytec Industries Inc., and Aliquat 336 (trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and Alamine 336 (tri-octyl/decyl amine) by BASF, Australia. The molecular structures of Cyphos IL 101, Aliquat 336 and Alamine 336 are illustrated in Metal extraction pH isotherms were obtained using 300 Depending on the requirement of A/O ratios, aqueous and organic solutions were mixed in a 100 For the determination of extraction kinetics, the synthetic aqueous solution at pH For the determination of stripping kinetics, the 0.5 The metal extraction pH isotherms with 0.5 Zinc adsorption with Cyphos IL 101 impregnated resin was investigated and it was proven that zinc was adsorbed as ZnCl As cobalt and manganese also formed CoCl From Eq. The extraction of nickel, magnesium and calcium by Cyphos IL 101 was negligible due to that they do not form the extractable anionic ions with chloride ( The effect of chloride concentration on the extraction of cobalt and manganese with 0.5 From The extraction of cobalt with Cyphos IL 101 was stronger than those with Aliquat 336 and Alamine 336 ( The extraction of cobalt and manganese was determined with various Cyphos IL 101 concentrations and the synthetic solution containing 100 The extraction of cobalt and manganese from the synthetic solution containing 100 McCabe Thiele diagrams were constructed to determine the theoretical extraction stages required for the recovery of cobalt ( Metal stripping from a loaded organic solution containing 0.33 From Although alkaline solutions were effective for zinc stripping, the application of alkaline reagent could lead to some concerns such as high organic solubility in aqueous phase, high reagent cost and possibly poor phase separation. In order to separate zinc and other possible trace amount impurities in nickel laterite leach solutions, such as iron(III) and Cu(II), 0.1 A loaded 0.1 The extraction kinetics of zinc, cobalt and manganese was obtained with 0.5 If a nickel laterite leach solution contains 80–100 Ionic liquid Cyphos IL 101 can be used to extract cobalt and manganese from nickel laterite leach solutions containing chloride in a range of 80–100 Three theoretical stages are required to completely recover cobalt from the synthetic solution containing 0.25 The authors thank Dr. Theo Rodopoulos at CSIRO Mineral Resources for reviewing this paper and providing valuable comments.
