The goal of this study was to calibrate a numerical model aimed at describing simultaneous air and water flow in soil and, to build a model-based estimator of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The experimental approach consisted of infiltration tests in a 1.5m high column of loamy sand. The numerical model correctly described water percolation without air convection, provided parameter adjustment of the predictive model of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was performed. An observer-based estimator was able to estimate on-line the hydraulic conductivity in steady-state but faced oscillation problems in unsteady-state. The difficulty in implementing the software-sensor can be explained by the strong nonlinearity of the dynamical model.
