To investigate the roles of lithotripter shock wave (LSW) parameters and cavitation in stone comminution, a series of in vitro fragmentation experiments have been conducted in water and 1,3-butanediol (a cavitation-suppressive fluid) at a variety of acoustic field positions of an electromagnetic shock wave lithotripter. Using field mapping data and integrated parameters averaged over a circular stone holder area (R

These observations, should they be confirmed using other shock wave lithotripters, may provide an important field parameter (i.e., P

                     ) to guide appropriate application of SWL in clinics, and facilitate device comparison and design improvements in future lithotripters.Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) is a medical technology for non-invasive disintegration of kidney stones in a patient without surgery. Since the early 1980s, SWL has been widely used in clinics as the first line therapy for a majority of renal and upper urinary stones ( Numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of stone comminution in SWL ( In this study, we have performed a series of stone comminution tests in vitro under a wide range of lithotripter field parameters using artificial stones of different physical properties. Our results demonstrate that stone comminution in SWL correlates closely with the average peak pressure surrounding the stone in a logarithmic function above a minimal pressure threshold required to initiate stone fragmentation. Implications of this new observation to the mechanisms of stone comminution and improvement of lithotripter design will be discussed. An axisymmetric electromagnetic (EM) shock wave generator mounted at the bottom of a Lucite tank (L×W×H=40×40×30 The pressure waveforms and distributions in the geometric focal plane ( Based on the pressure waveforms measured, lithotripter field parameters such as For effective acoustic energy calculations (i.e., compressive and tensile energy), the derived pulse intensity integral, Artificial kidney stones made of BegoStone Plus (BEGO USA, Lincoln, RI) with powder-to-water mixing ratios of 5:1 (for mimicking “hard” stones such as calcium oxalate monohydrate and brushite) and 5:2 (for mimicking “soft” stones such as uric acid or magnesium ammonium phosphate hydrogen) were prepared in spherical molds of 10 To evaluate the effect of cavitation in stone comminution during SWL, the stone holder was filled either with water or 1,3-butanediol, which has similar acoustic properties to water (and thus similar characteristics in lithotripter shock wave propagation and interaction with the target stone), but much higher viscosity (98 Fragmentation tests were carried out at discrete positions both along the After SWL, stone fragments were collected and thoroughly rinsed in water, dried overnight, and sequentially sieved to isolate fragments into the size range of >4.0  When stone comminution (SC) is plotted against the average peak pressure inside the holder,  Currently, the established mechanisms of stone failure in SWL are dynamic fatigue ( The distribution of The significant differences in stone comminution between stones treated in water compared to butanediol support the notion that cavitation is essential for producing effective stone fragmentation in SWL ( A close correlation between None declared.
