This paper presents a sectional analysis tool which can compute the complete torque-twist behaviour of reinforced concrete beams and shells. The cross section is modelled as a 2-D grid of triaxial elements representing the concrete and uniaxial elements representing the longitudinal reinforcement. Fixed strain patterns based on kinematic assumptions are used instead of using the finite element method to calculate strain distributions corresponding to sectional strains. Constitutive models for the concrete are based on the Modified Compression-Field Theory, though tension stiffening is neglected in the proposed model’s current implementation. A key assumption used in this model is that the shear strain distribution caused by twists obtained from a linear elastic analysis can be used to describe the nonlinear behaviour of a member following cracking. The validity of this assumption when applied to rectangular sections is confirmed based on a study of 115 tests from the literature. Excellent agreement of peak strength and overall torque-twist behaviour are observed when comparing the model predictions and experimental data from these tests. Areas of future work are to improve the capabilities of the model are identified.                                In the design or analysis of a reinforced concrete structure, the ability of its members to carry torsion and resist twisting displacements needs to be considered. Common instances in which torsion is particularly important include bridges curved in space or spandrel beams in buildings – for members such as these, the torsion is predominantly carried by shear stresses which circulate around the member’s cross section. As the tensile strength of concrete is low, even small torsions can cause the formation of diagonal cracks which then spiral around the member. These cracks lead to a dramatic reduction in the torsional stiffness of the member, which may lead to a redistribution of how the loads are carried by the overall structure. The cracking also alters how the torsion is resisted by the member, with the circulating shear stresses now being carried by fields of diagonal compression in the cracked concrete which are equilibrated by tensile forces carried by transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. The post-cracking response of reinforced concrete members has important implications for both the global behaviour of the overall structure and the local behaviour of the member carrying the torsion. In statically indeterminate structures, the reduction in torsional stiffness following cracking leads to redistribution in the loads throughout the structure as the cracked member continues twisting in order to maintain compatibility. In statically determinate structures where the load path does not change following cracking, the torsional strength of the cracked member is required to be large enough so that equilibrium is maintained in the structure to avoid collapse. These two phenomena were identified by Collins and Lampert in 1973 as Compatibility Torsion and Equilibrium Torsion respectively Modelling the behaviour of reinforced concrete members subjected to torsion is inherently a 3-D problem, as torsion is not present when conducting a 2-D analysis of a structure or member. The current state-of-the-art for dealing with torsion in reinforced concrete members makes use of finite element methods in tandem with nonlinear constitutive models. These approaches can be largely grouped into using solid elements to model portions of structures, an example being VecTor3 developed at the University of Toronto by Vecchio and Selby The strength of these approaches is that the response of arbitrarily shaped members can be modelled in great detail, with previous validation studies demonstrating their ability to accurately predict the torque-twist response of experiments found in the literature. However, their feasibility for practical application is limited by the large computational resources required to conduct an analysis. The costs of constructing and inverting a large global stiffness matrix can be very high, particularly when working the large meshes associated with using solid elements. The process is made even more challenging when modelling nonlinear behaviour, as many of the sophisticated constitutive models for the cracked concrete require iteration to converge on material stiffnesses at each load step. To avoid prohibitively long runtimes, a coarse mesh in the numerical model may be needed when using these methods, which detracts from the intended benefits offered by these models. Sectional analysis methods characterize the behaviour of a member by analyzing the behaviour of the cross section when subjected to stress resultants such as axial load, shear, moment and torsion. These methods, similar in approach to the layered analysis in fiber models, can quickly perform detailed calculations across a cross section because a global stiffness matrix does not need to be assembled and inverted. Response-2000 by Bentz, shown schematically in Sectional analysis programs which can account for torsion in combination with axial load, bending and shear typically make use of a space truss model, which represents the cross section as a space truss with four chords and four webs arranged in a rectangular shape. Bredt’s simple equation for thin-walled tubes is typically used to estimate the shear flows caused by torsion, instead of a more detailed approach. An example of a space truss model which uses the MCFT is COMBINED, developed by Rahal and Collins The proposed analysis model described in this paper is a sectional analysis tool for obtaining the response of reinforced and prestressed concrete members in pure torsion. The model combines the strengths of the finite element methods discussed in To perform the analysis, the following steps are taken. These steps are presented at a high level and are described in further detail in Create a representation of the cross section in the Calculate strain distributions which correspond to the six possible sectional strains. Specify a desired ratio of ( Specify a sectional strain value which will guide the analysis. For pure torsion, this is the twist, Apply a set of sectional strains. Using the strain distributions calculated in step 2, calculate the longitudinal strain ε Calculate the distribution of axial and shear stresses in the cross section using the material constitutive relationships. Integrate the stresses across the cross section to calculate the global section stress resultants. If the ratio of stress resultants does not match what was specified in step 3, modify the proportion of sectional strains in an iterative manner until convergence is achieved. Increment the guiding sectional strain in step 4 and repeat steps 5–7 until the analysis is completed. Representing the cross section in the model is done by discretizing the cross section into uniaxial elements, which represent the longitudinal reinforcement, and triaxial elements, which represent the reinforced concrete with embedded transverse reinforcement. Sample discretization for a hollow beam and a slab strip or shell element are shown in The distribution of longitudinal axial strains and shear strains throughout the cross section are obtained by using fixed strain distributions which correspond to each of the six sectional strains and are explained in further detail in Constitutive relationships used for modelling the triaxial stress-strain behaviour for reinforced concrete and the uniaxial stress-strain behaviour for conventional and prestressed reinforcement are presented in It should be noted that the model is currently implemented to only handle pure torsion and hence the associated strain distributions for γ To perform the analysis, the proposed model uses fixed strain patterns corresponding to each sectional strain to evaluate the axial and shear strains over the entire cross section. This means that given a set of sectional strains ( Longitudinal axial strains are calculated using a linear strain profile per the Euler-Bernoulli plane sections hypothesis first described by Hooke in 1678 Shear strains caused by twist are calculated using St. Venant’s assumption that when twisted, a member warps in the longitudinal direction and the projection of the cross section onto a surface perpendicular to its axis rotates as a rigid body. If this warping is not restrained, the resulting torsion is resisted by circulatory shear stresses (which contrasts with torsion carried by axial stresses caused by restrained warping, referred to as warping torsion). By assuming that the warping is constant along the length of the member, the resulting shear strain distribution in the cross section is described by the following equations: Calculating the shear strain distribution of the cross section assuming linear elastic behaviour can be done using Prandtl’s stress function approach and using an assumed material shear modulus Eq. A key assumption in the method proposed in this paper is that the member warps in the same manner both before and after cracking, resulting in the same pattern of shear strains caused by twisting. In reality, warping of a cracked reinforced concrete section is a complex phenomenon affected by the geometry of the member, the layout of reinforcement, the anisotropy of the concrete, the distribution of stiffness and the presence of accompanying stress resultants such as axial load, moment, shear and torsion. However, it has been found that for symmetrically reinforced members loaded in pure torsion, using this simplifying assumption allows reasonable prediction of the complete nonlinear response be obtained in a computationally efficient manner. To validate this approach, a series of analyses were performed using VecTor3, a nonlinear finite element analysis software which uses 3-D solid elements and has previously been shown to give good results when modelling members carrying torsion The proposed methodology works best for members which are symmetrically reinforced and loaded in pure torsion. This is because the post-cracking distribution of stiffness is similar to that of the uncracked section, resulting in a similar pattern of warping being present. It becomes less appropriate for members whose warping changes substantially following cracking. Examples of when this occurs include when the member is non-symmetrically reinforced, which results in the member curving after cracking, or when the section is not uniformly cracked while being twisted (which occurs when torsion is present in combination with bending and/or shear) – the resultant non-uniform distribution of stiffness results in changes to the pattern of warping. However, validation of the model under combined torsion and bending in A common assumption in beam theories for linear elastic materials, such as the bending of bars illustrated by Timoshenko, is that the cross section is rigid and neither expands, described by transverse axial strains In the current implementation, distortion strains are obtained by assuming that To a reduced 3 × 3 formulation: Here, [ The proposed analysis methodology requires constitutive models describing the triaxial behaviour of reinforced concrete and uniaxial behaviour of reinforcing and prestressing steel. Reinforced concrete elements are used to model all parts of the cross section apart from the longitudinal steel. Prior to cracking, the concrete is treated as an isotropic linear elastic material and the smeared reinforcement has little effect on the overall behaviour. In the absence of provided test data, the Young’s modulus of the concrete, Following cracking however, the cracked concrete is modelled as an orthotropic material with stiffnesses defined in its principal directions. A rotating crack model is used where the inclination of the principal stresses is assumed to coincide with the inclination of the principal strains in the same manner as the Modified Compression-Field Theory The constitutive matrix of the cracked reinforced concrete, [ The stress-strain behaviour of the concrete in compression is modelled using Popovic’s formulation Due to the presence of tensile strains in the cracked concrete, the compression response is modified by a compression softening parameter In tension, it is assumed that the concrete does not carry any tensile stress after cracking occurs (i.e. the tension stiffening effect is neglected). This can be represented as: This simplified constitutive model for concrete in tension was selected for two main reasons. The first reason is the lack of validated tension stiffening models which account for how the distribution of reinforcement affects the distribution of tensile stresses in the cracked concrete. Several approaches have been proposed in the past: Bentz modifies the basic tension stiffening expression in the MCFT by accounting for bond, though its application is limited to 2-D sectional analysis The second reason for using a simplified approach is due to the difficulty of implementing a crack check to limit the tensile stresses in the concrete once the reinforcement begins to yield or when aggregate interlock breaks down. As explained by Vecchio and Collins This simple assumption of neglecting post-cracking tensile stresses results in a model which tends to under-predict the torsional stiffness after cracking and conservatively estimate the strength of members whose torsional capacity is significantly influenced by tension in the concrete after cracking. This second case may occur in beams which contain large amounts of longitudinal steel and small amounts of transverse steel, as the tensile stresses in the concrete may account for a large proportion of the overall tensile stresses in the cracked member at failure. However, for beams which fail due to yielding of both directions of steel (a case where yielding of the steel at the crack controls the response at failure) or whose peak load are governed by crushing of the concrete, accurate results can still be obtained by using this simple constitutive relationship. Conventional reinforcement – either the transverse steel smeared into the reinforced concrete elements or the longitudinal reinforcement – is modelled as having an elastic-plastic stress-strain response, with strain hardening being neglected. The following equation is used for bars in tension and an analogous expression is used for bars in compression: For prestressing steel, a modified Ramberg-Osgood formulation is used as recommended by Collins and Mitchell To account for the prestress in the steel, a strain difference Once the strains have been obtained over the cross section and the stresses at each element been calculated, the section stress resultants can be computed using the following formulas: The proposed model has been implemented in a MATLAB script, and is currently formulated to model the behaviour of solid and hollow reinforced and prestressed concrete members with a rectangular cross section. To begin the analysis, the user first needs to define the discretization of the section, material properties, smearing of the transverse reinforcement and the location of the longitudinal reinforcement. Convergence criteria are also needed to define the maximum acceptable error on Prior to beginning the sectional analysis of the reinforced concrete member, the shear strain distributions of On the element level, the principal strains ( Although the model converges quite quickly in both the uncracked elastic stage and cracked elastic stages, a large amount of iteration is needed during moments of predominantly nonlinear behaviour (i.e. at the onset of cracking, when the reinforcement is yielding or when the concrete is crushing). It was also found that convergence on the axial load The proposed model was validated against 115 tests in pure torsion which were found in the literature, consisting of 108 reinforced concrete beams, 5 prestressed concrete beams and 2 reinforced concrete shell elements. Of the beams modelled, 23 were hollow with the remainder being solid. All members analyzed were rectangular in cross section and represent a wide spectrum of geometric and material configurations leading to different failure modes. In this section, a summary of predictions of ultimate torque is first presented, followed by a more thorough comparison of predicted and observed torque-twist behaviour for beams and shells in  When performing the validation studies, each member’s cross section was represented as a grid with approximately 1200–2000 elements across the cross section. When smearing the transverse reinforcement into the reinforced concrete elements, the steel was smeared from the outside surface of the member to the depth of the stirrup, which typically took place over four to six layers of elements. The steel was proportioned so that the area of steel assigned when calculating ρ increased linearly from a minimum in the elements in the outside layer to a maximum inside the layer of elements located at the depth of the stirrup (i.e. if a stirrup with cross sectional area of 100 mm   The model also works equally well for both hollow and solid sections, which is not evident from To validate the ability of the proposed model to capture the complete torque-twist behaviour of a reinforced concrete member in pure torsion, the predicted torque-twist response was compared with experimental data obtained by the P-series tested by Mitchell and Collins. The predicted and observed behaviour of four representative specimens, P1, P2, P3 and P6 are shown in For all four plots in The choice of constitutive modelling, particularly the assumption of no tensile stresses in the cracked concrete, has resulted in some discrepancies in the predictions and the experiments. The model tends to consistently under-predict the cracking torque of the members. The reason for this is because the small post-cracking tensile stresses in plain concrete, as well as the more significant post-cracking tensile stresses in reinforced concrete (tension softening and tension stiffening respectively) are ignored. Although this is not inherently the fault of the proposed framework, it does suggest that a more sophisticated model for tension in concrete is needed to adequately predict the cracking torque of a member. Neglecting tension stiffening when modelling reinforced concrete beams also leads to a large discrepancy in the torque-twist response shortly after cracking and can be seen in all four plots shown in The discrepancy caused by ignoring post-cracking tensile stress in the concrete disappears following yielding of both the longitudinal and transverse steel (like in P1, P2 and P3). When this occurs, the tensile stresses in the concrete go to zero, as they are limited by local behaviour of the steel yielding at the crack. In instances such as P6, where only the transverse steel yields, the discrepancy remained until the global behaviour was governed by crushing of the concrete. Although neglecting tension stiffening leads to conservative estimates of the cracking torque and underpredicts the post-cracking stiffness, the overall framework is still able to give good results using the constitutive models discussed in this paper. Further improvements to address the highlighted shortcomings can be addressed by using different constitutive relationships for post-cracking behaviour. Two reinforced concrete shell elements tested by Bruun in 2017 were also used to validate the numerical model for shells When modelling the specimens, a mesh similar to the one shown in  Although When modelling these beams using the methodology outlined in this paper, the use of the elastic shear strain distribution caused by twist led to large unbalanced shear forces in the member during the analysis. These unbalanced forces are due to the differences in the distribution of stiffnesses in the member following flexural cracking. For an uncracked rectangular member, the shear strain distribution caused by twist is symmetric about both the x- and y- axes. Following cracking however, the stiffnesses and hence the distribution of shear strains is no longer symmetric about both directions as the flexural tension side is cracked and the flexural compression side may be uncracked. Applying the elastic shear strain distribution to this system hence leads to a non-zero shear force carried by the section in addition to the applied torsion and moment. Despite this issue however, reasonable predictions of strength, as well as torque-twist and moment-curvature response were obtained by using the elastic shear strain distribution. Further work is needed to model torsion in combination with bending and shear to address this issue in a more rigorous manner. In conclusion, a sectional analysis tool is presented for the nonlinear analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete members subjected to pure torsion. A key component of the methodology is using the elastic shear strain distribution caused by twist to obtain the complete torque-twist behaviour. The resulting model is thus able to describe detailed sectional behaviour under torsion in a computationally efficient manner, combining the strengths of existing finite element and space-truss models available in the literature. Although the methodology has been implemented for modelling pure torsion in rectangular cross sections using select constitutive relationships for concrete and steel, the framework is general enough to permit the use of any constitutive models and be extended to account for any combinations of axial load, shear, moment and torsion being carried by an arbitrarily-shaped cross section. A validation exercise using 115 specimens tested in pure torsion found in the literature were modelled using the proposed analysis method to evaluate its predictive ability. The average test to predicted ratio for ultimate torque was found to be 1.028, with a coefficient of variation of 13.30%. Excellent predictions of both the peak load and overall torque-twist behaviour of specimens were made, both of which are important properties when considering Equilibrium Torsion and Compatibility Torsion in actual structures. Other positive features of the model are its fast runtime compared to performing a 3-D nonlinear finite element analysis and its limited calibration requirements, both of which enhance its practical appeal. Areas of future work include the following: Validating the approach for arbitrarily shaped cross sections. Although the shear strain distributions presented in Obtaining a means to calculate the shear strain distributions for γ Expanding the capabilities of the model to account for combinations of axial load, shears, moments and torsion. This primarily involves developing a means to calculate the changes in warping as the member cracks under load. Improving the constitutive model for cracked reinforced concrete in tension. The current approach leads to underestimating the stiffness following cracking and is less appropriate for members containing very small amounts of transverse reinforcement. This work is a promising first step towards efficient sectional analysis for members subject to torsion and further improvements would provide engineers with a practical tool to model members subjected to complex loading combinations and understand the fundamental mechanisms which allow them to carry load.
