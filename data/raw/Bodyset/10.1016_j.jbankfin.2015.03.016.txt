We study the market impact of a very successful financial innovation – the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (GLD). GLD holds physical gold, and provides traders with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to gold. We find that after the introduction of GLD, the liquidity of gold company stocks declined, and their adverse-selection risk increased. Over the two-month period after GLD’s introduction, the stocks’ relative effective bid-ask spreads increased by over 15%, while their adverse-selection cost, as measured by the price impact of trades, went up by more than 30%. Gold stocks also experienced significant negative abnormal returns (−12% on average) in the month after GLD started trading. Our findings suggest that GLD attracted traders, especially uninformed traders, away from gold company stocks, and that the resulting negative demand shocks and decrease in the stocks’ liquidity caused their prices to decline. Our results show that existing securities can be seriously adversely affected when a new security enters the market.In this paper, we study the market impact of a very successful financial innovation. The innovation is the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (Tic: GLD), which is the first bullion-backed exchange-traded fund introduced in the US market. GLD was introduced in November 2004 and has since grown to become one of the largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in terms of assets under management ($72 billion as of the end of December 2012). Our main objective is to examine the effect of GLD’s introduction on the trading characteristics and the prices of stocks of gold companies. The existing literature offers several reasons why the introduction of a new security can affect existing securities, especially closely related ones. These include improved risk sharing (e.g., Using a sample of gold company stocks traded in the US market when GLD was introduced, we find that various measures of the stocks’ liquidity deteriorated after GLD started trading. For example, on average, the stocks’ relative effective bid-ask spreads increased by over 15% in the two-month period following GLD’s introduction. During the same period, their adverse-selection cost, as measured by the price impact of trades, went up by more than 30%. Their trading volume (both in terms of shares and dollars) also significantly declined. In addition, the percentage of outstanding shares of gold company stocks held by institutional investors significantly increased. These findings support the adverse-selection argument, which predicts that uninformed traders will migrate away from information-sensitive securities once a less information-sensitive alternative is introduced ( With respect to the price effects of GLD, we find that gold company stocks significantly underperformed the benchmark after GLD started trading. On average, gold stocks experienced a negative abnormal return of −1.90% on GLD’s introduction day, and a cumulative abnormal return of approximately −12% during the first month. One explanation for the decline is that the demand for gold stocks was not perfectly elastic due to lack of close substitutes (e.g., Our results suggest that the introduction of a new security can have a serious adverse impact on the trading characteristics and prices of existing, related securities. The results are related primarily to studies that investigate the market impact of financial innovation. Typically, these studies concentrate on futures contracts and options and their impacts on the underlying securities (See More recently, there is an emerging literature on the securitization of commodities (i.e., commodity investment through securities such as commodity futures contracts and commodity-linked instruments). A few papers in this literature look at the effects of the securitization on the prices and return dynamics of other related assets. For example, Finally, in a wider context, our results on the price effects are related to studies on the effect of demand on asset prices. Evidence that asset prices can be affected by their demand is typically found in studies on stock inclusions into, or removals from, major stock indices. These studies find that stocks that were newly included into (removed from) a major stock index earned significant positive (negative) abnormal returns during the adjustment periods (e.g., The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe the background of GLD and other trading vehicles that enable traders to gain exposure to gold. In Section The SPDR Gold Trust was formed in November 2004 as an investment trust. The trust is sponsored by World Gold Trust Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of the World Gold Council, whose members are leading gold mining companies such as Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining Corp. The trust’s objective is to promote investment in gold by providing investors with a secure and cost-effective access to the gold market. To do so, the trust holds gold bars and issues shares which represent ownership of the trust. The shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 18, 2004 under the tic symbol GLD. At its inception, each share of GLD corresponded to 0.10 Similar to other exchange-traded funds, shares of GLD can be created and redeemed directly with the trust in large lots (multiples of 100,000 shares) by authorized participants, typically designated brokers and market makers. Creation and redemption are done in kind; i.e., by exchanging shares with a specified amount of gold. The process helps to provide liquidity to GLD trading as market makers can, if needed, create or redeem shares in order to execute investor orders. The creation/redemption provision also establishes an arbitrage relationship between market price and NAV, helping to keep them in line with each other. As with conventional ETFs, GLD can be bought on margin or sold short. Prior to the introduction of GLD, investors typically obtained exposure to gold price movements using three major approaches. When GLD was introduced, there were a few bullion-backed, exchange-listed securities in existence outside the US market but accessible to US investors, the prime example of which was the Central Gold Trust (listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange). However, at the time, these securities as a group did not attract significant investment attention. According to a survey by Gold Field Mineral Services, an independent precious metals consulting firm, the combined gold demand from these securities in the whole of 2003 (the year before GLD was introduced) was only approximately 39 tonnes or 1.25 million ounces (worth approximately $520 million based on gold price at the end of 2003). Over the years, the investment in GLD continued to grow. This coincided with a substantial rise in gold price. From the inception of GLD to the end of 2012, gold price increased by approximately 275% – from around $440/ounce to $1650/ounce. At the end of 2012, GLD held over $72 billion worth of gold (over 43 million ounces), making it the second largest ETF in the world. Its success has spawned several other bullion-backed ETFs, both in the US market (with currently four ETFs) and abroad (e.g., Canada, the UK, Switzerland and South Africa). Because GLD holds physical gold and has low expenses, its tracking errors are very low. From its inception to the end of 2012, the correlation between the percentage changes in its NAVs and the percentage changes in gold prices is 0.9885. In this section, we examine the effects of the introduction of GLD on the trading of gold company stocks. We start with a few theoretical predictions. Then, we present our empirical findings. The existing literature provides several reasons why the introduction of a new security can affect the trading characteristics of existing, related securities. The predictions vary depending on the setup and the assumptions of the models. Here, we mention three arguments that are relevant to the context of GLD and gold company stocks. The adverse-selection argument is due primarily to the work of The implication of both studies is that once an alternative security which is less information-sensitive is introduced, there will be a migration of liquidity traders to this new security. In our context, GLD is a less information-sensitive security than individual gold stocks. This is because, as mentioned earlier, the performance of GLD depends only on gold price movements, while the performance of gold company stocks depends not only on gold price movements but also on firm-specific factors such as management ability, cost structures, and hedging policies. As a result, liquidity traders have a higher chance of losing to informed traders if they trade individual gold stocks than if they trade GLD. It then follows that liquidity traders who wanted direct exposure to gold price movements would have a strong incentive to migrate to GLD when it was introduced. Accordingly, the adverse-selection argument predicts that gold company stocks should become less liquid after the introduction of GLD. With fewer liquidity traders remaining, the stocks’ adverse-selection costs should increase, and the composition of traders in them (i.e., the mix between informed and liquidity traders) should also change, with informed traders representing a higher proportion than before. The introduction of a new security can have an effect on the trading of existing, related securities if it encourages arbitrage activities between them. In our context, the existence of GLD makes it easier and/or less costly for traders to implement long-short trades, which are one of the most common risk-arbitrage trading strategies that hedge funds and many portfolio managers employ ( As  To summarize, studies from different strands of the literature offer different and conflicting predictions regarding the effects of GLD on the trading of gold company stocks. Under the adverse-selection argument, the liquidity of gold company stocks would decline and their adverse-selection risk would increase after GLD’s introduction. The opposite is true under the arbitrage and the market-making arguments. It is possible, in fact likely, that more than one of these effects occur at the same time. Therefore, the issue is an empirical question, which we will address in the following section. Empirical studies on the effects of new securities typically examine the effects of options or futures trading on the underlying stocks’ liquidity measures, particularly the bid-ask spreads (see, for example, To study the impact of the introduction of GLD on gold company stocks, we use a sample of firms that satisfy the following requirements. First, they were classified as belonging to the gold ores industry (SIC four-digit code: 1041) at the time of the introduction of GLD. The sample period consists of a period of two months prior to the introduction of GLD (the pre-GLD period) and two months after the introduction (the post-GLD period). The relatively short sample period minimizes the possibility of confounding events. In total, there are thirty-six companies in our sample. To get an idea about how these stocks co-move with gold prices, we calculate the correlation coefficients between the stocks’ returns and gold returns over the period of three months ending ten trading days before our sample period. As expected, all correlation coefficients are positive. They range from 0.30 to 0.68, with a mean (median) of 0.52 (0.51). This suggests that gold company stocks respond positively to gold price movements, but, on average, they do not provide a pure play on gold. This is consistent with the fact that the performance of gold stocks depends not only on gold price, but also on other factors such as hedging policies, production costs and management ability. The correlations between the stocks’ returns and the returns on the market (as proxied by the CRSP value-weighted market index) are low on average, with a mean (and median) of 0.26. This average is comparable to the number reported in  As a first step in our investigation of the effects of the introduction of GLD on the trading characteristics of gold company stocks, we compare the stocks’ measures of trading activity and liquidity between the pre-GLD and the post-GLD periods. The trading-activity measures that we examine are as follows: Number of trades. Trading volume (in both shares and dollar values). Relative trading volume, defined as the ratio between (i) the stock’s normalized trading volume (i.e., number of shares traded divided by the stock’s number of shares outstanding) and (ii) the equally-weighted normalized trading volume of all stocks traded on the NYSE and AMEX on the same day (see Sell-vs-buy volume ratio, calculated as the ratio between seller-initiated trading volume and buyer-initiated trading volume, where trades are classified as sells or buys using the techniques developed by For liquidity measures, we examine bid-ask spreads and trade depths. We use two definitions of bid-ask spreads. They are effective spread (ES) and relative effective spread (RES). Effective spread is defined as twice the absolute difference between the trade price and mid-point of the bid-ask quote at the time of the trade. This measure takes into account the fact that trades often occur at prices inside the posted spreads, and so a measure of spreads based on quoted bid and ask prices may not accurately reflect market liquidity and transaction costs faced by investors ( Trade depth is the amount of trade that can be done at the quoted bid and ask prices. It captures the quantity dimension of liquidity, which is another piece of information that liquidity providers (e.g., market makers) use to manage information risk (e.g., The bid-ask spreads and trade depth are calculated using TAQ data. We delete all quotes and transactions data outside the NYSE trading hours (9:30 A.M. to 4:00 P.M.), and disregard the first trade of each day to remove the overnight demand and news effects. Commonly used filters are applied to the data to remove observations that can be subject to errors or related to irregular transactions. For example, only quotes that were eligible for inclusion in the National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO) calculation (i.e., those with quote conditions of 01, 02, 06, 12 and 23) are considered. Only trades that were not corrected, changed, or signified as cancel or error (i.e., correction indicator To match trades with quotes, we use the For each day in the sample period (i.e., thirty-four trading days in the pre-GLD period and thirty-four trading days in the post-GLD period), we calculate the trading-activity measures and the liquidity measures for each stock. We then take the average of each measure at the company level for the pre-GLD period and the post-GLD period. Next, we calculate the “Post/Pre ratio” for each variable as follows: We also examine the holdings by institutional investors in gold company stocks. If uninformed investors migrated to GLD, we should observe an increase in institutional investors’ holdings. We collect the holdings information from the Thomson-Reuters Institutional Holdings (13F) Database. The data are based on form 13F, which investment companies and professional managers whose assets under management are over $100 million are required to file with the SEC on a quarterly basis. As GLD was introduced in November 2004, we compare the holdings on September 30, 2004 with the holdings on December 31, 2004. For each company, we calculate the ratio of the percentages of shares held by institutional investors and also the ratio of the numbers of institutional investors on the two dates (i.e., Post/Pre ratio).  The sell-vs-buy volume ratio increases significantly in the post-GLD period. The mean (median) of its Post/Pre ratio is 1.095 (1.111), indicating that, on average, the sell activity (as normalized by the buy activity) increases by about 10%. The increase occurs in two-thirds (i.e., 67%) of the firms in our sample. We interpret this result as being consistent with the prediction that the demand for gold company stocks would drop after the introduction of GLD. In Panel B, both of the bid-ask spread measures increase significantly in the post-GLD period. The mean (median) Post/Pre ratio of effective spread is 1.103 (1.059), while the mean (median) Post/Pre ratio of relative effective spread is 1.157 (1.174). In other words, the relative bid-ask spread increases by over 15% on average. The proportion of the sample that experiences an increase in bid-ask spread measures is also high – about 72% in the case of effective spread and 81% in the case of relative effective spread. As for trade depth, in terms of shares, both the mean and median of its Post/Pre ratios are smaller than, but not significantly different from, unity. However, trade depth in terms of dollars, which is arguably a more economically meaningful measure of depth, declines significantly. The mean (median) of its Post/Pre ratios is 0.925 (0.870), both of which are significantly different from 1. For both measures of depth, the proportion of the sample with ratio greater than unity is less than 40%, suggesting that the decline in trade depth happens to the majority of the companies in the sample. The (percentage) holdings by institutional investors also increase significantly in the post-GLD period. The average (across companies) of Post/Pre ratio is 1.099, which is significantly different from 1 at the 5% level. The increase occurs in about 70% of the firms in the sample. We also calculate the Post/Pre ratios of the number of institutional investors in each stock. The average of this ratio is 1.123, which is significantly different form 1 at the 1% level. Both results indicate that there is an increase in institutional holdings of gold company stocks, both in terms of the percentage of shares and the number of investors, after GLD’s introduction. In summary, the results in Finally, we note that prior studies have shown that bid-ask spreads depend on return volatility, price levels and trading volume (e.g., Specifically, we run the following regression: To correct for the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in standard errors, we use the The regression results are presented in The adverse-selection argument predicts that the introduction of GLD would attract uninformed traders away from gold company stocks. As a result, the stocks’ bid-ask spreads should increase due, in particular, to an increase in the adverse-selection cost that market makers face. In this section, we investigate whether the increase in the bid-ask spreads reported in the previous section can be attributed to higher adverse-selection cost. To do so, we employ two approaches that have been used in the literature to estimate the adverse-selection component of bid-ask spreads. The first approach is proposed by Under the Our parameters of interest are the two cost parameters, The second approach that we use to estimate the adverse-selection component of bid-ask spreads is from Based on this premise, we define relative realized spread as:  Panel B of In summary, the results in In this subsection, we examine the relationship between firm size and the observed effect of GLD. Our premise is that larger firms are more visible to the public and thus attract a greater number of investors, especially uninformed ones (e.g., We use two proxies for firm size and visibility – market capitalization and the amount of analyst coverage. The latter proxy reflects the fact that analyst coverage increases stocks’ media exposure and helps uninformed investors to become familiar with the stocks. We run a regression of the Post/Pre ratios of liquidity measures (effective spreads and relative effective spreads) and adverse-selection component measures (MRR’s adverse-selection cost and Huang and Stoll’s price impact) on each proxy and the correlation between the returns on each gold company stock and gold returns. We include this correlation as an independent variable of the regression to control for the fact that hedging policies typically vary across firms, and thus the sensitivity of their stocks to gold price movements is different. The difference in sensitivity can influence investors’ migration decision (e.g., investors may have more incentive to migrate from stocks that poorly track gold price movements). The coefficient estimates, together with their White’s heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, are presented in We now examine the effects of the introduction of GLD on the prices of gold company stocks. We will first discuss a few theoretical predictions. Then, we will present the empirical results. The results in the previous sections suggest that the introduction of GLD attracted traders, especially uninformed traders, from gold company stocks. As a result, the demand for gold stocks decline. To predict the effects of this demand shock on their prices, we rely on a few arguments that have been put forth in the literature. In a frictionless market where assets have perfect substitutes, their prices are not affected by changes in their demand or supply ( In actual markets, however, perfect substitutes do not exist. Therefore, the type of arbitrage transaction described above is not without risk. Along the same line, In the literature, this line of reasoning is typically referred to as the imperfect-substitutes argument. The argument implies that the price effect will be permanent as the new price reflects a new equilibrium distribution of security holders ( The price-pressure argument states that demand shocks are absorbed by traders who agree to immediately buy or sell securities that they normally would not trade ( A similar argument is made in Accordingly, applied to our context, the price pressure argument predicts that prices of gold company stocks would decline after the introduction of GLD, but the decline would be temporary.  All of the above arguments predict that the prices of gold company stocks should decline after the introduction of GLD. One important difference among them is that the decline will be permanent under the imperfect-substitutes and the liquidity-premium arguments, but will be temporary under the price-pressure argument. A number of prior studies have empirically tested the imperfect-substitutes argument and the price-pressure argument, particularly in the context of stock inclusions into, or removals from, major stock indices. Most of these studies concentrate on inclusions (which raise the demand for the included stocks), and ignore removals (which reduce the demand for the removed stocks, and which are closer in spirit to our study). For studies that examine removals, their results are not entirely conclusive. For example,  As for the liquidity-premium argument, the positive relationship between expected returns and bid-ask spreads has been empirically verified in several studies including To measure the price effects of GLD on gold company stocks, we estimate the stocks’ abnormal returns (ARs) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) during the period surrounding GLD’s introduction day. Since all the firms in our sample come from the same industry and we want to examine the effects of a common event on them, it is likely that their returns will be cross-sectionally correlated. As a result, the traditional event-study methodology introduced by Our benchmark return-generating factors are the four factors in         The estimated coefficient for each dummy variable, The above regression is run using daily observations over the period of six months centering on the GLD’s introduction day. As The estimated CARs of the portfolio are presented in In In summary, the introduction and trading of GLD were associated with a serious adverse effect on gold company stocks. The stocks significantly underperformed the benchmark on GLD’s listing date. The underperformance became more severe during the following two weeks. After two weeks, however, there did not appear to be any further significant negative effect. The observed decline in the prices of gold stocks in the days (and weeks) after GLD was introduced is consistent with the imperfect-substitutes argument and the liquidity-premium argument. It does not, however, lend support to the price-pressure argument because there was no significant price reversal, even after a period of a month. We use two measures of firm-level abnormal returns (i.e., the dependent variable of the cross-sectional regression). They are (i) the stocks’ abnormal returns on the day of GLD’s introduction (AR (0)); and (ii) the stocks’ cumulative abnormal returns over the one-month period from GLD’s introduction (CAR (0, To test for the effect of the imperfect-substitutes argument, we use, as independent variables of the cross-sectional regression, two variables that are predicted to determine the size of the price effects. The first variable is the stocks’ arbitrage risk (which determines the slopes of the demand curves), while the second variable is the size of the demand shocks. The stocks’ arbitrage risk is calculated using the approach in The liquidity-premium argument suggests that the price of a stock will decline (increase) if its liquidity decreases (increases). To test for the effect of this argument, we use two proxies for liquidity as the independent variables of the cross-sectional regression. The first proxy is the Post/Pre ratio of relative effective spread, while the second proxy is the Post/Pre ratio of the MRR adverse-selection cost (i.e., We run four versions of the regression. The coefficient estimates, together with their White’s heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors are presented in Columns (3) and (4) contain the results where CAR (0, 22) is the dependent variable. In column (3), the proxy for liquidity is the Post/Pre ratio of relative effective spread, while in column (4), the proxy for liquidity is the Post/Pre ratio of In summary, the results in columns (1) and (2) show that the negative abnormal returns on gold company stocks on GLD’s listing date are associated with both the decline in liquidity and the negative demand shocks. The results provide support for both the imperfect-substitutes argument and the liquidity-premium argument as the causes for the observed immediate price effects. For longer-term price effects, however, the results in columns (3) and (4) indicate that the imperfect-substitutes argument is more significant and dominant. In this paper, we study the market impact of a very successful financial innovation. The innovation is the SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (Tic: GLD), which is the first bullion-backed exchange-traded fund introduced in the US market. GLD holds physical gold, and provides traders with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to gold. Using a sample of gold company stocks traded in the US market when GLD was introduced, we find that the liquidity of gold company stocks declined and their adverse-selection risk increased after GLD’s introduction. Over the two-month period after GLD’s introduction, the stocks’ relative effective bid-ask spreads increased by more than 15%, while their adverse-selection cost, as measured by the price impact of trades, went up by over 30%. Their trading volume (both in terms of shares and dollars) also significantly declined. The findings support the conjecture that GLD, being a less information-sensitive security, attracted traders, especially uninformed traders, away from gold company stocks. We also find that gold company stocks significantly underperformed the benchmark after GLD started trading. On average, the stocks’ abnormal returns were about −12% during the first month. The findings are consistent with the argument that the stocks’ demand curves are downward-sloping. The migration of trading activities to GLD represented negative demand shocks to the stocks, which caused their demand curves to shift inward and prices to decline. The findings are also consistent with the argument that as gold stocks became less liquid and thus were more costly to trade (due to higher bid-ask spreads), investors required higher expected returns to compensate themselves for the higher costs. Our further test provides support for both explanations, but especially the former. Taken together, our results indicate that the introduction of a new security can have a serious adverse impact on related existing securities. Our findings provide evidence from a new context to the empirical literature on the market impact of financial innovation, which typically concentrates on the effects of options and futures contracts on their underlying securities. The observed decrease in gold stocks’ liquidity is in contrast to the results reported in studies on the effects of index ETFs on their constituent stocks. We believe that this is due to the fact that GLD attracted traders away from gold company stocks, while index ETFs needed to trade the constituent stocks. Accordingly, one cannot assume that the experience in one market will carry over to another. Our results also contribute to the recently emerging literature on the securitization of commodities. So far, there are a few studies in this literature that look at the effects of the securitization on the prices and return dynamics of other related assets. Our findings show that the securitization of commodities can have a negative effect on the stocks of commodity companies if the new securities attract investors away from the stocks. Finally, our results provide supporting evidence to the hypothesis that demand curves for stocks slope down and thus changes in demand can affect asset prices.

Any errors are my responsibility. This Appendix contains formal definitions of some of the trading-activity measures and liquidity measures used in this paper. For each day, we calculate stock For each day, we calculate stock The daily effective spread ( Relative effective spread ( Trade depth ( In this Appendix, we examine whether the bid-ask spreads of gold company stocks changed Specifically, we modify the panel regression equation that we use on the 36 gold companies in Section The coefficient of interest is The regression results are shown in In this appendix, we present evidence that traders in GLD indeed face lower transaction cost and, in particular, lower adverse-selection cost than traders in gold company stocks. The lower adverse-selection risk is what attracts uninformed/liquidity traders away from the stocks. First, we compare trading-activity and liquidity measures between GLD and gold company stocks during the post-GLD period. We calculate the differences in those measures on a daily basis for the 34 trading days in the post-GLD period, and test whether their mean and median are significantly different from zero based on the 34 observations. The results are reported in The estimates of the liquidity measures in Panel B show that GLD is a much more liquid security than an average gold stock. Effective bid-ask spreads, in both dollar term and particularly percentage term, are significantly lower for GLD than for an average gold stock. This suggests that trading in GLD involves much less transaction costs than trading in gold stocks. We also find that the market of gold company stocks is, on average, shallower than that of GLD. The quoted depth (in dollar term) of gold company stocks on average is about seven times smaller than that of GLD. The quoted depth (in share term), however, is higher for gold stocks. We attribute this to the fact that GLD has a higher price than an average gold stock. The average price of GLD during the post-GLD period is around $43, while the average price of an average gold stock during the same period is around $8. Next, we show that trading in GLD entails lower adverse-selection risk than trading in gold company stocks. In Panel A, the spread components are estimated using the MRR approach. Both the non-information component (
