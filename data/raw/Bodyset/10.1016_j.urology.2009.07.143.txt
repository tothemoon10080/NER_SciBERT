In newer lithotripsy systems, SWL is mostly performed ECG-ungated with a fixed shock wave administration rate of 90 or 120 SW/min. There is some evidence that a reduction of shock wave frequency yield better stone comminution due to a decrease of cavitation in the shock wave blast path. It was aim of our experimental setup, to evaluate the quantitative effect of a reduction of shock wave administration rate regarding disintegration efficacy. Artificial stones (AST 0118) fixed in a basket with 2 mm mesh were fragmented in a water tank, mounted on a clinical lithotripter (SIEMENS Lithoskop Our in vitro setup displayed a statistically proven correlation between shock wave administration rate and number of shock wave pulses for complete stone fragmentation (regression analysis, CI 95%, R-Sq (ad) 87,7%). 60 SW/min. instead of 90 (120) SW/min. achieved a statistically significant 10% reduction of shock wave pulses (p < 0,001). However, 90 SW/min. vs. 120 SW/min. showed no significant effect. Slowing down to 30 SW/min. presented a further significant 5 % reduction of SW-pulses (p < 0,001). The reduction of shock wave administration rate is an easy and effective measure, to improve the efficacy of SWL. Significant effects could be achieved with the reduction of shock wave frequency to 60 or 30 SW/min. Furthermore, the need of less shock wave pulses for stone disintegration presents an important aspect, to minimize parenchymal damage of the kidney.
