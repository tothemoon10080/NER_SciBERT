Fixation with an intramedullary nail is commonly employed for tibial shaft fractures, especially those of the mid-diaphysis [ After sufficient reaming, the tubular intramedullary nail should advance with gentle pressure over the ball tipped guidewire. In our case, the reamer ceased to advance 1â€“2cm proximal of the physeal scar. The decision was made to advance the nail by hammer tapping. Cortical bone then collected in the lumen of the tubular nail, crowding the guidewire which was then impacted and impossible to remove. As a result, the entire construct had to be removed. An attempt to salvage the nail by removing the impacted cortical bone, shown in It is generally accepted that some hammer tapping may aid the advancing nail tip. Intermittently pulling back slightly on the reamer to clear debris from the medullary canal is recommended by the AO group [ N/A. None. GH wrote and edited the draft.
