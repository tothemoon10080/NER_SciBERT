The extraction of rhenium from molybdenite roasting dust leach solution was performed using a mixer-settler extractor by tributyl phosphate (TBP) diluted in kerosene as the extractant. In the single-stage extraction experiments, effect of the aqueous to organic phase ratios, Q

                     o, and the number of extraction stages, N, on the rhenium extraction was studied. It was found that using the phase ratio of 1:1 in a two-stage extraction, 87.5% depletion of rhenium was obtained. The comparison of experimental results with the continuous co-current extraction showed a good agreement. The effect of internal recycle of organic phase was investigated in the phase ratio of 1:1 by changing the flow rate ratio of recycle-to-fresh organic phase, Q

(Kerman, Iran). Chemical analysis of the dust used in this research is listed in Operational conditions used for the leaching of dust in this research were as following: distilled water as leachant at the solid to liquid ratio of 1:3.5 at 85 °C for 90 min with the agitation rate of 400 rpm. The bath temperature was digitally controlled within ±0.5 °C. Under these conditions, the value of rhenium in the aqueous solution 600–700 mg/L was obtained. Then, the leach liquor was prepared for the solvent extraction experiments of rhenium in the mixer-settler. For selective extraction of rhenium from the leach liquor, the solvent extraction experiments were performed by 40 vol.% TBP diluted in kerosene as organic solvent and leach liquor at pH = 0 and ambient temperature for 60 min to approach the equilibrium. The solvent extraction data were selected based on previously published results A box-type mixer-settler made of plexiglas was used as the extraction equipment. The dimension of the mixer-settler is 25 × 5 × 8.2 cm ( All the solvent extraction experiments were performed through a single-stage mixer-settler other than continuous co-current extraction experiments, which was carried out through a four-stage mixer-settler. The experiments were conducted at the flow rate ratios, Where In order to verify the results obtained in the single-stage extraction experiments, continuous extraction experiments in the flow rate ratios, After achieving the optimum condition of flow rate ratio and the numbers of extraction stages, the effect of internal recycle on rhenium extraction and mixer-settler performance was investigated. In these experiments, a part of the pregnant organic stream outlet of the settler was returned to the mixer for the re-extraction ( The conditions used for the single-stage extraction experiments have been given in It can be concluded that the increase in Regarding the phase ratio of 1:1, the effect of internal recycle of organic phase in four different conditions was studied ( The approach used in the investigation of the effect of internal recycle cannot be used in the counter-current method because in the counter-current approach, it is needed that all the mixer-settler units to be in use so that the effect of recycle flow in the first stage can be examined. As a result, the co-current method is a useful method in the study of the effect of internal recycle for the continuous extraction experiments in a multi-stage mixer-settler. The single-stage extraction experiments were performed in order to study the effect of the flow rates on rhenium extraction in the phase ratios of 1:1, 3:2, 2:1, and 5:2. Results showed that in the phase ratio of 1:1 a convenient depletion of rhenium was obtained. Effect of the recycle flow was studied for different flow rate ratios. The best one was in the phase ratio of
