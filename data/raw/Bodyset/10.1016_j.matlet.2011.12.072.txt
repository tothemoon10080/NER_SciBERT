The hcp-structured α-Ti is one of the two basic phases (α-Ti and β-Ti) in Ti materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to analyse the α-Ti phase in both as-sintered and as-cast α-Ti materials. The structure factor of the (0001) plane of the α-Ti phase is 0. No diffraction should thus occur from the (0001) plane of the α-Ti phase when characterised by either x-ray diffraction or electron diffraction. However, electron diffraction of the as-sintered α-Ti materials recorded unambiguous diffraction from the (0001) plane as well as (000

The same phenomenon also occurred to the characterisation of as-cast α-Ti materials.Titanium and its alloys are advanced structural materials which possess a range of unique properties including high specific strength, excellent corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility and compatibility with composite materials. They have found wide applications in the aerospace, offshore drilling, chemical processing, biomedical, and other industries The α-Ti phase is one of the two basic phases in Ti materials. It has an hcp crystal structure with lattice parameters of This study is focused on the characterisation of the α-Ti phase in as-sintered α-Ti materials by TEM and XRD. While XRD showed no diffraction from the (0001) plane, TEM recorded election diffractions that correspond unambiguously to the (0001) plane of α-Ti. The same observation occurred to the as-cast α-Ti too. The contradictory observations were clarified through a detailed analysis of the electron diffraction patterns. CP-Ti powder (45-63 TEM (Tecnai F20, operated at 200  The same as-sintered CP-Ti was then analysed by electron diffraction. To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, a thin layer coating of Au was used as an internal standard. Au has a face-centred-cubic (fcc) crystal structure with the lattice parameter of Measurement of the diffraction spots in A closer examination of the SAED patterns in the ( the vectors of ( Since the (0001) patterns, including (0001) and ( It has been found that the electron diffraction of the (0001) plane of the α-Ti phase also occurs in the as-cast CP-Ti. A literature survey has found that the double diffraction phenomenon, which arises from the dynamical nature of electron diffraction The structure factor of the (0001) plane of the hcp-structured commercially pure α-Ti phase is 0. This is confirmed by the absence of the (0001) peak in the XRD diffraction spectra of the as-sintered CP-Ti (α-Ti) material. Electron diffraction, however, clearly records the (0001) plane in the as-sintered CP-Ti. This observation is due to the double diffraction from its two strong neighbouring planes (
