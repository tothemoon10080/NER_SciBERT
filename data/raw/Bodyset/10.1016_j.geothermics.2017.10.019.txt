Evaluating hydraulic properties of fractured reservoirs both during and after stimulation is vital for the development of Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). To constrain the evolution of fracture permeability at sufficiently fine resolution to define reservoir response, we propose a model that couples the moment magnitude to fracture aperture and then estimates the reservoir permeability at relatively high resolution. The critical parameters controlling fracture aperture and permeability evolution are stress-drop, the bulk modulus of the fracture embedded matrix, and the dilation angle of fractures. We employ Oda’s crack tensor theory and a cubic-law based analog to estimate the permeability of a synthetic fractured reservoir at various scales, demonstrating that the resolution of permeability is largely determined by the cellular grid size. These methods are applied to map the in-situ permeability of the Newberry EGS reservoir using observed microearthquakes (MEQs) induced during two rounds of reservoir stimulations in 2014. The equivalent mean permeability evaluated by each method is consistent and unlimited by representative elementary volume (REV) size. With identical parameters, Oda’s crack tensor theory produces a more accurate estimation of permeability than that of the cubic law method, but estimates are within one order of magnitude. The permeability maps show that the most permeable zone is located within the zone of most dense seismicity, providing a reference for the siting of the production well. This model has the potential for mapping permeability evolution from MEQ data in conventional and unconventional resources and at various scales.Frictional parameter (direct effect) Area of the fracture surface  Frictional parameter (evolution effect) Fracture aperture Mechanical aperture at low reference stress Normal aperture Normal aperture before fluid injection Normal aperture after fluid injection Residual aperture Shear aperture Contribution coefficient of tensile failure Contribution coefficient of shear failure Reservoir depth Power-law scaling exponent Young’s modulus Fabric tensor Average shear modulus of fracture embedded rock mass Permeability tensor Mean permeability Matrix permeability Source-type parameter Total mean permeability Mean permeability of aseismic fracture networks Mean permeability of seismic fracture networks Bulk modulus Stress intensity factor Fracture stiffness Fracture trace length Fracture radius or half length Scan line or imaginary grid size (REV size) Moment tensor Seismic moment Seismic moment for pure shear failure Seismic moment for pure tensile failure Moment magnitude Number of fracture Unit vector of the fracture plane Total population of fractures Population of aseismic fractures with size less than critical length Population of seismic fractures Number of activated fractures Number of unactivated fractures Initial hydrostatic pore pressure Total fluid pressure Critical fluid pressure at which the pre-existing fracture is reactivated Wellhead pressure Minimum wellhead pressure required to reactivate preexisting fractures Average fracture spacing Spacing of aseismic fractures Spacing of seismic fractures Fracture spacing Maximum horizontal stress Minimum horizontal stress Vertical stress Maximum principal stress Minimum principal stress Maximum final dislocation for 100% stress drop Average normal opening Average shear displacement Representative elementary volume Reference velocity Coseismic velocity Pre-factor of aperture-to-length scaling law Stiffness parameter Density of centers of fracture planes Density constant in fracture length-frequency power law Kronecker delta Fracture geometric factor Fracture orientation Nondimensional coefficient Static friction coefficient Frictional drop Poisson’s ratio Exponent in the fracture length-frequency power law Normal stress Critical normal stress at which the pre-existing fracture is reactivated Shear stress Stress drop Solid angle Dilation angle Some unconventional resources, such as geothermal energy, have the potential to enable a transition to a more sustainable energy future. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) have the potential to tap the Earth’s vast thermal resource. Since fractures are the most abundant structural feature in the upper crust ( A number of previous studies have provided insight into connections between in-situ MEQ data, inferred subsurface fluid migration and reservoir state. For example, the hydraulic diffusivity may be defined from the analysis of the spatio-temporal growth of the fluid-injection-induced seismic cloud ( In the following, we propose a model to couple in-situ MEQ data and in-situ permeability at various reservoir scales. This model assumes that induced seismicity is controlled by the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and applies the moment magnitude of MEQs to recover fracture shear slip ( The cubic law may be used to link permeability of the reservoir to the aperture of fractures, as a fundamental parameter that, in turn, may be indexed to seismicity. As fluid is usually channeled in permeable fractures that occupy only a small volume of the rock mass, it is important to characterize such hydraulic properties with consideration of the appropriate length scale. The hydraulic properties of the fracture network are captured as an equivalent permeability ( In this study, we are primarily interested in the sensitivity of parameters that control stress state and fracture properties, and their significance in influencing the moment magnitude of MEQs and the evolution of permeability before and after seismic slip. We use a synthetic model to explore the features of the two methods and indicate the most significant factors that dominate the resolution of the evaluated permeability. The significance of this model lies in two aspects: (1) it allows abundant observations of MEQs to constrain the structure and distribution of in-situ permeability evolution of the reservoir; and (2) it reinforces the importance of determining high fidelity in-situ geomechanical parameters ( In the following, we first identify the assumptions and define the key features of the model, and use these to provide the rationale to recover the physical relations that couple both cubic law based equivalent porous medium method and Oda’s crack tensor theory to the hydraulic behavior of fractures. The detailed coupling mechanism is introduced in Naturally fractured reservoirs are complex and difficult to characterize due to the significant uncertainty in the subsurface. Experimental observations provide some constraints on the fluid-mechanical coupling ( Pre-existing natural fractures are the most abundant structures in EGS reservoirs where fractures play a governing role in defining the hydraulic evolution of the reservoir ( If greater details of reservoir fracture attributes ( According to the physical relations in Differing from the synthetic fracture networks, natural reservoir fracture networks are notably more complex and difficult to characterize due to the uncertainties of in-situ stress and geologic discontinuities. For in-situ characterization, statistical field measurement of surface outcrops and fracture statistics from borehole imaging are essential and useful methods to reveal correlated fracture structure in near-surface formations. However, microseismic monitoring is the best way to characterize stimulated fracture networks at depth. In this section, we apply the methods introduced in Section During the 2014 stimulation, about 350 MEQs were located by a fifteen-station microseismic array ( The stress regime is a determining factor that defines the shear failure behavior of the fractures. For the Newberry EGS reservoir we use the normal faulting regime with E-W extension (minimum principal stress) according to World Stress Map. However, the observed focal mechanism solutions show combined double-couple (DC) and non-double-couple (non-DC) results, suggesting a possible strike-slip regime. Due to insufficient evidence to resolve this ambiguity, we use the stress regime aligned with the previous in-situ investigation and related THM simulations ( To analyze all seismic events, we use these 99 focal mechanism solutions as a statistical reference and randomly assign the strike and dip angle values to non-MT seismic fractures based on a normal distribution. Apparent from The observed moment magnitudes of the MEQs are constrained between −0.28 and 2.0 with a We assume that the fluid flow is essentially horizontal and in order to analyze spatial variations of permeability in the reservoir, we select two horizontal zones with the highest concentration of seismic events as an example where fracture traces are projected to a plane of zero-thickness ( The relation between slip distances of seismic fractures and fracture size is presented in In this work we present a model that links observed MEQs to the permeability of the fractured reservoir. The model links the established physical coupling between hydraulic and mechanical properties of fractures, hydroshearing-induced seismicity, and fracture permeability. We first investigate all the controlling parameters in the governing equations and define the most significant geophysical properties that determine the aperture of the fracture, for example, frictional evolution, fracture dilation angle, moment magnitude and the distribution of spatial seismicity ( This work is a partial result of support provided by In Eqs. In this work, the local normal stress with stresses in a local coordinate system obtained by tensor transformation as, According to the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, we assume that shear failure of a pre-existing fracture occurs at the critical normal stress The maximum aperture opening is predicted using a sublinear aperture-to-length scaling law, postulating that fractures of different lengths preserved in a homogenous body of rock are all in the same condition ( In reality, the moment tensor of observed MEQs in EGS reservoirs may indicate mixed failure modes ( These prior physical relations ( The physical relations described in First, a log-linear relationship between seismic moment magnitude ( The variation of fracture aperture with respect to fracture radius may be defined. The initial aperture and evolving aperture of fractures without shear failure, termed The parametric study of physical relations described in In the synthetic model, we set 300 penny-shaped discrete fractures at a prescribed depth of 3 Assuming a gravitational lithostatic stress gradient of 24 When a wellhead pressure of 5 The previous analysis implies that a zone within the reservoir with a high density of seismic events is expected to be more permeable. This prediction is examined by mapping the permeability of the synthetic reservoir after injection at wellhead pressures of 5 In reality, the in-situ stress conditions and observed MEQ data are far more complex than those assumed in the model. For the future prospect of this application method, three essential improvements are recommended to remove intrinsic limitations of the model: (1) Couple the real-time dynamic stress balance in the MEQ-perm coupled model. Based on the framework of this model, a rigorous DFN implemented mechanical model can be developed but this may be at the expenses of computational efficiency when applied at reservoir scale. (2) Understand the fundamental relationship between shear deformation and permeability evolution. This model employs a simple shear dilation – permeability enhancement relation. However, some laboratory and numerical experiments have revealed the contradictory observations that permeability decreases with shear slip due to the generated wear products or gouge (
