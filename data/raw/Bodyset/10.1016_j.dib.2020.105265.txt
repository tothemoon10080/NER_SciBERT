The data here reported were calculated from ab initio quantum mechanical simulations at the DFT/B3LYP level, all-electron Gaussian-type orbitals basis sets and from the analysis of the phonon properties of the zinc sulphide polymorphs and of type-A CAp by means of the quasi-harmonic approximation. In addition, a correction to take into account the effects of dispersive forces was considered to obtain the dataset of type-A carbonated apatite. This dataset, which was validated against experimental thermodynamic data reported in literature, has been employed to construct the phase diagram between the two zinc sulphide polymorphs and discuss their stability over the temperature and pressure range 0–800 K and 0–25 GPa. The thermodynamic and thermoelastic data of CAp were obtained between 0 and 600 K and 0–3 GPa, below the temperature of thermal decomposition of the mineral. The reported data can be of use in several application fields, for instance fundamental georesource exploration and exploitation, and also in applied mineralogy, geology, material science, and as a reference to assess the quality of other theoretical approaches. Furthermore, the data of type-A carbonated apatite could be useful for designing and processing new biomaterials with tailored properties. A detailed dataset on thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties of zinc sulphide polymorphs (zinc-blende and rock-salt ZnS) and of type-A carbonated apatite [Ca Both theoretical and experimental researchers could employ this dataset as a valuable reference to compare the results of their studies. This dataset provides also fundamental insights on the zinc-blende and rock-salt ZnS phases, which could be employed, for example, to devise pressure/temperature sensors. In addition, being zinc sulphide an ore mineral, this dataset could be employed for development of ore mineral processing techniques. Carbonated (hydroxyl)apatite is a key biomaterial for bone reconstruction and repair, and the provided data can drive future researches and developments in the biomaterial field. Zinc-blende (zb, also known as sphalerite from the mineralogical point of view) and rock-salt ZnS (rs) are two polymorphs of zinc sulphide, belonging to the space group The thermodynamics and thermomechanics of both zb-ZnS and rs-ZnS were calculated from the phonon properties of the mineral phases between 0 and 800 K. The effect of pressure was evaluated from 0 GPa to 20 GPa for zinc-blende, whereas for the rock-salt polymorph, which presents phonon instability at low pressure [ primitive unit cell volume ( isothermal bulk modulus, adiabatic bulk modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), isochoric heat capacity, isobaric heat capacity, entropy, absolute enthalpy, absolute Helmholtz free energy, absolute Gibbs free energy, absolute internal energy, The obtained reported data can be employed, for instance, to create bidimensional plots of the desired thermodynamic and thermoelastic properties and to compare them to other theoretical or experimental results. Type-A carbonated apatite [Ca The thermodynamic and thermoelastic data here provided were calculated from the structural and vibrational properties of seven unit cell volumes in the temperature range 0–600 K (step of 1 K), below the temperature of thermal decomposition of the mineral phase [ unit cell volume ( isothermal bulk modulus, K adiabatic bulk modulus, K coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), α isochoric heat capacity, C isobaric heat capacity, C entropy, S ( absolute enthalpy, H ( absolute Helmholtz free energy, F ( absolute Gibbs free energy, G ( absolute internal energy, U ( The data here presented was obtained by first principle simulations on periodic systems, using the CRYSTAL17 code [ Multielectron wave functions are constructed as an antisymmetrized product (Slater determinant) of monoelectronic crystalline orbitals (CO) that are linear combination of local functions (atomic orbitals, AO) centred on each atom in the system. In turn, atomic orbitals (basis set) are linear combinations of Gaussian-type functions (GTF). The all-electron basis sets employed for both Zn The hybrid B3LYP functional [ The compressional behaviour of zinc sulphide and type-A carbonated apatite has been investigated carrying out a symmetry-preserving relaxation procedure by exploring ten volumes between 0.82× At each unit cell compressive state, the energy Thermodynamic and thermomechanics properties of each mineral phase were obtained from lattice dynamics results by means of the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) approach as described by Erba and co-workers [ This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
