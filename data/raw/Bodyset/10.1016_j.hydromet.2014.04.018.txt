The solubility of tenorite, CuO(s), has been measured at 25°C and 60°C as a function of total hydroxide concentration, [OH−]T, at constant ionic strength (I
                     =5 or 6molkg−1) in Li(OH,ClO4)(aq) and Na(OH,ClO4)(aq) media. Additional measurements were also made in highly concentrated (≥6molkg−1) NaOH(aq) and KOH(aq). The solubility (S) of CuO(s), measured as the total concentration of dissolved Cu(II) by atomic absorption spectroscopy, decreased at approximately constant [OH−]T in the order LiOH≫NaOH>KOH and increased with temperature and [OH−]T in all media. Plots of log S against log [OH−]T were linear with a slope of ~2.0, indicating, consistent with UV–Vis spectra, that the only significant Cu(II) species in solution was Cu(OH)4
                     2−(aq) under all conditions studied. Detailed analysis indicates that previous studies overestimated S because of the presence of fine particles of CuO(s). Using equilibrium constants and SIT parameter values derived from the present experimental data, the solubility of CuO(s) could be described with good precision up to the highest hydroxide concentrations investigated in all media.The Bayer process is exploited worldwide for the extraction of alumina from bauxite ores. Despite the maturity of this technology, some 120 Rather few experimental data for the solubility of copper(II) oxide in caustic solutions have been reported ( In the present study, the solubility of tenorite, CuO(s), has been determined at 25 All reagents were of analytical grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), Merck (Germany) or Chem Supply (Australia), and used as received. All solutions were prepared using high purity water (Ibis Technology, Perth, Western Australia) that had been deoxygenated and decarbonated by boiling under high purity N The solubility of CuO(s) was measured in various hydroxide solutions, as outlined below, using the apparatus described in detail elsewhere ( Prior to sampling, the syringes were kept upright in the bath for ca. 5 The sample of CuO(s) used for the solubility studies was characterised with a GBC Emma X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD), using CuKα radiation and 2 The results of the present study are summarized in The solubility of CuO(s) was measured in 5 The equilibrium solubility of CuO(s), measured as [Cu X-ray diffraction measurements of the CuO(s) before and after equilibration with MOH(aq) indicated the crystal phase to be unaltered tenorite throughout. Before-and-after SEM images and EDX analyses of the CuO(s) also did not reveal any significant differences. It follows that the observed variations of The solubility of CuO(s) in LiOH(aq) solution does not appear to have been reported previously but there have been a number of studies in NaOH(aq) and KOH(aq) ( Solubility measurements are a reliable, if not very precise, method for quantifying complex equilibria, often working when all other methods fail ( Assuming all dissolved copper is present as Cu(OH) Therefore a plot of log For solubility measurements to be useful for quantifying equilibria it is essential to keep activity coefficients as constant as possible while varying the concentrations of the interacting species. This is done by making the usual (albeit imperfect) assumption that activity coefficients depend only on A typical plot of log [Cu]  Accordingly, the model selected by The solubilities of CuO(s) at ~ The differences between the present solubilities of CuO(s) and those of The CuO(s) sample used in the present study had a very low surface area (110 Particle-size effects thus account straightforwardly for the higher measured solubilities of It is noteworthy that a single value for the SIT parameter, Solubility measurements of well-characterised CuO(s), tenorite, in alkaline media, supported by UV–Vis spectra, established that (i) the solubility equilibrium is attained quickly (usually within 1 The present results suggest that, for typical caustic concentrations, CuO(s) solubilities in Bayer liquors at precipitation temperatures, usually ~ This work was funded by
