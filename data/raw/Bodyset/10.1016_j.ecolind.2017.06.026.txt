One of the greatest threats to biodiversity and the sustainable functioning of ecosystems is the clearing of forests for agriculture. Because litter-dwelling ants are very good bioindicators of man-made disturbance, we used them to compare monospecific plantations of acacia trees, cocoa trees, rubber trees and pine trees with the surrounding Neotropical rainforest (in contrast to previous studies on forest fragments embedded in industrial monocultures). Although the global level of species turnover was weak, species richness decreased along a gradient from the forest (including a treefall gap) to the tree plantations among which the highest number of species was noted for the cocoa trees, which are known to be a good compromise between agriculture and conservation. Species composition was significantly different between natural habitats and the plantations that, in turn, were different from each other. Compared to the forest, alterations in the ant communities were (1) highest for the acacia and rubber trees, (2) intermediate for the cocoa trees, and, (3) surprisingly, far lower for the pine trees, likely due to very abundant litter. Functional traits only separated the rubber tree plantation from the other habitats due to the higher presence of exotic and leaf-cutting ants. This study shows that small monospecific stands are likely sustainable when embedded in the rainforest and that environmentally-friendly strategies can be planned accordingly.The global-scale conversion of natural ecosystems to agriculture is recognized as one of the major threats to biodiversity and the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems due both to the clearing of native vegetation and the fragmentation and destruction of natural habitats. Species richness is generally reduced as a consequence of the simplified structure of human-altered habitats. Hence, preserving high quality agricultural habitats is a priority on the biodiversity conservation agenda ( In native, resource-rich habitats, the complementary presence of the species making up the communities may have positive effects on ecosystem functions when ecological partitioning occurs, while increasing the growth of the populations thanks to a lower rate of competition ( In the Neotropics, multistrata agroforestry systems (e.g., shade trees in cocoa plantations) are particularly valuable for the conservation of biodiversity because the remaining native forest fragments provide refuge, thus preserving an associated biodiversity very similar to the native one. They can also play the role of template for sustainable agricultural production systems ( Ants are frequently used as bioindicators in studies dealing with natural forests and forest disturbance because they include herbivores, generalists, predators or scavengers, they respond to stress at a finer scale than many other animals, and they occupy a central place in the functioning of tropical ecosystems where they constitute the largest fraction of the animal biomass ( To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive survey has demonstrated shifts in ant community diversity and functional traits from natural forest habitats (be they dense rainforest habitats or treefall gaps within that forest) to comparatively small tree monocultures (i.e., less than 10 Ant sampling was conducted during the dry season of 2014 at the Paracou experimental station in French Guiana (5°16′N, 52°54′W; ≈35 The Winkler method was used because it is highly recommended for ant inventories in forest-like habitats where leaf litter abounds ( All of the ant samples were first preserved in 70% ethanol. Then, voucher specimens and a reference collection were deposited in the Because ants are aggregated in colonies, contrary to non-social insects whose individuals have an equal probability of being caught during sampling, presence/absence data are preferred over abundance data in the analyses ( Species rarefaction curves were plotted on the presence-absence data matrices using EstimateS 9.1.0 software ( We calculated Hill numbers (i.e., “true diversities”) for three different orders (q) of diversity. True diversity indices obey the doubling property, preventing a misleading interpretation of results (see The global turnover between the different ant assemblages was analyzed using the second version of Harrison’s indices ( The community composition data recorded for each habitat type allowed us to build a “291 samples x 247 ant species” matrix (presence-absence data). These data were Hellinger-transformed prior to analysis (see equation ‘13′ in Based on previous studies of the nesting and feeding preferences of leaf-litter ant species ( A total of 247 ant species belonging to 52 genera from nine subfamilies (representing 3949 occurrences) was collected ( Twenty ant species out of the 247 (8.1%) were noted in all six habitats compared, but none of them abounded. Indeed, among them, the specialized predator The Chao2 estimator indicated that a representative part of the leaf-litter ant fauna was inventoried in total (Chao2 Rarefied species richness was significantly higher in the forest (including the treefall gap) than in the monospecific tree plantations, whereas confidence intervals around the mean species richness of tree monocultures were overlapping, indicating no significant difference ( The global beta diversity (Harrison After the In the The present study proves that creating relatively small monocultural tree plantations under conditions where the surrounding tropical rainforest is mostly preserved can limit biodiversity loss and so the consequences for ecosystem services although a decline in ant species diversity was noted ( This study also confirms the notion that man-made disturbances result in greater changes in ant species composition than those caused by natural disturbances (Philpott et al., 2010Philpott and Armbrech, 2006) because the treefall gap was much less affected compared to the rainforest than were the plantations ( The main cause of these differences is likely due to a homogenous leaf litter in monospecific plantations compared to natural forests (see Among the plantations compared here, the litter of the cocoa trees had the highest number of rarefied ant species as well as the highest values for true diversities of orders 1 and 2 ( Among the compared monocultures, the pine tree plantation surprisingly shared the largest number of ant species with the forest ( A lower diversity for Functional traits separated only the rubber tree plantation from all other compared habitats ( In conclusion, biotic homogenization can be prevented when tree monocultures are small and embedded in the rainforest as functional diversity was preserved in three tree species plantations and only slightly affected in the fourth one. So, when necessary to sustain human populations, conservation programs can include small-scale tree plantations all while preserving the rainforest (see We are grateful to Andrea Dejean for proofreading the manuscript and Frédéric Azémar for technical assistance.
