This study aims at the experimental analysis of the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) phenomenon. Experiments are conducted in which martensite is allowed to grow under the influence of a series of externally applied stresses. The magnitude of the applied stresses is less than 67% of the yield strength of austenite σγ(T
                     s. Since there is no obvious difference between the transformation plasticity under tension and the compression for the lower applied stresses, only compressive stresses are applied. The results confirm that the transformation plasticity is proportional to the applied stress if the latter does not exceed 67% of σγ(T
                     s. The TRIP-strain, the kinetics, and their dependence on the applied stresses are studied. The comparison between calculated results and experimental results shows that the model accurately describes the phenomenon.
