Core logging is the geological study, recording and classification of petrophysical attributes of drill hole samples, such as lithology, alteration or mineralogical assemblage. The geological logging is qualitative and subject to errors because of its visual nature and other factors inherent to logging, such as low drill hole recoveries, difficulties in estimating the volumetric contents of minerals, or different logging criteria among geologists. To date, different tools for quality control and validation of geological logging have been elaborated, based on geological knowledge, statistics, geostatistics, image analysis, neural network and data mining. This paper presents an alternative approach based on geostatistical modeling for identifying and reclassifying potentially mislogged samples when quantitative covariates from geochemical analyses or metallurgical tests are available. The principle of this approach is to: (i) define geological domains for each quantitative variable by an adequate grouping of the log classes; (ii) transform the quantitative variables into normal scores, accounting for the previously defined domains, (iii) model the spatial correlation structure of the normal scores, (iv) perform leave-one-out cross validation and obtain predictions of the normal variables and the associated variance-covariance matrices of prediction errors; (v) calculate a measure of consistency for each sample and each possible logged class under a multivariate normal assumption; and (vi) compare these measures of consistency with the actual logged classes to detect suspicious logs. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study from an iron ore deposit, with data of rock type logged by geologists and seven quantitative variables (grades of elements of interest, loss on ignition and granulometry).Drilling is the most expensive procedure in mineral exploration. Information from drill holes can be extracted by different methods, such as assaying, down-the-hole geophysical logging or geological core logging ( However, due to the visual nature of logging, the classification of petrophysical attributes is qualitative and subject to errors, which may be explained by several factors ( Quality control and validation of geological logging have been discussed in the fields of geosciences and resources engineering, where manual to automated procedures have been elaborated, based on geological knowledge, statistics, geostatistics, image analysis, neural network and data mining tools ( This work aims at presenting an improvement of the approach by The paper is outlined as follows. Section Let us consider a set of drill hole samples with spatial coordinates { For mineral resources evaluation in heterogeneous deposits, each quantitative variable is generally associated with geological domains that consist of a single log class or a group of log classes such that (i) the quantitative variable can be modeled as a stationary field (i.e., a field whose distribution is invariant under a spatial translation) within each domain and (ii) there is a change of distribution between one domain and another (e.g., one observes some discontinuity or some change in the spatial continuity when crossing the boundary between two domains). A contact analysis is helpful at this stage to determine the best grouping and therefore identify the geological domains ( The data of each quantitative variable within each of its geological domains are declustered in order to obtain a distribution corrected for possible biases caused by irregular sampling patterns, then normal score transformed, i.e., transformed into data that follow a standard Gaussian distribution ( As the geological domains associated with a given quantitative variable do not overlap, the normal score data associated with the different domains are totally heterotopic, i.e., they are not defined at the same locations. In contrast, the normal scores data associated with different quantitative variables may be isotopic, partially heterotopic or totally heterotopic, depending on whether the geological domains are the same, partially overlap or are disjoint and on the sampling design of the quantitative variables (isotopic or heterotopic). Since sample cross-variograms cannot be calculated for heterotopic datasets ( On the basis of the calculated sample covariances, a linear coregionalization model can be fitted by using combinations of basic nested covariance models ( Leave-one-out cross-validation ( For each sample Assume that, if no logging error occurred, class Transform the From the vector of cokriging prediction obtained in Subsection Similarly, from the variance-covariance matrix of cokriging errors, extract the sub-matrix Based on the assumption made at stage (1), the conditional distribution of the Gaussian random fields at the sample location is multivariate normal with mean equal to the cokriging prediction and with variance-covariance matrix equal to that of the cokriging errors ( It provides a measure of the distance between the generic point The This integral can be computed by using integration by parts. One finds: At the end of this process, one obtains, for each drill hole sample ( The proposed methodology is now applied to a data set from an iron ore deposit, the name and location of which are not disclosed for confidentiality reasons. The deposit is hosted by banded iron formations and is explored by diamond drill holes dipping from 60° to 90°. A total of 4096 samples are taken from cores and sent for analysis, yielding data for seven quantitative variables: grades of iron (Fe), silica (SiO Code 1: Friable hematite (FH) Code 2: Compact hematite (CH) Code 3: Alumina-rich hematite (ALH) Code 4: Alumina-rich itabirite (ALI) Code 5: Manganese-rich itabirite (MNI) Code 6: Compact itabirite (CI) Code 7: Friable iron-poor itabirite (FPI) Code 8: Friable iron-rich itabirite (FRI) Code 9: Amphibolitic itabirite (AI) Code 10: Canga (CG). The deposit is divided into a supergene layer (surficial canga) and underlying ferruginous rocks. On the one hand, CG is a layer of well-consolidated rock composed mainly of goethite derived from weathering of the iron formation, with high iron grade, alumina grade and loss on ignition. On the other hand, the underlying rocks are subdivided on the basis of their granulometry and contents of iron, alumina, manganese and loss on ignition. Specifically, iron is mainly present in the form of hematite and itabirite. The former is an oxide-facies formation with high iron grade (most often above 62%), while the latter is a laminated, metamorphosed oxide-facies formation in which iron is present as thin layers of hematite, magnetite or martite, with grade generally less than 62% ( The first modeling step involves partitioning the deposit into domains in which the quantitative variables are homogeneously distributed and can be represented by stationary random fields ( The results of contact analysis, which aims at determining the behavior of the mean value of a quantitative variable in the neighborhood of the boundary between two rock type domains. Some examples are provided in The data statistics (mainly the mean value and the standard deviation) within each rock type. The rock types belonging to the same domain are expected to have similar statistics. An example is given in The location and contact relationships of the rock types in the deposit. In particular, CG appears as a specific domain for all the quantitative variables because of its surficial position and because the data statistics in CG differ from those in any other rock type ( The lithological controls on the variable under study. For example, hematites and itabirites are likely to form two different domains for the iron and silica grades, but not necessarily for the other quantitative variables. Likewise, the compact and friable rock types are likely to define two different domains for the granulometry, but not for the remaining quantitative variables. In the following, the study will focus on the underlying ferruginous rocks, i.e., we will no longer consider surficial canga, as its characterization depends more on the geographical position than on the quantitative variables. Overall, there are 19 combinations of quantitative variables and geological domains: Fe-1, Fe-2, Fe-3, SiO Note that the normal scores associated with different quantitative variables and/or with different geological domains are assumed to be dependent, i.e., the linear coregionalization model assumes the existence of spatial cross correlations between all the 19 underlying Gaussian random fields. Accordingly, even if a quantitative variable is discontinuous across the boundary between two different domains, its values within these two domains are not necessarily independent (a situation sometimes referred to as a “transitional” boundary). The above model parameters (normal score transformation tables and theoretical direct and cross covariances) will not change in all the subsequent stages of the study, insofar as we assumed that only a small proportion of the samples is mislogged, hence their effect on the model parameters should be marginal. For each drill hole sample, the 19 Gaussian random fields are predicted by simple cokriging, using a vector of zero means, the previously fitted linear coregionalization model and a moving neighborhood (in the present case, a ball with a radius of 300 For each drill hole sample (index Assume that rock type k prevails at the sample under consideration. In view of the geological domains associated with the quantitative variables ( Transform the measured values of the original quantitative variables (grades, loss on ignition and granulometry) into normal scores, using the transformation tables associated with the adequate geological domains. Obtain the “true” Gaussian vector From the cross-validation results, extract the 7 Calculate the To detect samples that may be mislogged, the following criteria based on the calculated The The In addition, to get results that are consistent with the geological zonation of the deposit, a geographical criterion is also considered, namely, that the alternative (likely) class has been logged at some drill hole sample distant less than 50 Accordingly, each sample meeting all three mentioned conditions represents a suspicious data that should be examined on a case-by-case basis. Note that the geographical distance limit (50 The application of the previous criteria yields a total of 2.42% of the drill hole samples identified as suspicious. In the following, a few of these suspicious samples are discussed in more details, in the light of their logged rock types, values of the quantitative variables (grades, loss on ignition and granulometry) (       There is an increasing need in the mining industry for high performance of mineral resource models. A portion of model deviations are caused by mislogged samples, for which the logged value of a petrophysical attribute such as the lithology, alteration or mineralogical assemblage is erroneous. Considering the regionalized nature of petrophysical attributes and their dependence relationships with quantitative variables from geochemical analyses or metallurgical tests, a geostatistical approach based on leave-one-out cross-validation has been proposed for identifying possible mislogged samples. The proposal is aimed at calculating, for each sample, a measure of consistency between the logged classes and the quantitative covariates. It is worthwhile to mention that the application is not black-boxed and allows the practitioner to include additional criteria (e.g., To illustrate the applicability of the proposal, a case study from an iron ore deposit has been presented, where the logged rock types are closely related with seven quantitative variables (grades of iron, silica, phosphorus, alumina, manganese, loss on ignition and granulometry) measured on the same set of exploration drill holes. The samples detected as suspicious have been carefully checked on the basis of their logged classes and quantitative covariates, as well as on the basis of the information of the neighboring samples, in order to confirm or reject the correctness of the original rock type logs. The proposed approach can be applied in several geometallurgical contexts, for example by using geochemical data as covariates for defining lithologies, ore mineralogical data from QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy) analyses for finding mineral zones, or gangue mineralogical data derived from spectroscopy for recognizing alterations, or all the previous types of data as well as metallurgical tests for identifying geometallurgical domains. In all these contexts, the identification of misslogged samples can be beneficial for the overall performance of the value chain of the mining business and provide criteria to define samples that should be part of a relogging campaign.
