A comparison of present results was also made with the previous similar experimental results.Solidification and melting are the transformations between the crystallographic and noncrystallographic states of a metal or alloys. These transformations are basic to such technological applications as ingot and continuous casting, and directionally solidification of composites and single crystals. An understanding of the mechanism of solidification and how it is affected by such parameters as temperature distribution, solidification conditions and alloying, are important in the control of the mechanical and electrical properties of cast metals and fusion welds Eutectic alloys are the basis of most casting alloys. Research initially focused on materials for high temperature structural applications, but it was soon broadened to non-structural materials for electric, magnetic, and optical applications Two-phase planar eutectic growth has been extensively studied since 1960’s for a wide range of binary alloy systems. Several authors made the extension to ternary systems, usually to investigate possible three-phase coupled growth configurations More recently, Al-based alloys with high strength and light weight have attracted rapidly increasing interest because of the increase in the importance of energy and environmental problems on the earth. Ordinary Al-based alloys have been developed by the use of the following conventional strengthening mechanisms; i.e. solid solution, precipitation, grain size refinement, dispersion, work hardening and fiber reinforcement Al–Mg–Si alloys are being increasingly used in automotive and aerospace industries for critical structure applications because of their excellent castability, corrosion resistance and good mechanical properties in the heat treated conditions and consequential precipitation hardening of Mg Thus, purpose of the present work was to experimentally investigate the dependencies of the eutectic spacings ( In the present work, the experimental procedure consists of alloy preparation, the microstructure observation and the measurements of solidification parameters, lamellar spacings, microhardness, tensile strength and electrical resistivity for directionally solidified ternary Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy. The composition of Al–Si–Mg ternary alloy was chosen to be Al–12.95 The quenched sample was removed from the graphite crucible and cut into lengths, typically 8 The microstructures of samples were photographed from both transverse and longitudinal sections with an The temperature in the specimen was measured with K-type, 0.25 One of the purposes of present work was to reveal the relationships between the solidification processing parameters with microhardness for directionally solidified AlSiMg eutectic alloy. The mechanical properties of any solidified materials are usually determined with a hardness test, tensile strength test, etc. Microhardness measurements in this present work were made with a The uniaxial tensile test was performed at room temperature at a strain rate of 10 Electrical resistivity is an imperative physical property. Impurities observed in metals distort the metal lattice and can affect the behavior of The four-point probe method is the most widely used technique for electrical profile measurement of materials. The method has proven to be a convenient tool for the resistivity measurement. A four-point probe measurement is performed by making four electrical contacts to cleaned sample surface. A The aluminum corner of the Al–Mg–Si phase diagram is given in As expected, the formations of the microstructures have varied with the growth rates at constant temperature gradients. As the growth rate is increased, the eutectic spacings decrease at a constant temperature gradient. The highest eutectic spacings were obtained with the minimum value of growth rate at a constant temperature gradient ( The measured values of lamellar spacings in the Al–Si–Mg alloy as a function growth rates at a constant temperature gradient are given in Besides, the exponent values of 0.45 and 0.44 are in a good agreement with the values of 0.51, 0.46, 0.51, 0.49, 0.50 and 0.53 obtained by Böyük and Maraşlı The values of bulk growth rates for Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy were also determined as It is well known that some important solidification parameters, such as growth rate, significantly affect the microstructural scale as well as the mechanical properties of metals. Materials processed via directional solidification tend to show advantages of refined micro-structure, reduced microsegregation, etc. From Hall The photographs of microstructures were taken from transverse to longitudinal sections of the samples and the measurements of eutectic spacings were made from the photographs of microstructures with a linear intercept method One of the purposes of this investigation is to obtain the dependence of HV on As can be seen from It can be also seen from The relationship between HV and The exponent value of HV relating to growth rate for directionally solidified Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy obtained in present work is slightly smaller than the exponent values of HV relating to V for the binary Al–Si Variation of tensile strength with growth rate for Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy is plotted in From The exponent value of 0.20 for Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy is in a good agreement with the exponent value of 0.19 obtained for Al–Si–Ni eutectic alloy As mentioned above, the electrical resistivity of the directionally solidified Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy with different growth rates were measured by the d.c. four-point probe method at room temperature and the variation of electrical resistivity with growth rate for Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy is plotted in A comparison of present result with the variation of electrical resistivity versus growth rate for Al–Si–Ni eutectic alloy From The exponent value of 0.13 for Al–Si–Mg eutectic is 60% bigger than the exponent value of In present work, Al–Si–Mg eutectic alloy, has the commercial and technological importance was directionally solidified with different growth rates at a constant temperature gradient ( This project was supported by
