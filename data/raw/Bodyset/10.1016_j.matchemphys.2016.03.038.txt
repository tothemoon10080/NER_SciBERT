A facile method for preparation of barium hexaferrite, BaFe12O19 was reported. The barium hexaferrite synthesized via the metal organic complex formed by reacting Ba(NO3)2 and Fe(NO3)3.9H2O with triethanolamine, N(CH2CH2OH)3, ligand using ethylene glycol, HOCH2CH2OH, as a solvent and subsequent calcination. Effect of calcination temperatures on the material characteristics was examined by XRD, FTIR and SEM. Magnetic properties of the prepared products were studied by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). The hysteresis loop of the BaFe12O19 sample prepared by calcining at 1200 °C for 2 h showed hard magnetic behavior with coercivity (H

In addition, the preliminary work of using the barium ferrite calcined at 1200 °C for 2 h as a filler for polybutylene succinate (PBS) based composite materials to make the magnetic composite materials was carried out.Hexagonal barium ferrite (BaFe Solid state reaction is the conventional synthetic route of BaFe Firstly, metal-organic complex was synthesized and used as the precursor for preparing BaFe Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the Ba–Fe–TEA complex decomposition was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 with heating rate of 5 °C XRD diffraction patterns of all the calcined products were obtained from a Phillips X-Pert-MPD X-ray diffractometer, operating at 40 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded in the range 4000–400 cm The general morphology of the samples was analysed by a FEI Quanta 450 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Samples were mounted on stubs using carbon tape and then sputtered with Au to avoid particle charging. The hysteresis loops of the obtained samples were recorded by a LAKESHORE vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Hardness of the composite samples were measured by Hardness shore D GS702N Type D model from Teclock.  The FTIR spectra of the Ba–Fe–TEA complex and the calcined powders are shown in XRD diffraction patterns of all the products calcined in air for 2 h at temperatures of 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 °C are displayed in Effect of calcination periods, i.e. 2, 5 and 8 h at 1000 °C in the synthetic process was also studied. XRD patterns of the thermally treated products were demonstrated in The FTIR spectra and XRD diffraction patterns of the obtained powders calcined between 600 and 1200 °C revealed that Fe This reaction mechanism is consistent with that reported for barium ferrite prepared using glycine as a fuel Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the samples calcined at different conditions are shown in Hysteresis loops of the products calcined for 2 h at 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 °C are shown in In the present work, the synthetic route including the effects of calcination temperatures and times on the structural characteristics of powders of BaFe BaFe This research was supported by
