Ectopic mineralization, i.e., aberrant deposition of calcium phosphate complexes in connective tissues, particularly in arterial blood vessels, is globally a major cause of morbidity and early mortality. In fact, an earlier study reported the relative risk of death associated with coronary artery calcification as an independent risk factor in a cohort of 25,253 patients to be up to 12.5-fold Significant insights into the pathomechanisms of ectopic mineralization have been gained from observations on heritable disorders with defined gene defects. The prototype of such conditions is pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a multisystem disorder characterized by deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite in various connective tissues with protean manifestations There is no specific treatment currently available for prevention of systemic ectopic mineralization in PXE, GACI, or ACDC. Considering the notion that reduced PPi plasma concentration is a critical factor resulting in ectopic mineralization, it has been suggested that administration of PPi might be helpful in preventing mineralization processes, and recent studies have suggested that ingestion of PPi in In this issue of the Bisphosphonates have 2 principal effects on mineralization processes: 1) antimineralization activity that reflects their incorporation into calcium phosphate crystals preventing their growth; and 2) antiosteoclastic activity preventing bone resorption It is interesting to note that in the study by Kranenburg etÂ al.
