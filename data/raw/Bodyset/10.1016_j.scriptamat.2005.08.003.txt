Development of textures after heavy cold rolling (∼95%) and annealing were studied in powder metallurgically prepared pure Ni, Ni–5at.%W and Ni–5at.%Mo alloys. It has been found that W and Mo additions to Ni are beneficial for the development of sharp cube texture, although W has a much more pronounced effect than Mo.The RABiTS Nickel powder of purity 99.99% (Sigma–Aldrich) of −100 mesh size was used as the starting material. Ni and Ni alloys of composition Ni–5at.%W and Ni–5at.%Mo were prepared by a typical powder metallurgy method of mixing the powders, pressing at 250  From the above results it is quite apparent that the cube component is decidedly much sharper in the Ni–5at.%W alloy as compared to pure Ni and the Ni–5at.%Mo alloy, after different annealing treatments. A strong cube texture has been reported in cold rolled and annealed Ni–W alloy up to 5 at.% W Here of course, a simple powder metallurgy method comprising powder compaction and sintering was used followed by cold rolling and recrystallization. In this respect the present method of material preparation is substantially different from all the previous methods. In order to investigate the sharp difference in cube texture intensity in pure Ni and Ni–5at.%W alloy, the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) for the two materials was measured. These results, shown in Among powder metallurgically prepared pure Ni, Ni–5at.%W and Ni–5at.%Mo alloys, the Ni–5at.%W develops a much sharper cube texture after severe cold rolling and annealing. Significant differences in grain boundary character distribution between pure Ni and Ni–5at.%W alloy are also evident. Preferential segregation of W in grain boundaries could be a possible reason for that.
