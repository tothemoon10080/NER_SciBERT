The traditional Bond work index proposed by F.C. Bond over 60 years ago is still today a useful tool for characterizing material crushability and grindability in the minerals industry. Although not as popular as the Bond ball mill or the Bond rod mill work indices, the impact work index, also called Bond crushability index, continues to be much used for crusher selection. The present work shows the application of a model that combines measurements of particle fracture energies and a parameter that characterizes material amenability to breakage by repeated impacts in the prediction of the Bond crushability index. Results show that a reasonably good agreement exists between measured and predicted results, as long as losses in the pendulum apparatus, used to determine the Bond crushability index, are taken into account in the simulations.cross-sectional area of the impact load cell rod (m wave propagation velocity in the ILC rod (m impact energy per unit particle thickness, also called crushing resistance (J damage variable, which corresponds to the fraction of any cross-section of the particle that is not able to withstand load (–) particle size (m) maximum value of the damage variable reached during loading the particle (–) amount of damage sustained by the particle in the specific particle fracture energy (J specific particle fracture energy of a particle after the specific input energy – kinetic energy of the drop weight per unit of particle weight (J specific input energy used in the specific input energy used in the median of the log-normal distribution of specific particle fracture energies (J 80% passing size in the crusher feed (μm) load on the particle as a function of time (N) acceleration due to gravity (m stiffness of the particle prior to impact (GPa) stiffness of the damaged particle (GPa) weight of the striker used in the ILC (kg) particle weight (kg) number of impacts (–) 80% passing size in the crusher product (μm) cumulative fracture energy distribution of particles in a sample or proportion of particle broken (–) time (s) time at primary fracture (s) impact velocity (m specific energy consumption (kWh particle thickness – distance between loading points (mm) Bond work index (kWh modulus of elasticity of the particle (N local deformation of the system comprised by particle and platens (m) local deformation of the system at primary fracture (m) damage accumulation constant (–) release angle in the Bond pendulum (–) Poisson’s ratio of the particle (–) rod specific gravity (kg particle specific gravity (g A number of methods have been used to characterize rocks for crusher selection. Perhaps the most traditional is the one proposed by F.C. Bond over 60 years ago ( The test, such as a number of tests used in generating empirical measures in engineering, is based on a standard procedure and equipment and the result depends on adhering very strictly to them. In the last few decades, there has been a growth in interest for direct measurements of strain energy at fracture and the strength of single particles, which are more fundamental material properties ( Samples of 25 materials have been collected for testing, which include several samples of limestones, bauxites, acid and basic rocks, as well as coals. The samples have been prepared for testing by sieving in the appropriate size fractions and their specific gravity determined by pycnometry. An impact pendulum that follows strictly Bond’s standard for crushability measurement (  From this and the material specific gravity Samples of 20 particles are individually weighted and their thickness measured, followed by testing by successive increase of the impact angle of the pendulums, recording the value of The Bond crushability index is given by the median of the distribution ( A detailed description of the experimental apparatus and the analysis of the data can be found elsewhere ( The impact load cell ( Experiments were conducted using the impact load cell measuring 63 The distribution of particle fracture energies can be described well with the log-normal distribution, given by Additional experiments were conducted to determine the amenability of the various materials to fracture by repeated impacts ( The load–deformation response that results from impact of a spherical particle can be described by a combination of continuum damage mechanics ( The damage variable Assuming that the parameters A minimum of two experiments is required to determine a measurement of the distribution of particle fracture energies from a test at a loading energy that is sufficiently high for primary breakage of all particles in the sample (parameters in Eq. impacts at a constant low-energy level to determine the cumulative fraction of broken particles. In these experiments the impact energy is given by Results of experiments used to determine the parameter In the case of Bond’s standard pendulum test, the specific impact energy varies according to The simulation is carried out until all particles have broken. Typical experimental results from Bond crushability tests are presented in Eq. Tests have been conducted in the Bond pendulum and the impact load cell by impacting a 20-mm diameter tungsten carbide ball positioned between the striker(s) and a lead plate. In the case of the Bond pendulum, one hammer was kept at rest while the other was moved to different angles. The mean diameter of the impression was then precisely measured and results are related to the energy applied in the test ( This correction corresponds to a reduction in the calculated energy that varies from about 15% at lower angles up to as high as 40% for the largest angles used in the test. A step-by-step description of the simulation procedure is presented as follows, along with a worked example that uses data from acid rock 3 ( The first step is the transformation of the initial continuous distribution of particle fracture energies (Eq. The specific energy used in the impact simulating the pendulum is then computed using Eq. After this first impact, particles that presented specific particle fracture energies higher than Steps b and c are then repeated successively for The proportion of material broken at each impact (read in the ordinate of From the value of Simulations have been conducted, the impact work index calculated for the materials tested and results are shown in It is important to note that the simulated Finally, the approach used in the present work is based on measurements of material characteristics that contain all the required material information to predict the crushing resistance. It differs from another approach also recently used to predict the Bond crushability index ( Rather than aiming to demonstrate that the Bond impact work index should be determined using the present procedure instead of Bond’s pendulum, the present work shows that data measured in the impact load cell are consistent with those obtained using standard technical measures, such as the impact work index. As a result, it represents a sound basis for more advanced modeling and scale-up procedures of crusher selection for use in the future. A simulation procedure based on the combination of the damage mechanics model of particle fracture and measurements of the distribution of particle fracture energies has been successfully used to predict the Bond crushability index and leads to results that agree reasonably well with measurement results. The work demonstrates that energy losses in the pendulum device must be taken into account in the simulations and that the progressive weakening that particle undergo as a result of repeated impacts plays a significant role in the value of the Bond crushing work index.
