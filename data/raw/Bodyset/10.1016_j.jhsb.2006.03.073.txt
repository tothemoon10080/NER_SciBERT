Introduction: Operative treatment of the metacarpal fractures includes a variety of methods. The purpose of this study is to evaluate retrospectively the results after treatment of metacarpal fractures in two groups that were treated with internal fixation with plates and screws or with external fixation. Material and methods: Ninety fractures were treated from February 2000 to March 2005 with the methods of open reduction and internal fixation or with the application of an external fixator. Fifty-six were treated with open reduction and internal fixation and 34 fractures were treated with external fixation. Indications for ORIF included transverse, oblique, spiral fractures without an extensive injury to soft tissues. The applied hardware was very low profile plates and screws. External fixation was used in fractures with extensive comminution and injury to soft tissues, in fractures with bone defects and in fractures with infection. Results: Mean follow-up was 32 months (8–50) for the group treated with ORIF and 22 months (7–37) for the group treated with external fixator. The extensor fixation device was removed after a mean of 33 days (28–52). In this group 28 patients had good or excellent results while six patients with severe combined injuries had poor results. In the group of patients with ORIF 48 of the 56 patients had good or excellent results. For evaluation of hand function the DASH score was used. It was six (0–56) for the ORIF group and four (0–15) for the external fixation group. Discussion and conclusion: Following the appropriate indications and techniques both methods proved to be very efficient in the treatment of metacarpal fractures. Active mobilization is achieved early with both methods. The external fixator can be used in more severe injuries and in fractures with infection but its cost is higher. The surgeon must be familiar with the safe paths in the hand in order to avoid injury to tendons or nerves and vessels.
