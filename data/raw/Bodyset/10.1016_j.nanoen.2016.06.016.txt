Here, we report the fabrication of a graphene-wrapped nanostructured reactive hydride composite, i.e., 2LiBH4-MgH2, made by adopting graphene-supported MgH2 nanoparticles (NPs) as the nanoreactor and heterogeneous nucleation sites. The porous structure, uniform distribution of MgH2 NPs, and the steric confinement by flexible graphene induced a homogeneous distribution of 2LiBH4-MgH2 nanocomposite on graphene with extremely high loading capacity (80wt%) and energy density. The well-defined structural features, including even distribution, uniform particle size, excellent thermal stability, and robust architecture endow this composite with significant improvements in its hydrogen storage performance. For instance, at a temperature as low as 350Â°C, a reversible storage capacity of up to 8.9wt% H2, without degradation after 25 complete cycles, was achieved for the 2LiBH4-MgH2 anchored on graphene. The design of this three-dimensional architecture can offer a new concept for obtaining high performance materials in the energy storage field.Lithium borohydride (LiBH Developing reactive hydride composites (RHCs) by incorporating metal hydrides has been proven to be an effective strategy for lowering the reaction enthalpy, enhancing the kinetics, and improving the reversible capacity of LiBH Nevertheless the 2LiBH In this paper, we have adopted a bottom-up self-assembly strategy to controllably synthesize three-dimensional (3D) MgH The growth of homogeneous MgH After infiltration and nucleation of LiBH The hydrogen storage performance of the graphene-supported 2LiBH It has been clarified that, at elevated temperature and low hydrogen pressure, individual decomposition of LiBH The thermodynamics of graphene-supported 2LiBH The long-term kinetic measurements, an important challenging and key aspect in practical hydrogen storage applications, were carried out by isothermal hydrogenation and dehydrogenation at 350 In the light of these observations, the superior hydrogen storage performance and cycling stability of graphene-supported 2LiBH In summary, we have demonstrated the rational fabrication of a nanostructured binary composite, Graphene-supported MgH The synthesis of 2LiBH The ball-milling of LiBH Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Netzsch STA 449 F3) in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS; Hidden HPR 20) was carried out under dynamic argon with a heating rate of 5 The hydrogen storage performance of the as-prepared samples were studied on a Sieverts apparatus (GRC, Advanced Materials Corp., USA). The desorption properties were determined at various temperatures under a hydrogen pressure of 0.3 This work was partially supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
