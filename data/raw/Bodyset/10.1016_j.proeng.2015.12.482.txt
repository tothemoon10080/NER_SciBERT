In the present work, we propose to design and manufacture a specific Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) prototype in order to evaluate its performance when some geometrical parameters are modified. The key idea is to take advantage of additive manufacturing flexibility to print the main components in an easy way and at low cost. Prototype size (scale 1:250, with respect to a 2 MW wind turbine) is small enough to be tested in a 40cm x 40cm wind tunnel. We use a Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) machine to print the prototype, which is previously designed via CAD software. Different tests have been performed to determine an adequate printing configuration, mainly regarding how layer height influences roughness and printing time. Main dimensions, roughness and weight of the printed pieces were measured and finally, parts of highest quality were used to assemble a working prototype. The methodology presented in this paper shows it is possible to manufacture a wind turbine prototype with the following characteristics: flexibility to modify the design throughout the course of the investigation, low cost and low time needed to obtain the components with enough quality.
