This study investigates the isothermal, batch, H2SO4 acid leaching behaviour of siliceous goethitic (SG) nickel (Ni) laterite ore and its links to pulp rheology. Specifically, the effect of feed ore particle size (−0.2 vs −2.0mm), leaching temperature (70 vs 95°C) and pulp rheology on Ni and pay metal, cobalt (Co) extraction kinetics and yield was studied for 4h on 40wt.% solid dispersions at pH 1. The leaching behaviour was distinctly incongruent, reflecting the disproportionate proliferation of major gangue mineral’s constituent elements (e.g., Fe, Al, Mg, Na, Si) alongside Ni and Co in the pregnant leach solution. At 70°C, Ni/Co extraction rates were notably lower (<20%) in contrast with 95°C where a significant increase in Ni/Co extraction to 78/77% and 74/77%, respectively, for the −0.2 and −2.0mm feeds occurred. The slurries displayed a non-Newtonian, shear thinning Bingham plastic rheological behaviour of which the viscosity and shear yield stress increased markedly in the course of 4h leaching. The pulp viscosity and shear yield stress were greater at lower temperature than at higher temperature and they were also greater in slurries with finer than coarser feed particles. The dynamic pulp rheology, however, had no marked effect on the overall Ni/Co extraction rates. Whilst the feed ore particle size had no remarkable impact on overall Ni/Co extraction, it led to noticeably higher acid consumption and enhanced slurry rheology in the finer sized ore. The mechanism of leaching the SG ore followed a two-stage, first order chemical reaction-controlled shrinking core model, the kinetics of which gave higher rate constants and lower activation energies for the release of Ni, Co, Fe and Mg in the first stage. A faster leaching process involving more reactive minerals during the first 30min is envisaged to be followed by leaching of the more refractory minerals.The majority of the world’s nickel (Ni) resources occur as laterite ores which are exceptionally complex, low grade and costly to process using conventional smelting and high pressure autoclave methods. With continuous increase in demand for Ni in recent years, the introduction of more economically viable processing routes such as atmospheric leaching (AL) offers great potential for Ni laterite ores. Due to Ni laterite ore’s characteristic variability, ore-body specific investigation to facilitate their hydrometallurgical processability is commonly required. Several studies have been reported on strategies to improve the leaching mechanisms and kinetics of lateritic ores ( The effect of parameters such as pH, temperature, particle size and slurry solid loading on the atmospheric leaching of various Ni laterite ores has been examined. Higher leaching temperature generally leads to reduced batch time and increased extraction rates ( Recent column leaching studies on the pre-agglomerated SG feed ore showed that primary feed particle size (−0.038, −2.00 and −15.00 One of our recent studies on a fine ground (−0.2 Polydispersed, −2 40 Isothermal, batch leaching tests were conducted for 40 Rheological measurements were carried out on the samples removed from 40 For direct yield stress measurements, the Vane technique was used. The advantage of this method is the minimized slip effect particularly for structured dispersions ( To understand the influence of particle size, temperature and time on leaching behaviour of the SG ore slurries at pH 1, the corresponding pulp chemistries (i.e., leached ions’ concentration in slurry) were determined and the results are shown in  The effect of temperature (70 vs. 95 To confirm the observed leaching trends, chemical and mineralogical analyses were carried out on the leached solid products and the results are summarized in The influence of temperature and particle size on the percent extraction of Ni, Co, Fe and Mg measured as a function of time under different conditions at pH 1 are shown in  The correlation between the extractions of Ni and Co and those of the major gangue metal species (Fe and Mg) are given in Analysis of the acid consumption by the SG ore indicated a significant feed size, time and temperature-dependent behaviour (  The impact of mechanical shear forces due to agitation at 600  The effect of feed particle size, temperature (70 and 95 The static yield stress values measured at 70 To investigate the possible impact of mass transfer on Ni and Co leaching kinetics, further leaching tests were conducted at varying agitation rates of 600 and 1000 To determine the controlling mechanism for the acid leaching of the SG ore, the experimental data obtained from leaching were fitted to the shrinking core (SC) models (Eqs. As none of the models were good fit to the entire experimental data (0–240  By fitting the apparent rate constants obtained from the data in To confirm model adequacy, the predicted Ni, Co, Fe and Mg% extractions were plotted against the experimental data ( Overall, the mechanism for leaching the −2.0 The results provide insight on the influence of time (4 Temperature increase from 70 to 95 Fine grinding of −2 The slurries shear yield stresses and viscosities increased with time, reminiscent of pulp gelation and were more enhanced in the −0.2 Regardless of feed particle size (−2 and −0.2 For complex, low-grade siliceous goethitic ores, grinding to −2.0 The financial support of
