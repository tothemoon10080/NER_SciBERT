The present research investigates the use of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate as a compound lixiviant, and ammonium acetate as an inhibitor for aluminum in the recovery of rare earth elements from ion-adsorption rare earth ores. It is previously shown that rare earth ions, adsorbed physically on ion-adsorption rare earth ores, could be easily recovered via an ion exchange mechanism with inorganic monovalent salt solutions. A standardized desorption procedure was established to systematically investigate the effects of elution conditions such as compound lixiviant concentration, ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio, particle size, elution flow rate, pH and inhibitor concentration on the leaching of rare earth and aluminum. It was determined that the leaching rate of rare earth exceeded 80% under the optimum elution conditions: particle size <74μm, compound lixiviant concentration 2.0%, ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio 4:1, pH 5.5, ammonium acetate concentration 0.05%, elution flow-rate 0.5ml/min and room temperature. At these conditions, the inhibition rate of aluminum exceeded 80%.Rare earth products as a special functional materials, can greatly improve the quality and properties of other products, and it is known as “The vitamin of modern industry”, so the ongoing development of new, advanced technologies generate an increased demand for rare earth elements (REEs) in the international market, and the average annual rate of increase in rare earth production is about 10% At present, because the main commercially significant REE-rich sources, containing up to 70% rare earth oxides, such as carbonate-based bastnasite and phosphate-based monazite become limited, to insure an adequate supply for present and future use, the research focus shifted on the ion-adsorption rare earth ores as an alternative source For ion-adsorption rare earth ores (i.e. alumino-silicate minerals), isomorphous substitution of one cation with another of similar size but with lesser charge (e.g. Al The physisorbed REEs are easily and selectivity desorbed and substituted on the substrate by the monovalent ions followed by transfer into solution. The chemical reactions can be described as follows. Because of the above theory, extensive research has been reported on the desorption of REE on alumino-silicate minerals using single ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium chloride In order to obtain better rare earth leaching effect and purer product, a compound lixiviant of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate is used with an inhibitor for aluminum. Experimental work was conducted, with the aim of investigating the influence of ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate (AN/AS) ratio, lixiviant concentration, inhibitor concentration, flow rate of lixiviant solution, and pH on REE extraction and aluminum inhibition. The ion-adsorption rare earth ore sample used in this research was collected from Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, China. The main chemical composition of the sample was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). The results are shown in The partitioning of the sample was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and the results are listed in The existing state of rare earth in ore sample was determined with the sequential fractionating extraction method in a leaching column The sample was sieved using standard sieves, giving different particle size fractions for the experiments. Aluminum sulfate and aluminum nitrate are obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. Unless otherwise stated, all chemical reagents used in the experiments and analysis were analytically pure and were used without further purification. The de-ionized water was used during the experiments. The tests were carried out in a glass column, which was fixed vertically on an iron support, as seen in The total rare earth content of the ore sample and the rare earth content of mineral phase were determined by arsenazo (III) spectrophotometry by acidifying and purifying the ore sample after being fused with sodium peroxide and sodium hydroxide at 900 The rare earth content in leach liquor was determined by EDTA volumetric titration method using hexamethylenetetramine as buffer and xylenol-orange as indicator The rare earth content of ion-exchangeable phase was determined by the sequential extraction method: 500 The rare earth content of colloidal sediment phase was determined as follows: 500 In order to investigate the effect of particle size on the elution process, the ore sample was sieved into five different particle size fractions (>246 Previous work The generated In order to examine the effect of ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio on the elution process, several tests were conducted at different ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio with 2.0% lixiviant concentration at 0.5  Considering that the total content of rare earth is about 1 In order for the ion exchange process between assorted RE Shi In order to investigate the influence of pH on the leaching of rare earth and aluminum, the elution experiments were conducted at different pH at 0.5 Aluminum ion is the main impurity in the lixivium, and the content of aluminum is an important standard to test the quality of rare earth products, demanding RE According to soil aluminum sequential extraction method According to Wang’s work In order to inhibit the leaching of aluminum, the exchangeable aluminum, which was desorbed into the lixivium, needed to be hydrolyzed to precipitation and remained in rare earth ores. Therefore, pH is a critical factor in inhibiting the leaching of aluminum, without influencing the leaching of rare earth. Bradbury and Baeyens In order to investigate the effect of ammonium acetate concentration on the leaching of rare earth and the inhibiting of aluminum, several tests were conducted at with 2.0% compound lixiviant concentration (ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio 4:1) at 0.5 The issue of optimum liquid-to-solid was not addressed in this work; it was decided to select The present research investigated the influence of experimental conditions such as compound lixiviant concentration, ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio, particle size, elution flow rate, pH and inhibitor concentration on the elution process of ion-adsorption rare earth ores. It was concluded that the leaching rate of rare earth exceeded 80% with 2.0% compound lixiviant concentration (ammonium nitrate/ammonium sulfate molar ratio 4:1) and 0.05% ammonium acetate concentration at 0.5 Enhanced leaching conditions did not improve the leaching of rare earth, because the un-leached rare earth exist in the forms of colloid sediment phase and mineral phase and could be liberated via more aggressive and non-selective acid or alkaline leach. It was indicated that increased ammonium acetate concentration did inhibit the leaching of aluminum, because the exchangeable aluminum could be transformed into inorganic hydroxyl-aluminum, and simultaneously inorganic hydroxyl-aluminum also could be transformed into exchangeable aluminum. This transformation became balanced at 0.05% ammonium acetate concentration. This work was financially supported by
