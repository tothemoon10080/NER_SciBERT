Microalgae are a promising source of third generation renewable fuels. However, the biofuel production process from microalgae growth through to fuel production is still generally regarded as not economically viable. One area of particular consideration, for requiring more cost effective methods, is the recovery or harvesting stage. Among the several harvesting methods that have been proposed and used, flotation is emerging as one of significant promise. This review highlights why flotation can offer better harvesting characteristics than other methods by looking at work that has been carried out to date, as well as discussing the need for further developments in key areas.Currently initiatives are being taken in many areas to move from fossil fuel to a biodiesel-based economy Microalgae are efficient at converting solar energy into triglycerides suitable of transesterification into biodiesel Extensive research has been done on different microalgae species with regards to productivity and lipid production A reliable and cost effective method of bulk harvesting has not been developed. Difficulties arise arises from harvesting being affected by microalgal strain selection and their growth characteristics As the microalgae harvesting stage is of significant technical and economic importance, this review briefly highlights current methods and their limitations, which have led to flotation recently emerging as a promising alternative. This promise is based on good scale-up potential due to technical and economic parameters, such as lower energy and maintenance costs. In this review, results and trends from microalgae and other bioseparations utilizing flotation are discussed. Harvesting requires microalgae to be separated from the growth medium and then concentrated Algae require light to undergo photosynthesis and produce biomass, however as cultures become dense mutual shading occurs and limits productivity at approximately 0.5 There are currently no universal techniques for harvesting Despite research into different methods, current bulk harvesting remains energy extensive and expensive Based on the difficulties of microalgae harvesting, there have been several methods developed and each method has advantages and limitations Centrifugation is well characterized and is commonly used at the laboratory scale production stage. An advantage of centrifugation is that it avoids the addition of chemicals, which can contaminate the biomass and limit further production. However, due the energy requirement to spin the cells out of suspension, the operation is costly In certain systems, sedimentation can avoid chemical addition. However with microalgae, due to their small size and negative surface charge, the processing time is too long to make it a feasible for harvesting option Due to the requirement for frequent harvesting, flotation is preferred for higher overflow rates as microalgae cells move upward rather than downward Currently no universal technique exists, but flotation has shown particular promise. To support its development, technology from other industries can act as a framework and provide potential solutions With separation by flotation, small bubbles attach to destabilized particles and cause them to rise to the surface and concentrate. Combined with the use of a flocculant to destabilize the cells, flotation has emerged as a major harvesting option for microalgae Flotation can be viewed as inverted sedimentation While extensively used in the treatment of water ( Microalgae are hydrophilic and have a negative surface charge The addition of a coagulant causes the formation of flocs The electrostatic interaction between the microalgae and the coagulant is crucial A potential disadvantage arising from the use of common coagulants is when the chemicals, such as metal ions, become part of the recovered biomass and affect potential end uses Inorganic metal salts, in particular aluminum and ferric sulfate or chloride are commonly used as coagulants The obtained separation is dependent on the concentration of coagulant used. In one microalgae separation report, the highest concentration tested (150 Aluminum (particularly alum) is used for microalgae flotation more commonly than ferric salts as it generally forms more stable flocs and has a higher percentage recovery The major drawback for aluminum or ferric salts is that residual chemicals could pose environmental or health problems pH induced flocculation can be caused by precipitation of substances from the medium (autoflocculation) and/or by changing the surface physiology of the microalgae (bioflocculation) The pH threshold to induce autoflocculation is species specific Polymers (typically PolyDADMACs) can act as coagulants through a number of different mechanisms. The most common being long chain polymers acting as particle connectors and sweeping collectors Whilst polymers are generally more expensive than metal ions, issues of contamination and influences on downstream production and end uses are largely avoided. It has been shown that polymer treatment did not affect lipid levels or the lipid extraction process Chitosan is an abundant naturally sourced organic compound with a high cationic charge density and long polymer chains, which allow for charge neutralization and bridging The high charge density of chitosan allows for strong adsorption to negative microalgae cells and results in destabilization through neutralization The range of culture conditions that can be treated is also expanded, as organic coagulants are less sensitive to pH changes than metal salts Chitosan has been shown to coagulate microalgae cells effectively, and to produce larger flocs than Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl). The PACl flocculation also interfered with biodiesel conversion due to diffusion resistance in the flocs, a problem that was not evident in chitosan-treated cells Additional limitations of chitosan include that as it is not water-soluble, it requires a weak acid treatment to be dissolved Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) can be used as an microalgae coagulant and allows for simultaneous harvesting and cell membrane disruption There are significant advantages from using CTAB, including that it also does not contaminate the resulting biomass with any salts. In addition, CTAB increases the total lipid by solubilizing the phospholipids from the cell membrane. While these lipids are of little interest for biofuel production, potential markets exist for certain phosopholipids Traditionally flotation is done either by air addition through a diffuser (dispersed air flotation) or through pressurization (dissolved air flotation) In dispersed air flotation (DiAF) air is introduced to the system through either a mechanical agitator or air injection through a porous medium If smaller bubbles are required, the usual method of reducing their size is through addition of surfactants Dispersed air flotation does have significant advantages from an economic and operational standpoint. The operation has lower energy requirements, few mechanical parts and can easily be scaled up In dissolved air flotation (DAF) a portion of the water that has been through separation is recycled and pressurized The bubbles produced are in the range of 10–100 An additional advantage to DAF is that air which is not converted to bubbles in the inlet will nucleate into small bubbles at the surface of the algal cells. This allows for flotation of these hydrophilic particles However, in comparison to DiAF, DAF is relatively expensive due to the compression stage, which requires around 7.6 Electro coagulation flotation (ECF) is a four stage process in which: (i) a reactive anode dissolves creating coagulants, (ii) these coagulants interact with the microalgae to destabilize the suspension, (iii) the destabilized particles form flocs and (iv) gas bubbles formed at the electrodes adhere to the flocs and cause them to float The coagulants are formed through the dissolution of either iron or aluminum electrodes, which produce Al The amount of the flocculants dissolved at any time is correlated with current density Advantageously ECF does not introduce sulfate or chloride anions usually attached to metal salts added as coagulating agents. Additionally, ECF produces high efficiency coagulants and performs over a large pH range (4–10, with lower pH being beneficial) Whilst the energy required for freshwater microalgae harvesting is relatively low, the high conductivity of seawater makes ECF impractical Microflotation uses DiAF in combination with fluidic oscillation to produce microbubble clouds that have been shown to efficiently remove colloidal particles With the goal of removing the coagulation stage from DAF, PosiDAF is a bubble modification technique in which chemicals are added to the saturator. As the bubbles form due to the pressure decrease, they are coated with these chemicals Polymers can be used in the PosiDAF operation to protrude from bubbles and increase capture efficiency The use of polyDADMAC in PosiDAF was found to give similar removal efficiencies to DAF, but did not require pH modification or a coagulation stage In a control test using DiAF oxygen aeration, flotation harvesting did not occur, but through the use of ozone, separation was achieved The generation of bubbles accounts for a significant fraction of the cost of DAF and ballasted flotation was introduced to avoid this cost This method has been also examined in combination with DAF (known as BDAF) rather than as a replacement. This approach was able to capture up to 96% of To improve microalgae collection efficiency, microbubbles can be generated in a number of different ways. These methods include using a spinning disk to pull atmospheric air down a shaft and into the liquid in a process known as cavitation air flotation Another potential harvesting method is induced air flotation (IAF), which has been used to remove oil droplets from water. It works through inducing air with an impeller-based system, which avoids the need for blowers or compressors. While IAF produces larger bubbles than DAF, it requires a smaller footprint and allows for the ability to add far more air than the 5.6 Whilst there are modifications that aim to avoid the use of DAF, some methods have been developed to improve DAF efficiency. These include a gas aspiration nozzle to draw air into the recycled water Research has been also carried out to explore modifications to the process that aim to avoid other problems associated with harvesting, albeit they are unlikely to improve the economics. For example, flotation can be done under a vacuum to harvest dilute cultures without harming the microalgae cells. This approach creates a large interface between liquid and gas phases The type of flotation and coagulant used largely determines the effectiveness of flotation recovery ( Important considerations for the operation of a flotation system for the recovery of microalgae include hydraulic loading rate, initial algal concentration, air to solids ratio, coagulant type, coagulant dosage, pH, salinity and the type of flotation The height of a flotation column and the residence time of the microalgae in the foam have been shown to have significant impact on the concentration factor The effects of some variables are inconclusive. For example, changes in airflow rate has been said to not affect the recovery of microalgae The pH of the solution can have a significant effect on the coagulation of microalgae due to interfacial properties and reaction mechanisms Changing the pH between 5–8 is seen to have little effect on separation Other flotation operations have been shown to be most effective at different pH ranges. CTAB coagulation was found to be the most effective at pH 7.8, while separation efficiency using anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was poor until the pH was depressed to 3.5 The influence of pH can be significant enough that pH alone can be used for the coagulation of cells. If the pH was depressed to nearly 2 (from a culture of pH 7.5 to 8) 88% of microalgae could be recovered in 18 Rather than a condition that is changed for harvesting, salinity is determined by the nature of the microalgae cultivated. It has, however, been shown to have a significant impact on flotation. For example, with DiAF, the bubble size is heavily dependent on salinity. The higher the salinity, the smaller the resulting bubbles which lead to a higher recovery and concentration factor Salinity is also significant with regards to ECF, although the literature is contradictory on its impact. ECF has been reported to require relatively little energy for processing freshwater microalgae, but due to the high conductivity of seawater, its use with marine microalgae is impractical Bubbles without any modifications exert a negative surface charge Each flotation method produces different bubble sizes and this has significant implications on separation effectiveness. Smaller bubbles have a higher surface area to volume ratio, which leads to higher probabilities of collision and attachment, a lower detachment probability, lower ascending rate and higher free surface energy The optimal bubble size has been reported as approximately 50 Microalgae strain selection has a significant effect on the harvesting stage Microalgae cell size Hydrophobicity is a major factor for all microalgae The growth phase of microalgae also appears to have an effect on the harvesting efficiency. Microalgae have been shown to be more efficiently concentrated when harvested in the exponential phase compared to the stationary phase Dissolved organic matter (DOM) or extracellular algogenic organic matter (AOM) excreted during algal growth are thought to be a potential link between growth phase, coagulant demand and harvesting efficiency Zeta potential is the measure of the electric potential at the plane of shear of the electric double layer and represents the best measure of microalgae surface charge As the zeta potential approaches the point of zero charge, coagulation is generally improved In combination with pH, coagulants cause an increase in surface charge Whilst microalgae such as Whilst the choice of harvesting method is an important economic consideration The most economic method of microalgae harvesting by flotation appears to be DiAF The operation itself can have significant effects on the cost of coagulants. For example, when using chitosan, it was shown that chemical cost increased from 18 to 191 The use of flotation for the recovery of microalgae is a promising technique that can achieve good recovery and concentration. Several flotation techniques have been researched, along with different methods to destabilize microalgae cultures to encourage them to flocculate. However, whilst flotation recovery shows potential, most work to date is still at the laboratory scale. At the operational level, however, there is significant research that can be done to make the separation process more efficient and economically feasible. Foremost is obtaining a better understanding how different microalgae and their medium affect flotation and recovery Work is required to help address the need for development of cost-effective full-scale process designs The authors declare no conflict of interest.
