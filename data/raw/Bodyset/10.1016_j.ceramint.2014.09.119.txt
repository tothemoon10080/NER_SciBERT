A novel cubic-shaped nanocrystalline ZnWO4 photocatalyst has been successfully synthesized at 250°C in a very short time by a microwave -assisted precipitation technique using Na2WO4·2H2O and ZnCl2 as raw materials. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results indicated that obtained powder exhibited only wolframite structure with a cubic morphology. The direct optical band gap was estimated to be 3.74eV by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS). The photocatalytic activity was investigated by the decomposition of aqueous Rhodamine B (RhB) under UV light irradiation. Cubic-shaped nanocrystalline ZnWO4 showed high photocatalytic activity and the degradation efficiency was 69% after 75min.AWO So far, ZnWO To the best of our knowledge, not only cubic zinc tungstate is not yet reported, but also relevant reports on ZnWO In this study, ZnCl  FTIR spectrum shown in The morphology of ZnWO  Photocatalytic activity of the sample evaluated by probing the variations in maximal absorption of UV–vis spectra at 554 In the present experiment, a novel cubic-shaped nanocrystalline ZnWO
