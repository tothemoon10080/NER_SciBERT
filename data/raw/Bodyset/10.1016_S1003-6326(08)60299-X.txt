A new approach to prepare PbSO4 powder is studied. Using the methods of the leaching of galena concentrates in the ferric chloride media, selective purification and chemical sedimentation, PbS concentrate can be converted into PbSO4. The conversion recovery is 97.39%, the purity of PbSO4 powder is above 99% and its average crystallite size is about 42 nm. In this process, emission of lead vapour and SO2 cannot occur. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of realizing a green route to prepare the lead sulfate powder.
