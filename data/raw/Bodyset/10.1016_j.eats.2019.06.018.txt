Tibial eminence fractures most commonly occur in young children and adolescents with open physes. Displaced fractures are typically treated with surgical reduction and fixation. Multiple arthroscopic techniques and fixation constructs have been described. However, many of these techniques violate the physis with a risk of growth disturbance and deformity from asymmetrical physeal growth. This technical note details a surgical technique of arthroscopically assisted suture fixation of a comminuted tibial spine fracture using all-epiphyseal bone tunnels and knotless anchors. In this construct, sutures passing through the substance of the anterior cruciate ligament help to eliminate residual laxity, all-epiphyseal bone tunnels avoid growth disturbance, and suture anchors reduce persistently displaced anterior comminution.A fracture of the tibial eminence, also called the “tibial spine” or “intercondylar eminence,” is a bony avulsion of the tibial attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The classic clinical scenario is a child aged 8 to 14 years presenting with a knee effusion after a hyperextension or valgus and external rotation injury after falling off a bicycle. Meyers and McKeever This technical note details a surgical technique of arthroscopically assisted suture fixation of a comminuted tibial spine fracture using a hybrid of all-epiphyseal bone tunnels and knotless anchors. In this construct, sutures passing through the substance of the ACL help to eliminate residual laxity, all-epiphyseal bone tunnels avoid growth disturbance, and suture anchors reduce persistently displaced anterior comminution. This technique can be performed safely in pediatric patients with any fracture pattern. A demonstration of the technique in a right knee is provided in After a general anesthetic is given, the patient receives a single-shot sciatic nerve block and adductor canal nerve block with an indwelling catheter. The patient is positioned supine, and an examination under anesthesia is performed to assess knee stability and range of motion (ROM) of the operative and contralateral limbs. A single dose of antibiotic is administered for infection prophylaxis. A nonsterile tourniquet is placed high on the thigh and set at 200 to 225 mm Hg. The surgical limb is secured in an arthroscopic leg holder with the contralateral leg in a foam well-leg holder. The surgical area is prepared and draped in standard fashion. An Esmarch bandage is used to exsanguinate the extremity, and the tourniquet is inflated. Standard inferolateral and inferomedial arthroscopic portals are made; the fracture hematoma is evacuated, and the knee is thoroughly irrigated for optimal visualization. Routine diagnostic arthroscopy is performed, and intra-articular findings are noted. Particular attention is directed to characterizing the fracture pattern, assessing for hemorrhage or intrasubstance injury of the ACL, and identifying entrapment of the meniscus in the fracture site ( The knee is allowed to hang freely in flexion. Fracture fragments are elevated, and the fracture bed is debrided using an arthroscopic shaver and curettes ( Anterior fracture comminution is commonly still displaced despite reduction and fixation of the main fragment ( The knee is examined to ensure the Lachman and pivot-shift tests yield negative findings. The knee should easily be brought from full extension to full passive flexion. The arthroscope is then carefully placed back into the joint to inspect the fracture ( The wounds are irrigated copiously, and the knee is cleared of any loose debris. The subcutaneous layer and skin are closed in standard fashion. Sterile dressings are applied, and the leg is placed in a hinged knee brace locked in full extension. Formal postoperative rehabilitation is initiated 3 to 4 days after surgery and consists of distinct phases. Toe-touch weight bearing with crutches as tolerated is allowed immediately postoperatively in a hinged brace locked in full extension for 4 weeks. During this first phase, the patient works on quadriceps control, gait coordination with crutches, and passive ROM with a goal of 0° to 45° of knee flexion by week 2 and active ROM of 0° to 90° with the ability to perform a straight leg raise by week 4. The next phase focuses on progressive strengthening and neuromuscular control. Weight bearing is progressed, the brace is unlocked, and crutches are discontinued over a 2-week period. Bracing is discontinued after 6 weeks when healing is noted on plain radiographs. The final phase of rehabilitation starts 3 months postoperatively and focuses on advanced sport-specific training. Patients must have full ROM, quadriceps strength measuring at least 75% of that of the unaffected limb, and no pain or effusion to start this phase. Exercises include agility drills, plyometrics, and sport-specific drills with increasing intensity. At 6 months postoperatively, patients undergo functional testing to determine sport and activity readiness. Clearance for returning to sports is patient specific but typically occurs 6 to 9 months postoperatively. Multiple techniques have been described for surgical treatment of tibial eminence fractures with various implants including screws, sutures, staples, and anchors, as well as combinations thereof. Clinical ACL laxity after tibial eminence fracture occurs in an average of 70% of fractures treated nonoperatively and 14% treated operatively. Growth disturbance after fixation of a tibial eminence fracture is extremely uncommon but has been reported. This technical note details a surgical technique of arthroscopically assisted suture fixation of a comminuted tibial spine fracture using a hybrid of all-epiphyseal bone tunnels and knotless anchors. This strong construct allows early motion to avoid arthrofibrosis, high-strength sutures passing through the substance of the ACL help to eliminate residual laxity, all-epiphyseal bone tunnels avoid growth disturbance, and suture anchors reduce persistently displaced anterior comminution. This technique can be performed safely in pediatric patients with any fracture pattern.
