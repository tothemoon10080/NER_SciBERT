We report a case of malunion of the distal radius after a Collesâ€™ fracture treated with osteotomy using a volar approach combined with calcium phosphate bone cement grafting of the dorsal defect via a drill hole from the volar cortex 6 weeks after the injury. One year and 4 months after surgery range of motion and grip strength were improved and x-rays of the wrist showed complete union of the distal radius with progressive absorption of the calcium phosphate bone cement.
