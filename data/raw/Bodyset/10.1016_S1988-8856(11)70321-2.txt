Objective
                  To demonstrate, through a clinical case, that fractures of the hamate bone are very infrequent and even more so those that affect its body without there being fractures of the other associated carpal bones. Due to its infrequency and to the nonspecificity of its clinical manifestations, they are usually difficult to diagnose.
               
                  Material and methods
                  We present a case of a 24 year old male who suffered an isolated comminuted fracture of the body of the hamate bone. It was treated conservatively and full recovery without any functional deficit was obtained.
               
                  Conclusions
                  It is important to consider this type of fracture when confronted with a direct traumatism to the hand. Performing computed tomography (CT) is recommended in order to correctly identify the fracture and assess any possible associated lesions. The therapeutic decision depends on the degree of comminution of the fracture, its stability and any joint involvement.
