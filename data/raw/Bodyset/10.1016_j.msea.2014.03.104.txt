The evolution of microstructure during hot rolling and inter-stage annealing of a partially homogenized AZ91 magnesium alloy was investigated by microscopic examination and micro-texture analyzing. The effects of key processing parameters including rolling temperature, rolling speed, number of rolling passes and inter-stage annealing treatment on the deformation mechanism and recrystallization behavior of the experimental alloy were studied. At lower rolling temperature, the plastic strain applied during rolling was accommodated by the formation of twin and shear bands whereas at higher temperatures non-basal slip systems were activated resulting in the suppression of twinning and, hence, slip became the dominant deformation mechanism in such rolling conditions. The process facilitated an effective grain refinement by both dynamic and static recrystallization phenomena with an increase in the number of rolling passes and conducting inter-pass annealing stages leading to a reduction of average grain size to below 10μm. Moreover, optical microscopic examinations for all the rolling conditions demonstrated that twin DRX was the major dynamic recrystallization mechanism at the beginning of the rolling process due to the large initial grain size. However, new grains were found to nucleate preferably at grain boundaries as the average grain size decreased during the hot rolling process. Micro-texture analysis for all the processing conditions showed a relatively strong basal texture produced after the first pass of rolling, which was then weakened during the subsequent annealing and rolling stages.The global need for vehicle weight reduction and its result in lowering fuel consumption of vehicles has stimulated a great number of investigations on magnesium alloys as an important class of low density engineering materials. Magnesium alloys with a very low density (1.74 During the past few years, hot deformation processes such as hot rolling Dynamic recrystallization in magnesium and magnesium alloys is believed to occur with several mechanisms Several hot working processes such as differential speed hot rolling In order to achieve desirable combinations of strength and ductility in magnesium alloys by controlling the microstructure through thermomechanical processing, the effect of each processing parameter on the microstructure and corresponding texture should be identified precisely. The present work aims to investigate the effect of processing parameters, i.e., rolling temperature, rolling speed, number of rolling passes, and inter-stage annealing treatment, on the microstructure and crystallographic texture of partially homogenized AZ91 magnesium alloy. AZ91 magnesium alloy as the starting material in this investigation was received in as-cast condition with the chemical composition given in In order to partially dissolve β particles into the α-phase matrix, the as-cast alloy was homogenized in a multi-stage homogenization treatment including heating at 370 To investigate the effect of rolling speed (strain rate) on the microstructure of AZ91 magnesium alloy, a similar rolling process was carried out at 370 After each stage of rolling, the rolled specimen was sectioned from a location one centimeter away from one of its two ends parallel to the ND (normal to rolling direction) and through the width. The sectioned specimen was then cut half in perpendicular to the rolling plane (  The microstructures and (0002) pole figures of the specimens with around 10% reduction in thickness during the first pass of rolling at the temperatures of 330, 370 and 410 As can be seen in An important experimental evidence illustrated in According to the results of quantitative image analysis of the microstructures in different deformation conditions (using 6 different pictures for each condition), the volume fraction of dynamically recrystallized grains has increased with an increase in the rolling temperature. Although there has been no measureable amount of dynamically recrystallized grains in the specimen at the deformation temperature of 330 The dynamically recrystallized grain size of the specimens increased from 3 to around 7 It is interesting to note that a greater fraction of new recrystallized grains is formed during the hot rolling process at the temperature of 370 Considering the (0002) pole figures of specimens after being rolled in the first pass with deformation conditions indicated in  The microstructure of the specimen after being rolled at the temperature of 410 In addition, the (0002) pole figure of this specimen (  As can be seen in In addition, one can see in a higher magnification ( Inter-stage annealing of the specimen rolled at the temperature of 330 In the microstructure of the specimen rolled at 370 An important feature of the microstructure shown in  The fifth pass of rolling at 370 Final microstructures of the investigated AZ91 magnesium alloy after five passes of hot rolling and the last stage of annealing are shown in The situation is different for the case of the specimen rolled at higher temperature (410 The microstructure of the specimen rolled and annealed at the temperature of 370  In In addition, the rolling speed has had a decreeing effect on the average grain size of the investigated material after all five passes of hot rolling and subsequent annealing processes at the temperature of 370 Although the curves representing the variation of the average grain size as a function of the number of rolling passes and annealing stages for the rolling/annealing temperature of 370 On the other hand, the reduction of the average grain size of the material during the rolling/annealing treatments at 370 The microstructural evolution of partially homogenized AZ91 magnesium alloy during hot rolling and inter-stage annealing treatment was studied through microscopic examination as well as micro-texture analysis. The effects of hot rolling–annealing parameters on the deformation mechanism and recrystallization behavior of AZ91 alloy were investigated. Rolling temperature showed the most significant effect on the deformation mechanism and recrystallization behavior of the investigated material. At the lower rolling temperature (330 It was shown that an increase in rolling speed facilitates the formation of twin bands and nucleation of dynamically recrystallized grains at twin bands during the early stages of rolling. In addition, a smaller grain size was achieved after the fifth pass of rolling with a higher rolls speed followed by the last stage of annealing, due to relatively higher internal energy stored in the material when rolling was conducted with a greater strain rate. For such a rolling condition, the average grain size was measured to be 3.4 For all the rolling conditions used in this investigation, the grain size of partially homogenized AZ91 magnesium alloy decreased steadily with increasing the number of rolling passes by the predominant mechanism of dynamic recrystallization. As the most important experimental result of the present study, the grain size decreased to 18.8, 7.4, and 3.4 Annealing treatment at the rolling temperature immediately after each pass of rolling caused grain refinement of the microstructure by static recrystallization mechanism, and this resulted in a weakening of (0002) pole figure. However, grain growth was observed after each inter-stage annealing treatment at the rolling temperature of 410
