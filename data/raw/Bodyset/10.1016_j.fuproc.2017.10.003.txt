This manuscript analyzes the steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) over a Ni/La2O3-αAl2O3 catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor under a wide range of operating conditions (500–650°C, space time up to 0.35gcatalysth/gEtOH, and steam/ethanol (S/E) molar ratio in the feed between 3 and 9) in order to select optimum conditions for maximizing H2 production. The significance the individual reactions in the reaction mechanism have on products distribution and the role of the catalyst in the extent of these reactions has also been analyzed. Blank runs (without catalyst) have been performed to test the contribution of thermal routes to this mechanism. Ethylene and acetaldehyde are intermediate products in the kinetic scheme, whose presence is only observed when ethanol conversion is not full. The increase in temperature enhances the reforming and decomposition of ethanol and acetaldehyde and, when the catalyst is used, CH4 reforming and reverse WGS reactions are also promoted, so that the yield of H2 and CO increases, that of CH4 decreases and the one of CO2 remains almost constant with temperature. The increase in S/E molar ratio increases H2 yield, but attenuates the rate of some reactions involved in the process. 600°C, a space time of 0.35gcatalysth/gEtOH and S/E=6 are suitable conditions for maximizing ethanol conversion (100%) and H2 yield (82%) with high catalyst stability.The foreseen 30% growth in worldwide energy demand for 2040, together with the increasing social awareness concerning the negative consequences of the use of fossil fuels, have boosted the development of technologies for maximizing energy production from renewable sources, so that 37% of power generation will be from renewable resources in 2040, compared to 23% today Among biomass derived oxygenates, bio-ethanol has great interest as raw material for producing H The steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) is an endothermic process that proceeds at relatively low temperatures (between 300 and 800 The use of steam/ethanol (S/E) molar ratio in the feed above the stoichiometric value (S/E Other reactions take also place, but they are not relevant for products distribution, although they contribute to catalyst deactivation by formation or elimination (by gasification) of coke (C): Due to the complexity of the reaction scheme, the yield and selectivity of H Furthermore, it is well established that an increase in metal content in Ni based catalysts improves ethanol conversion, but does not guarantee a higher H γ-Al In view of this background, this work analyzes the effect operating conditions (temperature, S/E molar ratio and space time) have on the behavior of an equilibrated Ni/La The catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were conducted on an AutoChem II 2920 Micromeritics. The TPR profile of this catalyst showed three reduction peaks The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern measured on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with a CuKα1 radiation showed diffraction lines corresponding to the reflection of Al The runs were carried out in automated reaction equipment (Microactivity reference-PID Eng & Tech) provided with an isothermal fluidized bed reactor (22 The use of a fluidized bed is interesting in order to guarantee the isothermicity of the bed and also to attenuate deactivation by coke deposition The conditions of the catalytic runs are as follows: temperature between 500 and 650 Blank runs (without catalyst) have been performed in order to delimit the temperature from which there is a noticeable contribution of thermal routes to the reaction mechanism. These runs have been carried out with inert solid (CSi) in the fluidized bed, in the 500–700 The kinetic behavior has been quantified by considering the following reaction indices: Conversion of ethanol (X), which is calculated from its molar flow rate (F) at the inlet and outlet (unreacted ethanol) of the catalytic reactor: The yield of each product (Y The selectivity of each gaseous product (S  It is observed that at 500 The increase in temperature up to 600 Furthermore, an increase in S/E molar ratio has lower effect than temperature on these results. In general, all the thermal routes are promoted by increasing S/E molar ratio from 3 to 6, although a further increase in this variable has no significant effect. There are scarce papers in the literature reporting results without catalyst in order to analyze the thermal routes for ethanol conversion under steam reforming conditions. The aforementioned results are consistent with those by Fatsikostas and Verykios Based on these results, and although the higher reaction rate of the catalyzed steps minimize the contribution of the thermal routes, the 500–650 This section analyzes the effect operating conditions (temperature, space time and S/E molar ratio) have on the reaction indices at zero time on stream, which have been obtained by extrapolating the results obtained in runs of 20 The effect that temperature has on the reaction indices is shown in Under kinetic regime (space time of 0.04 Concerning the H This evolution of H For a high space time value (0.35 As previously mentioned, the properties of the support have an important role in products distribution. Thus, Melchor-Hernández et al. (2013) obtained a maximum ethylene yield of ~  Ethanol conversion increases in a pronounced way with space time ( Similarly to those observed in Similar trends in the effect of space time in ethanol conversion and products yields have been observed in the literature for other Ni based catalysts, although the range of space time depends on catalyst composition and on the remaining reaction conditions. Thus, Llera et al. The effect of this variable has been studied in less detail than that of temperature in the literature. Most of the research has been carried out with S/E molar ratio  Similar trends in carbon products selectivity by changing S/E ratio have been also observed by Carrera-Cerritos et al. The selectivities of acetaldehyde and ethylene have not been plotted in In order to complement the previous results, corresponding to total ethanol conversion, the effect of S/E molar ratio on ethanol conversion and H Nevertheless, Taking into account the above mentioned results concerning the effect of operating conditions on products distribution obtained on a Ni/La In order to test the stability of the catalyst, long duration runs (200 The evolutions of ethanol conversion and products yield under these conditions are plotted in The effect operating conditions have on products distribution in the SRE over Ni/La The thermal routes contribute significantly to the extent of some reactions, and therefore to products distribution, i.e., below 600 In the catalytic steam reforming over Ni/La In order to maximize H This work has been carried out with financial support from the  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
