High pressure roll grinding (HPRG) and ball milling were compared to investigate the influence of mechanical activation on the acid leaching dephosphorization of a high-phosphorus iron ore concentrate, which was manufactured through magnetizing roasting-magnetic separation of high-phosphorus oolitic iron ores. The results indicated that when high-phosphorus iron ore concentrates containing 54.92 mass % iron and 0.76 mass % phosphorus were directly processed through acid leaching, iron ore concentrates containing 55.74 mass% iron and 0.33 mass % phosphorus with an iron recovery of 84.64 % and dephosphorization of 63.79 % were obtained. When high-phosphorus iron ore concentrates activated by ball milling were processed by acid leaching, iron ore concentrates containing 56.03 mass % iron and 0.21 mass% phosphorus with an iron recovery of 85.65% and dephosphorization of 77.49 % were obtained. Meanwhile, when high-phosphorus iron ore concentrates activated by HPRG were processed by acid leaching, iron ore concentrates containing 58.02 mass% iron and 0.10 mass% phosphorus were obtained, with the iron recovery reaching 88.42% and the dephosphorization rate reaching 88.99%. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ball milling can reduce the particle size, demonstrating a prominent reunion phenomenon. In contrast, HPRG pretreatment contributes to the formation of more cracks within the particles and selective dissociation of iron and P bearing minerals, which can provide the favorable kinetic conditions to accelerate the solid-liquid reaction rate. As such, the crystal structure is destroyed and the surface energy of mineral particles is strengthened by mechanical activation, further strengthening the dephosphorization.
