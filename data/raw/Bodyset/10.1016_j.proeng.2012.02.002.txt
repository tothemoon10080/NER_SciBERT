Al powders, manufactured by different powder metallurgical methods, with various sizes have been used to produce Al foams. Different oxide contents in various Al powders play a major role in foam expansion and stability. The airatomised coarse Al powder with a high oxide content of 0.536wt.% shows the largest foam expansion. Of similar particle size, a small foam expansion is found when the centrifugally atomised coarse Al powder with 0.061wt.% oxide is applied. The large foam expansion resulted from a high content of oxide clusters of crumpled films developed during foaming process.
