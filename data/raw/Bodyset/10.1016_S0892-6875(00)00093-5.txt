A large proportion of the gold processed in the 21st century will be recovered from sulfide ores. Since the sulfide minerals are to some extent soluble in cyanide solutions, there will always be some sulfur species present in the leach solution. It has been shown that soluble sulfide hinders the rate of gold leaching, forming a protective layer of the type Au/Sx. Electrochemical studies of the constituent half reactions: gold oxidation; and oxygen reduction, were consistent with this view. The effect of sulfide and cyanide concentrations on the leaching reaction were investigated, and it was shown that the sulfur formed is chemically attacked by cyanide, resulting in higher leach rates at higher cyanide concentrations. The effect of lead was also studied and is discussed in detail.
