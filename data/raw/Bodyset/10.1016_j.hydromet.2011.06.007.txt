The kinetics of cementation of copper from copper sulphate solutions in a stirred tank reactor fitted with a rotating perforated basket of novel geometry packed with zinc Raschig rings were studied. The effect of different parameters such as initial copper sulphate concentration, basket rotational speed, temperature and the effect of presence of some alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and butanol were studied. The rate of cementation was found to increase with increasing initial copper sulphate concentration, basket rotational speed, and temperature, while a decrease in the rate of copper cementation was observed in the presence of alcohols according to the following order: butanol>ethanol>methanol. The thermodynamic activation parameters ∆H≠, ∆G≠ and ∆S≠ were calculated within the range of temperature studied. The activation energy was found to be 6J/molK which confirms the diffusion controlled nature of the reaction. Mass transfer study of the process has revealed that the present data can be correlated by the equation:

A comparison between the present modified stirred tank reactor with the rotating cylinder reactor and the rotating disc reactor has shown that a higher rate of cementation was obtained in the present reactor.Motor Shaft Plexiglass container Liquid level Baffle Rotating packed impeller Zinc Raschig rings The importance of environmental pollution control has increased significantly in recent years. Environmentalists are primarily concerned with the presence of heavy metals in aqueous effluents due to their high toxicity and impact on human and aquatic life. Several techniques have been developed and used to remove and/or recover a wide range of micropollutants from water and a variety of industrial effluents ( The overall reaction for copper cementation on zinc is expressed by the following equation: This reaction takes place through the galvanic cell Zn|Zn Copper may be present in wastewaters from a variety of chemical manufacturing processes employing copper salts or a copper catalyst. Metal-process pickling baths and plating baths are one of the primary sources of copper in industrial wastewater. Removal of heavy metals, especially copper, by cementation has been studied by a number of researches on various cementation agents with different geometries ( The aim of the present work is to study the rate of copper removal from wastewater by using a new reactor of high space-time yield. The reactor was a stirred tank fitted with a rotating perforated basket packed with zinc Raschig rings. Recently All chemical reagents such as CuSO  Before each run, 2.5 For batch reactors the rate of diffusion controlled liquid–solid reaction is expressed by the equation ( Since the interfacial Cu   The high exponent (0.943) reflects a highly turbulent flow ( The ability to promote high turbulence of the geometry suggested here stems from the fact that as the basket rotates with its load of Raschig rings past the solution, a hydrodynamic boundary layer is formed on each ring, whereas at the rear of each ring boundary layer separation takes place with the formation of turbulent eddies. These eddies penetrate the already thin diffusion layer and enhance the rate of mass transfer and the rate of cementation.  The method of dimensional analysis is used to correlate the present data. The mass transfer coefficient can be correlated to different variables by the functional equation: To obtain the value ofβ, log Sh was plotted against log Re at different conditions ( An overall mass transfer correlation was envisaged using the dimensionless groups Sh, Sc and Re. To demonstrate the high efficiency of the present reactor in comparison to both the traditional solid rotating cylinder and the rotating disc usually used in cementation studies, the volumetric mass transfer coefficient (K While the mass transfer coefficient for the rotating disc was calculated from the equation (  To study the effect of addition of alcohols on the rate of cementation three different types of alcohols were used (methanol, ethanol and butanol). Different concentrations of the alcohols were used namely 1, 1.4, 1.7 and 2% by volume. Where k is the mass transfer coefficient in the absence of alcohol and k The low dielectric constant of alcohols leads to a decrease of the activity of copper ions owing to ion pair formation with a consequent decrease in the rate of cementation ( The addition of alcohols affects the diffusivity of ions in the solution by changing the composition of the solvation shell. Copper ions are solvated with water molecules to form [Cu(H To confirm the diffusion controlled nature of the cementation reaction under the present conditions the effect of temperature on the rate of cementation was examined using Arrhenius equation:  To show how the thermodynamic properties are influenced by the presence of alcohols the thermodynamic activation parameters were studied in the temperature range of 293 to 313 The change in the zinc surface area as a consequence of the cementation process and the effect of alcohols were confirmed by a scanning electron microscopic study of the cementation reaction product.
