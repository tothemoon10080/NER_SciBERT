Flotation operations use a wide variety of depressants for sulfide and non-sulfide minerals to achieve both simple and complex separations. These depressants are conveniently grouped into inorganic, small organic and polymeric compounds. The use of polymeric depressants is limited to a few niche applications involving several types of polysaccharides (such as guar, starch and CMC) and, to a lesser extent, other polymers and organic byproducts. Several synthetic polymeric depressants have been developed in the last few years by Cytec Industries to address many of the drawbacks associated with the traditionally used depressants. These synthetic polymeric depressants offer many advantages: better dosage-performance and lower treatment cost, ease of handling, lower toxicity, lower transportation and storage hazards, ease of structural modification to suit different applications and ore variability, and consistency from batch to batch. The chemistry, applications and advantages of synthetic polymeric depressants are discussed in this paper using laboratory and plant performance data.
