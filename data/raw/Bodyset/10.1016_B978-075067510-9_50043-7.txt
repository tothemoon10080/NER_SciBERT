This chapter focuses on the process of solid-liquid separation, which is concerned withmechanical processes for the separation of liquids and finely divided insoluble solids. The selection of equipment for specific solid-liquid separation applications is largely a process of scale-up, based on direct experimentation with the process material. The nature and sizing of equipment depends on the economic values and proportions of the phases as well as certain physical properties that influence relative movements of liquids and particles. Pressure often is the main operating variable, so its effect on physical properties should be known. Clarification is the removal of small amounts of worthless solids from a valuable liquid. Filtration is applied to the recovery of valuable solids from slurries. Expression is the removal of relatively small contents of liquids from compressible sludges by mechanical means. In some kind of equipments, residual liquid can be removed by blowing air or other gas through the cake. When the liquid contains dissolved substances that are undesirable in the filter cake, the slurry may be followed bypure water to displace the residual filtrate.
