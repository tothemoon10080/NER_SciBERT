Gaseous reduction kinetics of the high phosphorus iron ore fines from Hubei in China and effect of microwave pretreatment on the gaseous reduction behavior were studied. Gaseous reduction kinetics were investigated by TG (Thermogravimetric) methods using LINSEIS STA PT 1600 thermal analysis equipment. Microwave pretreatments to the ore fines with four power levels were performed using a high temperature microwave reactor. Its effect was examined by TG methods and its mechanism was analyzed by SEM (scanning electron microscope) and EDS (energy dispersive spectrometer). Gaseous reduction tests were carried out using a tubular furnace. Results of kinetic study indicate that controlling step of the gaseous reduction of the ore fines is a mixing control of gas internal diffusion and interface chemical reaction when reduction fraction is less than 0. 8 and is solid state diffusion when reduction fraction is more than 0.8. Microwave pretreatment of the ore fines could change the pore structure of the oolitic unit to generate cracks, fissures and loose zones, which promotes reduction in the early stage and delays the occurrence of sintering. Gaseous reduction tests show in the condition that the ore fines are pretreated with a microwave power of 450 W for 4 min and reduced under temperature of 1273 K, the gaseous reduction of the ore fines could be apparently intensified. Using CO or H2 as a reductant and ore fines being reduced for 1.5 to 2 h, increase of metallization rate of the ore fines is 10% to 13%.
