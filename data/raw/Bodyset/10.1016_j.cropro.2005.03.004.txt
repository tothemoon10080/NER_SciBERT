Greenhouse and field experiments evaluated the effect of sewage sludge incorporation to the soil against Phytophthora nicotianae in cravo lemon plants. Six sludge doses, ranging from 0 to 30% (v/v), were tested per assay on plants at different developmental stages and with different pathogen inoculum levels. The increase in sewage sludge dose resulted in pH reduction, electric conductivity and soil microbial activity increases (evaluated by FDA hydrolysis and microbial respiration), and reduction in P. nicotianae recovery, both from the soil and from the plant roots. The pathogen recovery was significant and negatively correlated with soil microbial activity and electric conductivity. Better plant development was observed with sludge incorporation up to 20%. These results indicate that the incorporation of sewage sludge can suppress P. nicotianae, by nonchemical management of the pathogen and is a potential means of disposal of this residue.Damping-off, gummosis, and root rot caused by The management of diseases caused by One alternative to the management of soil-borne pathogens is the use of organic matter sources, both incorporated to the soil and as mulches, and also as a vehicle for biological control agents. Organic matter contributes toward a more effective control of pathogens due to an increase in microbial activity and to improved physical and chemical soil properties ( Several studies have been conducted for At present, the sewage sludge generated in sewage treatment stations constitutes one of the organic matter sources available in ever-increasing amounts, and is rich in nutrients for plants. Despite this fact, no information is available concerning its effect on suppressing soil pathogens in citrus. With regard to The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of sewage sludge incorporation to the soil on cravo lemon plants growth at different development stages, soil microbial activity, soil chemistry, and the recovery of The IAC 01/95 The sewage sludge utilized was obtained from the Sewage Treatment Station in Franca, SP. This sludge is from a residential area, with a low heavy metal content ( The commercial substrate (Plantmax The pathogen presence in the substrate and roots was evaluated through the citrus ( Two experiments were conducted; in the first, in addition to the no sludge treatment, a no sludge treatment with weekly foliar applications of nutrients (Ajifol In the first experiment, the soil was treated with sewage sludge at the proportions of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% (v/v). After 1 day, the soils were placed in 4.5 In the second experiment, 4-month-old commercial cravo lemon seedlings were used; sewage sludge was applied at the proportions of 0%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% (v/v), and the soil was infested with 30 In both experiments, evaluations included: fresh matter weight of the above-ground part and roots, pathogen presence in the substrate and roots by means of the citrus leaf bait test, pH, and electric conductivity. The evaluations were performed 150 days after treatment for the first experiment, and after 120 days, for the second experiment. The microbial activity of the substrates containing 15 In the first experiment, leaf samples were collected (100 leaves), 150 days after treatments, for nutritional status determination by means of leaf tissue analysis. The macronutrients results (N, P, and K) were analyzed through the DRIS (Diagnosis and Recomendation Integrated System) indexes described by Three-month-old cravo lemon seedlings, obtained from a commercial nursery, were transplanted to 9 The experimental design was organized as completely randomized blocks, with four replicates. Soil microbial activity was determined by FDA hydrolysis and by CO The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS for Windows statistical package, Version 6.12, by S.A.S. Institute, Cory NC, USA. Significant differences among treatments were observed for fresh matter weight in the above-ground part of plantlets, with positive increases when sewage sludge doses increased ( The percentages of In the first experiment, the pathogen recovery data from roots was negatively correlated with electric conductivity values (  In the first experiment, fresh matter weight for the above-ground part and roots of citrus seedlings was directly proportional to sludge dose increase up to the 20% application ( In the first experiment, pH in water did not show significant differences between treatments ( The substrate electric conductivity values were directly proportional to sludge doses and showed significant differences among treatments in both experiments ( Soil microbial activity, evaluated through FDA hydrolysis and microbial respiration, showed significant differences between treatments, with positive increases when sludge concentrations increased (  From the leaf tissue analysis and DRIS index results for N, P, and K, it can be seen that treatments without fertilization showed the greatest imbalances, with relative deficiencies of N and P and a relative excess of K ( Since there was no significant effect of the factor inoculum concentration, treatment means with and without inoculum were obtained; these are shown in The values for electric conductivity and pH in soil solution water showed statistically significant differences among treatments, which are explained by the sludge factor for electric conductivity, and by the factors sludge and blocks for pH, on different evaluation dates ( For pH, the no sludge and no mineral fertilizer treatment showed the highest values, with a steady trend along the experiment ( Electric conductivity values increased up to 43 days after all treatments, and then decreased right afterward, with a tendency to become stable from 118 days, but always with values higher than the initial values ( In general, the leaf tissue analysis results for seedlings showed that differences between treatments with and without sludge are small ( Soil microbial activity, evaluated through FDA hydrolysis and microbial respiration, showed statistically significant differences among treatments on different evaluation dates (  In the greenhouse experiments, it was observed that Electric conductivity increased as a response to increases in the amount of sludge incorporated to the substrate ( In the greenhouse and field experiments, the pH values showed a decreasing trend when sewage sludge levels increased ( Sludge showed a significant and positive effect on seedling development ( A tendency of reduction in fresh matter weight of the above-ground part and roots was observed with sewage sludge incorporation at concentration of 30% (v/v) ( Increases in soil microbial activity are mentioned by several authors as one of the main factors that could explain suppression of An increase in soil microbial activity was verified in the present work, with positive responses of fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) and microbial respiration to sewage sludge incorporation to the soil ( The importance of studies on disposing of sewage sludge in agriculture has increased considerably in Brazil and in other countries, because a great number of cities are treating their sewage and generating sludge. In addition, many cities are beginning the construction of treatment stations, because it is crucial to collect and treat sewage in order to reduce public health and water pollution problems. These results demonstrate the potential use of sewage sludge in citrus, as well as the necessity for additional studies in other pathosystems. Moreover, they show the need for interdisciplinary research studies involving the utilization of urbanâ€“industrial residues in agriculture to be carried out. Considering that sewage sludge amendments carry in their composition, different forms of pollutants such as: heavy metals, organic chemical compounds and pathogens that may represent threat to human life, rigorous control in their agricultural use is recommended.
