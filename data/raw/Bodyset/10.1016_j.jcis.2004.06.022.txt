                     , of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) of 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 generations (G) have been determined at different surfactant as well as PAMAM concentrations. The critical micelle concentration of SDS increases with the increase in the amount of each generation and the additive effect of 0.5G is maximum.

                      of SDS shows a systematic decrease with maximum reduction in the presence of 0.5G. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) captures a layered pattern of 1.0G in the form of nanorods and no AFM images are detected for 1.0G in the presence of SDS. All results demonstrate that SDS has favorable interactions with ester-terminated 0.5G PAMAM rather than amine-terminated 0.0G and 1.0G.One of the most rapidly expanding areas in chemistry over the past few years is the study of dendrimer chemistry. The class of dendritic molecules represents a truly special area of polymer science Dendrimers are very interesting for studies in molecular physics, mainly because of their regular branching. A series of dendrimers consists of five or six generations. The first and second generations belong to low-molecular-weight structures, whereas the fifth and following generations are high-molecular-weight compounds. They are synthesized in successive generations from a central core. This results in macromolecules with well-defined branches, very specific molecular masses, and uniform sizes The dual nature of dendrimers involves an external periphery containing multiple functional groups responsible for their solubility in aqueous media and an internal hydrophobic core which is large enough to contain small molecules as guests As far as dendrimer–surfactant interactions are concerned, the poly(amido amine) family of dendrimers is a widely investigated group of dendritic polymers possessing branched repeating units radially attached to a central core. Recently, some mixed systems of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and surfactants in aqueous solution have been investigated In the present study, the interactions between poly(amidoamine) dendrimers ( Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 99%, from Aldrich, used as received. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) ( In situ images were captured using a Nanoscope IIIA atomic force microscope (Digital Instruments) using standard silicon nitride cantilevers (Digital Instruments) with a spring constant of The conductivity measurements of aqueous solutions of PAMAM and SDS were carried out with the help of a Model EQ 661 digital conductivity meter (Equiptronics, Bombay). A dip-type conductivity cell with a double-walled jacket to circulate the thermostated water was used for all measurements. The measurements were performed at The Krafft temperatures ( It is to be mentioned here that the concentration of PAMAM is expressed in g L The AFM images did not show any distinct organization at the HOPG surface for the 0.0   These results are further supported by the All of the above results can be explained as follows. Looking at the surface groups of all present PAMAM dendrimers, one can find that the 0.0 The following conclusions can be drawn from this study. The adsorbed layers of 1.0 Unlike surfactant layers, which are limited to one layer of molecules, multiple layers of dendrimers grow at the surface.
