This special issue contains selected papers among the 47 presented at the Kammel's Quo Vadis Hydrometallurgy International Conference-QVH IV, held in Herlany, near to Kosice, Slovak Republic, on May 25â€“28, 2004. The title of this conference is Kammel's Quo Vadis Hydrometallurgy. By so doing, the participants decided to commemorate the great contribution of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Dr. h.c. (mult.) Roland Kammel to development of hydro- and electrometallurgy. The 4th conference of the QVH series provided an international forum in which the progress and applications of hydrometallurgy were addressed by representatives of 11 countries. Within the various topics covered during the conference, we may highlight the progress in understanding the leaching processes and applying new ideas to commercial applications. The increasing role of hydrometallurgical processes in waste processing was also apparent. The program for the Conference encompasses five sessions, covering a range of topics related to leaching: Leaching; Metals recovery; Deep sea nodules processing and related topics; Outokumpu HYDROCOPPER proces and related topics; Waste processing and related topics. We wish to express our appreciation to authors and participants. Acknowledgments are also due to reviewer corps who took the time to carefully read and constructively criticize the contributions to this special issue. That such important event would not have been possible without the aid of co-organizers and sponsors. We would like to express gratitude particularly to Outokumpu Research Center, Pori, Finland, Interocean Joint Organization, Szeczyn, Poland, Slovak Metallurgical Society, Kosice, Slovakia and R. Kammel foundation, Kosice Slovakia for their valuable contribution. We hope that this special issue provides not only a record of the recent progress but also become a basis for further advancement in this field of hydrometallurgy.
