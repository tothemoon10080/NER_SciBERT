Tropical sandy soils are highly susceptible to acidification as a consequence of intensive farming. We analyzed the dominant processes of acidification and neutralization in a sandy soil of cropland system in northeast Thailand. Proton budgets in the soil (Typic Ustipsamments) were quantified for a sugarcane field and a mango plantation by measuring ion fluxes associated with solute leaching and plant uptake. Soil acidification in the sugarcane field was caused mainly by excessive uptake of cations over anions by sugarcane and following product removal. Despite the small stocks of organic matter in the sandy soil, the net mineralization of the native soil organic matter can neutralize most of the acidity associated with product removal (68%) in the sugarcane field. Proton budgets have demonstrated the sensitivity of tropical sandy soils to acidification and potential roles of organic matter on acid neutralization.Tropical sandy soils are typically infertile due to the low availability of water, soil organic matter (SOM), and nutrients ( Sandy soils are susceptible to acidification or alkalization due to their small acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) ( Net mineralization of the native SOM can be an important mechanism of acid neutralization in cropland soils, as organic anions in soil consume protons in mineralization process ( In this study, we quantified proton budgets in the sandy soils under sugarcane and mango plantation to analyze the dominant soil-acidifying and buffering mechanisms under different vegetation covers within a cropland system. We answered three questions: (1) whether the magnitude of nitrate leaching is large throughout the wet season in the sandy soils, (2) whether the dominant soil-acidifying processes differ between a sugarcane field and a mango plantation, and (3) whether proton consumption from the net mineralization of SOM is sufficiently high to neutralize acidity in the sandy soil. The experiments were carried out in a sloped cropland on a farm field in Ban Sam Jan, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand (N16°35–36′, E102°47–48′; 300 Soil samples, which were collected at the beginning of the experiment (March 2004), were air-dried to pass through a 2 Stems and leaves were harvested in the SC field. Litterfall was collected in the MG plantation using circular litter-traps (60 Soil solutions were collected in five replicates using tension-free lysimeters, each draining a surface area of 200 Ion fluxes leached from each horizon were calculated by multiplying water fluxes by ion concentrations in precipitation (or throughfall in the MG plantation) and soil solution. The water fluxes of precipitation and throughfall were measured using a precipitation collector, while the half-hourly fluxes of soil water were estimated by applying Darcy’s law to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the gradient of the hydraulic heads at 0–5, 10–15, and 40–45 The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity characteristic described by Mualem-Van Genuchten functions ( Soil acidification is defined as a decrease in ANC of the solid phase of a soil ( Net proton generation and consumption in a soil can be calculated according to proton budget theory ( The sum of acid load results in an equivalent decrease in ANC [ All results are the means Both SC and MG soils were sandy and contained low concentrations of C and N ( The water retention curves indicated that both the SC and MG soils had lower water-holding capacities than a clayey soil from northern Thailand ( The soil C stocks of SC and MG soils were smaller than the reported values in clayey soils [44–56 Mg C Most of the soil solution samples were moderately acidic to neutral ( The concentrations of DOC, the source of organic anions, were significantly higher in the MG soil than in the SC soil ( Cation concentrations were higher than anion concentrations in litter and woody materials in both plots ( The NPG The proton consumption from net mineralization of SOM, which can be estimated using the rate of SOM loss ( Seasonality of N leaching can generally be affected by plant uptake and N mineralization in cropland soils ( The leaching of NH Vegetation covers can also have strong influence on the N fluxes of leaching through effects on N assimilation by plants and soil microorganisms ( The differences in C and N fluxes under different vegetation covers can cause the different patterns of soil acidification ( Dissociation of organic acid and organic anions are common acidifying processes of moderately acidic to neutral soils studied ( Sandy soils are susceptible to acidification due to their small ANC and SOM stocks ( Soil organic matter is another important proton sink, as organic anions consume protons before mineralization (e.g., HC Acidification of sandy soil was increased by proton release associated with excessive uptake of cations over anions by sugarcane and following product removal in the sugarcane field. Despite the small stocks of SOM, the rapid mineralization of litter and the native SOM can neutralize most of the acidity. Proton budgets have successfully demonstrated the sensitivity of tropical sandy soils to acidification and potential roles of organic matter on acid neutralization in the cropland system.
