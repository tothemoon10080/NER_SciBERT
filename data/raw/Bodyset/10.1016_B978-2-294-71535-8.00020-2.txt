               Tibial plateau fractures are frequent; their treatment is difficult. Arthroscopically assisted percutaneous fixation is one of the best techniques for simple fractures Schatzker type 1, 2, 3 and 4. It allows an optimal reduction of the articular fracture and a rigid fixation which permits early mobilization. Percutaneous fixation with cannulated screws appears to be the most reliable mechanical solution and is far less invasive than open reduction and plate fixation. In complex fractures of the upper tibial extremity, arthroscopy can also be used to check the restoration of the articular surface while avoiding a large arthrotomy. An additional stable osteosynthesis must be used in such cases in order to achieve a rigid fixation and to allow early mobilization. We review the various techniques and technical tricks which can prove useful in arthroscopy assisted treatment of tibial plateau fractures.
