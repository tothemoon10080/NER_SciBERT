To improve the preferential nucleation of calcium phosphate by incorporated ions during anodization, titanium oxide (TiO2) films for implant applications were synthesized by electrochemical process in an electrolyte with sodium silicate solution as an additive. The surface morphologies of the anodic TiO2 films were dependent on the electrolyte. The anodic oxide films formed in the electrolyte with high additive content and for long anodic applied time demonstrated the greater precipitation capability of the bioactive Caâ€“P compounds.For application as a high performance biomedical material with good biocompatibility, an anodic titanium oxide (TiO The present work investigated the surface characteristics of anodic titania formed by anodizing at higher applied voltage and the effects of incorporated chemical species in the anodic TiO Commercial grade titanium specimens (99.6 The microstructures of the anodic TiO The anodizing process is shown in The variations of the microstructure and morphology of the anodic TiO The X-ray diffraction results of anodic titania films showed peaks related to the anatase phases  The bioactivity of these anodic TiO  In order to facilitate the preferential nucleation of bioactive calcium phosphate compounds on TiO
