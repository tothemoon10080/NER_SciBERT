This work focuses on the sorption recovery of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III) simultaneously present in chloride solutions, freshly prepared and stored over 3months, on commercial anion exchangers with different physical and chemical structure. The sorption was carried out from solutions with 0.001–4.0mol/L HCl. The initial platinum and rhodium concentrations in contacting solutions were 0.25–2.5mmol/L. Sorption and kinetic properties of the chosen anion exchangers were investigated and the basic parameters of exchange capacity, recovery, distribution coefficients, separation factors, process rate, diffusion coefficients and half-exchange times were calculated. It is shown that anion exchangers investigated possess high sorption ability to platinum and rhodium chloride complexes, which does not deteriorate in case of stored solutions. Desorption of platinum and rhodium from the resins investigated was carried out with hydrochloric acid (2mol/L), thiourea (1mol/L) in sulfuric acid (2mol/L) or in potassium hydroxide (2mol/L) as well as by ammonium thiocyanate (2mol/L). It was shown that complete separation of platinum and rhodium can be carried out with 2mol/L HCl on anion exchanger Purolite S 985, whereas 2mol/L NH

The growing demand for platinum group metals (PGM) resulted in intensive PGM mining from known deposits, and also in expanding the supplies of secondary raw materials. The major sources for these materials are spent automobile catalysts, catalysts from chemical industry, electronic scrap and so-called tailings, i.e. wastes of ore-dressing plants on noble metals-containing deposits ( In a variety of sorbents, the ion exchange resins with different functional groups are of special interest because of their high exchange capacity, mechanical stability and good kinetic properties ( It is known that PGM solutions obtained after breakdown of initial materials are distinguished by their complex composition ( Previously we have successfully applied selective ion exchangers for the recovery of some noble metals, including platinum and rhodium, from individual chloride solutions ( In our investigation we used two kinds of platinum/rhodium solutions: freshly prepared and stored over 3 For the purpose of this investigation, selected anion exchangers with different physical and chemical structure were chosen; the basic characteristics of which are summarized in The initial platinum stock solution with concentration 10 The dry residue of The initial rhodium stock solution was prepared according to The content of platinum and rhodium in the stock solutions was controlled before preparing the working solutions by a gravimetric method using The sorption of platinum and rhodium was studied under batch experiment conditions: resin mass — 0.1–0.2 The efficiency of sorption recovery of platinum and rhodium by the ion exchangers investigated was estimated by means of recovery (R, %), distribution coefficient ( The sorption isotherms were plotted by varying the molar ratio of resins to the amounts of platinum or rhodium in contacting solution ( The Raman spectra of resins were recorded on an RFS 100/S Raman Fourier Spectrometer (Bruker) by direct scanning of resin beads. Each spectrum was obtained after 300 scans over the interval 100–3500 The kinetic behavior of anion exchangers towards platinum and rhodium was investigated by the “limited bath” method ( Then the kinetic curves were plotted on the coordinates The interpretation of results on kinetics was carried out using Boyd's method ( If the process is controlled by gel diffusion, the function All the results were subjected to statistical processing according to conventional procedures ( It is known that the equilibrium ionic state of PGM in solutions depends on medium, concentration of chloride ions and temperature ( It is worth noting that if relatively weak acidic The simultaneous adsorption and recovery of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III) was studied from both freshly prepared solutions and solutions stored over 3 The effects of fresh solution acidity on the sorption properties of anion exchangers investigated are given in It can be seen also from As for strong basic anion exchangers, they reveal a similar behavior, i.e. their sorption ability towards Thus, the anion exchangers investigated can be arranged according to their sorption ability in the following orders: for for Based on these orders, we have selected anion exchangers Purolite S 985 and A 500 as well as AM-2B for the further investigation, as they possess the best sorption properties. The data on sorption recovery of platinum and rhodium from stored chloride solutions are summarized in We have calculated the platinum and rhodium separation factors during their recovery from freshly prepared and stored solutions, which are given in To determine the mechanism of sorption recovery of platinum and rhodium on selected anion exchangers, we have registered Raman spectra of these sorbents in initial chloride form and also after saturation by solutions of platinum and rhodium in strong and weak acid media. The spectra are presented in The comparison of intermediate basic anion exchanger AM-2B spectra in initial form and after saturation with platinum ( Comparing the Raman spectra of AM-2B saturated with rhodium from 1 The comparison of Raman spectra of complexing anion exchanger Purolite S 985 in initial chloride form and after saturation with platinum in 0.01 The Raman spectrum of this sorbent after its saturation with rhodium solution ( The Raman spectrum of strong basic anion exchanger Purolite A 500 after its saturation with platinum ( The comparison of Raman spectra of anion exchanger Purolite A 500 in the initial The obtained data point to the mixed sorption mechanism of platinum (II, IV) chloride complexes on anion exchangers AM-2B and Purolite S 985, proceeding through anion exchange (Eq. The sorption isotherms of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III) from chloride freshly prepared and kept solutions on the resins investigated are represented in Eq. According to Eq. It can be seen from An investigation of the kinetics of The kinetics type during the sorption of platinum and rhodium was determined using the classical Boyd's model with the corresponding criteria ( The main kinetic parameters of simultaneous With the decrease in acid concentration in freshly prepared contacting solution, the half-exchange time shortens, whereas the values of average diffusion coefficients increase. In case of platinum recovery, the diffusion coefficients are greater and the half-exchange time is shorter than for rhodium sorption under the same conditions. The The desorption of platinum and rhodium was also studied after their simultaneous recovery on investigated anion exchangers. The problem of elution of noble metals from highly selective sorbents was investigated by a number of researchers ( It can be seen from these data that in most cases platinum is almost completely recovered (> Nevertheless, the obtained data are promising for complete separation of platinum and rhodium in some systems. If 2 Therefore, the investigated anion exchangers can be recommended for simultaneous recovery of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III) from chloride solutions and for separation of these noble metals.  It was shown that the investigated resins possess high sorption ability towards chloride complexes of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III), which does not practically decrease in aged solutions which show evidence of some different aqua chloro- and aqua hydroxo-species. By using Raman spectroscopy, it was determined that anion exchangers AM-2B and Purolite S 985 recover platinum (II, IV) according to both anion exchange and additional complexation, whereas sorption of platinum proceeds on Purolite A 500 in accordance with a simple anion exchange mechanism. The recovery of rhodium (III) was determined by complexation with functional groups on AM-2B or by anion exchange on Purolite A 500. The rhodium recovery on Purolite S 985 was carried out by anion exchange and additional complexation. It was shown that the resins possessed good kinetic properties with the rate of ion exchange limited by gel diffusion for anion exchangers Purolite S 985 and A 500 as well as for AM-2B. The kinetic parameters (rate constant, diffusion coefficients and half-exchange time) were calculated and showed faster sorption of platinum complexes compared to rhodium complexes. Desorption of platinum and rhodium sorbed simultaneously on anion exchangers was carried out by The results allow recommending the investigated anion exchangers Purolite S 985, Purolite A 500 and AM-2B for simultaneous recovery of platinum (II, IV) and rhodium (III) from chloride solutions as well as for the separation of these noble metals by their selective desorption.
