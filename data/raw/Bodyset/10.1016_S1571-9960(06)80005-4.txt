The distribution of in situ rock stresses is a major concern of rock mechanics and rock engineering, both with respect to understanding basic geological processes—such as plate tectonics and earthquakes—and the design of structures in and on rock masses. There are many different methods for measuring in situ rock stresses. These methods can be classified into two main categories. The first category comprises methods that disturb the in situ rock conditions, that is, by inducing strains, deformations, or crack opening pressures, including the hydraulic fracturing and/or hydraulic testing of pre-existing fractures (HTPE) methods, borehole relief methods, and surface relief methods. The second category comprises methods based on the observation of rock behavior without any major influence from the measuring method, including core discing, borehole breakouts, relief of large rock volumes (back analysis), acoustic methods (Kaiser effect), strain-recovery methods, geological observational methods, and earthquake focal mechanisms. This chapter discusses various methods for estimating the in situ rock stresses, including empirical correlations or observations obtained from stress measurements made in the past and different analytical models.
