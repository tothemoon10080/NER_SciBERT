The red-emitting Ca0.54Sr0.16Eu0.08Gd0.12(MoO4)0.2(WO4)0.8 phosphor is improved in the emission charateristics by charge compensation, of which chromaticity coordinates (CIE) are x=0.66 and y=0.33. Three approaches to charge compensation are investigated, namely (a) 3Ca2+/Sr2+→2Eu3+/Gd3++vacancy, (b) 2Ca2+/Sr2+→Eu3+/Gd3++M+(M+ is a monovalent cation like Li+, Na+ and K+ employed as a charge compensator) and (c) Ca2+/Sr2+→Eu3+/Gd3++N− (N− is a monovalent anion like F−, Cl−, Br− and I− employed as charge compensation ions). Through photoluminescent spectra analyzing the radiative and non-radiative relaxation mechanisms of luminescent system are obtained. Under 20mA forward-bias current, one red-emitting LED is made by combining 390–405nm-emitting LED chip and the phosphor. The red-emitting phosphor has broad prospects in LED application field.Nowadays, there are two main methods to gain white light. One is combination of a blue LED chips with a yellow phosphor. The other is to obtain white light through UV light from LED exciting the tri-color phosphors. However, the phosphors are deficient under blue or near ultraviolet (NUV) light excitation. Therefore, exploiting new efficient phosphors has become a very hot research topic. Molybdates, tungstates and Eu A series of red-emitting phosphors were synthesized by dynamic solid-state reaction. The starting materials were calcium oxide (CaO, A.R. grade), strontium carbonate (SrCO Excitation and emission spectra were measured by using a Hitachi F-4600 spectrometer equipped with a 150 To improve the luminescent property of CSEGMW for meeting the requirement of LED and PDP, etc., charge compensation are employed. A total of 26 kinds of charge compensators are introduced into the procedure of synthesizing the red-emitting CSEGMW phosphors in order to obtain the ideal phosphors. Shown in Above all, when the single alkali carbonates, such as Li Secondly, to study further the possible mechanism of charge compensation, the luminescent properties of CSEGMW are studied when NH With KF, KCl, KBr or KI employed as charge compensators, the emission intensity and CIE of CSEGMW are 3868 In a word, charge compensation way are closely related to charge compensators. To CSEGMW, the degree of charge compensators giving contribution to improving its emission characteristics is generalized as follows, viz. trinary alkali carbonates>couple alkali carbonates>single alkali carbonates>alkali halides>ammonium chloride. The ideal compensators are 8 Excitation spectrum of CSEGMWN ( According to photoluminescent spectra, the mechanism of non-radiative and radiative processes are shown in These CR processes as above mentioned have the function of increasing the intensity of the emission spectrum with increasing the Eu The luminescent life of CSEGMWN is 7.5 Charge compensation way are closely related to charge compensators.
