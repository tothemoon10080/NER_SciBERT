Implant placement in bone is presently associated with defined expectations of success based on defined clinical and radiographic endpoints. This successful outcome has been correlated to the histologically represented bone-implant interface and is commonly referred to as "osseointegration". The concept of osseointegration has thus significantly broadened from its original sense to its definition as a direct structural and functional connection between living alveolar bone and the dental implant as a load-carrier. Today, osseointegration is a term regarded as synonymous with clinical success. To explain the micromechanisms involved in osseointegration, it is necessary to know concepts of biology, physiology, anatomy, surgery and tissue regeneration. Osseointegration is observed in several areas, including not only dental implants, but also maxillofacial implants, replacement of damaged joints and placement of artificial limbs. Among the important requirements for osseointegration are the existence of a biocompatible surface, the presence of alveolar bone in the potential recipient sites and no traumatic surgery. According to Brånemark et al, the phenomenon of osseointegration is due to new bone formation in close contact with the implant. To achieve this end, protocols were developed, since several parameters have to be defined, from the choice of the metal to the placement and preservation of the prosthesis. Thus, osseointegration depends on the material used in the implant, the machining conditions, the surface finish, the type of bone that receives the implant, the surgical technique, design of the prosthesis and the patient care.
                  The aim of the present review is to discuss current status of osseointegration in the field of dental implants.
