Wood dust reinforcing polymer matrix composites has been one of the epoch-making and pioneering study both from scientific and economical eye over the last decades, due to the eco-friendliness and aesthetical properties. Wood dust is suitable and beguiling filler for thermoset polymers due to its cost effectiveness, low density and high specific properties. It is biodegradable and nonabrasive during processing. The research was proceeded with the objective of evaluating the effect of different types of wood saw dust on the properties of composite materials. In this experiment, thermal behaviours of composites reinforced with wood dust particles of various woods (three types of woods) were investigated. Size was a viable parameter to control the properties of developed composites. As a result two different particle sizes as medium and coarse sized wood particles were used to develop the composites and characterize their thermal conductivities. The results of the experiment thus observed were quite interesting. Pure polyester has been found to have lower thermal conductivity compared to that of any wood reinforced polyester and that wood strength or true density has been found to influence the thermal conductivity of the as-received polymer. With increase in the dust particle content, thermal conductivities of all composites have been found to increase.
