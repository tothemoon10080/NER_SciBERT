The surgical repair of acetabular physeal fractures in four kittens using a screw and tension band technique is reported. This was an appropriate method for restoring articular congruency and improving pelvic alignment. All cases had an excellent outcome and full limb use following fracture repair. In kittens younger than 12 weeks, there is a possibility of premature fusion of the acetabular bone resulting in development of a deformed, shallow acetabulum and hip subluxation. However, surgery is still justified when there is pelvic canal narrowing to decrease the risk of future defecatory problems. Early implant removal in such young kittens may decrease the severity of deformity caused by premature physeal closure. In kittens of 16 weeks or older, the prognosis is good for normal acetabular development and implant removal is not necessary.
