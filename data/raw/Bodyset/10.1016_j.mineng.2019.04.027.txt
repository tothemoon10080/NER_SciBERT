This paper reports the measured froth zone (R
                     f) and collection zone (R
                     c) recoveries in the flotation of pure quartz, pure hematite, and a quartz-hematite mixture with one of three corn starches with different mass ratios of amylose to amylopectin: waxy starch (0:100), normal starch (27:73), and Gelose 50 (50:50). The flotation tests were carried out at continuous mode using a three-product column at different pHs and starch concentrations with sodium oleate as collector and calcium chloride as activator. It was found that both R
                     f and R
                     c were significantly affected by pH and starch type and concentration. In the flotation of pure quartz or hematite, addition of each of the corn starches tested would decrease the R
                     f and R
                     c, with the effects following the order of waxy starch > normal starch > Gelose 50. The decreases in R
                     f and R
                     c coincided with the increase in the aggregate size caused by addition of these starches. Possible correlations between R
                     f, solid flux at the pulp-froth interface and R
                     c were examined. In the flotation of the quartz-hematite mixture, the changes in R
                     f and R
                     c of Fe caused by varying starch type and dosage were consistent with those in the flotation of pure hematite.Iron ores are widespread in the Earth’s crust, playing an important role in many fields, such as steelmaking, coating and durable pigments ( In the reverse flotation of iron ores, depressants are often used to depress the flotation of iron oxides by modifying the mineral surface properties ( Most of the previous flotation research concerning the interactions between starches and iron ores has focused on the flotation pulp phase. Starches can act as a flotation depressant by hindering the adsorption of a collector onto the iron-rich mineral surface to maintain the hydrophilic surface state of the mineral ( Relatively little attention has been paid, however, to the froth phase in iron ore flotation systems. As the final particle separation phase, froth phase plays an important role in determining the separation efficiency of the flotation process ( Previous studies only showed that the application of starch could significantly affect the overall flotation performance ( The present study aims to investigate the flotation responses of mineral particles (pure hematite, quartz and their mixture) in the pulp zone and froth zone to the use of various starches with different mass ratios of AM to AP. A three-product column was used to simultaneously evaluate the mineral flotation recoveries in froth phase and pulp phase. This study provides important details on the depressing ability of various starches for two typical minerals in flotation froth phase and pulp phase, and its implications for iron ore flotation practice are discussed. Natural hematite and quartz samples were purchased from GeoDiscovery and Sibelco in Australia, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that these samples were highly pure. According to chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), the hematite sample contained 95.19% Fe Three corn starches with different mass ratios of AM to AP, Waxy Starch (WS, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich): 0:100, Normal Starch (NS, from Penford Australia Ltd.): 27:73, Gelose 50 (G50, from Penford Australia Ltd.): 50:50, were used. More details on these starches can be found elsewhere ( Sodium oleate (NaOl, purchased from Chem-Supply, Australia) was used as collector. Calcium chloride (CaCl  The feed port was 1000 mm above the screen sparger with an aperture size of 105 μm. A peristaltic pump (BT300-2J LongerPump) was used to feed the column with slurry discharged from the conditioning sump. Another peristaltic pump was used to add washwater through a water distributor, which was 500 mm above the feed port. A vertically movable bucket, which was connected to the tailings discharging port, was used to control the level of the pulp-froth interface. The drop back collector, which was 200 mm below the pulp-froth interface, was used to collect the drop-back, and the volumetric flowrate of the drop-back stream was controlled manually through a valve. A flowmeter and an air pressure regulator were used to control the flow rate and pressure of air introduced to the flotation column. The flotation feed slurry was prepared by mixing 0.50 kg of minerals (quartz, hematite or their mixture) with 9.5 kg of tap water in a conditioning sump with agitation at 1000 rpm. HCl or NaOH stock solution was added to adjust the pH of the slurry prior to addition of a starch stock solution. CaCl The flotation tests were carried out at continuous mode. Before starting the flotation, precautions were taken with preloading of water in the column and addition of washwater for minimizing physical entrainment ( The feed pump was operated at an impeller rotating speed of 250 rpm to introduce the slurry to the flotation column, and the drop-back slurry flowrate was maintained at ∼0.35 L/min. The drop-back flow was downward, accelerating the particle sinking and thus helping prevent particles from returning to the collection zone. In addition, it was observed that the entrainment of air into the sink during steady state was negligible compared to the total amount of air introduced to the flotation system. The flotation system would achieve steady state at twice particle residence time, according to the results of preliminary tests. The particle residence time was at most 3 min as the volume of the flotation column was approximately 4.0 L and the discharge rate was at least 1.4 L/min (see After 6 min of operation, the flotation system reached steady state, and then sample collection for the float, sink and drop back steams was simultaneously carried out for 2 min. The collected samples were filtered, dried, and weighed. The recoveries in the froth and collection zones were calculated using the measured mass flowrates of the three-products in the column. These calculations were made under the following assumptions: Steady state when the mass flow rates of solids and water do not change over time; Steady state when the grades of the feed, float, drop-back and sink do not change over time; No entrainment from the collection zone to the separation zone; No entrainment of air into the column sink. For flotation of pure minerals, the froth zone recovery For flotation of the quartz-hematite mixture, the Fe distributions of material stream A laser particle size analyzer (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern, UK) was used to measure the size distributions of the aggregates/particles, following the procedure described by  The    Apart from hindering collector adsorption on hematite surface, starches may also act as flocculant to aggregate fine mineral particles in water (   The P80 values (shown in Froth zone recovery is strongly dependent on froth depth, gas flow rate and solids flux at the pulp-froth interface (  All the An artificial mineral mixture consisting of hematite and quartz at a mass ratio 1:1 was agitated in a conditioning sump containing water in the presence of various reagents as described in   The flotation tests for pure hematite and quartz found that starch type would affect froth zone (    One can see from A three-product column was used to measure the froth zone ( Both Addition of each of the corn starches tested would decrease the There were strong correlations between Flotation of the hematite-quartz mixture found that a corn starch with a higher amylopectin content led to decrease The authors gratefully thank the Supplementary data to this article can be found online at The following are the Supplementary data to this article:
