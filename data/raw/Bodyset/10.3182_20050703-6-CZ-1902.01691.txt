As an internal parameter of ball milling process, grinding concentration (GC) is not able to be measured directly. According to ball mill's principle, based on radial base function (RBF) network, a soft sensor method is presented to estimate the ball mill's GC. And a novel grey relation analysis method as a way to determine the secondary variables is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the design possesses high accuracy and can meet the practical demands.
