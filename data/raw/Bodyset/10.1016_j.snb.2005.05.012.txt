A micromachined gas sensor based on a catalytic thick film/SnO2 thin film bilayer and a thin film heater was investigated for CO sensing. The sensor demonstrated good sensitivity and high selectivity with low power consumption.
                  The thin film heater and the SnO2 thin film sensing layer were deposited on an Si micromachined structure having a silicon oxideâ€“silicon nitride membrane. On the SnO2 sensing layer, a Pd-Al2O3 catalytic thick film was formed to promote CO detection with a catalyst.
                  The sensor realized low power consumption and fast thermal response owing to small heat capacity. This fast thermal response decreased the time required to detect CO and thus decreased the time to operate the sensor. The average power consumption was less than 0.03mW when operated every 2min. The sensor sensitively detected CO by high-and-low periodic operation of the heater, while the sensitivity to H2, the interfering gas used, was relatively suppressed.It is widely known that CO is selectively detected by periodically heating an SnO The structure of the sensor is shown in The measurement system shown in The thin film heater was operated periodically to control the sensor temperature by a sequence as shown in    Under typical conditions for CO sensing used in this study ( A micromachined gas sensor based on a catalytic thick film/SnO
