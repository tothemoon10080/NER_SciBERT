Nano titanium oxide (Nano-TiO2) was used in this work as a solid support to solid–solid immobilize carboxymethyl cellulose via glutaraldehyde as an efficient cross linking reagent to produce a novel nanosized biocomposite (Nano-TiO2-glu-CMC). The synthesized materials were characterized by FT-IR to confirm crosslinking reaction between the two species as well as by HR-TEM, SEM, TGA and surface area analysis. The particle size was found to correspond to 22.2–44.4nm for Nano-TiO2-glu-CMC. The designed nanosized biocomposite was used and compared with Nano-TiO2 for separation and extraction of heavy metal ions such as Cd(II), Pb(II) and Hg(II) from aqueous solution by using batch experiment and microcolumn technique. The maximum metal sorption capacity values of Cd(II), Pb(II) and Hg(II) were established as 2440μmolg−1 (pH 7), 2880μmolg−1 (pH 6) and 1160μmolg−1 (pH 3), respectively. Optimization of the extraction experiments confirmed the maximum adsorption upon using 0.025g biocomposite dosage and 30min contact time.Heavy metals are known as the most common source of pollution due to industrial development such as nuclear fuel industry, ceramics, batteries, electroplating, nuclear laboratories, textile, mineral processing and metallurgical alloying Several physicochemical methods are generally used to remove toxic heavy metals such as cadmium (II), mercury (II) and lead (II) from water and wastewater. These methods are based on techniques of membrane processes, solvent extraction, precipitation, ion exchange, filtration and adsorption Nanosized metal oxides (NMOs) have been recognized by a number of physicochemical properties as high reactivity for separation, extraction and removal for organic and inorganic pollutants for the sake of water treatment Cellulose, the most prevalent natural polymer, has greatly impacted the world and society in broad reaching areas.
