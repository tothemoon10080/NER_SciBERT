Measurements of the abundance and isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in lunar samples, carried out in the laboratory of Ian Kaplan at UCLA, led to several important insights into lunar, and possibly solar, processes. Sulfur isotope systematics in the lunar regolith record both addition of meteoritic sulfur and loss of sulfur from the lunar surface. Regolith nitrogen reveals complex, long-term isotopic variations of large magnitude which may originate in the Sun. Only the carbon isotope systematics defy explanation at this time.
