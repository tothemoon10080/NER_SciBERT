Nickel is one of the most commonly used catalysts for the growth of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Nevertheless, the chemical state of nickel catalyst, which may be metallic nickel (Ni), nickel subcarbide (Ni3C1-x) and nickel carbide (Ni3C) during the growth process of CNFs, remains a longstanding issue. We report here the catalytic growth of CNFs by CVD at temperatures ranged from 300 to 600 °C. It is demonstrated that the nickel catalyst has different chemical states during the catalytic growth, including Ni3C at 300 °C, composite Ni–Ni3C1-x from 400 to 500 °C and metallic Ni at 600 °C, which is clearly dependent on the growth temperature. Our findings reconcile the longstanding debate on the contradictory models (i.e. Ni-assisted growth, Ni3C1-x-assisted growth and Ni3C-assisted growth) for the catalytic growth CNFs.Catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) has been a widely used approach for industrial production of carbon nanofibers/nanotubes (CNFs/CNTs) due to its low cost, high yield and ease of scale-up The debate on the chemical state of catalysts was originated from the argument in 1980s that the deviation of C equilibrium during the growth process of CNFs could be attributed to the formation of the metastable carbides, Ni Ni is one of the most common catalysts used for the growth of CNFs/CNFs. The chemical state of Ni catalyst exists as metallic Ni during the catalytic growth of CNFs/CNTs at the temperatures of above 500 °C, which has been well demonstrated by both In our recent work, we successfully synthesized CNFs at 300 °C by metal-organic CVD, and demonstrated that the Ni catalyst appeared as Ni CNFs were synthesized by metal-organic CVD in a horizontal tube furnace. Nickel(II) acetylacetonate (Ni(acac) The collected products were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D max 2500 VB), scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F, operated at 5 kV), TEM (JEOL JEM-2100F and FEI Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, EDAX Genesis XM2). The phase compositions of the products synthesized at different temperatures were examined by XRD, as shown in   The CNFs obtained 500 °C exhibit the similar bi-directional structure as those obtained at 400 °C ( The morphology and structure of the CNFs at 600 °C are similar to those obtained 500 °C, though rare defects can be detected within the catalytic particles, as shown in From the above-mentioned TEM results, we find that the catalyst particles are basically diamond-shaped at 400, 500 and 600 °C and are hexagonal at 300 °C. To obtain the further structural information about the CNFs and the corresponding catalysts at different temperatures, we performed intensive TEM analyses on the C layers and the ends of the corresponding catalyst particles, and presented the typical HRTEM images in It is generally argued that the observed Ni According to the C–Ni phase diagram The growth of the CNFs obtained at 300 °C, as suggested in the our previous work, is controlled by the Ni The growth of CNFs obtained at the temperatures ranged from 300 to 500 °C is presumed to be induced by the composite-assisted mechanism with the following fundamental process ( The formation of CNFs generated above 500 °C was believed to be governed by the well-known dissolution-precipitation process of C atoms through the metallic Ni particles, as illustrated in The differences in the chemical states and shapes of the catalyst particles have an obvious effect on the morphology of the CNFs, although all CNFs are basically coiled. The coiled morphology can be intuitively attributed to the asymmetric supply of C atoms during the catalytic growth of CNFs, but is essentially controlled by the asymmetrical morphology and structure of the catalyst particles. At 300 °C, the diameters of the CNFs are much smaller than those of the corresponding catalyst particles, and the CNFs normally do not initiate from the centers of the corresponding flat Ni The CNFs were synthesized by use of catalytic CVD at temperatures ranged from 300 to 600 °C. It was found that the chemical state of Ni catalyst was dependent on the growth temperature, i.e., Ni This study is financially supported by the
