This work aimed to achieve optimal thermal oxidation parameters to create a TiO2 film with excellent electrical properties at the interface of Ti/RuO2–IrO2–TiO2 anode to increase the service life of this anode in chloride solution. TiO2 films were prepared on commercially pure titanium (CPT) using thermal oxidation process at temperatures of 450, 480, and 520 °C for 45, 90, and 180 min under normal and air blowing atmospheres. Mott-Schottky and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were employed to study the electrical properties of these films. Based on the results, the sample subjected to a thermal oxidation process at 450 °C for 115 min under air blowing atmosphere had the highest defects density and, as a result, the highest electrical conductivity. To investigate the effect of optimal thermal oxidation parameters on service life of Ti/RuO2–IrO2–TiO2 anodes, an accelerated life test (ALT) was performed on an anode sample in a solution of 0.1 M NaCl with a current density of 2 A/cm2. The results of this test demonstrated that the production of Ti/RuO2–IrO2–TiO2 anodes with the optimal thermal oxidation parameters instead of the typical thermal oxidation parameters (480 °C, 60 min, and normal atmosphere) led to the enhancement of their service life by up to 30% in 0.1 M NaCl solution.Titanium anodes coated with electroactive oxides, known as dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs), are widely used in various industries due to their electrocatalytic properties and excellent stability [ Over the past few decades, some researchers have studied the electrical and electrochemical properties of titanium dioxide film created by methods such as anodizing, thermal oxidation of titanium, and the electron beam ion assisted [ In the present paper, we used Mott-Schottky technique, known as the best way to identify the electrical properties of oxide films in terms of semiconductor type and defects density [ The substrate used in this study was a commercially pure titanium (CPT) plate with dimensions of 40 × 40 × 1 mm Mott-Schottky and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed using Bio-Logic VSP-300 instrument in a conventional three-electrode system consisted of saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, platinum as counter electrode and oxidized titanium as the working electrode. The exposed surface area for all electrochemical tests was 1 cm In order to evaluate the effect of optimal thermal oxidation parameters on the stability and the service life of DSA anodes, an accelerated life test (ALT) was performed on two samples, one of which was produced under optimal thermal oxidation parameters (1#) and the other under typical thermal oxidation parameters (2#) [ The substrates used for preparation of both 1# and 2# anodes were commercially pure titanium (CPT) plates. The dimensions of both substrates were 40 × 40 × 1 mm In order to prepare the surface of substrates, the titanium plates were sandblasted, and then degreased with ultrasonic cleaner at 20 kHz in soap and water solution at temperature of 50 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, pickling treatment was first performed in 5 vol% hydrofluoric acid at room temperature for 3 min, and then at 14 vol% oxalic acid at 90 °C for 4 h. In the following, the titanium plates were carefully rinsed with distilled water, and finally dried by hot air blowing. The coating solution (Ru; Ir; Ti with molar ratio of 36:38:26) was prepared by dissolving H The accelerated life test (ALT) was utilized to evaluate and compare the stability of both optimized and typical Ti/RuO The surface morphology of anode specimens before and after accelerated life test were characterized utilizing MIRA2 TESCAN-XMU field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), which was equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The energy of accelerator beam for FESEM characterization was selected 15 kV. The inverse square curves of capacitance as a function of the applied potential, known as Mott-Schottky plot, for thermally grown TiO The presence of different oxidation states of titanium in oxide layer could affect the overall shape of Mott-Schottky plots. Dominant state in the titanium oxide layer is known as Ti For the n-type semiconductor, the Mott-Schottky equation is defined as follow [ According to Eq.  Since TiO The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-destructive technique to provide information about metal, coating and solution interfaces [ The impedance spectra were analyzed by fitting the experimental data to the equivalent circuit model containing two time constants shown in As shown in  The Nyquist and Bode plots for thermally grown TiO As observed in In order to investigate the effect of atmosphere type in thermal oxidation process on the electrical properties of TiO The Nyquist and Bode plots for thermally grown TiO Based on the fitting results reported in Based on the previous sections, the optimal parameters for thermal oxidation process were obtained and it was determined that the oxide film created at 450 °C for 45 min under air blowing atmosphere, has the highest electrical conductivity. In order to investigate the effect of these parameters on the service life of Ti/RuO Liu et al. [   Due to the presence of high content of Ru and Ir after the accelerated life test, dissolution of catalytic materials cannot be considered as the main reason for the anode deactivation. Hence, despite the partial dissolution of Ru/Ir, the results reveal that when RuO To sum up, TiO The temperature of thermal oxidation process has a greater effect on the donor concentrations of the TiO The optimal time of the thermal oxidation process for the production of DSA anodes is 45 min. When the oxidation time exceeds 45 min, the thickness of TiO Air blowing during the thermal oxidation process leads to an increase in the electrical conductivity of the TiO Thermal oxidation of the coating at 450 °C for 45 min under air blowing atmosphere during the manufacturing process of Ti/RuO The results of SEM analysis showed that the surface morphology of anode sample in the case of using optimal thermal oxidation conditions is finer, and less degradation of the coating is observed on its surface after the accelerated life test in 0.1 M NaCl solution.
