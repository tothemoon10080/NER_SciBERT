The craniocervical junction (CCJ) is composed of the occiput (C0), the first cervical vertebra (C1) called the atlas, and the second cervical vertebra (C2) called the axis, united by a complex network of ligaments.
               The CCJ is involved in about one-third of all cervical spine injuries and the investigation of any suspected CCJ injury must be done using CT, radiographs missing a substantial number of fractures.
               Three primary mechanisms are encountered in CCJ trauma: rotational forces, generally responsible for C1/C2 injuries; flexion-extension forces, seen for instance in rapid head acceleration, responsible for dislocation, ligamentous injury and fractures (notably of the odontoid); compressive forces, responsible for most C0 and C1 blunt fractures.Introduction Anatomy Bones Ligaments Radiological anatomy Mechanisms of injury C0 injuries C0–C1 dislocation C1 injuries Compression fractures Avulsion fractures C1–C2 instability C2 injuries Odontoid fractures Hangman’s fracture C2 body fractures References The craniocervical junction (CCJ) is involved in about one-third of all cervical spine injuries [ The investigation of any suspected CCJ injury must be done using CT, radiographs missing a substantial number of fractures The CCJ is composed of three bones: the occiput, the first cervical vertebra (C1), called atlas, and the second cervical vertebra (C2) called the axis ( The occiput, or occipital bone (C0), has paired inferior condyles that articulate with the superior articular surfaces on the lateral masses of C1. Those bilateral joints are the only connection of the neck with the head. The C0–C1 joint allowed mainly flexion and extension, with minimal involvement in axial rotation. C1 is a ring-shaped vertebra, with two lateral masses bridged by an anterior and a posterior arch. The lateral masses have articular facets that articulate with C0 condyles above and the lateral facets of C2 below C2 differs from a lower cervical vertebra by a distinctive odontoid process developed above the vertebral body. C1 articulates with C2 at the level of three atlantoaxial joints: one central joint: the odontoid articulates, anteriorly, with the posterior surface of the anterior arch of C1 and, posteriorly, with the anterior surface of the transverse ligament. This joint acts like a pivot. two lateral joints: between the lateral masses of the atlas and axis The atlantoaxial joint allows rotation with only some minor contribution to flexion and extension. This joint has a physiologic high range of motion, of about 45° to either side, in both adults and children C2 articulates with C3 by an intervertebral disc and two facet joints. Besides facet capsules, a complex network of ligaments helps in stabilizing the CCJ The three primary ligament complexes are: odontoid ligament: formed by the apical ligament (from the odontoid apex to basion), and the alar ligaments (from posterolateral aspects of the odontoid to the medial aspect of the occipital condyles). The alar ligaments limit excessive rotation cruciate ligament: formed by the transverse ligament (TL) and the superior and inferior crura (superior and inferior extensions of the transverse ligament). The transverse ligament prevents excessive anterior shift of C1 on C2, restraining odontoid protrusion within the vertebral canal tectorial membrane: continuation of the posterior longitudinal ligament Two other membranes, the anterior and posterior atlanto-occipital membranes, that are fibroelastic continuations of the anterior longitudinal ligaments and the ligamentum flava, have a lesser mechanical significance. CT optimally achieves the imaging exploration; nevertheless, radiographs remain widely performed. The routine radiograph protocol includes a lateral view and an open mouth antero-posterior view. Landmarks that have to be recognized on radiographs are: C0-C1 relationship (Harris “law of 12”): two intervals, basion-posterior axial line and basion-odontoid, should measure less than 12 mm on lateral radiograph ( atlantodens interval (ADI) ( displacement of C1 lateral mass relative to C2 body: less that 7 mm on the AP view ( integrity of the Harris ring ( Swischuck line, drawn from anterior aspect of the spinolaminar line of C1 and C3. The anterior aspect of the spinolaminar line of C2 should be within 0–2 mm posterior to this line The Harris ring is not a anatomical part of the axis but a radiological construction with an anterior part formed by the anterior cortical of C2 at the level of the junction of the vertebral body with lateral masses an upper part formed by the superior facets of C2 superimposed with the superior cortical of the C2 body a posterior part formed by the posterior cortical of the C2 body Three main mechanisms are involved in CCJ injuries, according to its motion relative to the lower cervical spine rotation forces: generally responsible for C1-C2 injuries flexion-extension forces, seen for instance in rapid head acceleration or airbag deployment: they induced tensile forces responsible for dislocation of the occipital condyles, ligamentous injury and fractures, notably of the odontoid compressive forces, resulting from an impact on the head. Compression forces are responsible for most C0 or C1 blunt fractures. Occipital condyles fractures are relatively uncommon; they result from either compressive or distracting (tensile loading) forces applied to the head Those fractures are usually described allowing to the Anderson and Montesano classification type 1: comminuted fracture type 2: linear skull fracture involving the occipital condyle type 3: avulsion injury of the alar ligament Type 1 and 2 fractures generally occurred after a direct blunt compression to the head, while type 3 is commonly seen after tensile loading (distraction) [ C0 If MR can directly demonstrate ligament injuries, radiographic or CT diagnosis of C0-C1 dislocation can be difficult. The diagnosis often relies on index or dimension changes [ The most commonly used methods for the diagnosis of C0-C1 dislocation are: Power’s ratio “Harris rule of 12” [ The “Harris rule” is recommended over the Power’s ratio by the Spine Trauma Study Group basion/posterior axial line basion/odontoid Using CT, some authors recommend to lower the threshold to 9 mm Depending on the position of the head relative to the spine, dislocations can be classified as anterior (type 1) ( vertical (type 2) ( posterior (type 3) Compression fractures of C1, also known as Jefferson fractures, are in the vast majority due to axial loading Anterior and posterior rings can break in one or two sites resulting in different combinations, the most recognizable being ( lateral mass fractures anterior arch fractures posterior arch fractures burst fractures Burst and lateral mass fractures can be associated with tears of the TL, leading to a high instability with an increase lateral spreading of bone fragments. This leads to an lateral displacement of C1 lateral mass relative to C2 body, this displacement being abnormal when over 7 mm for both sides ( On the coronal plane, the interval between the odontoid and C1 lateral masses can be asymmetric Deficiency of the transverse ligament allows a dorsal displacement of the odontoid, with a potential compression of the spinal cord ( In summary, deficiency of the transverse ligament can be suspected in the cases of: C1 lateral masses displacement > 7 mm fragments from ligament avulsion ( increased atlantodens interval (ADI) ( Nevertheless, one should keep in mind that: a transverse ligament injury may occur without C1 arch disruption a C1 burst fracture with TL disruption may not be associated with significant LMD on CT examination, as in prone position, the weight of the head is no more transmitted to the CCJ. A horizontal fracture at the level of the inferior aspect of the anterior C1 arch is a rare injury, presumably due to the avulsion of the anterior tubercle by the anterior longitudinal ligament or longus coli muscle ( As the head rotates, the angular relationship between C1 and C2 increases (C1 rotates respectively more than C2) and this produces a physiologic subluxation of C1–C2 facets [ In normal conditions: the interval between the posterior aspect of C1 anterior arch and the anterior aspect of the odontoid (atlanto-dens interval, ADI) is lower than 3 mm [ the interval between the posterior aspect of the odontoid and the anterior aspect of C1 posterior arch (posterior atlantodens interval, PADI; or space available for the cord, SAC) is greater than 13 mm ( A rotational motion is generally involved in C1/C2 injury (atlanto-axial rotatory subluxation or AARS), a vertical distraction being more rare AARS will occur when restraining ligaments (TL, AL, facet capsules) are injured But, as the normal C1/C2 range of motion is particularly wide, the key finding that differentiates AARS from normal cervical motion is the impossibility to return to a normal head position [ AARS are generally described using the Fielding and Hawkins classification [ type 1: the most common, unilateral facet subluxation with intact TL. The pivot is the odontoid, no displacement occurs between the anterior arch of C1 and the odontoid. One facet subluxates anteriorly, and the other posteriorly ( type 2: unilateral facet subluxation with transverse ligament injury (ADI 3–5 mm). One facet acts as pivot, and the other one facet subluxates ( type 3: bilateral anterior facet displacement (ADI > 5 mm). type 4: Posterior displacement with odontoid deficiency (fracture or hypoplasia) Therefore, signs suggestive of C1-C2 instability are: lateral overhang of C1 on C2 in excess of 7 mm, unilateral rotation of C1–C2 of more than 45°, atlanto–dens interval (ADI) greater than 3 mm, space available for the cord (PADI, SAC) less than 13 mm. Fractures of C2 can be basically subdivided into odontoid, arch (hangman’s fractures) and body fractures ( Odontoid fractures are the most frequent C2 fractures Anderson and D’Alonzo presented a classification system that has become universally accepted ( Fractures are classified into three types based upon the level of the fracture line ( type 1: an oblique fracture through the upper part of the odontoid, probably an alar ligament avulsion. type 2: at the junction of the odontoid and the body of the axis ( type 3: fracture line that extends into C2 body or lateral mass ( As for the lower cervical spine, prevertebral soft tissue swelling is an important clue to suspect odontoid fracture In children, odontoid fractures are quite uncommon, and occur generally at the level of the synchondrosis between the odontoid and the body of C2 [ A common pitfall is the presence of the The “hangman’s” fracture is as bilateral fracture traversing the pars interarticularis of C2 (traumatic spondylolisthesis), with an associated traumatic subluxation of C2 on C3 Depending on the degree of this subluxation, four fracture pattern types were described [ type 1: fractures with no fracture angulation and <3 mm of displacement ( type 2: fractures with C2–C3 translation > 3 mm and fracture angulation ( type 2A: fractures with slight or no translation, but severe fracture angulation. type 3: fractures with severe fracture angulation and displacement, and associated unilateral or bilateral facet dislocation ( Isolated fractures of C2 body are much less common that odontoid and hangman’s fractures. As hangman’s fractures, they are secondary to head hyperextension A particular type of fracture is the avulsion of the antero-inferior corner of C2, realizing a “extension tear-drop” of C2 [
