In recent years, the issue of safe production of tailing ponds has become a common social problem facing China. Safe operation of the tailings dam is one of the main issues to ensure safety of the lives and properties as well as social stability in the areas where the tailing ponds are located. On the basis of the structure of the tailing ponds on-line monitoring system, this paper systematically studied the dam displacement GPS on-line monitoring method and the vibrating wire type saturation line on-line monitoring method with regard to the technical indicators for the dam displacement and saturation line that should be observed for tailing ponds rated at Class IV or higher, and come up with the structure and fulfilling means for the on-line monitoring system of these two indicators. This paper also studied the basic functions and data flow that the on-line monitoring system of an enterprise should have. The aforesaid achievements may be used as a basis for China's metal and non-metal mining enterprises to install the tailings dam online monitoring systems.
