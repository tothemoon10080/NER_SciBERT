SUMMARY
               The main reason for failure of hemiarthroplasty for fracture is failure of the tuberosity healing leading the rotator cuff functionally deficient. Thus, it appears logical to use the reverse prosthesis in acute fracture of the elderly patients in order to improve mobility despite lack of tuberosity healing. However, tuberosity healing is actually needed to restore active external rotation, even for the reverse prosthesis. The purpose of this article is to report a specific surgical technique of the reverse for fracture and to analyse the previous published series. Considering the short follow-up and the risk of complications, the reverse prosthesis should be indicated only for fractures in elderly patients who present local and general risk factors for bad results by using an hemiarthroplasty.
