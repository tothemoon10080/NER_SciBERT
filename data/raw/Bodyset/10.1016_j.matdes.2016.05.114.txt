The effect of friction stir processing (FSP) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a semi-solid cast AA2024-1wt%Al2O3 nanocomposite was investigated. For comparison, plates of unreinforced AA2024 alloy were also cast and processed at the same FSP conditions (400rpm, 20mm/min). The microstructure of all the produced materials was investigated using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). Microhardness and tensile tests were carried out on the unreinforced AA2024 alloy and AA2024-Al2O3 nanocomposite before and after FSP. The addition of 1wt% of Al2O3 nanoparticles significantly reduced the grain size of both the cast and FSPed microstructures, leading to a grain size reduction from 28μm to 18μm in the cast condition, and from 3.7μm to 2.3μm after FSP. The application of FSP to AA2024-Al2O3 nanocomposite enhanced the tensile strength and yield strength by 71% and 30%, respectively, in comparison to the as cast matrix, as a result of the uniform distribution of Al2O3 reinforcement and grain refinement of Al matrix. The combined application of compocasting and FSP resulted to be a promising method to treat casting defects and to produce nanocomposites characterised by good reinforcement dispersion and high strength and ductility.Aluminum matrix nanocomposites (Al-MNCs), characterised by reinforcing particles smaller than 100 Liquid state processing of Al-based nanocomposites is strongly limited by the low wettability of ceramic nanoparticles into the molten metal; as a result, although they would enable the production of complex shape parts, traditional liquid routes such as casting are usually associated with particle clustering, high amounts of casting defects related to the addition of nanoparticles and particle segregation induced by the different specific gravity of the matrix and reinforcement Semisolid casting has been proposed as a possible production route to overcome such problems, by improving nanoparticle wettability due to the higher viscosity of the semi-solid matrix in comparison to the liquid state, which would also help facilitating the mechanical entrapment of the reinforcing phase Al-based composites reinforced with Al Al based nanocomposites have also been investigated as surface materials, aiming to exploit their mechanical properties and hardness to produce components with superior wear resistance. For this purpose, secondary processes are currently being investigated to obtain an even distribution of particles, usually difficult to be achieved by conventional surface treatments Developing new routes for the manufacturing of metal matrix composites (MMCs) is of considerable importance. These new routes are based on the combination of the conventional liquid state techniques and friction stir processing The present study is intended to investigate the possibility to produce a AA2024-based composite containing Al AA2024-Al The compocasting process for the unreinforced matrix alloy and its nanocomposite plates was carried out in a furnace designed for this work. The apparatus consists of a lift out graphite crucible with a maximum capacity of 500 Friction Stir Processing (FSP) was then applied to the cast plates of the unreinforced alloy and nanocomposite. A H13 steel tool was used for sample processing (dimensions of the cylindrical tool: pin diameter 6 For microstructural analyses, samples were cross sectioned perpendicular to the processing direction and polished according to the standard techniques for examination by optical microscopy (OM), multifocal microscopy (MM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) systems. After final mechanical polishing, all the samples were etched with Keller's etchant to be examined by OM, MM and SEM. Samples for EBSD analyses were electro-polished with a solution of 30% nitric acid in methanol for 20 Density of the produced materials was determined, based on Archimedes' principle through an analytical balance (precision  Optical micrographs of the as-cast unreinforced alloy and nanocomposite are shown in Macrographs of the FSPed unreinforced alloy and nanocomposite are showed in It can be observed that FSP significantly reduced the content of porosities associated with Al  SEM-EDS images of the FSPed samples are presented in Aiming to compare the grain structure before and after FSP, EBSD maps were acquired using 1 FSP, as a severe plastic deformation process, resulted in significant grain refining in the NZ. It has been reported that the mechanism of grains formation during FSP is mainly continuous and geometric dynamic recrystallization  Tensile tests and microhardness profiles were carried out on specimens of the unreinforced alloy and nanocomposite, both in the as-cast condition and after friction stir processing. Microhardness profiles of the FSPed unreinforced alloy and nanocomposite are illustrated in The higher hardness in the NZ and TMAZ observed in the 0.5 and 2.5 The NZ of the FSPed material shows low hardness data scatter; only in the TMAZ were some peaks registered, which is likely to be due to different local amount of plastic deformation and/or nano-reinforcement distribution. No significant hardness increase compared to the as-cast condition was seen in the deepest profile from the FSPed surface (i.e. 5 The results of tensile tests on the investigated materials are presented in After FSP, a noticeable enhancement of tensile properties in terms of YS (+ FSP applied to the nanocomposite led to an increase in both YS and UTS, with a more consistent enhancement of UTS, in comparison to the FSPed unreinforced alloy ( Multifocal and SEM images of fracture surfaces of the as-cast and the FSPed materials after tensile testing are presented in Al Some oxide films were still present on the fracture surface of FSPed samples ( In this research, the feasibility of adding nano-sized Al AA2024 Al alloy based composite containing Al The addition of 1 The application of FSP to the unreinforced alloy induced a noticeable increase in hardness, tensile strength (+ In comparison to the as cast AA2024 alloy, UTS and YS of AA2024-1wt%Al AA2024-Al Compocasting technique and subsequent FSP was proved to be a promising method to treat casting defects in terms of porosity and shrinkage cavities and also to produce surface nanocomposites characterised by good dispersion of reinforcement and high levels of strength and ductility.
