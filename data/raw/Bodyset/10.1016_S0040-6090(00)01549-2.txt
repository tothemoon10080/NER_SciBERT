SrBi2.4Ta2O9 (SBT) thin films of 70–400 nm thickness were prepared on platinized Si substrates by liquid-source misted chemical deposition (LSMCD), and the thickness dependence of the ferroelectric characteristics was investigated. The grain size of the LSMCD-derived SBT films was approximately 150 nm and hardly varied with the film thickness. The 70-nm thick SBT film exhibited remanent polarization (2P
                     r) of 13.5 μC/cm2 and a coercive field value (Ec) of 63 kV/cm at ±3 V. Within the thickness range of 70–400 nm, the LSMCD-derived SBT films exhibited size effects, i.e. a decrease in remanent polarization and relative permittivity and an increase in the coercive field with a reduction in the film thickness. The LSMCD-derived SBT films with a thickness of 70–400 nm exhibited fatigue-free behavior for up to 1012 switching cycles.Ferroelectric thin films have been extensively investigated for use in non-volatile memory due to their electrically switchable remanent polarization To achieve the high density and low power consumption required for FRAM devices, a thickness reduction of the ferroelectric thin films is required. For Pb(Zr,Ti)O In this study, SrBi As bismuth volatility occurs during the annealing process of SrBi Pt/Ti/SiO The crystalline phase of the LSMCD-derived SBT films was characterized using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and the microstructure of the films was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Remanent polarization and the coercive field of the SBT films were characterized by an RT66A ferroelectric tester, and a fatigue test for up to 10   As shown in In In For ferroelectric thin films of the perovskite structure, such as PZT, the decrement in ε The fatigue behavior of the LSMCD-derived SBT films at ±400 kV/cm is illustrated in Ferroelectric SBT films with well-saturated ferroelectric hysteresis curves could be successfully fabricated using the LSMCD process. The 70-nm thick SBT film exhibited remanent polarization (2 This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (Project No.: 981-0806-037-2).
