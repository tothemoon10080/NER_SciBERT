TheMSAC(modifiedsilica-aluminum-carbon)was used as a new type reinforced filler of the ENR (the epoxidation national rubber). It was made from coal shale by cracking, comminuting and modifying of a compiling agent. The influence factor about the reinforced mechanical of the MSAC was discussed. The effects of the MSAC content changing on the theology and curing behavior of the ENR vulcanizes were investigated. The result showed MSAC can be as a reinforced filler of the ENR The MSAC can replace the clay or part replace carbon-black used as the reinforced filler of the ENR. It can replace the clay or part replace common carbon-black, the replace content is about 50%.
