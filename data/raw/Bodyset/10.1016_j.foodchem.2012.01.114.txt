In the presented work, an insight was made into the polyphenolic composition of intact plant material and in vitro cultures of indigenous South African plant Cyclopia subternata Vogel (honeybush). Ethyl acetate fractions of methanol extracts were separated by means of gravity column chromatography and/or semipreparative HPLC on two serially connected monolithic RP-18 columns. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by means of 1D and 2D NMR techniques and additionally confirmed by LC-DAD-ESI-MS. Apart from the previously described honeybush components, that is mangiferin (1), scolymoside (2), hesperidin (3) and narirutin (4), three additional compounds: iriflophenone 3-C-β-glucoside (benzophenone) (5), phloretin 3′,5′-di-C-β-glucoside (dihydrochalcone) (6), and isorhoifolin (flavone) (7) were identified for the first time in the herb of C. subternata. Additionally, three isoflavone glucosides, namely calycosin 7-O-β-glucoside (8), rothindin (9) and ononin (10), which had not been previously reported in Cyclopia plants, were identified in the callus of the above species. As far as the authors are concerned, this is the first report on the presence of benzophenone and dihydrochalcone derivatives in Cyclopia genus.The shrubs from The species of particular interest is Thus, the aim of the presented work was to isolate and identify the yet unknown constituents of Another goal of the study was to investigate the phenolic composition of the previously obtained The solvents used for extract preparation and column chromatography were from POCH (Gliwice, Poland). Water for preparative purposes was obtained by means of double-distillation (REL-5 double water still, POLNA, Przemysl, Poland). Acetonitrile for semi-preparative HPLC was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Water for LC–MS and LC–DAD analyses was obtained with the use of DirectQ3 water purification system (Millipore, Billerica, MA), whereas acetonitrile and formic acid were from Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). The solvents used in NMR experiments were from Deutero, Kastellaun, Germany (DMSO- The non-fermented (“green”) For extract preparation, 200-g portions of intact plant material (stems and leaves, dried after comminution, particle size <2.0 The semi-preparative HPLC system used in isolation procedures consisted of two L-7100 pumps (Merck Hitachi, Darmstadt, Germany), Jetstream 2 Plus column oven (WO Industrial Electronics, Langenzersdorf, Austria), variable wavelength monitor with V7566 interface (Knauer, Berlin, Germany) and injector valve (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA). The compounds were separated on two 100 Fraction 1a (two compounds) was dissolved in 16.5% ( Fraction 1 was diluted 5 times with double-distilled water and subjected to semi-preparative gradient HPLC (mobile phase Fraction 2 was chromatographed under isocratic conditions (chloroform:methanol 95:5 The HPLC system used (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisted of SIL-20AC autosampler (24 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded with the use of Varian Unity Plus 500 (500        Fraction 1 (intact plant) was shown to contain a rich composition of polyphenolic compounds ( Fraction 2, obtained from callus, differed significantly from the herb extract (fraction 1) in terms of phenolic composition ( Fraction 1a consisted of two compounds, Ten compounds of polyphenolic nature were isolated from intact plant and callus of For the isolation of the individual compounds from fraction 1 (herb extract) and 1a (precipitate), the mixtures were separated by semi-preparative liquid chromatography. Due to the complexity of the Considering the above described features, it seems that monolithic columns are a useful tool for separation and isolation of compounds from complex plant matrices on a semi-preparative scale. Moreover, modern monolithic beds provide excellent performance without the need to use a dedicated preparative LC system. However, semi-preparative RP-18 monolithic columns allowing high mass loading entered the market only a few years ago and limited data are available concerning their use for the isolation of plant secondary metabolites ( Given the above, it was decided to separate the examined The presence of impurities deriving from The respective compounds were identified with the use of The comparison of LC–DAD and LC–MS spectra of The spectral characteristics of The obtained compound exhibited a UV spectrum similar to that of flavanones and was probably a The presence of this dihydrochalcone in the herb of LC–DAD analysis showed that The UV spectra of In the current study, several phenolic derivatives were isolated from the herb and callus of This study was supported by Grant No.
