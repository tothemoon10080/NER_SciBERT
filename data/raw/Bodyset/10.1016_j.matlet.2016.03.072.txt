2,2′-biquinoline-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (BQCOOH) exhibits interesting photoluminescence and electroluminescence properties, which have motivated the development of BQCOOH films. Electrophoretic deposition method (EPD) has been developed for anodic deposition of BQCOOH. The film microstructure was governed by electrode reactions, nucleation and growth rates, and interactions of BQCOOH molecules. BQCOOH was used as a film-forming dispersant for EPD of inorganic materials such as huntite, ZnO and TiO2. The strong adsorption of BQCOOH on the inorganic particles resulted from chelating properties of BQCOOH. The results pave the way for the controlled EPD of films utilizing functional properties of BQCOOH and inorganic materials.EPD is an important technique for deposition of oxides One of the challenges in EPD technology is the development of strategies for the deposition of small functional organic molecules. BQCOOH and its derivatives are important organic molecules for various devices owing to their strong photoluminescence and electroluminescence properties The goal of this investigation was the EPD of BQCOOH films and application of BQCOOH for surface modification and EPD of inorganic particles, such as huntite, ZnO and TiO BQCOOH, ZnO, TiO The results of our investigation showed a feasibility of controlled EPD of BQCOOH films.  In another strategy, we utilized chelating and film forming properties of BQCOOH for the EPD of different inorganic materials, such as ZnO, TiO It was found that inorganic particles of different materials, such as ZnO, TiO EPD method has been developed for the deposition of BQCOOH films from BQCOOH solutions. The flower-like film microstructure is governed by the electrode reactions, nucleation and growth rates and interactions of the BQCOOH molecules. BQCOOH can be used as an efficient film-forming dispersant for the EPD of inorganic materials, such as huntite, ZnO and TiO The authors acknowledge
