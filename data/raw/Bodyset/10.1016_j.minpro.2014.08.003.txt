This paper discusses the systematic analysis of the results of calcination as a function of size fraction performed on a sample of Brazilian silicate–carbonate manganese ore tailing at 800°C. The raw materials and the corresponding calcination products were analysed using several analytical techniques, including determination of density, specific surface area and porosity, chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. The morphology and chemical composition of the calcination products were analysed by using scanning electronic microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDS). Results indicate that the manganese ore tailing consists of silicates, namely, spessartine (Mn3Al2(SiO4)3), tephroite (Mn2(SiO4)) and rhodonite ((Mn,Fe,Mg,Ca)5(SiO3)5) and rhodochrosite (MnCO3). The loss of CO2 and OH during the thermal decomposition of the carbonate (rhodochrosite and dolomite) and hydrated minerals (kaolinite, muscovite and antigorite) in air atmosphere at 800°C resulted in: (1) decrease of the specific surface area and porosity, (2) increase in the density and Mn grade from 27.6% to 32.2% and (3) increase in SiO2 grade from 26.7% to 30.1%. These results indicate that this material is within the chemical specifications of Fe–Si–Mn alloy.Of the worldwide consumption of manganese, 92% is directly related with the steel industry, given the fact that manganese imparts malleability, tenacity and hardness to steel. Besides, the non-ferrous applications of manganese include the production of dry-cell batteries, important component in plant fertilizer and animal feed, and as colourant for bricks ( The world's total resource of manganese is approximately 573.5 In principle, manganese ores are classified according to the Mn content as high grade (Mn Lately, the depletion of oxidised high-grade manganese ore and the rising market demand for manganese ore products have resulted in the exploitation of low-grade manganese ore (protores), such as the silicate–carbonate manganese ore of the Morro da Mina Mine located in the Minas Gerais State in Brazil. The main manganese minerals in this ore are silicate (spessartine, rhodonite, tephroite) and carbonate (rhodochrosite). The gangue minerals consist of dolomite, feldspar, muscovite, biotite/phlogopite, quartz, magnetite, zircon, pentlandite, pyrite/pyrrhotite and others (  The industrial beneficiation plant for silicate–carbonate manganese ore (queluzite) in the Minas Gerais State in Brazil is producing lump ore for Fe–Si–Mn alloys.
