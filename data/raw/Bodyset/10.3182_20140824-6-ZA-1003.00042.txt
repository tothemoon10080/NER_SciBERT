This paper presents a closed-form expression for the model-plant mismatch that may be present in a feedback control system. The main limitation on the expression is that the controller and plant models should be representable by means of transfer functions, i.e. they should be linear and time invariant. This includes a variety of controllers, among which the ubiquitous Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller. The expression can then be used to identify the true plant transfer function. The MPM expression is shown to work for single-input single-output as well as a multiple-input multiple-output systems.
