Palladium (Pd) is well known for its capability to selectively detect hydrogen (H2) gas, where the detection process involves absorbing hydrogen gas molecules to form compound palladium hydrides. Such Pdâ€“H interaction leads to the increase of electrical resistance and volume of Pd, simultaneously lowering its work function. These Pd-based hydrogen sensors would be more beneficial when connected to conventional semiconductor integrated circuits. Here, we utilize the Pd film as H-sensing electrode for metal/SiO2/p+-Si (MIM) capacitor, since we found the H-induced chain reactions in Pd/SiO2/p+-Si capacitor:Pd volume expansion, Pd-SiO2 contact are change, and the capacitance change. This capacitance change is connected to the gate of an electrically stable amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) thin-film transistor (TFT). As a result, H-induced output as the drain current of a-IGZO TFT was statically and dynamically measured through the capacitance signal change from Pd-MIM sensor. This output current signal was converted to voltage when a load resistor was connected to the a-IGZO TFT in series. These sensor circuit configurations are regarded promising and novel because of their simplicity and practicality.In recent years, hydrogen gas (H In order to fabricate the Pd-MIM type sensor, 50 In the next place, a 40 We fabricated the simple Pd/SiO The Pd-MIM type devices as hydrogen sensor were studied once by researchers but they only utilized the H-induced work function change in Pd, according to which their device form was Pd-SiO Based on the capacitance change of Pd-MIM sensor by H The smaller As a final experimentation, we constructed an inverter-type device to extract out a voltage ( We fabricated a H This research was supported by Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is the supplementary data to this article:
