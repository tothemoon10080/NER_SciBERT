The roasting in air of pellets consisting of copper–iron sulphides and limestone and activated limestone has been investigated to explore the possibility of developing a metal production process that eliminates sulphur dioxide gas emissions. The effects of pellet porosity, sulphide: limestone ratio, pellet sizes and temperature on reaction kinetics were investigated. Thermogravimetry was carried out under air atmosphere. The weight gain of pelletized samples was used to identify and study the phases present in the reaction products.
                  The experimental results indicated that at 500 °C using activated limestone, a completely reacted pellet can be produced in about 50 min with very low emissions of sulphur dioxide (more than 95% of sulphur capture).An alternative to conventional pyrometallurgical methods to solve the problem of high SO Following the observation that limestone reacts with SO Prior to studying the effect of activated limestone, roasting experiments of mineral copper concentrate were carried out with additions of limestone under fixed experimental conditions based on the reports by A series of runs using the same experimental apparatus and procedure as the one described by By increasing the porosity, the sulphur retention and reaction rate decrease. By adding water the reaction rate seem to decrease, inhibiting the SO Following the finding of  To confirm the extent of reaction XRD analysis were undertaken on the roast product of run 7 before and after a leach test. The analysis of the calcine indicated the presence of Fe No effect on the reaction rate (on a relative mass gain basis) was observed by decreasing or increasing the pellet size, but the reaction time as well as sulphur retention increases with increase in size. No noticeable effect on reaction rate was observed by varying temperature. However, a better sulphur retention was observed at higher temperature. As pointed out by The principal conclusion that can be drawn from the work described here is that, by an appropriate selection of roasting conditions, pellets of copper concentrate and activated limestone can be roasted in air to give a completely roasted product in about 40–50 min with very low emission of SO
