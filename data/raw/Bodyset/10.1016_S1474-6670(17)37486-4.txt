Process equipment manufacturers are looking for added value for their products by implementing intelligent automation. Fault diagnosis and remote support for process equipment increases safety and reduces maintenance time and repair costs. This paper presents the fault diagnosis module of the intelligent control system for the variable volume pressure filter. The fault diagnosis system works in parallel with the existing automation system. The system is capable of detecting faults in the process and equipment, indicates the undesired or forbidden process states and suggests the appropriate actions in order to maintain optimal operation. The experimental results of the fault diagnosis system for the filtration and pressing stages of the filter are presented and discussed.
