The paper presented focuses on the synchronous process of oxidation and stripping of vanadium from the loaded organic phase using H2O2. The results indicated that about 45% of vanadium could be released after the organic phase was contacted with the aqueous phase (initial pH=7.0) for 40s at room temperature when O/A=10/1 and nH2O2/nV2O5
                     =5/1, and a 97% vanadium stripping efficiency was achieved after a three-stage counter-current stripping process. Stripping experiments were carried out repeatedly to confirm that H2O2 had little effects on the performance of the organic phase. Precipitation of vanadium in the stripping solution was sequentially carried out. Results of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) for the precipitant indicated that hydrated ammonium vanadate was formed. Product V2O5 of high purity was obtained after the calcination of the precipitant.China is one of the major players in the global supply of vanadium, where V In the presented paper, a novel method of stripping vanadium from the organic phase was trialed, in which H The raw solution containing vanadium (VO In the presented work, H Another reaction would occur with the overdose of H The reaction would carry on in the solution where the pH Tentative experiments were initially carried out in which the extractability of these vanadium species by the stripped organic phase was investigated, because the extent to which vanadium was released into the aqueous phase after being oxidized by H The stripping of vanadium from the loaded organic phase from Yiyang city was also carried out in the separating funnel. The aqueous phase, containing various concentrations of H The influence of H The precipitation of vanadium in the stripping solution was another concern in the proposed methodology. The concentration of V The concentration of V As was shown in The effects of H It is clearly shown in The effects of contact time on vanadium stripping efficiency were investigated as shown in The vanadium stripping efficiency was initially increased but subsequently decreased with the contact time. The vanadium stripping efficiency was around 33% and then increased to 45% when the contact time was prolonged from 10  It is demonstrated in The effects of the initial pH value of the stripping solution on the vanadium stripping efficiency were of great importance in this study, as it would be the key factor to determine the necessity of the employment of alkaline substances in the precipitation step such as NH Experiments on the determination of stripping stages were carried out for the optimal vanadium stripping efficiency. The results are shown in It can be seen from The solvent extraction from the raw solution by the stripped organic phase and stripping of vanadium from the loaded organic phase were alternately and repeatedly conducted in order to determine the influences H The results showed that for 30 times of recycle, the performance of the organic phase on extracting vanadium from the aqueous phase was barely weakened, suggesting slight effects of H In the process of vanadium precipitation, as was expected, about 97% of vanadium was precipitated and as can be seen from It was evident that the vanadium pentoxide product had achieved high quality, conforming to the industry standards of China. In the presented work, H About 45% of vanadium could be released after the organic phase was contacted with the aqueous phase (initial pH The successful utilization of H The authors gratefully thank the
