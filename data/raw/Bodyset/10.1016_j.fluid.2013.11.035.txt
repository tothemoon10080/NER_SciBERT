A modified model with temperature-dependent parameters is proposed based on the Hoch–Arpshofen model. The enthalpies of formation of multicomponent liquid alloy systems were calculated using the modified model. Results for the Pb-Sn-Zn, Cd-Ga-Sn, Bi-Cd-Ga-Zn, Bi-Cd-Ga-In-Zn, Cd-Ga-In-Sn-Zn and Bi-Cd-Ga-In-Sn-Zn systems are in excellent agreement with experimental data and highly accurate than obtained via the original Hoch–Arpshofen model, which indicate that the method is reliable.The enthalpies of formation of liquid alloys are important for providing thermodynamic information in materials science and metallurgical engineering. A great deal of binary data has been so far compiled as monographs such as Hultgren et al. The Hoch–Arpshofen model was deduced from physical principles and is applicable to multicomponent systems The Hoch–Arpshofen model is an extension of Guggenheim's treatment of solutions combined with an adaptation of Pauling's ideas of the metallic bond  For a multicomponent solution ( From binary data gathered in In an earlier paper Let us assume that the pair-potential energy parameter in Eq. For example, the value of Substituting the corresponding Model performance was evaluated by the following parameters; the average relative error is given by From In order to verify the accuracy of the modified model, the enthalpies of formation of Cd-Ga-Sn, Bi-Cd-Ga-Zn, Bi-Cd-Ga-In-Zn, Cd-Ga-In-Pb-Sn-Zn and Bi-Cd-Ga-In-Pb-Sn-Zn systems are calculated by the modified Hoch-Arpshofen, and the obtained results are compared to the experimental data and the original Hoch–Arpshofen model In this work, Hoch–Arpshofen has been modified based on temperature-dependent parameters. The newly obtained parameters have predictive capabilities equivalent to, or better than, those of original parameters. The modified Hoch–Arpshofen model provides accurate prediction of the enthalpies of formation of multicomponent liquid alloys on the whole composition range. The predictive accuracy is much better than the original Hoch–Arpshofen model which indicates that the method is reliable. This research work is supported by the Fund of
