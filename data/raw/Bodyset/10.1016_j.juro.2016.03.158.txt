Lipkin   Abstract available at As the life expectancy of our flexible ureteroscopes becomes of increasing financial concern, any innovation that can decrease damage is welcome. For laser lithotripsy we are all aware that just the act of passing the laser fiber can damage the working channel. The authors evaluated inÂ vitro a novel ball tip holmium laser fiber developed to minimize working channel damage. In fact, fiber insertion force was much less than with standard flat tip fibers. Equally important, at various energy settings there were no differences in scope deflection, laser tip degradation or stone comminution. Clinical experience with this new fiber is needed.
