Whilst many efforts have been well documented on the readily available flotation surfactants, more kinds of newly-designed surfactants and auxiliary reagents for froth flotation process are still highly demanding. Herein we report the facile fabrication of a series of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS)-based froth flotation giant surfactants via two-step sequentially performed thiol-ene “click” reactions, with precisely-controlled chemical structures and tunable multisite surface functionality. The resulting giant surfactants performed high mineral recovery efficiency in the flotation testing of quartz, hematite and apatite in a broad range of pH conditions. We describe these POSS-based surfactant molecules in an initial proof-of-concept study and propose that this class of giant amphiphiles will be useful in flotation separation technique.Since early 20th century, froth flotation has been frequently used for the separation of solids encountered particularly in the primary mineral and chemical industries [ Giant surfactants describe an emerging class of amphiphilic molecules which capture the structural features of small molecular surfactants at larger sizes of several nanometers [ Among them, POSS-based giant surfactants have been attracting considerable research interests during the recent years. POSS probably are the smallest shape-persistent silsesquioxane nanoparticles with cage diameter around only 1.0 nm. The large surface area and readily diverse surface chemistry of POSS cage [ In this work, we report our first effort on the design and fabrication of a series of POSS-based giant surfactants as novel and efficient froth flotation agents for mineral recovery ( Inspired by the traditional small molecular surfactant flotation agent categories, three kinds of alkyl chains with distinct lengths (C The complete functionalization is revealed by the vanish of vinyl groups on POSS cage in the resonance range of To evaluate the potentials of the resulting POSS-based giant surfactants in froth flotation area, NPOSS-C The filtered pulps of three minerals with NPOSS-C We further investigated the flotation responses of these minerals as a function of initial concentration of NPOSS-C Furthermore, the zeta potentials of those three kinds of mineral particles with and without NPOSS-C Finally, the FT-IR characterizations on apatite, hematite and quartz interacted with/without NPOSS-C In summary, we have successfully prepared a new class of POSS-based froth flotation giant surfactants with precisely-controlled chemical structures and tunable multisite surface functionality This work was supported by The following is the Supplementary data to this article: Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
