A proper characterization of upgrading results requires two material balance parameters, usually plotted as upgrading curves. It was presented in the paper that such pairs of separation result parameters have a certain degree of self-similarity defined as an extent to which one parameters is a part of the other. Some pairs of upgrading parameters have a significant degree of self-similarity. Upgrading curves based on such parameters are unsuitable for a simple statistical evaluation of separation results, especially when the determination coefficient R
                     2 is used for this purpose. This is so because the R
                     2 value can be as high as almost 1, even for highly scattered original data points. It results from comparison of nearly two identical parameters. It was shown in the paper that, for example, the upgrading curve relating the content of the considered component in concentrate less the content of the considered component in tailing and the content of the considered component in concentrate have the self-similarity approaching 99% on a 0 to 100% scale proposed in the paper. Other upgrading curves used in mineral processing have medium (between 50 and 60%) self-similarity, while the Fuerstenau plot, relating recovery of the useful component in concentrate and recovery of the remaining components in the tailing, has a relatively low self-similarity which changes with recovery from 0 to about 50%.During mineral processing operations the starting material, called the feed, consisting of two or more components, is split into two or more products. Even though a separation system is complex, it can always be considered in a practical way, that is as a feed consisting of one component and the rest while due to separation, two products, concentrate and tailing are created. For simplicity such a system will be considered in this work and the feed will be represented by symbol f, concentrate by c and tailing by t. The components of the system will be denoted as component A and the rest material as R or r. The system with the feed, concentrate and tailing has four material variables: mass of component A in the feed A proper plotting of the separation results for the considered system, especially for statistical considerations, should be based on original variables, for instance It is obvious that yield To assess the degree of self-similarity of parameters used for plotting upgrading curves, the parameter plotted on the y axis is split into a part identical with the parameter occupying the x axis and the rest, which represents the non-similar part: Evaluation of self-similarity of upgrading parameters and splitting upgrading parameters into the S and N parts is not a simple task. One of the possible approaches is to use a set of separation results which can be easily approximated with a one-fitting parameter formula. For the purpose of this work we used hypothetical separation results presented in In this work the self-similarity will be assessed by using a self-similarity index ( This upgrading curve relates two principal upgrading parameters considered in the so-called technological evaluation of separation results, which are the content of the considered component in the concentrate The equation relating both parameters of the Stepinski I upgrading curve, that is  The relations between Having the values of The Henry upgrading curve ( The relation between yield As before, yield The plot showing  The Halbich upgrading curve (   Both figures indicate that the axes of the Halbich curve, similarly to the Stepinski and Henry plots, are self-similar in about 50â€“60%. The Fuerstenau upgrading curve relates recovery of a component in a product with the same or another component in the same or the other product ( Recoveries Incorporation of these expressions into the approximating equation gives The plot, showing the upgrading line (  So far we have considered the upgrading plots having self-similarity equal to about 50% (Henry, Stepinski, Halbich) or less (Fuerstenau). No self-similarity occurs for plots involving directly masses of components in the separation products, while a full self-similarity occurs for the plots when comparing identical parameters such as for instance The According to Separation parameters, plotted as upgrading curves, relate quality and quantity parameters characterizing products of separation and contain a certain degree of self-similarity. It results from the fact that upgrading parameters, describing the results of separation, represent a combination of the contents of a considered component in the feed The self-similarity degree is very likely influenced by such parameters as the numerical values of data points and their extent of scattering. We expected, however, that the changes are not significant. This aspect of self-similarity of parameters used for evaluation of separation data requires further investigations. The self-similarities of all investigated in this paper upgrading curves are presented in fitting parameter of equation used for approximation of separation data name of considered component in feed or separation products mathematical function (absolute value) concentrate feed Hall's parameter upgrading index Hancock's parameter mass of component A in concentrate mass of component A in feed mass of component A in tailing mass of other-than-component A components (R) in concentrate mass of other-than-component A components (R) in feed mass of other-than-component A components (R) in tailing non-similar part rest material (other-than-component A components in feed or separation products) statistical determination coefficient similar part self-similarity index tailing Stepinski's parameter ( operational variables axis x in Cartesian plots axis y in Cartesian plots content of a component in feed content of a component in concentrate content of component A in concentrate yield yield of concentrate yield of tailing recovery recovery of component A in concentrate recovery of other-than-component A components in tailing content of a component in tailing Financial support by the
