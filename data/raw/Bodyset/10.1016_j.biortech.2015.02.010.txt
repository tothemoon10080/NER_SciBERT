The influence of visible light exposure on chalcopyrite bioleaching was investigated using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The results indicated, in both shake-flasks and aerated reactors with 8500-lux light, the dissolved Cu was 91.80% and 23.71% higher, respectively, than that in the controls without light. The catalytic effect was found to increase bioleaching to a certain limit, then plateaued as the initial chalcopyrite concentration increased from 2% to 4.5%. Thus a balanced mineral concentration is highly amenable to bioleaching via offering increased available active sites for light adsorption while eschewing mineral aggregation and screening effects. Using semiconducting chalcopyrite, the light facilitated the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ as metabolic substrates for A. 
                     ferrooxidans, leading to better biomass, lower pH and redox potential, which are conducive to chalcopyrite leaching. The light exposure on iron redox cycling was further confirmed by chemical leaching tests using Fe3+, which exhibited higher Fe2+ levels in the light-induced system.Chalcopyrite, the most abundant primary copper sulfide in the oxysphere, is the primary mineral source for copper extraction ( In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to the characterization of copper bioleaching, with focus on the bacterial leaching mechanisms ( Photocatalysis with semiconductors has been deeply researched over the past few decades (  The chalcopyrite concentrate used in the bioleaching experiments was obtained from Guangxi province (China). This ore was ground and sieved to a particle diameter of 43–74 All the experiments were undertaken in a constant temperature (30 The bioleaching experiments were conducted in 250 The supernatant was regularly withdrawn and analyzed for the dissolution of copper and iron using BCO spectrophotometry and byo-phenanthroline spectrophotography, respectively. A pH meter (PHS-3C) and a Pt electrode using a calomel electrode as a reference were employed to measure the pH and redox potential of the bioleaching solution. Luminous intensity was determined with TES-1330A digital light meter. The contribution of illumination of varying intensities to the bioleaching of chalcopyrite in aerated conditions was investigated. It can be seen in  The relationship between light intensity and redox potential is showed in Photocatalytic copper leaching involves the stimulation of semiconductor mineral by visible light, promoting the release of photoelectrons, interactions between microbes and ore grains, and the transfer of iron and copper from the mineral matrix to leaching solution, et al. Copper yield is greatly dependent upon the dispersion of the heterogeneous photocatalytic system, which was consisted of light, a semiconductor (chalcopyrite) and chemoautotrophic microbes ( The luminescent intensity’s influence over the rate of copper dissolution during bioleaching is shown in As shown in Changes in pH ( The influence of light intensity on redox potential is showed in A lot of researches on photocatalysis suggest that the photocatalytic activity of semiconducting minerals is mainly determined by light intensity, initial mineral concentration and the structural properties of semiconductors, namely particle size distribution, porosity, band gap and surface area (  According to the above studies on the contribution of light illumination to bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite incubated in aeration reactors and shake flasks, it is evident that the promotion of the cycle of iron in light treated system by For the analysis of composition changes, we selected representative chalcopyrite samples after 33 It was confirmed that jarosite is the most abundant product that accumulates during the mesophilic and thermophilic bioleaching of chalcopyrite ( Light-induced condition can accelerate copper bioleaching by This research was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
