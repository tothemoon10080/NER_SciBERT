Thin films of undoped and 0.1wt.% Ca-doped SnO2 with 30–60Å Pt layers deposited by ion beam sputtering and subsequent annealing at 500–700°C were fabricated to measure butane sensing characteristics such as sensitivity, humidity dependency, and long-term stability in the temperature range of 250–450°C. There are an optimal annealing temperature, operating temperature and Pt thickness for maximum butane sensitivity of the undoped, and Pt catalyzed sensors. Sensitivity enhancement by catalytic activities of the Pt films with a thickness equivalent to or less than 45Å was not remarkable. In the case of 0.1wt.% Ca-doped SnO2 sensors, the Pt catalysts had inverse effect on C4H10 sensitivity due to blocking role of free CaO surrounding SnO2 particles. The humidity dependencies of the 5000ppm C4H10 sensitivity for all the sensors are relatively large at low level of relative humidity. Ion-beam sputtered SnO2 film sensors with dense structure and single SnO2 phase exhibited excellent long-term stability for 90 days.Butane extensively used in outdoor cooking, residential heating and industry is an easily flammable and explosive hydrocarbon gas. Butane sensors require long-term stability rather than sensitivity since the gas is easily oxidized on the surface of SnO Except for the above dependencies, the long-term stabilities are also related to decrease in the amount of adsorbed oxygen (reduced gas conversion rate), degradation of catalytic activity, polymerization of a binder, and physical or chemical reactions with contaminated atmosphere such as high humidity conditions and existence of reactive gases.
