Hierarchical pagodas and monodispersed quasi-octahedrons of lead tungstate (PbWO4) have been controllably synthesized through an easy mineralization process of preformed PbWO4 suspension under natural conditions. The selective synthesis of PbWO4 pagodas and quasi-octahedrons is achieved in the absence or presence of mixed organic additive polyvinylpyrrolidone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy have been used to characterize the obtained PbWO4 products. It is demonstrated that the cooperative effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide is responsible for the morphological transformation of PbWO4 crystals from pagodas to quasi-octahedrons.Tungstate materials Recently, great efforts have been focused on the development of suitable synthetic route for preparing inorganic crystal with controllable morphology and architecture Previous works have demonstrated that a variety of organic modifier show significant effect in controlling the morphology of PbWO Pb(CH X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 0.05° 2  The PbWO The synthetic procedure for PbWO In the previous works, colorful morphologies of PbWO  On the other hand, although PbWO The specific effect of organic additive PVP and/or CTAB exerted over the crystallization of PbWO In summary, an easy solution approach has been developed for the controllable synthesis of unique hierarchical PbWO This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (20473059).
