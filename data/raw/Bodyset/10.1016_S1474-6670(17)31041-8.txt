The number of control loops used in industry is growing continuously and there are problems in keeping them well tuned. In addition to maintenance, there is also always a need to improve the performance. Since the number of personnel is being reduced, companies are using, to an ever-increasing extent, a range of remote expert services for control loop performance evaluation. In this paper a set of performance indices appropriate to process monitoring and assessment is presented, and the economical aspects of these indices are evaluated. The economical evaluation has been mainly carried out from the remote center point of view. Finally, two case studies from industry are described.
