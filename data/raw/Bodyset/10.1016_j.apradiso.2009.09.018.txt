The thermoluminescence technique is recommended by the European Committee for Standardization for the detection of irradiated food containing silicates as contaminants. In this work, the applicability of the thermoluminescence technique as a quantitative method to assess the original dose in irradiated oregano was studied; the additive-dose method was used, with reirradiation doses up to 600Gy. The proposed new procedure allows to clearly discriminate irradiated from unirradiated samples, even after one year storage, and it gives an acceptable estimation of the original dose; the overall modified procedure requires only one day to be completed.Among the industrial applications of ionizing radiation, the treatment of food for preservation purposes is a worldwide recognized tool, provided, among others, that proper identification methods are available and used. The thermoluminescence (TL) technique has been validated by the European Committee for Standardization ( We have already shown ( The method was applied to the silicates extracted from oregano samples soon after the radiation treatment (original dose: 2, 3, 5, 8 Dried leafs of unirradiated oregano ( The silicate minerals, present as surface contaminants, were isolated from oregano by means of a density gradient with a sodium polytungstate solution. The separated minerals (usually about 1 Oregano samples as a whole, as well as minerals transferred on disks, were irradiated under electronic equilibrium conditions with a All the glow curves (TL emission as a function of temperature) were recorded with an Harshaw 3500 TL reader and using the following instrumental setting, under pure nitrogen flush: voltage 500 For each recorded glow curve, the integrated TL signal was calculated as the sum of the counts recorded by the TL apparatus between 150 and 250 The additive-dose method ( In previous papers ( In a first set of experiments, the additive-dose procedure was applied to oregano originally irradiated at 1 The experimentally measured TL signals were fitted as a function of dose with the following mathematical functions, already used by other authors (  The same procedure was applied to a couple of samples irradiated at 1 The described procedure allows to obtain a gross estimate of the original dose in no less than four days. To make the procedure faster and easier, the thermoluminescence response of the silicates, both after their extraction and after each re-irradiation, was measured without the 50 This original procedure, without overnight storage, has been applied also to oregano originally irradiated at 1 Using the experimental procedure set up and described in this paper, the detection of the irradiated food cannot be performed according to the European protocol, since no irradiation at 1 The results obtained in this work allow to define a procedure, based on thermoluminescence technique, that, within one day, can distinguish irradiated from not irradiated spices, and can also give an acceptable estimation of the given dose in the sample (deviation <60%) with almost the same irradiation time required by the European protocol only for the identification. This new proposed procedure can be summarized in the following steps: Extraction of the silicates from the spice. Glow curve recording and measurement of the TL Irradiation of the silicates at 200 Evaluation of the TL ratio: TL If the TL ratio is lower than 0.90, the sample is not irradiated; if it is higher than 1.10, the original dose can be estimated with reirradiations at 400 and 600 This research was supported with a grant of the UniversitÃ  di Palermo and of Dottorato di Ricerca in Chimica Farmaceutica.
