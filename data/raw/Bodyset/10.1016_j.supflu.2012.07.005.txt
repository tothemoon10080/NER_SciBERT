Extraction with pressurized carbon dioxide was applied to recover polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from striped weakfish (Cynoscion striatus) wastes. Extraction yield was evaluated at temperatures from 30 to 60°C and pressures from 20 to 30MPa. Temperature and pressure of 30°C and 20MPa were selected to evaluate process kinetics. A scale-up was performed by keeping the ratio constant between solid mass and solvent flow rate. Mathematical models were applied to the extraction curves, and the broken and intact cell model provided good fits, being applied to multiple curves simultaneously. Manufacturing cost of the extraction was estimated, and an optimal extraction time was observed by the end of the convective period. Finally, the extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography, and over 20% of the oil was composed by PUFA, whose concentration increased with extraction time. Therefore, this work shows that pressurized CO2 extraction can obtain valuable compounds from fish residues.Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the omega-3 (n-3) and omega-6 (n-6) families have gained significant importance in the last decades, since their benefits to human health had been studied and demonstrated Since the fish intake is often low in societies of Western-style diet Striped weakfish ( The most used method to obtain oil from fish in industrial scale is hydraulic pressing. Nevertheless, the efficiency of such technique is limited to the lipid content of the material to be extracted, and, in general, lower yields are achieved from raw materials with a low lipid content. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has been receiving great attention as an alternative method, due to the advantages that it presents over conventional techniques, especially when carbon dioxide (CO Extraction of PUFA with sub and supercritical CO Based on the information summarized in this introduction, this work presents a study of the sub and supercritical CO The solvent used in sub and supercritical extractions was CO The raw material consisted of the residues from the manual filleting process of striped weakfish, formed by head, spine, viscera, skin and fins. Fish were caught at the coast of Santa Catarina state, in southern Brazil, and the residues were provided by the public market of Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. At the market the residues stayed at ambient temperature for about two hours, before being stored in a freezer at −18 Before extraction the frozen material was ground in a domestic blender in order to homogenize the fish wastes, and enhance the mass transfer surface. The ground material was then dried in an air circulation oven (DeLeo – A3CARF, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) for 10 Analyses of moisture and ash were performed according to AOAC techniques The Soxhlet method was selected as conventional extraction technique, using hexane as solvent, due to its non-polar characteristic, which is ideal for lipid extraction, and its current use in oil extraction by food industries The sub and supercritical CO The experiments to determine The kinetic experiments were performed in a dynamic extraction unit (Applied Separations, Spe-ed, Allentown, PA) at the optimal conditions selected through the previous step. In these experiments extraction curves were obtained by determining the accumulated extract mass as function of time. Approximately 5.5 The large scale CO Mathematical models were applied to the experimental curves in order to define the most important mass transfer mechanisms of the sub and supercritical CO Some process data are needed to apply the models, such as The models were adjusted to experimental data using a derivative-free algorithm that establishes lower and upper limits for each parameter The manufacturing cost estimation of pressurized CO The extraction unit considered in this study is composed of two extraction columns, a series of flash tanks for the fractionation of the extract, a CO The total operational labor (COL) in terms of man-hour per operation hour was estimated using the tables presented by Ulrich In a SFE process, the only accumulated waste is the exhausted solid. In the case of pressurized CO The utility cost (CUT) was estimated considering the energy involved in the cycle using the pure CO The raw material cost (CRM) it is considered as the price of all materials that are directly related to the production. In a SFE process, the raw material are the solid substrate particles that contain the solute of interest, all the cost of the pre-processing required to prepare the material for extraction (drying, comminution, cleaning, classification, etc.) and de CO The process data used for cost estimation were: Initial investment: (estimated by the Chilton rule US$ 2,000,000.00: two 2 US 1,150,000.00: two 2 total yearly operation time – 24 labor cost: US$ 10.08/h raw material price: zero, since it is a residue from fishery; transport cost: zero, considering that the extraction unit belongs to the fish processing industry; initial and final moistures: 71.9% and 5.2%; milling and drying costs: US$ 30.00/ton CO CO electric cost: US$ 0.107/Mcal water chilling and saturated vapor costs: US$ 0.0837/Mcal and 0.0133/Mcal depreciation: 10%/year operational temperature and pressure: 30 separation pressure: 4 CO waste treatment cost: zero. Using the data listed above, the manufacturing cost was calculated using the software Tecanalysis The fatty acids of the extracted lipids were converted into fatty acids methyl esters by the method of Hartman and Lago Quantification (in mg fatty acid/g of total lipids) was made against tricosanoic acid methyl ester as an internal standard (23:0), as described by Joseph and Ackman The fatty acid profile and quantification was determined for the extracts obtained by Soxhlet and by CO The results were statistically evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), applied using the Software Statistica for Windows 6.0 (Statsoft Inc., USA) in order to detect significant differences in The proximate composition (%) of the dried waste used in the extractions was: moisture: 5.2 Soxhlet extraction achieved a yield of 17.6 As can be observed in An analysis of variance (ANOVA) ( The positive effect of pressure is explained by the increase of solvent density, which enhances its solvation power. Temperature may have positive effects on Some works define optimal conditions for SFE of fish oils, such as temperatures of 40 The kinetic pressurized CO  The observation of The model based on Fick's law presented poor fits to experimental data, as observed in  Although can be observed, in In the scale-up of pressurized CO The calculations of the cost of manufacturing are based on a scale-up prediction from the subcritical CO  According to Rosa and Meireles The variation of the specific manufacturing cost is also plotted in It can be noticed in The main fatty acids of the extracts obtained by Soxhlet and pressurized CO It is important to remark that, as well as global yield, the absence of difference in pressurized CO The fatty acid profile was also evaluated as function of extraction time for the chosen pressure and temperature, with a CO A significant increase of DHA content can be observed with time, since its concentration varied from 12.9 to 18.11%. Concerning EPA, significant differences in concentration were not detected. These results agree with those obtained by Létisse et al. Supercritical CO The study of the extraction kinetics has shown that the process is limited by intraparticle diffusion, and the most representative mass transfer mechanism is convection in the fluid phase that appears at the constant extraction rate initial period. The values of fluid and solid phase mass transfer coefficients corroborate this observation. The broken and intact cell model of Sovová fits well to experimental data, and through correlations between data of different curves the physical meaning of the model parameters can be reinforced. Concerning scale-up, a five-time increase was able to reproduce a similar extraction curve when the ratio between CO The extracts obtained by pressurized CO The authors wish to thank
