This article focusses on the control loop performance diagnosis of a multivariate system with emphasis on the presence of interactions and poor performance of control loops. The paper provides a data-driven technique to determine if a decentralized PI(D)+ controller will suffice or if an advanced controller (e.g., MPC) is necessary to handle the control interactions and improve the loop performance. Two different techniques are proposed: the first one, based on the Power Spectrum of the error, analyzes interactions in the frequency domain, while the second one, based on the evaluation of a modified IAE (Integral of Absolute Error), analyzes interactions in the time domain. A performance index for the controller is also proposed for the case of set-point tracking. Simulation and experimental case studies are presented to highlight the applicability of the proposed techniques.
