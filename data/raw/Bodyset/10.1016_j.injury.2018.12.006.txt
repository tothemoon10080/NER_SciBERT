We have read the article - Classification of tibia plateau fracture according to the “four-column and nine-segment” by Xiang Yao, Yong Xu, Jishan Yuan, Lei Wang, Xingli Fu, Bin Lv, Shengquan Yang, Sheng Meng. Injury.2018 (in press), with great interest [ The classification is based on a very well described “four columns and nine segments” concept. However, there are occasions when a single fracture line traverses through one or more segments of same or different columns ( Although authors have described comminution as a classifying parameter in intermediate column, it has not been included for the medial and lateral columnar segments. We frequently encounter medial and lateral column injuries with coronal split without any comminution, dividing them into simple anterior and posterior segments. However these fractures are far simple to treat than those with extensive comminution of the involved segments. Sometimes, we encounter fractures which extend from intermediate column to either medial or lateral cortices and occasionally, both the cortices, with intact cartilage bearing columns. We also feel that an additional parameter stating non displaced or displaced nature of segments would add more information to the fracture classification and convey the fracture pattern in a better way. None of the authors have any conflict of interest to declare.
