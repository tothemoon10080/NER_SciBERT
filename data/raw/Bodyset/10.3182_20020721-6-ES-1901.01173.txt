A study to develop a fault diagnosis system in the pneumatic injection of copper concentrate into a Teniente Converter at Caletones Smelter, Chile, is presented. The availability of the injection system must be improved at least in 2% to satisfy the actual production demands. The most frequent operating failure were pump pressurization and pump overcharge. However, most of the problems were due to disturbances propagation either from the reactor or silo operation. A research to identify and remedy the main causes of operating failures leaded to modify the control and supervising system and to introduce changes in the plant layout.
