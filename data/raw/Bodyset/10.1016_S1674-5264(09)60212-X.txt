Although pressure cells have been produced and installed successfully for decades, the accuracy of measured pressure is often inadequate. Due to large differences between the stiffness of pressure cells and the surrounding media, there is a considerable difference between applied pressure and that measured from pressure cells. It is often difficult and expensive to make a pressure cell with stiffness (modulus of elasticity) similar to the surrounding material in which it will be embedded. In order to improve this situation, a casing material with proportional dimensions is recommended as a means to obtain reliable results. In our study, the effect of using casing in the installation of pressure cells is investigated, providing the characteristics of casing. Some practical recommendations are presented to improve the accuracy of the results using casing.
