Performance measurements of seven different types of block cutters were applied to six different carbonate rocks and three stone processing plants. Energy consumption of large diameter circular diamond saw block cutters was measured and recorded for a number of sawblade diameters during the cutting process by means of a portable power analyzer. Additionally, rock samples were collected from stone processing plants for laboratory tests. Uniaxial compressive strength, bending strength, Brazilian tensile strength, point load strength, Shore hardness test, Schmidt hammer hardness test, seismic velocity, water absorption at atmospheric pressure, apparent density, open porosity, sawblade diameter, and depth of cut values were used as input parameters in the analysis for the prediction of SE

                      values for carbonate rocks in the stone cutting process can be predicted successfully for large diameter circular saws in natural stone processing by using the model developed here.The prediction of the sawability of natural stones is very important in cost analysis and production planning. Due to the increase in the use of natural stone and the increase in the competition among the manufacturers in the field, studies on the improvement of productivity and costs by optimizing various operational parameters in the process of cutting became more important. For this reason, the sawing parameters of the stones to be cut with block cutters are important in terms of monitoring the sawing performance. Determining the proper parameters for the physico-mechanical and mineralogical–petrographical characteristics of the rock to be cut plays an important role in cost analysis, production planning, product quality, and the selection of an appropriate machine-equipment for the stone to be cut. There are a number of studies in the related literature focusing on the circular diamond saws in stone sawing process. The early studies of Büttner Previous studies were those performed under similar conditions in the laboratory. This study included in-situ measurement in stone processing plants from different regions in Turkey for the prediction of  Due to the lack of industrial data in the literature, for natural stone cutting processes, this study aims at investigating the relationship between the industrial Block cutters are used in stone sawing process in order to obtain thick slices or plates from stone blocks. A block cutter consists of a large-size blade (diameter 1000–3000 In general, there are two types of block cutters based on the number of the columns in the main carrier system namely two-column and four-column. The sawability of various stones and its influence on the blade life of the sawing parameters are quite important in stone processing. In circular sawing, the blade turns in a stable direction, and the diamond particles and matrix wear in a certain direction with the blade–stone touch. As a result of the wear, the parameters that determine the relationships between the amount of the stone cut and segment consumption are generally those influencing the sawing performance. It is quite important to optimize the sawing process and the life of the sawblade due to the quantity of the material cut. The life of the sawblade can be increased by optimizing the wear behavior of the sawblade and the process parameters. This way, the high cost of the sawblade can be reduced There are collateral factors affecting the performance of block cutters and the life of a sawblade regardless of the choice of diamond and the matrix. There could be a general approach towards the sawing performance, which is a combination of a number of controllable and uncontrollable factors. In this respect, the diamond particle and the matrix structure are ignored as secondary factors; thus, the most important factors influencing the sawing performance and the life of the sawblade are as follows: cutting mode, cutting rate, blade design, cooling efficiency, workpiece properties, sawing conditions, machine conditions, and the operator's skills The present study was carried out on modeling the sawability of carbonate rocks merchandised in Turkey and in the World and cut by using large diameter circular saws on the block cutters as well as on seven different natural stones from five different locations in Turkey in three different stone processing plants. The technical features of the block cutters used in the study are presented in The data and sample collection phase of the study in the stone processing plants included five parts: the electrical data obtained from the electrical panel of the block cutters, the data obtained from the diamond segmented circular sawblade of the block cutters, the time measures and the data obtained from the block during and at the end of sawing, the Schmidt hammer rebound number data obtained from the cut block and sample preparation from sawing rocks. In this study, the KYORITSU 6300 Model digital powermeter is located on the power line that transfers electric to the block cutter vertical sawing disk in the block cutters' electrical panel. During the time the block cutter is cut along the block, the data were obtained in the course of the cutting with clamp sensors and voltage test leads during 3 or 4 cuts. Electrical parameters in the cutting process such as the power, current, and voltage that passed through each phase were recorded for analysis with computer by using the digital powermeter. The sawblade diameter ( Cutting length, cutting depth, the cutting channel width (a total of 40 measurements were made at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the cutting process), and the time spent on each cut were measured and recorded in order to calculate the The Schmidt hammer hardness measures were recorded from each block with the help of an N-Type Schmidt hammer. Twenty-five cubic samples with the dimensions of 70×70×70 The samples prepared were transported to the laboratories, where the experiments would be conducted, and the physico-mechanical features and mineralogical–petrographical definitions were determined. It is quite important to know the properties of a material cut for several reasons such as choosing an appropriate machine, equipment and sawblade. Therefore, it is necessary to define the properties of stones to be cut. A variety of sawblades can be used in practice for rock groups with different properties. The mineralogical–petrographical and physico-mechanical properties of the rock samples chosen for this purpose were determined through laboratory investigation and were intended to be associated with the sawability properties. The mineralogical–petrographical definitions of the rocks, whose trade names are known among thin section samples prepared for each rock sample, were provided. As for the method of analysis, the model analysis method was applied, and the rocks were classified according to Folk's classification In this study, several physico-mechanical properties used in natural stone definition in literature were determined (see Uniaxial compression tests were performed on cubic samples, which had a dimension of 70 50 The point load strength test is intended as an index test for the strength classification of rock materials. Specimens used for point load strength are NX size drill core samples in 1:2 length/diameter ratios. The tests were carried out according to ISRM Bending strength tests were carried out according to the TS EN 12372 Turkish Standard The C-2 model Shore hardness test device was used in order to determine Shore hardness values of rock samples. The tests were carried out according to the ISRM Schmidt hammer rebound tests were applied on the rock blocks having different dimensions varying between 2–6 The mean values of the P-wave velocity were obtained by averaging three measurements of the transit time recorded during the test. After measuring the sample length, the values of the velocity were calculated. The mean values of the ultrasonic pulse velocity of the cubic specimens with the dimensions of 70×70×70  The water absorption at atmospheric pressure ( Apparent density ( Specific energy is defined as the energy required for the excavation of the unit volume of rock. Generally, mechanical efficiency is at a maximum when specific energy is at a minimum With the help of the data obtained, the The power values at the moment the sawblade is entirely in the stone are used for calculation ( The energy consumption from the moment the sawblade makes contact to the stone to the moment the sawblade is entirely in the stone relatively increases ( The cutting time–power consumption chart is prepared via the records of the power analyzer that includes the cutting energy data ( The The data obtained in this study were evaluated with the multiple regression analysis, a classic statistical method. The method that mathematically presents the cause and effect relationship between the variables used to solve a problem or explain a situation is called “regression analysis”. The variable that the researcher tries to explain or attempts to establish relationships is called “dependent variable”, and the variable used to solve the problem is called “independent variable”. The method that determines the degree and strength of the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable is called “correlation analysis” In multiple linear regression analyses, coefficient of determination ( The stepwise method feature of SPSS 11.0 was used for the multiple linear regression analysis in order to determine the relationship between the dependent variable, The predictive performances of the models were compared in order to determine the applicability of the models obtained. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) (Eq. The performance indices above can be interpreted as follows: if the RMSE is low, then the model performs better also for a good predictive model, the value of Results of the basic descriptive statistical analysis performed on input parameters are given in First, the correlation matrix was constructed for all the data ( According to the correlation matrix for all the data, certain input parameters had the highest correlation coefficient ( The In these models, the maximum coefficient of determination ( The According to the results obtained, the model predicting the According to The high level of coefficient of determination demonstrates that the The best model obtained as a result of the stepwise analysis includes the feed rate and cutting depth among the working parameters of the machine and includes the Schmidt hammer hardness value which is one of the physico-mechanical properties of the rock. The results are consistent with the practice. The models including only one of the feed rate or cutting depth values are not valid because the In block cutters used in natural stone processing plants, production is directly related to the performance of block cutters to a great extent. The first phase of all cutting processes generally starts with usage of block cutters. Therefore, in a natural stone processing plant, it is quite important to determine the performance of a block cutter in advance and to determine the cost of the process in terms of the planning of production. In the related literature, lack of studies on determining the It should be noted that the data obtained in the present study and the predictive models obtained are used to generalize different cutting conditions and that they reflect only the conditions in the market of natural stone cutting with respect to a number of different parameters.
