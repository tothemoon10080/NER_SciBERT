A rockburst is a sudden dynamic process under high geostress conditions where rocks spontaneously explode. This is an important geological problem for underground construction processes. A rockburst could lead to equipment damage, casualties, and construction delays. Therefore, rockburst prediction and classification are extremely significant. A prediction and classification model is established by introducing the basic theory of the ideal-point method, considering the rockburst mechanism. Three parameters are selected as evaluation indexes, including the rock stress coefficient (σθ
                     /σc
                     ), rock brittleness coefficient (σc
                     /σt
                     ), and elastic energy index (Wet
                     ). To eliminate any correlation between the parameters, a principal component analysis based on mutual information (MIPCA) for the rockburst feature selection is used to calculate a new group of parameters. Then, using the information-entropy theory, the weight coefficients of these new evaluation indexes are confirmed. Finally, using statistics-related projects, engineering-case analyses show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model. A computer evaluation program with a rockburst-classification interface was developed, based on the proposed model. This model and computer software can be used for other similar engineering practices in the future.A rockburst is a dynamic process in high geostress conditions, where a rapid release of energy causes rocks to spontaneously explode. This could lead to equipment damage, casualties, and construction delays ( Rockburst prediction is the key to preventing rockbursts ( Many scholars have investigated rockburst predictions using data-mining methods and artificial intelligence. For instance, The above theories use different angles to forecast the rockburst, leading to certain prediction results. However, because of the complexity of the rock mass and a variety of influencing factors, it is very difficult to exactly predict the space–time distribution of a rockburst. Thus, the results of various prediction methods should be analyzed comprehensively. Moreover, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and understanding, predicting, and controlling rockbursts still pose a considerable challenge for underground engineering. The rockburst mechanism is complex and includes many predictive indexes. However, most previous evaluation methods only base the model on its construction-project background, so they cannot serve a wide range of applications ( To establish the predictive models and avoid the duplication of information among the selected parameters in this research, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed in the initial analysis stage. PCA is a statistical analysis method based on the K-L transformation ( Using a linear conversion, the original space is converted to a low-dimensional principal component space, and the new features after the conversion are the main component. In previous research, PCA has usually computed new variables, based on linear combinations of the original variables ( Mutual information can define the interdependence strength between variables that are not limited to a linear correlation, and it represents the amount of information that is common to both variables. For two given random variables Step 1: Calculate the mutual information matrix: Step 2: Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the mutual information matrix, according to Eqs. Step 3: Calculate the principal component based on mutual information. Step 4: Calculate the principal component load matrix. Step 5: Calculate the new parameter. Based on the second law of thermodynamics, the concept of entropy is a state function that describes an irreversible process. The entropy weight method uses the utility value of the index information to calculate the weight of the parameters, and belongs to an objective weighting law. The following summarizes the essentials of the IETWC process. Step 1: Create the original data matrix: Step 2: Standardize the raw data. The larger model is more optimal: The smaller model is more optimal: The matrix after standardization: Step 3: Calculate the entropy of the Step 4: Calculate the objective weight of the The ideal-point method is an analytical method for multi-objective decision-making; it can transform a multi-objective programming problem into a single-objective programming problem ( The ideal point method includes three steps, which follow: Step 1: Construct the ideal-point decision matrix. If ( Step 2: Determine the ideal point. The ideal point’s evaluation indicators can be classified according to different properties. In this research, they are divided into three categories: the income-type index, the loss-type index, and the interval-type index. For the income-type index: For the loss-type index: For the interval-type index: Step 3: Determine the ideal-point evaluation function. This method classifies based on the distance between the points and the ideal point. If the distance from the ideal point is minimal, the evaluation object is closest to the ideal point. The commonly used distance function is the Minkowski distance function ( In a rockburst application, the Minkowski distance function of this model measures the distance between the various factors and the ideal point. Therefore, the effect of The ‘strength theory’, ‘rigidity theory’, and other theories have been proposed to explain the rockburst mechanism and predict rockbursts ( The rock stress coefficient is the ratio of the maximum tangential stress to the uniaxial compressive strength. The maximum tangential stress can significantly influence the occurrence of shear fracture instabilities, and the uniaxial compressive strength is a main rock characteristic. Russenes and Hoek’s criteria are synthetic and the rock stress coefficient ( The rock brittleness coefficient is the ratio of the uniaxial compressive and the tensile strength. The uniaxial tensile strength is the other main rock characteristic, and the rock brittleness coefficient has often been applied for such engineering problems. The elastic energy index ( To validate the proposed model, we compiled 60 engineering cases described in recently published literature. The field data was obtained from the following: the Soviet Rasvumchorr Workings engineering project ( From According to the distribution of the rockburst evaluation indices in levels II and III, the upper and lower limits in levels I and IV need to be added to determine the ideal point ( According to To accurately calculate the weight of each evaluation index, we obtain three new independent indicators, which can reflect the comprehensive information of the original index by MIPCA. The mutual information matrix and the principal component load matrix were calculated through programming with MATLAB. According to Eq.

Then, according to Eq. In the rockburst application, this model used the Minkowski distance function to measure the distance between the various factors and the ideal point. Therefore, the effect of When As shown in Based on the proposed ideal-point model, a computer-prediction grading system for rockbursts was developed. In this research, a model for predicting and classifying rockbursts was established using the ideal-point method of information theory.
