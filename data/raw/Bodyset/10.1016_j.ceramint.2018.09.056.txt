Macro-mesoporous structured gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3) has been prepared using a low cost aqueous sol-gel method in the presence of various amounts (0, 2, 4, 6 wt%) of biological gelatin. The primary cationic source was saved via an aqueous solution of the aluminum nitrate and partially hydrolyzed by an ammonia solution. A porous structure was obtained from the agglomeration of alumina nano-particles in the presence of the gelatin chains as a network former. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) shows direct crystallization of gamma alumina from the amorphous precursor without formation of any hydrated or other transition alumina phases. Also, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis demonstrate formation of the macro-mesoporous structure. The specific surface area and particle size varied from 140 to 45.9 m2 g−1 and from 11 to 35 nm, according to gelatin addition (0–6 wt%).Among the alumina polymorphs the gamma alumina (γ-Al Aluminum nitrate (Al(NO The phase determination of powders was done with a X-ray diffractometer, (Model: Siemens D-500) using CuK B X-ray diffraction patterns of the sample without gelatin (G0) calcined at the various temperatures are shown in Formation of porous nano-structured γ-Al
