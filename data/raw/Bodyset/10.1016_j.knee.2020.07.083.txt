Current literature estimates that approximately 10–20% of patients have a problem with their knee replacement (KR) [ To make a diagnosis, a structured and systematic approach is required. The following structure has been provided to evaluate the problematic KR. The ‘SPECIFIC’ diagnostic criteria categorises the problems that are encountered in KRs that have potential surgical solutions:         If a “SPECIFIC” diagnosis cannot be identified, then it is recommended that an initial non-surgical approach to management is undertaken and/or referral for further specialist opinion from an experienced revision KR surgeon at a specialist centre. Second opinions are to be encouraged in a timely fashion, they are particularly recommended if you are the original surgeon or the patient is within two years of the original primary. It is recommended that revision knee cases are discussed at a revision knee MDT with experienced surgeons and other health professionals (see article 8). The literature supports THE VIEW that the best results for revision knee surgery occur when there is an identifiable cause [ There may be more than one reason for a KR to be problematic, including extra-articular reasons that must be considered [ Clinical assessment can be separated into four stages, that should be coordinated by a KR surgeon ( Detailed history Clinical examination Imaging studies Laboratory tests There are core questions during history-taking which should include: The severity of degenerative joint disease pre-arthroplasty (imaging and symptoms) The nature of the pre-existing deformity and level and site of pain prior to KR The presence of medical co-morbidities known to increase the risk of prosthetic joint infection Were there complications in the peri-operative period? Has there been a “pain-free window” before onset of symptoms, or has this always been a problem KR? Has the patient had successful arthroplasty of any other joints? If pain is the dominating symptom, see Chapter 3 for a detailed pain history A detailed clinical examination is required. It is recommended that the following is documented: Leg alignment while standing Gait Walking aids, orthotics etc. Scars Clinical features of infection (such as erythema, swelling, sinuses etc.) Tenderness to palpation and evidence of pain sensitisation and/or neuropathic pain Active and passive range of movement of the knee Correctability of deformity Instability in full extension, mid flexion and flexion. Is the PCL intact? Formal assessment of hips and spine Neurovascular assessment Recommended radiological assessment of the problematic KR: Full weight bearing long leg alignment films Weight bearing lateral XR Patella skyline views In problem partial KRs Rosenburg (PA flexion 45 degree views to stress the lateral joint) or Schuss views (PA flexion 30 degrees to load the medial joint) may be performed Analysis of the x-rays should assess: component alignment, sizing, patella height and thickness [ These are not routinely required but may in some special cases aid the diagnosis and planning in the problematic KR.     Occasionally more “functional” tests may be required, particularly if instability is suspected. This can include stress x rays, fluoroscopic screening or arthroscopy.  All problematic KRs require evaluation for potential infection. It is recommended that all problematic KRs have serum CRP and ESR taken If there is any clinical concern, or the inflammatory markers are raised, it is recommended that further investigation is undertaken to exclude infection. See Chapter 4 for further information Identification of any organism(s) is important prior to revision surgery An International consensus defined post-operative fibrosis of the knee as a limited range of movement that is not attributable to an osseous or prosthetic block to movement, but due to soft tissue fibrosis that was not present pre-operatively. Limitation of range of movement was graded as mild, moderate or severe according to the range of flexion (90 to 100, 70 to 89, < The following factors may contribute to knee stiffness: When stiffness is evaluated clinically, the pre-arthroplasty range of movement must be considered, it is useful to calculate a Value Added Range of Motion (VAROM) [ Component positioning: Femoral flexion or extension, Tibial slope, Combined flexion and tibial slope [ Femoral sizing – relationship to anterior cortex and medial / lateral overhang. Posterior condylar offset - Offset Ratio of 0.45 (0.44–047) [ Patella thickness or overstuffing the patellofemoral joint. Patella baja may be associated with knee stiffness. Generalised stiffness, hip stiffness, arthrofibrosis  Careful assessment of the soft tissues and scarring must be made Cases with soft tissue problems or defects should be referred to units with plastic surgery Inflammatory arthropathy may lead to synovitis with swelling and effusions. Large swellings in the suprapatellar pouch cause dysfunction of the quadriceps musculature Bleeding may be a cause of recurrent effusions Impingement may occur due to the implant or soft tissues around the knee  Clinical suspicion on history or examination findings of patellofemoral maltracking such as J sign, clunking, subluxation or dislocation Patella Tilt – consideration of an asymmetric patella cut or femoral component malrotation particularly if the patella is tracking well but is found to be tilted on skyline XR or CT Patella component complication – fracture, fragmentation, implant separation Positive Clarks Test – compression of the patella into the trochlea groove and active quads contraction eliciting pain is a sensitive (but non-specific) sign of patella irritability Rotational profile of leg (anteversion of hip, foot progression angle, tibial rotation). Compare to the patient's other side and to preoperative notes if possible Rotational profile of knee components. Measurements of the femoral component relative to epicondylar axis and tibial component relative to tuberosity. CT scans can be helpful, although interpretation can be challenging and potentially misleading as generally there is no preop measurement to compare to. There may be a combined component construct rotational mismatch leading to patellofemoral dysfunction  May occur at quads tendon, patella, patella tendon or tibial tubercle. May be atraumatic. Failure of the extensor mechanism is a significant complication and is associated with high rates of failure and dissatisfaction in KR [ Evaluate extension from flexion, extensor lag, an intact straight leg raise and exam for a palpable defect Evaluate the patella height and stability both clinically and radiographically  Non-progressive radiolucent lines are commonly seen and do not necessarily represent loosening of the components Review radiographs carefully for widened lines or evidence of component movement. Compare using previous radiographs. Comparison of radiographs in maximum flexion and extension may demonstrate movement of the prosthesis Further investigations such as CT and SPECT may be useful in the determination of component loosening. Beware over reading X-ray appearances and alignment; KRs have complex 3D kinematics that are poorly represented by X-ray investigations  The assessment of infection has been discussed in Chapter 3 It is important to establish the difference between acute and chronic infections Assess for systemic sepsis and/or other foci of infection such as discitis or endocarditis  The Universal Classification System (UCS) for periprosthetic fracture helps to guide the treatment of fractures around the knee implants [ CT scans may be useful to determine comminution or fragmentation around the implant that is not readily seen on radiographs Instability can be attributed to a number of causes, including: Ligament injury (iatrogenic or traumatic) Poor muscular control and proprioception Widespread laxity, collagen disorders or neuromuscular disease Pain leading to symptoms of giving way Surgical error and poor ligament balancing Large effusions defunctioning the quads musculature Implant wear or fracture leading to instability Patient perception in the absence of objective findings Assessment of instability: Coronal laxity in full extension, mid flexion and at 90 degrees Sagittal laxity – PCL integrity, implant wear Hyperextension – global laxity or suggestive of implant damage Examination under anaesthetic with fluoroscopy can be helpful to objectively record laxity  If a KR is significantly worn or broken, this will generally lead to symptoms of pain, instability and possibly bone loss Standing radiographs alone are often sufficient to make the diagnosis of polyethylene wear or implant fracture. CT may be a useful adjunct  The evaluation of problematic KRs can be complex. Therefore, a structured approach is required. It is recommended that infection is always excluded, and careful history-taking, and examination is performed. Radiographs and additional investigations may be useful to establish the diagnosis. The acronym SPECIFIC can be useful in establishing the diagnosis and identifying a ‘surgical solution’ to the problematic KR. A surgical solution cannot always be identified, so a multimodal MDT approach is required to care for patients with problematic KRs and an appropriate non-operative care pathway should be available.
