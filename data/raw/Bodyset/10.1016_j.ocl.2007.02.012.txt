Scaphoid nonunions can exist with or without avascular necrosis of the proximal pole, and waist fractures may have an associated humpback deformity. CT best shows the deformity and bone loss, whereas MRI will show avascular necrosis. Operative treatment should be directed at correcting the deformity with open reduction and internal fixation and bone grafting. Vascularized bone grafts should be used in cases of avascular necrosis.
