The work carried out on spiral concentrator/separator is an exemplary on the analysis and modelling of the particle separation in the trough by incorporating the wash water addition. However, the title used by the author is “An operational model for a spiral classifier” which is misguided the readers largely on this subject. The phrase, i.e. ‘classifier’ was used rather than ‘separator/concentrator’ utilized in the published title as well as at several occasion inside the paper. We would like to mention/highlight to the author and also it may be aware that both of these phrases are different from each other in principle and operation as well as application front as widely understood in Mineral Processing fraternity. Also, many instances, the authors used the terminology ‘classifier’ for refereeing the operating principle of this separator. It can also be noted from the references section as mentioned by the Author in the paper, wherein the equipment operating principle is categorically explained for Spiral ‘Concentrator’ and not the Spiral ‘Classifier’ ( Authors can agree on the working principle of the spiral concentrator or separator which is in the published literature (
