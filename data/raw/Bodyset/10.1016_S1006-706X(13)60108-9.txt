The burden distribution real-time estimation problem of multi-loop charging based on the real multi-radar data is resolved. Firstly, an iterative algorithm is introduced to calculate the radial coordinate of the pile-top. Then, based on the multi-radar data, the burden profile is estimated by a cubic-curve equation at the end of the multi-loop charging. Furthermore, the burden profile before the next multi-loop charging is calculated based on multi-radar data by considering the impact of burden descent. On the basis of these burden profiles, a more accurate thickness ratio of ore to coke (R
                     o/c) at the radial direction of blast furnace can be obtained. Finally, an example is given to calculate the burden profiles and R
                     o/c by using the real multi-radar data sampled from Baosteel, which shows the effectiveness of the method introduced.
