A series of molecular basket sorbents consisting of SBA-15 loaded with different amounts of polyethylenimine (PEI) have been systematically studied, focusing on their characterization by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), N2 physisorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and their CO2 sorption properties. The meso-structure of SBA-15 was retained after PEI loading. When the PEI loading was no more than 50 wt.%, PEI was dispersed and filled inside the pore channels of SBA-15. Higher PEI loading resulted in a part of the loaded PEI coating on the external surface of the SBA-15 particles and thus caused the agglomeration. The effects of sorption temperature and PEI loading on the CO2 capacity of the PEI/SBA-15 sorbents were examined over a fixed-bed flow system using a model flue gas. The relationship between the sorption performance and the sorbent structure has been discussed. CO2 diffusion in the PEI bulk may play a crucial role for determining the CO2 sorption capacity and sorption/desorption rate at low temperature. With the increase of the sorption temperature, CO2 diffusion can be accelerated and more amine sites may be exposed and accessible for CO2 sorption. As a result, the sorption capacity increases. However, at further higher temperature, e.g., 100°C, the sorption capacity decreases due to the dominant desorption. In addition, the sorption behavior of SBA-15 and PEI-50/SBA-15 at high CO2 pressures (up to 50 bars) has been studied. The results showed that CO2 sorption over PEI/SBA-15 occurs mainly via chemisorption even under pressurized conditions.Selective sorption of CO Adsorption is one of promising methods for CO Compared to MCM-41, SBA-15 has larger pore, thicker wall and higher thermal stability To further improve the sorbent performance and explore new sorbents, it is important to fundamentally understand the sorption mechanism and the structure–performance relationship. Therefore, in this paper, we report a systematic and collaborative study of the SBA-15-based MBS materials with a focus on the sorbent characterization and sorption characteristics.
