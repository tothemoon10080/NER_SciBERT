This chapter discusses the role of coke in the steel and foundry industries. Quality requirements on metallurgical and foundry cokes are discussed based on their functions in the blast furnace (BF) and in the cupola, respectively. In respect to the BF, as a main consumer of the coke, its structure and properties, as well as their effect on the BF operation, are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the use of nut coke, ferro-coke, bio-coke, and form coke, as well as alternate reductants, particularly coke oven gas, is a part of this contribution. Finally, future prospects of ironmaking including cokeless iron and steelmaking are discussed.Introduction Coke types Steel industry and energy use Coke in the steel industry Foundry industry and the role of coke Coke in the blast furnace Coke functions in the blast furnace Effect of coke quality and properties on the blast furnace operation Quality of metallurgical coke Coke properties Coke structure Requirements for blast furnace coke Quality of coke produced by different technologies Non-standard coke quality indices and test methods Further coke types for the blast furnace Nut coke High-reactivity coke and ferro-coke Biocoke Form coke Coke for further metallurgical processes Coke in smelting reduction processes Coke breeze in the sintering Charcoal ironmaking, coke ironmaking, what next?

The global annual production of metallurgical coke ranged in the last years between 650 and 685 The main share of metallurgical coke is consumed in the steel industry to produce hot metal, which, in turn, is used as the main ingredient to make steel ( Iron and steel metallurgy is the branch of pyrometallurgy (recovery of metals by the thermal treatment of minerals, ores, and concentrates) that deals with processes and technologies of production of iron and its alloys. It comprises ironmaking, steelmaking, secondary metallurgy, solidification, and casting. An integrated steelworks also comprise raw material preparation (typically, sinter and coking plants) and rolling mill (cold or/and hot ones); see The following are main routes for molten steel production:  smelting reduction ( direct reduction (  World crude steel production reached 1630 The steel industry is an energy-intensive branch. The energy efficiency depends mainly on production route (see above), type and quality of iron carriers and reductants, the steel product mix, and operation control technology. Energy is also consumed indirectly for the mining, preparation, and transportation of raw materials (about 8% of the total energy required) ( Metallurgical coke is the indispensable input material for BF operation. Furthermore, established SR processes such as Corex  The decrease of specific coke consumption has been the key issue of the BF technology development for many decades. Foundries are plants where castings are produced by melting metal, pouring liquid metal into a mold, then allowing it to solidify. They also form components for numerous applications. About 90% of all manufactured goods are based on metal castings ( A majority of foundries specialize in a particular metal and have furnaces dedicated to these metals. There are ferrous (iron or steel) and nonferrous (aluminum, brass, bronze, copper, etc.) foundries. For ferrous materials, EAFs, cupola furnaces, and induction furnaces are commonly used. Reverberatory and crucible furnaces are typically used for production of aluminum, bronze, and brass castings. The foundry industry is widespread around the world. The highest annual amount of cast metal is produced in China: over 44.5 Mio tons in 30,000 mostly small foundries, including 17,000 iron foundries in 2013. The United States produced nearly 12.3 Mio tons of cast metal in 2013 in 2000 foundries, including 640 iron foundries (  With respect to iron production, foundry coke is used primarily in a cupola furnace for the production of molten iron. It is a heat and carbon source for melting scrap and other additives to provide gray iron or ductile iron, as well as source providing the adequate permeability within the burden. The coke ratio lies between 9% and 15% of metallic charge or some 100–150 The BF is a continuously operating shaft reactor for iron ore reduction based on the countercurrent flow principle ( Coke has the following three main functions in the BF: heat supplier (to cover thermal requirements) reducing agent (to cover chemical requirements) spacer (mechanical and hydrodynamic requirements to ensure the permeability) Furthermore, coke is a carbonizing agent (carbon content in hot metal makes up 4%–5%) and dust filter.  Carbon and oxygen react to carbon monoxide in the raceway according to two subsequent reactions: The carbon monoxide (and also the hydrogen from water steam and auxiliary reducing agents) acts as This process is slightly exothermic. At temperatures above 900–1000 DR is an endothermic process and consumes heat. Actually, DR (reaction 13.4) is a sum of reactions 13.2 and 13.3. Coke also maintains burden Because of carburation of iron, its melting point decreases considerably. A decrease in melting point makes tapping at lower temperatures possible. If carburation of hot metal is not sufficient, wear of carbonaceous refractory materials in the BF hearth increases.  The required properties and amount of coke to fulfill these functions are discussed in  Only excellent quality coke grades may guarantee high efficient BF performance. However, the effect of coke quality and properties on BF performance varies depending on BF characteristics (size and geometry) and operation mode (pulverized coal The pressure drop of the gas flow (ΔP in N/m With multiple grain packed bed as occurs in a BF, the voidage becomes smaller as the range of grain sizes increases (  Requirements on coke quality characteristics depend on BF operation modes. For example, superhigh PCI and very low coke rate require enhanced coke quality due to the lower coke/ore thickness layer ratio and an increased residence time of coke. In turn, the BF operation conditions affect the coke quality characteristics in different ways. During its journey down the furnace, the coke is subjected to mechanical degradation and chemical attack. This causes a decrease of coke size, strength, and change in the reactivity (e.g., due to interaction with unconverted residues of injectants). Factors affecting the coke degradation in the BF and change of its properties are described in numerous references, e.g., in The following chemical, physicochemical, physical, and mechanical characteristics of coke are particularly important for BF operation ( Proximate and ultimate analyses Ash composition Break, pressure, abrasion Cold, hot, and microstrength Size distribution Density and porosity Crack size and distribution Heat conductivity Calorific value Reactivity          Structurally, i.e., from the petrographic point of view, cokes are very complex, consisting of a wide range of pore and wall sizes and shapes in addition to fissures. Furthermore, the wall material consists of different textures or carbon forms with different microscopic properties, which vary in optical anisotropy/crystallinity ( Based on coal petrography, carbon forms can be classified into two major categories, binder-phase carbon forms and filler-phase carbon forms. The reactive entities in coal (vitrinite, liptinite, resinite, and reactive semifusinite) soften during carbonization and serve as a binder. The inert entities (inert semifusinite, fusinite, micrinite, macrinite, and inertodetrinite) do not soften during carbonization and serve as a filler, which are incorporated by reactive entities or macerals (  There are various classifications of coke carbon phases. In petrography, the word texture relates to the carbons' optical properties, whereas structure relates to the amount and size of coke pores and walls ( Coke strength is dependent on both  Graphitizing carbons, such as coke, begin to approach the atomic structure of graphite when heated to high temperatures. The height of graphite crystallites in coke (L It was reported in various studies that the higher graphitization degree of coke reduces its strength and abrasion resistance and has a disadvantage for carburization reaction. Furthermore, the carbon structure is often believed to influence the coke reactivity. Further valuable information on coke structure and its effects on coke properties are summarized by Quality requirements for coke can be derived from its functions in the BF. The requirements on coke characteristics become stricter while raising the BF size (especially height), decreasing the coke rate, and increasing the furnace campaign life. For example in China, requirements on physical and mechanical properties of coke depend on BF size (  Blast furnace coke quality characteristics in some further countries and world regions are shown in  Sufficient grain size, its narrow distribution, and high cold strength (e.g., high I It should be noted that there is no consensus on importance and validity of CSR and CRI indices. One critical point is that both indices are correlated closely, e.g., CSR Several cokemaking technologies, alternative to the conventional multichamber or slot coking system, have been developed. The heat recovery oven seems to be the most advanced system. A comparison of properties of cokes produced from identical coal blends in the conventional slot coke oven and in the heat recovery oven shows that coke quality in the heat recovery oven improves while VM content in the coal blend increases ( Test procedures for determining the standard coke characteristics such as those discussed in Standard parameters of coke quality and test methods seem to be insufficient to characterize coke properties required for a modern BF. They provide limited assessment of coke properties under limited reacting conditions without sufficiently There are attempts to assemble various parameters in one index. Thus, a The higher the global coke quality index, the better the coke quality. Also, a concept for the so-called Some developments are devoted to the coke dissolution behavior. A A laboratory test was developed to quantify the A method for quantitative determination of A laboratory test was developed by  A Requirements on coke grain size (see   the sinter/pellet reducibility increases in the temperature range of 900–1100 nut coke in the sinter layer prevents the sticking of the sinter pieces (photographs in  The optimum rate of nut coke seems to be 10–30 A controversial discussion on desired coke reactivity still seems unfinished since over 80 The use of coke with high CRI index was proposed for decreasing the carbon consumption in the BF. The idea behind it is to shift the wüstite reduction equilibrium to lower temperatures by decreasing the starting temperature of solution loss reaction and the thermal reserve zone temperature ( Ferro-coke is a kind of high reactivity cokes, which is produced by blending iron ore with coal during coke production ( A pilot plant with a daily capacity of 30 tons of ferro-coke in vertical retort distillation furnace operates in Japan. The main process steps are to crush non- and soft-coking coal, to mix crushed coal with iron ore powder and additive substances, to mold the mixed material under high pressure, and to heat the molded material in a continuous pyrolysis furnace for 11–12 Adding of biomass into a coal blend is one of the options for the renewable energy use in the steel industry that also involve its injection, embedding in iron burden materials, and gasification ( Biomass into a coal blend can only be added in a small amount (usually until 2–3 This phenomenon can be explained by the coke microstructure matrix ( Stamped charging of blends containing low-grade weakly caking and high volatile coals allow production of a compact, stable, and relatively inexpensive form coke. The technology developed since the early 20th century involves formation of a stable coal cake with finely crushed coal by mechanically stamping outside the oven for carbonization. The bulk density of the coal charged in the oven is increased by physically stamping the charge into a cake. The cake (up to 50–60 tons), which is almost The advantages of stamp charging are increased by 8%–10% throughput due to higher bulk density, improved cold and postreaction strength of coke due to closer packing of the individual coal particles during carbonization, and less pollution during charging as fine coals are not charged from the oven top; produced coke is denser, smaller, and more uniform in size (  Following the definition of SR as a group of processes which produce liquid hot metal from iron ore without agglomeration and without using coke ( Mainly two SR processes are commercially used: Corex Coal or coal briquettes enter the dome of the melter-gasifier and is converted to char ( The Corex It was already mentioned in Sintering or the agglomeration of fine ferrous compounds, mostly iron ore fines, but also internal waste such as flue dust, mill scale, and/or dusts from electrostatic precipitators, takes place at a sinter strand which is an endless chain of stringed pallets made from heat-resistant cast iron with a driving wheel and a turning back wheel ( The raw sinter mix consists of abovementioned iron-bearing fines, additives (mostly limestone, lime, dolomite, and olivine), circulating materials (e.g., mill scale, blast furnace, and converter dusts), return sinter fines, solid fuel, and moisture. Solid fuel makes up ca. 3%–4% of raw mix. Coke breeze is the most common solid fuel (fraction less than 3 Coke breeze, as already mentioned, is the fraction below 3 Fuel combustion rate is one of the most important factors for sinter quality and productivity of a sinter strand. Targeting at improved coke combustion efficiency, Coating the breeze coke can also be applied to decrease NOx emissions in the sintering process. Thus coating layer of CaO–Fe Charcoal can be used to substitute partially coke breeze in the sintering process and contribute in such a way to CO Nearly 4 centuries operated BFs with charcoal (first documentations on BFs in Europe are dated to the year 1340), then nearly over 3 centuries with coke. Despite the impressive drop in coke rate (see The lowest coke rate will be achieved when (a) the total BF demand on reducing agent is minimum and (b) maximum possible rate of this demand is covered by injected auxiliary substances and alternative energy sources ( Maximizing BF efficiency Optimizing coke quality (see Partial replacement of coke with injectants, renewable, electrical, and other energy sources. The minimum coke rate is determined by requirements on gas permeability in dry shaft and in the cohesive zone, drainage of liquid products in the dripping zone, and renewal of deadman. The tuyere injection of gaseous, liquid, and solid fuels, mostly pulverized coal (PC), natural gas (NG), and heavy oil, became state of the art. Furthermore, waste plastics (WPs), coke oven gas, biomass products, and further media are or can be injected. About 65% of BFs worldwide operate using the injection technology, thereunder all the BFs in Japan, over 80% of BFs in China, and a majority of BFs in the EU inject PC, the main part of BFs in Russia and Ukraine—NG with increasing tendency to PC and both reductants, and a major part of BFs in North America uses coinjection of PC and NG. The common feature is raising injection rates, see  Coke saving while injecting the auxiliary reducing agents depends on reducing agent type and composition, injection rate, conversion efficiency, and accompanying changes of BF operating parameters and is characterized by reducing agent-for-coke replacement ratio. This is the ratio of the amount of coke saved (ΔK) to the amount of injected reducing agent required as a replacement (s) and is measured in kg/kg (m Natural gas 0.8–1.0 Coke oven gas 0.4–0.45 Oil 1.15–1.35 Anthracite 1.0–1.05 Compensating measures are required while injecting the auxiliary reducing agents to maintain a suitable adiabatic flame temperature and further operation parameters. Such measures could be, for example, as follows: blast oxygen enrichment increase in blast temperature decrease in blast humidity decrease of the amount of coinjected reducing agent Cokeless technologies can be divided into two principle groups: carbon-based (direct use of coal and biomass products) and hydrogen- or electricity-based ones. The first group, which includes SR processes (with some restrictions, see Carbon serves until now as a main chemical reactant to convert iron-bearing materials to iron and steel, and CO The following ways can be considered as short and midterm measures to break the direct dependence of CO usage of secondary raw materials and recycling application of renewable bio-based energy sources application of materials lowering the energy demand (e.g., high reactivity carbon carriers and prereduced iron carriers) top gas recycling after CO use of hot reducing gas produced from low-grade coal, waste, or natural gas use of available hydrogen-containing media such as original and reformed natural and coke oven gases (see next section) or coalbed methane By discussing the environmental effect of metallurgical coke, it should be taken into account that on the one hand its usage causes CO The refined coke oven gas (COG) usually has low calorific value of 16.5–18.5 COG injection into the BF tuyere as an auxiliary reducing agent was already mentioned in In gas-based DR processes, natural gas is typically used to produce reducing gas by conversion (e.g., catalytic steam reforming or partial oxidation) into a mixture of H Foundry coke is used in a coke-fired cupola to produce cast and ductile iron products. As mentioned in The cupola consists of a vertical steel shell lined with a refractory brick. The charge consists of alternate layers of the metal to be melted (typically, pig iron, scrap steel, and domestic returns), coke, and flux (typically limestone). Coke is burnt in air, which is introduced through tuyeres positioned above the hearth ( The basic requirements for foundry coke are qualitatively the same as for metallurgical coke ( The size specification of foundry coke depends on the size of the cupola, but it is usually larger than metallurgical coke. The following examples of its standard sizing in mm can be shown as 150 x 230, 100 x 230, 100 x 150, 60 x 130, 90 x 250, 130 x 250. The use of larger-sized coke with a dense structure and low ash, high carbon, and high calorific values provides the following advantages for efficient cupola process ( higher metal temperature lower blast pressure reduced solution loss reaction reduced breakage from handling The predominant part of the produced coke is used in the BF process. Therefore, its “fate” depends on development of BF and alternative ironmaking technologies. The BF remains the most efficient producer of primary metal (about 95% worldwide), but coke use is a crucial problem due to its relevant impact on CO Specific metallurgical coke consumption has been decreased due to numerous technological, organizational, and construction measures down to 220–250
