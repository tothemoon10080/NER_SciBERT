Accumulation of glacial debris in basal ice of glaciers can be viewed as the initial stage of lodgement till formation occurring during active glacier flow which in turn strongly influences the initial grain-size structure and fabric of lodgement till. Consequently the entrainment and alteration of debris within the basal ice provides information on the initial stage of lodgement till formation. The content of glacial debris in the basal ice, its grain-size frequency distribution and the dip and dip direction of the longer axes of clasts were measured and the structural characteristics of the debris distribution within the basal ice were observed at the margin of Russell Glacier, West Greenland. The content of debris within the basal ice ranged from 34.3% to 86.5% producing a mean value of 61%. The results of comparative grain-size analysis indicate that the debris material of basal ice of Russell Glacier is distinguished by the higher portion of silt and sand fraction in comparison with the material of flow till, lateral and terminal moraines. These data were compared with the data of grain-size analysis of lodgement till of Lithuania. In the Lithuanian till the content of clay is very high in comparison to the debris within the basal ice of the Russell Glacier. The comparison of till varieties shows that the index of relative entropy is highest for grain-size distribution of clastic material within the basal ice. The grain-size distribution of material within the basal ice reflects a combination of the petrology of eroded glacier bed and debris comminution and mixing associated with ice deformation. During glacier movement, debris material is mechanically milled to a silt fraction. Clay particles appear only when a glacier flows across clay-rich subglacial beds. The rise of the value of relative entropy of grain-size distribution of debris within the basal ice is interpreted as equalization of the content of eroded fractions in the comminution and mixing process.
