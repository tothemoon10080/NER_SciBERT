Commercially available LM4 Aluminum alloy was subjected through Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) method by Multi-Axial Forging Process (MAF) in ambient temperature. In this process, the material was processed successfully up to 5 Passes and mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compression strength and hardness of the as received and processed samples at ambient temperature were evaluated. The MAF processed sample result showed that the ultimate strength, percentage elongation and compression strength improved by 55 MPa, 3.75% and 162 MPa respectively as compared with the unprocessed sample. Hardness also increased with the increase in the number of passes. In the case of microstructure, grain size reduced from 110 μm to 8 μm after subjecting the sample to MAF. Fractography explains the nature of the fracture from received to processed samples by decreasing the size of the dimple and the type of fracture observed was ductile in nature. Improvement in strength and hardness of processed samples was observed due to the grain refinement and high amount of density dislocation in the material during MAF.
