Due to the tremendous success of endosseous dental implants, these are being preferred over conventional fixed and removable prosthesis. This success has lead to the extraction and replacement of teeth with guarded prognosis. A 24 years oid maie patient, reported with pain in upper central incisor, which had undergone trauma four months earlier. Due to trauma, he lost his right latéral incisor & suffered from fracture of the central incisor. The prognosis of the fractured central incisor was poor because this was located in the middle of the root. Hence, the tooth was extracted and two implants were placed. The restoration was executed with two métal ceramic crowns which were splinted to each other. The prosthesis is successfully functioning for last 5 years.
