By using the self-developed triaxial servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-fluid–solid coupling of coal containing gas and the self-developed coal and gas outburst simulation test device, experiments to study the influence mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas outburst disasters. The results show that: (i) gas seepage decreases the strength of coal containing gas and accelerates its failure process; (ii) under the same gas pressure, the confining pressure is larger, the more difficult the gas flows and the greater the intensity of coal containing gas is; (iii) in the process of coal and gas outburst, the greater the vertical ground stress is, the more powerful the outburst will be; (iv) the influence mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas outburst disasters is as follows: firstly, gas seepage weakens the mechanical properties of coal body, which makes it much easier for coal and gas outburst to occur; secondly, on the same effect of external force, it will be easy to form a high gas pressure zone in the coal body under the difficult condition of gas seepage, and accumulate more gas compression energy, which is the energy source for coal and gas outburst, and it is also the main dynamic source to throw and grind the coal.Coal and gas outburst is an extremely complex geo-dynamic phenomenon in coal mining. The studies on the mechanism of coal and gas outburst show that: coal and gas outburst, mainly attributed to ground stress, gas pressure and physical and mechanical characteristics causing by the coupling interaction between coal and gas ( Based on the above discussions, we experimentally study on the mechanical properties of coal containing gas and the process of coal and gas outburst under different gas seepage conditions by using the self-developed triaxial servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-fluid–solid coupling of coal containing methane and the coal and gas outburst simulation test device in this paper. The mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas disaster is further proposed. This work may provide an experimental and theoretical basis to prevent and control coal and gas outburst disasters. Mechanical of coal containing gas under different gas seepage conditions are determined by the self-developed triaxial servo-controlled equipment for thermo-fluid–solid coupling of coal containing methane ( Coal and gas outburst under different gas seepage conditions is simulated on the coal and gas outburst simulation test device ( Test coal is taken from Zhaozhuang coal mine of Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group in Shanxi Province and Tian-fu Sanhui No. 1 mine in Chongqing. The making process of coal specimens is as follows: first, raw coal got from stope should be ground by a muller, then coal dust with mesh between 60 and 80 is got, and then the coal dust is blended with pure water to make molded coal with a size of Coal and gas outburst simulation test device has its special molding device, which is shown in Coal and gas outburst can be seen as gas flow and deformation failure on fluid–solid coupling effect from a mechanical view. Based on studies of mechanical properties of coal containing gas under different gas seepage conditions, coal and gas outburst simulation tests under different gas seepage conditions are also carried out by coal and gas outburst simulation test device, then the influence mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas outburst disaster is determined and analyzed completely. The specific test content contains the follows: (1) triaxial compression failure tests of coal containing gas are done under gas flow state and non-flow state. In all tests, the confining pressure is 2.0 Previous studies about gas effects on the mechanical properties of coal are usually that coal samples were tested under static state (  It is known that gas flow is usually driven by the gas pressure gradient. So under the gas flow state the gas pressure in coal is not equal but a certain gradient from import to export. However, when the gas is not flowing, the gas pressure in coal keeps the same everywhere. When the confining pressure is 2.0 The test condition is that gas pressure is 1.0  In addition, under the same gas pressure, the greater confining pressure, the smaller the gas flow. The greater the deformation rates of coal samples, the greater the compressive strength. It is shown in Coal and gas outburst simulation tests are carried out when vertical stresses are 2.0 The screenshots of outburst simulation experiment when vertical stresses are 2.0 Above all, on the one hand, gas seepage reduces the ability of coal to resist external force, which makes coal and gas outburst much easier to occur. On the other hand, under the same external force, if the gas seepage is difficult in coal body, it will be easy to form a high gas pressure zone in the coal body, and accumulate more gas compression energy, which is the energy source for coal and gas outburst, and it is the main dynamic source to throw and grind the coal. Gas seepage is an essential factor for coal and gas outburst disasters. Based on the self-developed triaxial servo-controlled seepage equipment for thermo-fluid–solid coupling of coal containing gas and coal and gas outburst simulation test device, experiments to study the mechanical properties of coal containing gas and the process of coal and gas outburst. Finally, the influence mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas outburst is discussed. The conclusions are as follows: (i) gas seepage decreases the strength of coal containing gas and accelerates its failure process; (ii) under the same gas pressure, the confining pressure is larger, the more difficult the gas flows and the greater the intensity of coal containing gas is; (iii) in the process of coal and gas outburst, the greater the vertical ground stress is, the more powerful the outburst will be; (iv) the influence mechanism of gas seepage on coal and gas outburst disasters is as follows: firstly, gas seepage weakens the mechanical properties of coal body, which makes it much easier for coal and gas outburst to occur; secondly, on the same effect of external force, it will be easy to form a high gas pressure zone in the coal body under the difficult condition of gas seepage, and accumulate more gas compression energy, which is the energy source for coal and gas outburst, and it is also the main dynamic source to throw and grind the coal.
