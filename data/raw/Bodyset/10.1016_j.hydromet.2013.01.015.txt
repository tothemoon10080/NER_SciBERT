Key factors controlling the extraction of lithium from a lepidolite concentrate (2.55% Li) using a two-stage process based on roasting with Na2SO4 and water leaching were determined in this study. HSC software was used to predict lepidolite decomposition characteristics and products yielded from roasting. From this simulation roasting was conducted at 850–1000°C with different sodium sulphate additions (set at sodium sulphate-lithium molar ratios of 1:1 to 3:1) in 0.5–2h to yield several calcines for leaching. Stabcal modelling was applied to investigate the stability of various Li species formed during water leaching. From the simulation it was identified that LiKSO4, as one of the main Li-containing products formed in the calcine, has a low solubility and therefore controls the release of Li into water during leaching. The low solubility of LiKSO4 at 25°C indicated by Stabcal was confirmed during leaching at different water–calcine mass ratios from 5:1 to 15:1. Leaching under these conditions only yields liquors containing <1.0g/L Li, corresponding to Li extractions of 45–48%. The Li extraction was significantly improved at 85°C, yielding liquors containing 1–3g/L Li, corresponding to extractions of 47–90%, with lower extractions of Li achieved at higher Li concentrations. At best, 90.4% of lithium was extracted (at water–calcine mass ratio 15:1, 85°C and 3h) using calcines roasted at 1000°C for 0.5h (using Na2SO4 — Li molar ratio of 2:1).Lithium has found application in many industries, from the manufacturing of glass, ceramics, rubbers, pharmaceuticals to production of batteries. The global market share of lithium used in batteries has grown significantly over the last few years and has reached 23% in 2010 ( Up to now, lithium has been mostly produced from salar brines which contain 0.06–0.15% Li due to the low cost of production. However, several potential ore deposits are being considered or have been recently developed to produce lithium carbonate from lithium minerals such as spodumene (by Galaxy Resources Ltd. WA, Australia), from china clay (by Goonvean Ltd., Cornwall, UK) ( Spodumene (formula LiAl The processing of lithium minerals involves first upgrading the ground ores by beneficiation techniques such as flotation and wet magnetic separation ( Earlier work by  The recovery of lithium from a zinnwaldite waste produced from a dressing plant treating a Sn–W ore (originally mined in Cínovec area in the Czech Republic) was first reported by Roasting of the zinnwaldite material in calcium carbonate seems to maximise the Rb recovery as reported by   A sulphation roasting using Na These studies indicate that mica-type minerals containing lithium have to be first roasted either in calcium carbonate/sulphate, or sodium/potassium sulphate or sulphuric acid to convert lithium to a soluble sulphate form before leaching in water. Sulphation using sodium sulphate seems to be the critical step for this scheme of treatment as it lowers the calcination temperature to 850–1000 This study therefore aims to optimise the conditions for recovering lithium from a lepidolite ore collected from the BOAM mine (Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea) using sulphation roasting and water leaching and to determine factors affecting its extraction. Specific attention is given to the reactions that potentially liberate SO The lepidolite concentrate (2.55% Li or 5.49% Li In this study the chemical composition of the concentrate, calcines and residues after leaching was analysed by X-Ray Fluorescence, XRF (Rigaku ZSX Primus II) whereas their structure was determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis (Cu-tube60kv 50 To extract Li from lepidolite, the concentrate was first mixed with Na Typical leaching tests at different conditions using a calcine produced from roasting the concentrate with Na A simulation of the roasting process using HSC software ( The TG-DTA profile of Na  To investigate the stability and leachability of various Li species (as indicated by HSC modelling) in water, Stabcal models were derived to evaluate the equilibria of different Li species in water at 25 In the presence of high F Thus it is now understandable why leaching of calcines produced from lepidolite roasting using only Na There was a marked improvement in Li extraction yielded from tests conducted at 85 Results from the above and this study however are different from those reported by In this study, leaching at 85 Since HSC modelling shows that the reaction of lepidolite with Na In addition, roasting time also affects the recovery of lithium ( To recover Li from lepidolite, Na Using HSC simulation to identify conditions for decomposing lepidolite by roasting with sodium sulphate, we conducted experiments at 850–1000 This work was supported by a grant from the
