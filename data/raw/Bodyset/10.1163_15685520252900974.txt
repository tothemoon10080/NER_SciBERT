Segregation indices were proposed to describe the intensity of segregation of multi-sized particle mixtures as a whole during filling a two-dimensional silo. They adequately represented the effects of the operational conditions on the segregation patterns obtained experimentally. As a result, the proposed segregation indices were found to increase with a lower feed rate and lower concentration of the smallest component, and exhibit a maximum with increasing numbers of components.
