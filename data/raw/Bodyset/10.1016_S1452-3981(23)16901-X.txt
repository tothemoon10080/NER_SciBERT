The effect of N,N'-dimethylaminoethanol on the corrosion of austenitic stainless steel type 304 in 3M H2SO4 has been studied by weight-loss method and linear polarization measurement in different concentrations of the compound. The inhibition efficiencies of the inhibitor compound on the corrosion of the stainless steel were evaluated through assessment of the anodic and cathodic polarization curves of the alloy, the spontaneity of the electrochemical process, inhibition mechanism and adsorption isotherm. The inhibitor efficiency increased with increase in the inhibitor concentration. Results obtained reveal that the inhibitor performed effectively on the stainless steel providing good protection against pitting and uniform corrosion in the chloride containing acidic solutions. The compound acted through physiochemical mechanism on the stainless steel surface and obeyed Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The values of the inhibition efficiency calculated from the two techniques are in reasonably good agreement. Polarization studies showed that the compounds behave as mixed type inhibitor in the aggressive media.
