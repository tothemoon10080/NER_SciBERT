The genitourinary (GU) tract may be injured by a wide variety of blunt and penetrating trauma to the lower chest, abdomen and pelvis. Most GU trauma is not immediately life-threatening, but its association with other injuries necessitates an organized approach.
                  In general, in the haemodynamically unstable patient with abdominal injury, exploratory laparotomy is necessary, regardless of the mechanism of injury.
