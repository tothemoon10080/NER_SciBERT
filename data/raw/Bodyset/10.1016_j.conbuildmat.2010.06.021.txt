The strengthening of out-of-plane loaded unreinforced masonry (URM) walls strengthened with near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP strips has proven to be an innovative and cost effective strengthening technique. Since the performance of FRP-strengthened URM walls is often controlled by the behavior of the interface between the FRP and masonry, it is very important to model the bond–slip relationship accurately. In this paper, the bond–slip behavior of the FRP-to-masonry interface in a pull test was simulated by solid continuum elements where detailed information of the interface could be modelled directly. The masonry prism in the pull test was modelled using a previously derived homogenized model. For comparisons of computational efficiency, a continuum model, in which the mortar and masonry brick units are discritized individually, and the commonly used smeared-crack model were also employed to model the masonry prism in the pull test. A thin layer of interface elements was used to simulate the behavior of the FRP-to-masonry interfaces in each model. The accuracy and efficiency of the homogenized model together with the interface elements was validated by experimental data from (a) uniaxial pull tests of a NSM strip bonded to a masonry prism and (b) an out-of-plane loaded full-scale masonry wall strengthened with NSM CFRP strips running in the vertical direction. The simulated results using the homogenized model were found to agree well with test data from both sets of tests.the area perpendicular to the principal strain direction shear failure surface constants in Drucker–Prager model the modulus of elasticity the compressive modulus of elasticity the tensile modulus of elasticity the ultimate compressive stress of mortar the ultimate tensile stress of mortar elastic shear modulus the fracture energy release rate in smeared-crack model the shearing fracture energy release rate in bond–slip model the tensile fracture energy release rate in bond–slip model the acceleration due to gravity height of the masonry wall the first invariant of the stress tensor the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor the material constant in Drucker–Prager model the shear strength in the deviatoric stress tensor thickness of the URM wall the tensile strength in the compressive strength in the average tensile strength in the average compressive strength in the pressure sensitivity coefficient in Drucker–Prager model the crack opening displacement increment slip at zero shear stress slip at peak shear stress strain components in an element the average strain defined by integral over the basic cell the threshold strain the ultimate strain the deviatoric strain increment the function of strain rate of the deviatoric strain-rate tensor Poisson’s ratio the density of the masonry the yield stresses in uniaxial compression the yield stresses in uniaxial tension the ultimate normal stress the normal stress the stress in an element the tensile strength of brick units the average stress defined by integral over the basic cell the ultimate shear stress the shear stress Unreinforced masonry (URM) construction is extremely vulnerable to seismic actions. Their susceptibility to failure has provided the impetus to develop retrofitting techniques to strengthen URM structures. The strengthening techniques such as near-surface mounted (NSM) FRP strips and externally bonded (EB) FRP plates have been shown to increase the flexural strength and ductility of URM structures Numerical analysis has been shown to be a cost-effective method for simulation of the interfacial behavior of FRP-to-concrete and FRP-to-masonry Recently, significant research has been conducted to simulate the response of masonry structures to static and dynamic loads In this paper, a finite element model is described for use simulating the bond–slip behavior at the interface between NSM CFRP strips and clay brick masonry. The interface was simulated using a layer of 1 In a continuum model, the brick units and mortar joints that make up the masonry are discritized and modelled individually. In this study, the brick units were typical 10-hole cored clay brick units, with nominal dimensions of 230 The Drucker–Prager strength model, commonly used to model the behavior of brittle materials, was used here for the mortar and brick units. The Drucker–Prager yield criterion is given by: A three-dimensional homogenized material model developed previously The failure surface of the basic cell in Smeared crack material models are commonly used to simulate the non-linear macro-level behavior of URM structures since they are computationally inexpensive and can provide reasonably accurate results The FRP composites being modelled here were adhesively bonded to the masonry. The NSM CFRP strips used in pull tests were 20 The FRP-to-masonry interface behaves like an isotropic material and can be modelled by a thin layer of elements. The strength criterion of the thin layer interface material is dominated by shear debonding failure The homogenized material model for masonry together with an elastic material model for the CFRP and the bi-linear interface element material model were coded into the finite element program LSDYNA to simulate the behavior of a NSM CFRP plate bonded to a masonry prism in a pull test. In the experiments reported by Yang  It should be noted that although the continuum, smeared crack and homogenized models all gave reliable estimates for the local bond–slip relationship and global load–displacement curves for the pull tests, the respective times to complete the numerical simulation using these models varied significantly. For the same pull-test simulation, the calculation time for the homogenized model was about 75% and 90% less than that for the smeared crack and continuum models, respectively, as shown in Only the homogenized model was used in this phase of the project to simulate the response of a full-scale FRP-strengthened URM wall under out-of-plane loading owing to its superior computational efficiency as demonstrated by the pull-test analyses. The wall considered here had been severely damaged due to previous testing as an unreinforced wall under reverse-cyclic loading   Numerical methods have been used to analyze the response of FRP reinforced URM walls under out-of-plane loading. The bond behavior of the interface between the NSM CFRP reinforcement and the clay brick masonry was simulated using 1
