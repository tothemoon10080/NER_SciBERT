Thiophosphorous compounds: diisobutyl dithiophosphate (DIBDTPA), diisobutyl dithiophosphinate (DIBDTPI), diisobutyl monothiophosphate (DIBMTPA) and diisobutyl monothiophosphinate (DIBMTPI) are widely used as flotation collectors and corrosion inhibitors, though the true nature of their bonding mechanisms to solid surfaces is still unclear. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this study investigates the structure-reactivity relationship of these thiophosphorus molecules as flotation collectors with sulfide minerals. The results indicate that the O atom(s) bonded to the P atom in thiophosphorus molecules can significantly impact the chemical reactivity of the S atom(s) in the four reagents, and for DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI, they could even attend the chemical bond formation with metal atoms. The reactive power of the four compounds to mineral surfaces of Cu, Au, Ag and Pb sulfides is predicted to be DIBDTPI≫DIBMTPI≥DIBDTPA>DIBMTPA, and their flotation selectivity against pyrite and sphalerite is suggested as DIBDTPA<DIBDTPI<DIBMTPI<DIBMTPA. Moreover, the thione form of acid or ion species of DIBMTPA or DIBMTPI is more stable than its thiol form, and in aqueous phases, the ionized thione of the four thiophosphorus collectors exhibits the strongest affinity to mineral surfaces. The theoretical results provide an atomic level understanding of the adsorption activity and selectivity of the four thiophosphorus molecules to metal sulfide minerals and a potential approach to molecular design of new thiophosphorous compounds for improving the flotation recovery of them.The chelate reagents dithiophosphate (DTPA), dithiophosphinate (DTPI), monothiophosphate (MTPA), and monothiophosphinate (MTPI) are able to form metal complexes with various metal ions, In the last decades, the quantum chemical methods have been developed to a point where they have become an essential tool for the most important researches in the field of reactive system. With affordable computing power and acceptable reliability, the density functional theory (DFT) has been extensively adopted as a plausible alternative to traditional ab initio methods for the study of structure and property of various organics The chemical reactivity of a collector depends on certain quantum-chemical parameters such as composition and energy of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) In the present study, DFT was employed to determine the optimal molecular structure and calculate the relative energy (Δ In this study all computational analysis was performed using Gaussian03 Sulfydryl collectors, such as DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI, could react with a sulfide mineral by a frontier-controlled reaction, The reaction energy is composed of electrostatic effect, normal covalent bond, and back donation covalent bond orderly. The energy of electrostatic effect is proportional to the net charge value at the reactive center of flotation reagent or mineral. The energy of normal covalent bond depends on the electron-donating power of reagent and electron-accepting power of mineral. The energy of back donation covalent bond is related to electron-back-donating power of mineral and electron-accepting power of reagent. The chemical reaction between thiophosphorus collector and sulfide mineral is a frontier-controlled reaction, thereby making the normal covalent bond and back donation covalent bond especially important in assessing the adsorption mechanics of collectors with metal or sulfide mineral surfaces. DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI may exist as acid and ion species in aqueous solutions as shown in The optimized geometric parameters of DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI are given in  The results in The calculated total energy The results in  The presence of solvent (water) shows an interesting effect on HOMO energy of DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA and DIBMTPI acids. Placing acid species from vacuum into water decreases the HOMO energy. It is evident that surrounding water weakens electron-donating ability of acid species. And water shows a similar effect on the SOMO energy of these thiophosphorus reagents. The HOMO or SOMO energy of DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA or DIBMTPI ion is higher than that of its corresponding acid species in both vacuum and aqueous phases. As a result, the ion species exhibits stronger electron-donating ability to transfer electrons to metal atoms on mineral or metal surfaces in aqueous solutions. Another remarkable trend shown in The theoretical analysis of the data in The compositions of HOMO, SOMO and LUMO obtained by GaussView3.0 are shown in   For SOMO, the presence of water increases the contribution of the reactive p(S1) orbital of the acid species of DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI or DIBMTPI, and slightly decreases that of DIBMTPA. For the four thiophosphorus ion species, SOMO's contribution values of the reactive p orbital of sulfur atom(s) follow the order as: DIBDTPA For DIBMTPI and DIBDTPI, the contribution of the reactive p orbital of the sulfur atom(s) in their ion species to HOMO and SOMO compositions is similar to or even less than that of their corresponding acid species in aqueous solutions. This result suggests the acid species of DIBMTPI and DIBDTPI has stronger collecting power. The LUMO of the acid or ion species of DIBDTPA, DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA or DIBMTPI is mainly composed of 3s orbitals of phosphorus atoms in the four collector molecules ( The results in The calculated Mulliken and Natural atomic charge values are given in The Natural atomic charge values of S1 atom in ion species follow the order of DIBDTPA  The band gap of chalcopyrite, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, silver sulfide, gold and silver is shown in Among the four thiophosphorus collectors, DIBDTPI has the strongest electron-donating and accepting ability, indicating the strongest collecting power for sulfide minerals ( DIBMTPI and DIBDTPA have similar collecting power for sulfide minerals ( In the four collectors, DIBMTPA shows the weakest electron-donating and accepting ability ( In this work, the molecular structures and parameters of acid and ion species of thione and thiol tautomers of DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA, DIBMTPI and DIBDTPA were computed by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31 The sulfur atom of P The ion species of DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA, DIBMTPI or DIBDTPA is predominant in aqueous solutions at pH over 6 and exhibits superior chemical reactivity compared to its corresponding acid species. The S1 and X3 atoms in The theoretical results provide an atomic level understanding of the adsorption activity and selectivity of DIBDTPI, DIBMTPA, DIBMTPI and DIBDTPA to metal and sulfide mineral surfaces, introducing a potential approach to molecular design of new thiophosphorous compounds for improving the flotation recovery of valuable minerals.
