Researchers have been unable to incorporate the copper(II)–thiosulphate complexes in Eh-pH or species distribution diagrams due to the unreliability of the reported stability constants. The present work describes a concurrent thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of literature data to show that the reaction between copper(II) and thiosulphate ions takes place via the formation of an unstable

                     . This minimizes thiosulphate degradation to tetrathionate via the disproportionation of Cu(II)(S2O3)1–2. However, the presence of carbonate enhances the overall thiosulphate consumption and trithionate and sulphate formation, leading to a lower gold extraction. In a thiosulphate deficient leach liquor, such as that produced in the presence of carbonate, gold precipitation takes place via disproportionation reactions. The addition of sulphite reproduces thiosulphate from tetrathionate, but slowly precipitates gold.Thiosulphate is an intermediate product of the oxidation of iron sulphides ( However, the oxygenated thiosulphate system has been recognized as a promising non-cyanide gold lixiviant in the presence of ammonia. Recent research publications have highlighted the advantages and problems associated with the use of the oxygenated thiosulphate system as a non-cyanide gold lixiviant in the presence of copper(II) and ammonia ( The thiosulphate degradation and consumption is unavoidable and detrimental to overall gold leaching due to high reagent cost, precipitation of gypsum, metallic gold and/or Au A proper analysis of leaching kinetics requires reliable information on chemical speciation based on stability constants of copper(II)/(I) complexes listed in The aim of the present investigation is to (i) carry out a concurrent thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the data reported by In the case of non-ammoniacal gold leaching by oxygenated thiosulphate, it is expected that the concentration of thiosulphate (ligand) and oxygen (oxidant) would control the kinetics of gold leaching and thiosulphate degradation that involve a series of reactions (Eqs.

This also precipitates gold in thiosulphate deficient leach liquors. The author gratefully acknowledges the continuous support of the A.J. Parker Cooperative Research Centre for Hydrometallurgy.
