The effect of niobium addition on the microstructure of cast AISI H13 hot work tool steel was evaluated by using EDX analyzer attached to the scanning electron microscope. The volume percent of eutectic area and eutectic cell size and also volume percent of different carbides of new steel, which is heat treated under different conditions, are also determined. The results show that the a niobium addition modifies the cast structure of Nb-alloyed hot work tool steel, and reduces the size and volume of eutectic cells, and increases the maximum hardness of the steel.
