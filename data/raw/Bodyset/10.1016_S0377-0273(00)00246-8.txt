In addition to a number of epithermal ore deposits, some porphyry-type ore deposits are also hosted by ash-flow calderas. Spatial correlation between ash-flow calderas and these deposits is observed in several parts of the world, but temporal correlation between the mineralization and the episode of caldera formation remains unclear, especially because geochronological data indicate that the mineralization may date to several million years before or after caldera formation. Because caldera collapse represents only a very short event in a long time-scale evolution between a silicic magma chamber and its host rocks, we have developed a thermo-mechanical model of upper crustal and magmatic system behavior during the pre- and post-caldera formation stages. Major petrophysical properties of ash-flow caldera related rocks are incorporated into the model, which accounts for brittle–elasto-ductile rheology and heat transfer, and reproduces fault initiation and various caldera collapse scenarios. Large-scale mechanisms of initiation of thermal and structural traps for epithermal ore deposits are described. In particular, we found that the outer sides of caldera border faults are associated with both anomalous heat-transfer and a high fracture density. The finite size of the insulating intracaldera units forces the accumulated heat excess to be laterally transferred across the border faults. In most cases, the model predicts “Y-shaped” fault geometry, which is surprisingly similar to that of mineralized faults in the field. Variations in lithostatic pressure on the magma chamber roof and in the vicinity of the border faults can reach 10 to 20MPa, with deep overpressured zones close to the inner edge of the chamber corners. Despite the fact that hydrothermal convection and fluid geochemistry are not included in the model, these thermal and mechanical results are believed to constrain the conditions for mineralization processes. Our results show that in the presence of regional extension, the development of caldera border faults may be suppressed to the advantage of deep-seated fractures, clustered above the central part of the magma chamber, thus favoring conditions for the formation of porphyry-type ore deposits. Finally, we demonstrate that well before the eruption, the gradual emplacement of a hot and large silicic magma chamber may create significant extensional stress in the brittle upper crust, resulting in breakup and pre-eruptive normal faulting and thus allowing for conditions of pre-caldera mineralization.Epithermal ore deposits are commonly associated with fractured and faulted zones in the upper crust, where circulating hydrothermal fluids exchange heat and matter with the host rocks allowing mineralization processes to take place. These fluids, enriched with metals from an underlying magma chamber, are absorbed by the meteoric water participating in the hydrothermal circulation ( The existence of a genetic link between caldera systems and ore deposits is not, however, fully accepted because of a number of mis-correlations in the time domain, with caldera formation being separated from the mineralization stages by as much as several million years (see examples in The first objective of this study is to demonstrate how and why favorable traps for minerals and ore deposits can be created in ash-flow caldera settings. We present some thermal and mechanical processes that lead to enhanced “trapping” capabilities of the outer sides of the border faults. The presence and location of major faults (such as border faults) are shown to be strongly dependent on magma chamber geometry, in addition to being controlled by the regional stress regime. The geometry of major faults appears to be more sensitive to temperature-dependent rheology. Depending on the evolution of the extensional stress regime, ore deposits can switch from being epithermal type to porphyry type. Our results also describe how conjugate faults joining at depth (“Y-shaped” faults) are created at caldera borders. The second objective deals with temporal relationships: we show that the border faults of ash-flow calderas can be initiated long before eruption (and thus before caldera collapse) by certain thermo-mechanical processes that may occur during magma reservoir settlement within the shallow crust. Hence, mineralization that precedes caldera formation may in fact be compatible with the “genetic link” concept, implying that simple geochronological data alone are not sufficient to discriminate whether ore deposit formation and caldera collapse are closely related or not. Our calculations also show that long-term or quasi steady-state anomalous stress/pressure variations and heat transfer processes need to be considered during a study of mineralization timing. Although our interpretations are constrained by several field examples, the reader should bear in mind that mineralization cannot be modeled without taking into account both thermal and mechanical processes (this study) and also hydrodynamic and chemical interactions between the hot mineralized fluids and their fractured host rocks. Unfortunately, the formation of thermal and structural traps for ore deposits has not been sufficiently studied and understood yet, to support the creation of a complete four-fold coupled model. For example, fluid circulation can be largely controlled by poorly constrained permeability variations in the fractured host matrix. On the other hand, some authors claim that the presence of strong (e.g. fault induced) pressure gradients can completely overprint and dilute the effect of the permeable matrix on the fluid pathways (Y. Podladchikov, personal communication). Once formed, ash-flow (or ignimbrite) calderas can clearly provide favorable conditions for mineralization: the underlying silicic magma chamber may be sufficiently hot to maintain a strong circulation of hydrothermal fluids within the permeable ash-flow units. Intracaldera rocks have very different physical properties from those of adjacent units (see Despite such favorable geological features, ash-flow calderas are not necessarily mineralized. In some cases, neighboring calderas, apparently formed under similar conditions appear either barren or mineralized, such as the Los Frailes and Rodalquilar-Lomilla calderas in southeastern Spain, ( In order to illuminate the mineralization potential of ash-flow calderas, we adopted an approach aimed at understanding large-scale thermo-mechanical processes responsible for initiating thermal and structural traps for ore deposits. To achieve this, we took into consideration “caldera-scale” factors (i.e. the “host rock-fault-ignimbrite” system together with the magma chamber) as well as external parameters such as the regional stress field and thermal regimes of the crust. Inherently, we assumed in this study that ore deposit formation is favored in areas where fracture density is the highest and where particular heat and mass exchanges are likely to take place. Hydrothermal convection and fluid geochemistry were not included although we accept that mineralization processes cannot be studied in detail without considering a fully coupled model (thermal, mechanical, hydrodynamical and chemical). Calderas associated with explosive ash-flow eruptions have been studied for several decades (e.g. In our previous study ( We consider two different scenarios. (1) Caldera collapse assuming an existing magma chamber with a pre-defined rectangular chamber geometry. For most experiments, we assumed a steady-state geotherm and no heat transport during the collapse stage, although some were carried out in the fully coupled thermo-mechanical mode. (2) A fully coupled thermo-mechanical model taking into account the final stages of chamber emplacement within the upper crust, surface uplift and subsequent subsidence, although no magma eruption was imposed. In this second scenario, we implicitly assume a light, i.e. gravitationally unstable, magmatic body which settles at shallow levels. Magma ascent continues until either (a) gravitational equilibrium with the surroundings is reached, (b) the magma chamber is faced with a strong rheological barrier, or (c) the thermal energy stored in the body is capable of maintaining the magma and its direct vicinity hot and sufficiently weak (or any combination of the three). Although other ascent mechanisms could have been considered, this one was selected because it allows us to investigate the effects of the final stage of magma chamber emplacement. Results from this second scenario are described in The cumulative thickness of intracaldera units commonly exceeds 1 The assumed geometry and the rheological and lithological properties are summarized in  The results of these experiments ( It is noteworthy that secondary inclined faults are commonly initiated at the outer caldera edges, even in the case of the one single-side faulted cover (when In a series of other calculations, regional extension was applied to the model, which had a significant effect on stress distribution. Assuming a constant regional extension of 10 Ash-flow calderas represent specific geological systems such as sedimentary basins, where thermally insulating rocks are embedded in thermally conductive fractured rocks (thermal conductivities  The results show that in the caldera case (c), a thermal anomaly (vertical heat flow excess) develops at depth along the outer sides of the conducting fault ( In the previous numerical modeling (   A number of ore deposits hosted in ash-flow calderas predate the caldera collapse, as shown in It has been shown that the insulating intracaldera units tend to increase lateral heat transfer towards the border faults. Along the outer sides of the border faults, a combination of thermally anomalous areas and a high fracture density improves the “trapping” capabilities of these zones. However, before explosive eruption and caldera collapse, and thus pre-deposition of a thick insulating cover, no blanketing effect exists, and there is no reason a priori for preferential mineralization in the vicinity of the rounded edges of the magma chamber. Nevertheless, field data and geochronological data seem to indicate that pre-collapse mineralization stages do occur in some large ash-flow calderas. A new mechanism acting prior to the eruption phase could explain pre-caldera mineralization. When large and hot silicic magma chambers settle at shallow crustal levels, the hot magma significantly disturbs the thermal regime of the crust, and thus its stable stratified rheology. The magma chamber roof is deformed and the BDT zone is raised around the reservoir, delineating the “thermo-mechanical geometry” of the magma chamber. It follows that the upper crust forms a thinned brittle layer above the reservoir, which becomes more and more elongated. Fractures and cracks are thus more easily initiated within this layer. The second set of experiments was intended to investigate a number of phenomena that can precede magma chamber emplacement and caldera collapse. The detailed investigation of possible emplacement mechanisms is largely beyond the scope of this study and would require in itself an individual study. For this reason, we decided to focus our analysis to the thermo-mechanical consequences of emplacement and thus only consider a simplified hypothetical situation, in which an initial spherical magma chamber, deeper than its final emplacement depth, ascends under positive buoyancy forces (e.g.  In all cases, we observe strong pressure gradients from the center of the chamber roof towards the borders, as well as fault-induced pressure gradients. Active faults may be associated with high local pressure due to shearing on fault surfaces. The internal fault geometry defines the direction of pressure gradients associated with the fault (see the “valve effect” described by Despite the absence of surface loads (no eruption in these simulations), the magmatic overpressure tends to focus the shear stress and the major deformation structures in the vicinity of the rounded edges of the reservoir, thus creating “pre-eruptive” border faults within the brittle part of the upper crust. In addition to these “pre-eruptive” border faults, we observe the formation of a subhorizontal fault, corresponding to the horizontal portion of the BDT zone (above the magma chamber roof), and thus representing another possible fluid pathway. This “pre-cutting” of the upper crust may favor a particular style of collapse once explosive eruption occurs. It may also promote preferential pathways subsequently followed by hydrothermal fluids. The major result here is related to the pre-existence of structural traps before eruption and thus before caldera formation. At that time, the heat source is clearly present because the magma has not cooled sufficiently to be frozen by the surroundings. It follows from these experiments that thermal and structural traps can be formed long before caldera collapse. Numerous field examples show that eruptions of several rhyodacite domes along border faults predate caldera collapse (see Several authors have investigated the mineral potential of ash-flow calderas, but the genetic link between the ore deposits and caldera formation remains controversial. Field observations over several decades have shown that ash-flow caldera features (e.g. the presence of ignimbrites and ring faults) represent a kind of exploration guide for mining geologists. However, it is often difficult to recognize ash-flow caldera signatures in the field because of intensive erosion probably related to the proximity of subduction zones. Our results have shown that the location and distribution of traps for ore deposits strongly depend on large-scale factors, such as magma chamber geometry and regional tectonics. Therefore, it seems useful to incorporate these large-scale factors and the long-term evolution of calderas into mineral exploration strategies. Favorable areas, i.e. the outer sides of the border faults, have been described in terms of steady-state heat refraction effects, density of potential brittle failure, and thus potential hydrothermal fluid pathways. Our study evidently lacks fluid dynamics within such systems, and fluid geochemistry in the presence of an anomalous thermal field. As such an approach would need to take into account so many other parameters (fluid properties and compositions, rock porosities and permeabilities, etc.), we decided to first restrict this new thermo-mechanical modeling to a simple and unresolved problem. Despite the absence of fluids, “Y-shaped” border faults of ash-flow calderas have been obtained and because these geometries are common in mining districts, our modeling approach seems to successfully reproduce the basic principles of the thermo-mechanical processes associated with caldera settings. According to our results, the conditions for epithermal gold mineralization (high and low sulfidation) can switch to those for porphyry mineralization under the influence of regional extension. In subduction-related volcanic settings, this regional change is very likely to occur because the amount of retrograde motion of subduction zones as well as the dip angle of subducted slabs can undergo marked changes over a few million years ( The most intriguing result of our modeling remains the “pre-cutting” of the upper crust when silicic magma chambers settle at shallow depths. It seems that faulting conditions for caldera collapse might be conditioned by the pre-eruptive history of the magmatic system. The amount of overpressure needed to lead to the development of pre-eruptive faults should be easily reached with large and voluminous magma reservoirs. In consequence, pre-collapse mineralization would only occur for large caldera areas, as suggested in Another surprising phenomenon is a juxtaposition of some low/high sulfidation ore deposits with porphyry-type ore deposits (e.g. This paper has greatly benefited from the ideas of and discussions with Bob Brathwaite, Eric Marcoux, Alexis Poliakov and Yuri Podladchikov.

To compute the thermal field in the three cases of The steady-state heat equation in Cartesian geometry writes: Farther away from the fault, at For the third case, one condition is missing for solving the heat equation: we have imposed a final condition at the surface and at the center of the caldera: Solutions for temperature distribution, vertical gradient and vertical heat flow are expressed with Fourier series.
