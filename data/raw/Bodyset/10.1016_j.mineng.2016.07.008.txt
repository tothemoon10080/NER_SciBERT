The present volume contains a compilation of papers presented at the 7th International Flotation Conference (Flotation ’15), held on 16–19 November 2015 at the Vineyard Hotel in Cape Town, South Africa. The event gathered 241 delegates from 27 countries, as usual a well-balanced attendance between froth flotation researchers and practitioners. The technical programme was divided into two, 2-day symposia: ‘Flotation Fundamentals: Physics and Chemistry’ and ‘Flotation Applications and Plant Practice’. There were keynote lectures for each day of the conference, presented by Prof. Jan Cilliers (Imperial College London), Dr. Janusz Laskowski (University of British Columbia), Prof. D.R. Nagaraj (Cytec) and Peter Amelunxen (Aminpro Chile). The technical sessions and poster papers presented during the conference covered a wide range of current flotation research, both fundamental and applied. Authors were invited to submit final papers after the conference, in order to give them the opportunity of taking into account discussions at the meeting when editing their final work. This special issue contains 26 of those papers, which were peer-reviewed for publication. I would like to thank all the authors for their valuable contributions and also the referees, whose time and efforts have been instrumental in producing this special issue of Minerals Engineering. I look forward to Flotation ’17 in Cape Town, South Africa, from November 13–16, 2017.
