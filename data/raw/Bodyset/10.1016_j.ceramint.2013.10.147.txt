Alpha-alumina–boron nitride (α-Al2O3–BN) nanocomposite was synthesized using mixtures of aluminum nitride, boron oxide and pure aluminum as raw materials via mechanochemical process under a low pressure of nitrogen gas (0.5MPa). The phase transformation and structural evaluation during mechanochemical process were investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques. The results indicated that high exothermic reaction of Al–B2O3 systems under the nitrogen pressure produced alumina, aluminum nitride (AlN), and aluminum oxynitride (Al5O6N) depending on the Al value and milling time, but no trace of boron nitride (BN) phases could be identified. On the other hand, AlN addition as a solid nitrogen source was effective in fabricating in-situ BN phase after 4h milling process. In Al–B2O3–AlN system, the aluminothermic reaction provided sufficient heat for activating reaction between B2O3 and AlN to form BN compound. DTA analysis results showed that by increasing the activation time to 3h, the temperature of both thermite and synthesis reactions significantly decreased and occurred as a one-step reaction. SEM and TEM observations confirmed that the range of particle size was within 100nm.Due to excellent properties such as high hardness and wear resistance, good thermal conductivity and high temperature stability, alumina (Al By conventional ex-situ methods, the reinforcement is prepared separately and then mixed with matrix; the synthesis of BN composites is difficult due to the large BN agglomerates or BN platelets possibly preexisting in raw powders Generally, boron nitride is being synthesized via (i) carbothermic reduction of boron oxide with simultaneous nitridation and (ii) direct interaction between boron and nitrogen in a self-sustained mode In our previous work, mechanical activation process was used to synthesis Al Our research indicated that synthesis of Al The precursor materials were aluminum (Merck, 99.7% purity, particles size 40±5 XRD analysis of the samples was carried out using a D8 Advance spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu radiation (K The crystallite size and lattice strain of samples is calculated by using Williamson–Hall method The reaction process and features were also investigated by thermal analyses (DTA; model BÄHR 503). A small amount of the reactants weighing about 50±5 Based on the thermodynamic data The general form of the reactions taking place in ternary system Al–B This reaction includes two stages: first, reduction of B Depending on the milling conditions and enthalpy of reaction, mechanochemical reactions classify into two categories: progressive (gradual) reaction and mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) In Calculated DTA technique were utilized to investigate the reaction mechanism and to study the effect of the activation time on thermite reactions behavior and initial reaction temperature. For these purposes, the Al and B The XRD trace of 3 In this case, after 3 In this case, direct nitridation of boron element produced from aluminothermic reaction, in both thermal and mechanochemical process failed to produce BN. As a result, in next step, AlN addition as a solid nitridation source was selected to investigate its effect on the progression of BN formation. Formation of Al During ball milling at room temperature, reactions  In order to investigate the effect of milling time on structural characteristics, the grain size and lattice strain of powder mixtures of sample with stoichiometric ratio Al were estimated from broadening of XRD peaks using the Williamson–Hall method ( Refinement of the crystallite size to nanometer range and increasing the defect densities can promote the reaction kinetics by providing short-circuit diffusion paths  In this case, the system involved one ductile powder (Al) and two brittle powders (AlN and B Unlike thermodynamics evaluations on feasibility of formation of BN in binary mixture of Al–B However, as AlN compound was added to powder mixture (Al:B The SEM micrographs illustrated that after 4
