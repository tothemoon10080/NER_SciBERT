The formation of intermetallic compounds and the shear strength of Sn–Zn–Bi solder alloys with various (0, 1, 3, 5 and 7wt%) weight percentages of Sn–Ag–Cu were investigated on Au/Ni metallized Cu pads depending on the number of reflow cycles. In Sn–Zn–Bi solder joints, scallop-shaped AuZn3 intermetallic compound (IMC) particles were found at the interfaces and in the solder ball regions, fine Bi- and needle-shaped Zn-rich phase were observed in the Sn matrix. After Sn–Ag–Cu additions, an additional Ag–Zn intermetallic compound layer was adhered to the top surface of the AuZn3 layer at the interface and fine spherical-shaped AgZn3 intermetallic compound particles were detected in the solder ball regions together with Bi- and Zn-rich phase volumes. After the addition of Sn–Ag–Cu, the shear strength of Sn–Zn–Bi solder joints increased due to the formation of the fine AgZn3 intermetallic compound particles. The shear strengths of Sn–Zn–Bi and Sn–Zn–Bi/7wt% Sn–Ag–Cu solder joints after one reflow cycle were about 44.5 and 53.1MPa, respectively and their shear strengths after eight reflow cycles were about 43.4 and 51.6MPa, respectively.The development of environmental-friendly solders, namely, lead-free solders, has become a great concern for material scientists in recent years since lead is a toxic element and is harmful to health Among the lead-free solders, eutectic or near eutectic Sn–Zn solder is regarded as a suitable replacement for Sn–Pb solders due to its low melting temperature as compared with other Sn-based, lead-free solder as well as low cost One innovative, potentially viable and economically affordable approach, to stabilize a fine grain microstructure, give homogeneous deformation of solder joints as well as improve the mechanical properties of a solder, is the addition of an appropriate secondary phase to a solder matrix for the formation of Zn-based intermetallic compound. In this study, as a new approach, Sn–Zn–Bi alloys with various additions of secondary Sn–3.5Ag–0.5Cu were prepared by mechanically dispersing different weight percentages (0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 The Sn–8Zn–3Bi solders balls with different weight percentages of Sn–3.5Ag–0.5Cu were prepared primarily by mechanically dispersing different weight percentages (1, 3, 5, and 7 The solder joints were made by soldering between flexible ball grid array (BGA) substrates with Au/Ni/Cu coated pads. The solder balls were placed on the prefluxed coated pad and then reflow at 245 Ball shear tests were performed on the reflowed samples using a shear tester (PTR-1000, Rhesca Co. Ltd., Japan) with a shear tool height of 50      With an exposure of Sn–Zn–Bi solder to a high-temperature and high-humidity atmosphere, the Zn on the free surface will soon react with water vapor or oxygen and form ZnO on the free surface. At the same time, Zn will also diffuse along the Sn grain boundaries to the free surface and form oxides near the free surface because of its rapid diffusion along the Sn grain boundaries Since solder joints are often subjected to mechanical loading during processing and system use, good mechanical properties of solder joints, such as high shear strength and creep resistance, are essential for solder joint reliability. Therefore, ball shear tests were performed to evaluate the strength of solder joints as a function of the number of reflow cycles. After measuring the interfacial strength, fracture surfaces of the solder were examined using a scanning electron microscope.  Since the fracture occurred inside the solder, the difference in shear strength should be independent of the interfacial structure. After the addition of Sn–Ag–Cu, the shear strengths consistently increased with an increase in the Sn–Ag–Cu content as a result of the uniform distribution of fine AgZn In the present study, the interfacial reactions, the morphology of intermetallic compound particles and shear strength between Sn–Zn–Bi solder joints with different weight percentages of Sn–Ag–Cu and Au/Ni metallized Cu substrates were investigated for up to eight reflow cycles. The results of this study are summarized as follows: At the interfaces between the solder and Au/Ni metallized Cu pads, scallop-shaped AuZn In the solder ball regions, a fine Bi-rich and Zn-rich phases were detected in the Sn matrix in the Sn–Zn–Bi solder. However, in the Sn–Ag–Cu containing solder joints, additional AgZn The solder joints with a high percentage of Sn–Ag–Cu showed consistently higher strength than that of solder joints with a lower Sn–Ag–Cu content at different reflow cycles due to the formation of AgZn The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by
