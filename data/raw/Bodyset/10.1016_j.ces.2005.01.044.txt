An improved discretized population balance equation (PBE) is proposed in this study. This improved discretized PBE has new probability distribution functions for aggregates produced in non-uniform discrete coagulation modeling. The authors extended an improved particle coagulation model previously developed to an adjustable geometric size interval

                     ). This model was compared with exact numerical solutions of continuous (uniform discretized) PBEs and applied to simulate the particle aggregation and breakup with fractal dimensions lower than 3. Further, comparisons were made using the fractal aggregate collision mechanisms of orthokinetic coagulation with the inclusion of flow induced breakup.
                  In the course of the investigation the new algorithm was found to be a substantial improvement in terms of numerical accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency over the continuous model. This new algorithm makes it possible to solve fractal particle aggregation and breakup problems with high accuracy, perfect mass conservation, and exceptional computational efficiency, thus the new model can be used to develop predictive simulation techniques for the coupled coagulation using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and chemical reaction modeling.Coagulation is the multi-step process of producing larger aggregates by collisions and subsequent bonding or coalescing of smaller particles contained in a fluid. The particles can be either solid or fluid materials suspended in a gas or liquid. Particle collisions are induced by inter particle motions that have been attributed to three basic mechanisms: fluid motion or orthokinetic coagulation, Brownian diffusion or perikinetic coagulation and buoyancy or differential sedimentation. Fluid motion also creates disruptive stresses that can cause fracture of the agglomerates. In recent years, numerous studies have attempted to solve the particle aggregation problem consisting of the continuous population balance equations (PBEs), where the continuous PBE can be expressed as an uniform discretized equation ( To obtain exact numerical solutions of the continuous PBE (Eq. Relatively, little attention has been paid to fractal particle coagulation modeling. Spherical particle coalescence applies only to ideal bubbles and droplets and most particle aggregates are found to be fractal, especially in solid colloidal particle coagulation. Thus, fractal coagulation modeling is needed for realistic simulation. This paper will examine an improved technique of PBE discretization and compare them to exact numerical solution of uniform discretized PBE. Further, modifications and comparisons are made to incorporate breakup in the orthokinetic population balances with the inclusion of flow induced fracture. Finally, model comparisons are made using simulation data of particle size distributions, conservation of mass, and computational time. Hill and Ng produced a discretized PBE based on probability density functions in each interval Aggregate breakup mechanisms have been applied to various fields, such as floc disintegration, droplet fragmentation, and comminution of particle solids ( Researchers have proposed the breakup distribution function (or probability function), The breakup rate coefficient, In a straightforward manner, a final coagulation population balance model can be obtained from the combination of aggregation and breakup, yielding an overall PBE. Thus, an overall continuous PBE with aggregation and breakup reactions can be expressed by Eq. In both continuous and discrete modeling, the volume and/or radii of the particles are significant parameters. In droplet coalescence, conservation of the volumes will produce a new droplet radius and is easily computed. In terms of a size class, such a radius is given by Furthermore, coagulation simulation using Eq. The collision frequency kernel, For dimensionless concentration, Eq. The PBM of Eq. The effects of aggregate fractal dimension ( Using the improved discretized population balance model of Eq. Furthermore, a mass conservation factor (MCF) concept was used for evaluating the model numerical stability and is given as Incorporating Eqs. In From In examining the computational efficiency, the continuous PBM (Eq. Comparing CPU time, the improved discretized PBM has a much higher computational efficiency than the continuous model. Further, as expected, CPU time is inversely proportional to the magnitude of both Computational efficiency is a direct relationship to the number of size intervals or the number of variables. As shown in For the purpose of fractal aggregate coagulation modeling, the authors improved the discretized population balance equations having an aggregation and breakup kernel. After direct numerical simulation, the accuracy of this model was verified using the lowered geometric size interval ( As a result, this proposed discretized population balance equation can be used for fractal aggregate orthokinetic coagulation model on the basis of numerical accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency.
