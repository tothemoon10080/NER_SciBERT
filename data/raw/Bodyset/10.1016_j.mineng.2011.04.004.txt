The Second, process modelling featured prominently. Modelling outputs were in several papers demonstrated to be consistent with experimental and observational results, and the resultant proposed circuit changes showed tangible positive impacts on the bottom line of these operations. Again, a powerful demonstration that theoretical work can result in real economic benefits to the industry. And finally, innovation â€“ the conference spanned several technologies that have shown commercial promise, such as pneumatic flotation, new refractory gold processes, and microwave treatment to render ores more brittle and friable. Some key questions were left to the delegates to ponder by the time the conference ended. Will soft socio-political agendas dictate hard process flowsheet selection? Are new step changes in refractory gold treatment on the horizon? Will hydrometallurgical refineries ultimately replace traditional pyrometallurgical PGM smelters?
