Column floatation processes are multivariable, complex and difficult to model systems. Usually linear single input/single output (SISO) models are derived from experimental data and process analysis, using prior knowledge of the process. However, it is highly preferable to use multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) models, which are much more accurate. However, this type of models is much more difficult to identify. This paper proposes a methodology to automatically identify a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) model obtained from experimental data, using a fuzzy modelling strategy. The process has four manipulating variables: feed flow rate, which in normal industrial operation is usually kept constant, washing water, air and rejected flow rates. The outputs of this model, which are normally used to control the grade and the recovery in the flotation column, are the froth layer height, the bias flow rate and the air holdup in the collection zone. By using the regularity criterion, it was possible to determine the structure of the MIMO model without any prior knowledge of the process dynamic. The final model is validated using different experimental data. The experimental data was acquired in a pilot scale laboratory flotation column of 3.2m height by 80mm of diameter.Nowadays column flotation is an important mineral processing unit. It is a complex multivariable process undergoing several disturbances, such as those originated by changes in feed characteristics and in equipment wearing ( Classic and modern approaches to process control rely on the availability of dynamic models of the process. However, until now it was not possible to develop a phenomenological dynamic model of the column flotation, due mainly to the following difficulties: Inaccurate knowledge of the physical and chemical laws of the sub-processes involved. Formulation of nonlinear partial differential equation systems of distributed parameters, due to the geometry of the column, forces to the consideration of the concentration gradient along the axial position. Need to solve a mathematical problem of a movable boundary between the collection and the froth zones. Finally, the difficulties inherent to the acquisition of accurate measures of many variables of the process. This final item is very important. Although there is a large number of columns installed world-wide, there are still unsolved problems related to deficient or lack of instrumentation ( Until now, only linear models have been obtained and used to design the control of the flotation column process ( A study carried out on a pilot plant column flotation showed that only some relations between controlled and manipulated variables could be identified ( This paper proposes the identification of a nonlinear dynamic MIMO fuzzy model ( The number of fuzzy rules (or clusters) that best suits the data must be determined for that identification. The following criterion, as proposed in ( Assuming that input and output data are collected using the pilot scale column flotation, structure identification using this methodology generally entails the following algorithm:            The column flotation process is usually controlled by humans, and it is an unstable process except for a very restricted area of operation. It is a process difficult to model once it is highly nonlinear, and the mathematical relations between variables that describe the process are not completely known. As the process is unstable, it is much more difficult to identify. There are a few empirical relations for some of the process variables, which were described in ( As the process in study is only partly known, it is advantageous to use fuzzy modelling as a way to combine first principles, human knowledge and/or measurements, obtaining an usually called gray-box modelling approach ( The experiments to obtain the data were designed so that all system variables could take all possible values within their respective variable ranges. This procedure was accomplished using white noise generation, so that a signal with many frequency information and non correlated could be used. The column flotation is a slow process. Thus, the output variables take some time to react to the input variables. Therefore, the identification signals were constructed in order to give enough time to the process to respond. Note that usually the feed flow rate is kept constant, but in the real plant this is not always possible and has some oscillations. If the feed flow rate is considered to be constant it will turn to be a disturbance in the system. As this is a measurable disturbance it can be considered as an input of the system. The outputs of the process are the height The RC criterion was used to identify the model structure. The criterion proposed in As an example of the rules obtained it is showed the fuzzy rules for the model of the holdup      The respective membership functions for this model are depicted in Recall that two fuzzy models were compared. The first was obtained using empirical relations between the variables given by experts and described in ( Both performance indexes show clearly that the approach proposed in this paper achieves the best accuracy. Note that both indexes shows a good performance, even for the level The validation of the RC model in different data is presented in The fuzzy modelling identification technique proposed in this paper, where the structure of the model is determined using a regularity criterion and the rules are identified using fuzzy clustering, proves to accomplish a good performance. The approach is applied to a column flotation process, which is a very complex, highly nonlinear and multivariable system. The obtained results shown that the structure of the model is well determined using the regularity criterion. The derived model will be used in the future to control the system in a model predictive control framework. It is expected that this model gives more accurate estimations of the system variables than a classical linear model and consequently more accurate control actions.
