A methodological approach for validation, optimization and lumping of mechanistic models for heavy metal sorption onto composite natural matrices is proposed. It follows a previously developed mechanistic model for biosorption onto olive pomace, based on potentiometric titrations and Cu, Pb and Cd sorption tests at different pH. This model assumes two main kinds of active sites (carboxylic and phenolic groups) and three surface complexation reactions among these sites and metallic species in solution. It is able to represent the biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb according to a general-validity reaction scheme in both acid and basic pH ranges. The identification of the most significant contributions of surface complexes by model simulations, along with sensitivity analysis oriented towards a lumped model, assumes one kind of active site (carboxylic) and two complexation reactions occurring in the pH 3–5 range. Simultaneous regression of titration data, first derivative plot of titration, and sorption data according to this lumped model, allow an improvement of experimental data representation by using a reduced number of parameters (i.e. model discrimination by statistical analysis). Contributions of surface complexes and sensitivity analysis show that all the assumed reactions of this lumped model are significant and necessary to represent biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb in pH range 3–5.Biosorption technology is an innovative waste water treatment to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions ( The accomplishment of product optimisation and continuous process design are the main challenges for biosorption application in large-scale plants ( Information about site-metal interactions can also be derived by using an outstanding approach in equilibrium modelling of sorption phenomena: mechanistic equilibrium models able to describe the effects of the operating conditions in terms of supposed reactions among active sites and metallic species in solution ( The appealing chance of predicting the environmental effects on metal binding can be strongly compromised by the initial choice of the set of reactions among active sites and metallic species, which can be made according to different and equally reasonable ways. The complexity of the model and then the number of adjustable parameters (e.g. active site concentration, equilibrium formation constants for the superficial complexes, electrostatic corrections and non-ideal contributions) should be strictly related to the degree of knowledge of the system. This avoids reaching a better fit only by introducing additional parameters to give flexibility to the model. The main objective of this work is concerned with the analysis, the validation and the eventual lumping or reduction in the number of parameters of a mechanistic model already developed for the description of pH effect on heavy metal biosorption onto olive pomace—an agricultural waste of olive oil production ( Olive pomace was supplied by an Italian olive oil production plant, as pressed and sun dried disks. Solid samples were ground by an electric mixer, washed by distilled water, dried in an oven at 60 °C and stored ( Pomace suspensions (1.6 g of olive pomace in 20 mL of deionized water flushed by N Equilibrium biosorption tests were performed by using 10 g L A mechanistic model for heavy metal biosorption onto olive pomace (defined in the following as Model 1) has been already developed in previous work ( Active sites concentrations are then assumed to be equal to Even though phenolic sites are still associated in the acid pH range, the involvement of these groups in metal removal was assumed because of results of biosorption tests onto samples selectively treated by NaOH for polyphenol extraction and by Surface complexation was considered to be the predominant mechanism operating in metal binding according to the complexing ability of these chemical groups (especially carboxylic) and the HSAB theory of complex formation ( The minimum set of assumed reactions that better represent experimental data are the two protonation reactions, the reaction among carboxylic sites (S In order to facilitate further investigation and model comparison, dimensionless variables were introduced for metal ([Me]*) and proton ([H]*) concentration in bulk solution, metal in solid phase ( Footnote #, in this case Model 1 equations for titration and isotherms can be then rewritten by using dimensionless variables as reported in Dimensionless parameters, evaluated starting from dimensional ones of previous work, are reported in The adequacy of the model schematic was firstly tested by considering the importance of the different contributions of the assumed surface complexes with respect to the total amount of sorbed metal ( The contribution of surface complexes was then considered for the different equilibrium pH investigated in the experimental phase. In Cadmium behaviour is very similar to copper, while lead presents a different behaviour with a predominant contribution of the second reaction surface complexes even at pH 4 ( In addition to surface complex contributions, sensitivity analysis was performed to study how the variation in the output of a model can be apportioned to different sources of variability. Sensitivity analysis can be helpful to evidence if a model resembles the system under study and which model parameters are not significant and can be eliminated by the model (model lumping). In the case of mechanistic modelling where several combinations of chemical reactions among active sites and ionic species can be written, sensitivity analysis allows irrelevant parts of the model to be dropped so that a simpler model can be extracted from a more complex one. In order to evaluate which parameters mainly affect the model output, the first order sensitivity coefficients (S Sensitivity coefficients evaluated for the different metals in the pH range 3–5 at constant metal concentration in liquid phase ([Me]* Sensitivity analysis denoted that the equilibrium constants related to the first site (concentration (  after  The different profiles observed for sensitivity coefficients of equilibrium constants (i.e. monotonic and bell-shaped curves) only depend on the range of observation of sensitivity coefficients. In fact, when sensitivity coefficient curves are considered over a wider range of pH, bell-shaped curves are always observed, but with maximum points shifted at different pH. This shift is due to the different magnitude and relative order of complexation and protonation constants for the different metals. According to previous analysis which showed a low contribution of the third surface complex ( In the literature there are several examples about the analysis of the relative contributions of carboxylic and phenolic groups in metal binding onto humic substances ( The previous model including phenolic sites was aimed to develop a generally valid and extendable schematic. In addition, the negative effect of polyphenol extraction on metal removal observed experimentally ( In particular, it assumes the protonation reaction of the carboxylic sites ( Reaction leading to the binding of Me(OH) According to Model 2, the fractions of metal as hydroxo-complex and the free aquo-species are evaluated by the metal balance (Eq. This change was made to obtain more similar Another difference with respect to the previous model lies in the regression procedure. Model 1 was determined by fixing the parameters related to the titration ( In addition, the simultaneous regression of the first derivative of titration data ( Nonlinear regression of titration and metal isotherms were performed by using different software–Mathcad, Matlab and Scientist–to validate fitting results. This also accounts for the first derivative plot of titration curves for Model 2 with the adjustable parameters reported in Comparing numerical values of parameters by two models it can be observed that: titration model maintains the same parameters except for the shift of   The first two observations confirm the robustness of previously proposed model reaction scheme. In order to compare these two models in a quantitative way a statistical discrimination procedure was performed ( Coefficients of determination do not denote any significant difference between Model 1 and Model 2 except for lead isotherms that are better described by Model 2. As for the scatter diagrams, linear equations and regression coefficients ( In order to assess the statistical significance of the observed differences, model variances for titration and biosorption data were compared: Model variances (MS Further model analysis was performed to evaluate if all surface complexes assumed in Model 2 significantly contribute to metal concentration in the solid phase. Sensitivity analysis also provides evidence that all the reactions assumed in Model 2 are significant and necessary. In particular:    Finally a comparison was attempted among equilibrium constants by Model 2 and others reported in the literature for biosorption onto similar biomaterials ( Biomaterial used for comparisons are: lingo-cellulosic substrates ( humic and fulvic substances containing both carboxylic and phenolic groups ( bacterial and algal biomasses containing carboxylic groups ( Of course the comparison among the complex formation constants of these biomaterials is only qualitative since the chemical structure of olive pomace is both unknown and extremely heterogeneous. The analysis of the parameters indicated that even considering the same class of biosorbents and the same modelling approach (e.g. humic substances and two-site NICA-Donnan models), a wide range of values is reported. Protonation constants for carboxylic groups ranged from log 2.89 to 5.5 with different degrees of heterogeneity ( A methodological approach for the validation and the optimization of mechanistic models of heavy metal sorption onto composite natural matrices is proposed. A non-electrostatic mechanistic model for biosorption onto olive pomace based on potentiometric titrations and Cu, Pb and Cd sorption tests at different pH is considered as the starting point. This model assumes two main active sites (carboxylic and phenolic groups) and three surface complexation reactions between these sites and metallic species in solution. It is able to represent biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb on the pH range 3–5. This model also considered phenolic site reactions, even though these groups generally dissociate over the range of pH 3–5 investigated in biosorption tests. In this way, a general schematic was developed, easily extendable to pH greater than 5. At higher pH, phenolic groups are more significant and metal hydroxo complexes have increasing importance. The development of a lumped model with a reduced number of adjustable parameters, which is strictly valid in the investigated range of pH, is a fundamental mathematical tool especially as constitutive equilibrium equation in dynamic modelling of continuous biosorption processes. The identification of the most significant contributions of surface complexes by the model simulation, along with sensitivity analysis oriented towards a lumped model, assumes one active site (carboxylic) and two complexation reactions in the pH range 3–5. Simultaneous regression of titration data, first derivative plot of titration data and sorption data according to this lumped model allows an improvement of the experimental data representation by using a reduced number of parameters. Contributions of surface complexes and sensitivity analysis indicate that all the assumed reactions are significant to represent biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb in the pH range 3–5. metal concentration in liquid phase (mmol L reference for metal concentration in liquid phase (mmol L dimensionless concentration of metal in liquid phase proton concentration in liquid phase (mol L reference for proton concentration in liquid phase (mol L dimensionless concentration of proton in liquid phase metal concentration in solid phase (mmol g dimensionless concentration of metal in solid phase negative surface charge concentration (mmol g dimensionless concentration of negative surface charge reference concentration in solid phase (mmol g maximum negative surface charge concentration for dimensionless maximum negative surface charge for proton affinity constant for dimensionless proton affinity constant for metal affinity constant for dimensionless metal affinity constant for first hydrolysis constant maximum negative surface charge concentration for dimensionless maximum negative surface charge for proton affinity constant for dimensionless proton affinity constant for metal affinity constant for dimensionless metal affinity constant for Titration data were generally reported as negative charge concentration in the solid phase ( The mass balance equation for the generic The total negative charge concentration in the solid A nonlinear regression of the experimental data expressed as When the adsorbent material presents a dispersion of active sites a continuous approach can be used introducing a probability density function for the logarithm of the protonation equilibrium constant of the active sites ( The relation among fraction of protonated sites When a Langmuir-type Eq. Previous equation can be easily extended considering the presence of different affinity distribution each one characteristic of a specific functional group. Sorption data of multicomponent systems can be represented according to this continuous approach by assuming a competitive Langmuir extension as the local isotherm: Introducing this local isotherm If the monocomponent sorption of different species on the same surface presents different shapes of the distribution function, namely different The simplified case assuming the same mathematical form of The total fraction of active sites occupied by the
