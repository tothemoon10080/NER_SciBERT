Batch flotation test data of a mixture of pyrite and calcite were used to compare regression parameters of four kinetic model structures. The work included the use of unoxidized or a mixture of partially oxidized pyrite (by microwave irradiation). The objective of floating oxidized pyrite was to have mineral particles with different floatability, closer to a real situation. The models considered include: single rate constant, distributed rate constants (i.e. rectangular and gamma distributions), and a recently introduced approach based on fractional calculus. Such models were selected due to their good tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy. The regressions were performed (1) taking all the data points and comparing the mean square error (MSE) and adjusted correlation factor

                     , a predictive factor, E, was defined by subtracting the final measured recovery from the calculation obtained by the model. This allowed to measure the ability of each model to extrapolate the omitted points on the recovery vs. time curve.
                  Results from this study showed that the single constant model had a satisfactory performance with the advantage of having the least parameters compared to the other structures. The gamma model was effective and robust. The rectangular model gave an acceptable goodness of fit but overestimated the maximum and final recovery. Finally, the fractional calculus approach gave the best goodness of fit, overall, but failed in predicting the maximum recovery, which occurred when the derivative order was greater than 1.Flotation is an important mineral concentration process, which involves the attachment of particles suspended in an aqueous medium to bubbles. The bubble-particle aggregates rise to the froth phase, from which they are recovered as concentrate. Whether or not the particle-bubble aggregate forms and reports to concentrate depends on numerous parameters. Such parameters affect the response ( Flotation parameters can be classified into machine, chemical or physical ones ( Unlike factors such as gas flow rate or reagent addition, some cannot be completely controlled ( Design and control of flotation plants relies on the prediction of the species transferred from the pulp to the concentrate, in terms of flotation parameters. As a consequence, extensive research has been conducted on developing models of flotation kinetics. The prediction of flotation metallurgical performance by understanding the kinetics has been a goal pursued by numerous researchers. Flotation kinetics can be defined as the study of concentrate as a function of time, the qualitative determination of all rate control factors and the mechanisms by which such factors affect the recovery and grade. Formal flotation kinetic studies can be traced back more than 50 Kinetic models that consider the flotation process as a reaction between particles and bubbles are popular, due to their simplicity and capacity to simulate reasonably well batch flotation ( For an analogy with chemical reactions, the batch flotation kinetics for the collection zone can be defined as the derivative of concentration of the valuable mineral with respect to time, provided the delivery of bubbles remains constant ( A special case with first-order dependence, To account for flotation classes ( A new approach for describing flotation kinetics that makes use of fractional calculus was recently introduced ( In Eq. In this study, a comparison of several kinetic models was performed. This was performed by two schemes: first, by using all data points of recovery vs. time curves; and second, neglecting the last data points (from 1 to 3). This attempted to show the capability of the models to predict the ultimate recovery. The chosen models include three of the most extensively used flotation rate distributions to describe first-order batch processes: unique rate constant ( These models were applied to kinetic data of flotation of pyrite from calcite using dodecylamine amine as collector and F150 as a frother. This system was chosen due to the relatively slow kinetic response ( The experiments included the use of “unoxidized” (virgin) or a mixture of oxidized (to a different degree) pyrite. In the first case, the system behaves in a more ideal way while the second approaches to a more realistic flotation, with minerals having different floatability classes. Pyrite and calcite, purchased from VWR International (USA), were crushed and screened at 2630 Pyrite, due to its dielectric properties, acts as an energy absorber when irradiated with microwaves. This results in rapid heating of the mineral and direct oxidation, provided oxygen is available. Previous studies have shown how exposure to microwave radiation alters the magnetic properties of pyrite ( X-ray diffraction (XRD) (model P1770 with rotating Cu anode set at 40 Particle size distribution was determined by means of a laser scattering analyzer (Horiba, Japan, model LA920). For pyrite, the P Flotation was carried out in a 1 L Denver cell. Prior to flotation, 50 The pyrite grades of the concentrate and tailings were determined by calcite dissolution followed by gravimetric analysis. Approximately 1 In order to provide accurate kinetic data, special care was taken with timing. Pulp and froth volumes were kept constant by the addition of flotation solution (at the same pH and frother concentration of the test). The concentrate recovery continued until the mass recovery was negligible. This ensured a good estimation of maximum recovery. Entrainment corrections were carried out, although mineral desliming was performed to decrease entrained material. The contribution due to entrainment was estimated by assuming water recovered every time interval transported pyrite by entrainment, proportional to the pyrite concentration in the −45 The parameters for each model structure presented in As mentioned previously, kinetic studies and dependency on the flotation parameters are linked to the design and operation of flotation machines; the main objective of kinetic studies ( Batch flotation tests of a mixture of pyrite (unoxidized and partially oxidized) and calcite, in the presence of amine as collector were performed. Pyrite, calcite and water cumulative recoveries as a function of time were calculated from the tests. Since the concentrate was rapidly removed from the cell (scraping every one second), the flotation rate characterization was assumed to be representative of the collection process. The studied system permitted the taking of several samples during the flotation time. It is well-established that the largest experimental errors occur at the beginning of the flotation test, when the majority of the material floats. If the concentrate is not removed at a sufficient rate, there is a strong possibility that there will be some drop-back of particles that have already floated; under this scenario, timing errors of few seconds during the initial period may result in large differences in the recovery calculation. The rate of flotation of a mineral frequently decreases as much as tenfold within the first minute (  Calcite recovery plotted as a function of water recovery is shown in  Flotation kinetics in mechanical flotation cells have traditionally been modelled using the first-order flotation rate (both derivative and kinetic orders). Here, the rate of flotation is assumed to be proportional to the concentration of mineral particles in the pulp phase while sub-processes such as particle-bubble collision, attachment and detachment are considered in the flotation rate constant. The fractional calculus approach was proposed as an alternative point of view to describe flotation rates, in which the process is represented by a derivative order instead of a flotation rate distribution. Regarding the first order kinetic models, the tested structures gave comparable and fairly good adjustment as reflected by the As for the maximum recovery prediction, all models gave similar values ( The models’ predictability was tested by performing regressions first neglecting the last data point, then two, and finally three. The maximum recovery for the single constant and the gamma distributed constant were virtually equivalent for the prediction. Although these models provided comparable goodness of fit, the single rate constant model is preferred under the principle of parsimony (which favours models that have as few parameters as possible), for this particular case. Moreover, the parameters of the gamma model strongly suggested the distribution converged to a Dirac delta, which indicates a single rate constant. The fractional calculus approach provided a derivative order ( For the rectangular model, the miscalculation of The fractional calculus approach provided a poor prediction of In real systems, particles of valuable minerals have different floatability, depending on the mineralogy ( As mentioned previously, the work was extended to synthetic mixtures of mineral having different rate constants to increase the probability of having mineral particles with different floatability, similar to a more realistic situation. This was achieved by using mixtures of pyrite with different degrees of oxidation. The oxidation was produced by microwave irradiation (preliminary tests showed that fully oxidized pyrite does not interact with dodecyl amine).   Again, the rectangular model fails on the prediction of the last data point, even more than for the unoxidized pyrite to some extent, judging by the Historically, batch flotation has been represented by a first order kinetic model since the 1930s, recognizing the exponential nature of the process. The single rate constant is the simplest structure. Although more accurate kinetic model structures have been introduced, this model has been used often ever since due to its straightforwardness. The cases tested in the present study show the model is capable of giving a reasonable adjustment and good predictability. Although the rectangular model is not the most adequate in many applications, it is frequently more accurate than the single rate constant ( The gamma model normally shows good accuracy. In this study, the model was demonstrated to be adaptable and simplified to a single rate constant structure. The main drawback of this method is perhaps the incapability of relating the gamma function parameters (  A comparison of parameters obtained by four model structures has been presented. The models considered were: single rate constant; distributed rate constants ( Funding from the
