The pretreatment of heavy oil refinery wastewater (HORW) was experimentally investigated using a three-dimensional electrode reactor (TDER) with granular activated carbon (GAC) and porous ceramsite particle (PCP) as the combination particle electrode and DSA® type anodes as the anode. The results showed that higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was obtained in TDER comparing with the two-dimensional electrode reactor (without particle electrodes packed), and combination particle electrode was favorable to improve the COD removal efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. The treated HORW under the optimal experimental condition (GAC percentage=75%, current density=30mA/cm2, pH not adjusted and treatment time=100min) presented that the removal efficiencies of COD, total organic carbon and toxicity units were 45.5%, 43.3% and 67.2%, respectively, and the ratio of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand to COD was increased from 0.10 to 0.29, which is beneficial for further biological treatment. Furthermore, the application of electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to characterize polar compounds in HORW and their oxidation products was well demonstrated to reveal the composition variation.Heavy oil is an important part of the energy supply of the world, and is being exploited increasingly as the demand for petroleum increases In recent decades, advanced electrochemical oxidation processes (AEOPs), an important branch of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), have been extensively studied as the pretreatment or mineralization process for the treatment of wastewater containing bio-refractory or toxic organic contaminants In this paper, the applicability of electrochemical oxidation process as a pretreatment of HORW was investigated by performing the following experiments, which was carried out with a three-dimensional electrode reactor (TDER). Effects of particle electrode composition, current density, pH and treatment time on contaminant removal and/or biodegradability improvement were observed. Furthermore, electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) was utilized to characterize the composition variation of polar organic pollutants before and after pretreatment. The HORW samples were obtained from Liaohe Petrochemical Branch Company (LPBC) of PetroChina, which is a main heavy oil refinery with a capacity of over 3 The schematic diagram of the rectangular undivided TDER is shown in For each experiment, 2 The pH was measured by a PHS-3C meter (REX, China). The determination of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD The acute toxicity of the initial and treated HORW samples was assessed by Microtox™ bioassay tests using the luminescent bacteria ( In order to characterize polar organic pollutants in HORW and their oxidation products during the treatment, we used ESI FT-ICR MS operated in the negative-ion mode. Analyses were performed on an Apex-ultra FT-ICR MS (Bruker Daltonics, USA) equipped with a 9.4 The energy consumption (EC) was calculated using the Eq. Previous studies on three-dimensional electrode mainly used GAC as the homogeneous conducting particles. During the treatment period, pollutants were adsorbed on the GAC surface, particularly polar compounds were electro-adsorbed under the induced electric field, and this allowed the short-circuiting current to be considerably increased  The results above indicated that GAC played an important role in enhancing oxidation of pollutants. Some researchers confirmed that GAC was beneficial to not only adsorb pollutants on its large specific surface, but in situ generate strong oxidizing agents (such as hydroxyl radical), which significantly improved pollutant degradation in TDER system Effect of current density on COD removal and ICE is shown in  When the treatment time was more than 100  According to the overall experimental results, the optimum experimental condition was determined as follows: GAC percentage Serial experiments on biodegradability improving were carried out to explore the stability of the TDER under the optimal experimental condition, as shown in The toxicity bioassay tests were performed to determine the toxicity change during the treatment under optimum experimental conditions. The average TU values of initial samples (B/C ratio The treated HORW was as a result of biodegradability greatly improved and toxicity significantly reduced, which is beneficial for further biological treatment. Moreover, the results also revealed the great potential of TDER in engineering application as a pretreatment of HORW. Electrochemical oxidation treatment induced alteration of the polar compounds appears to produce systematic changes, suggesting that selected NSO-class or compound distribution can be used as indices to evaluate the extent of biodegradability. ESI FT-ICR MS is now recognized as a powerful technique for the resolution and identification of complex polar compounds, including natural organic matter (such as humic and fulvic acids) The calibrated negative-ion FT-ICR mass spectra of raw and treated HORW samples (after 100 The greatest changes imposed by the treatment occur for oxygen containing compounds (O-compounds). According to the identification for the raw and treated HORW samples (after 100 The overall effects of electrochemical treatment on pollutants in HORW can be concluded that: (1) higher molecular weight compounds were effectively degraded to low toxicity and easily biodegradable oxidation products; (2) lower molecular weight compounds and oxidation products were further oxidized to O-compounds (such as acidic compounds) or mineralized.
