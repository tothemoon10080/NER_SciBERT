We welcome the discussion on this paper. We understand that Mr Kowalczuk's concern is that grouping and splitting the forces may influence the calculation results. However, the reason we rewrite the buoyancy force of the particle by the whole volume less the particle volume immersed in the gas phase is to follow the definition of adhesive force according to The so called non-existing force according to Mr Kowalczuk, We believe that the equation proposed by Mr Kowalczuk (Eq. If we use Eq. Grouping and splitting are still required in this case, since the variable Î± is on both sides of the equation. Since the bubble height With this assumption, the radius of the bubble at the apex equals the radius of the three phase contact allowing the same value of the parameter Thus, by this simplification, the bubble height which is also used by Rather, we may also use an expression for However, there was little difference using Eqs. The maximum adhesive force, i.e., the tenacity, does not change appreciably if we use Eq. We thank Mr Kowalczuk for his interest in our paper. Our main motivation is to understand factors which may contribute to the increased recovery of coarse particles in flotation practice. The viscosity of the flotation medium plays an important role in controlling the recovery of coarse particles in flotation practice, yet viscosity does not appear in the current models for stability efficiency. The models consider the quasi-static condition and not also the dynamics of movement of the three phase line of contact. We are grateful to the editors of the International Journal of Mineral Processing for giving us the opportunity to address the concerns of Mr Kowalczuk.
