Instrument of IR spectrometer and methods of saturation, equimolar series change and slope were applied to study the extraction mechanism of Cyanex272-P507 impregnated resin for heavy rare earths from hydrochloric acid solution. The results show that the molar ratio of Cyanex272-P507 to rare earth in the extraction complex is 3. Chlorine ions do not participate in coordination. The extraction reaction can be expressed as
