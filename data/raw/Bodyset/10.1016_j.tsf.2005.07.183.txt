Effect of hydrogen (H2) dilution of the Silane (SiH4), acetylene (C2H2) gas mixture during the deposition of hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbon alloy (a-SiC:H) films by Cat-CVD process shows that the H2 dilution induced additional carbon incorporation, leading to an increase of the carbon content in the films from 52% to 70% for the maximum H2 dilution employed. A slight increase in graphitic carbon in the films deposited with H2 dilution is also observed. A drastic increase in the optical band gap E
                     g from 2.5 eV for zero dilution to 3.5 eV is observed for a H2 dilution of 10 sccm. Raman spectra for the films deposited with increasing H2 dilution indicate structural changes in the amorphous network associated with increasing graphitic carbon.Hydrogen (H However in case of a-SiC:H deposition by the HWCVD using either SiH a-SiC:H films were deposited by the HWCVD process using SiH Films were deposited on c-Si (p-type <100>) and Corning 7059-glass substrate to facilitate different characterizations. The infrared spectroscopy data was obtained with a Nicolet Magna 550 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The optical band gap was determined from the transmission data obtained with a UVâ€“Vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V 530). The structural characterization was done by Raman spectroscopy (Jobin-Yvon/SPEX T64000, 514 nm Ar   In  The continuous PL curve obtained at room temperature is shown in H This work was carried out with financial support from BRNS, Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India.
