This chapter presents the faults, their types, and effects. It is not practical to design and build electrical equipment or networks to eliminate the possibility of failure in service. It is therefore an everyday fact that different types of faults occur in electrical systems, however infrequently, and at random locations. Faults can be broadly classified into two main areas: active and passive. The solid fault occurs as a result of an immediate complete breakdown of insulation as would happen if, say, a pick struck an underground cable bridging conductors, or if the cable was dug up by a bulldozer. In mining, a rockfall could crush a cable, as might a shuttle car. In these circumstances, the fault current would be very high resulting in an electrical explosion. Transient faults are the faults that do not damage the insulation permanently and allow the circuit to be safely re-energized after a short period of time. A typical example would be an insulator flashover following a lightning strike, which would be successfully cleared on opening the circuit breaker. Transient faults occur mainly on outdoor equipment where air is the main insulating medium. Permanent faults, as the name implies, are the result of permanent damage to the insulation. In this case, the equipment has to be repaired and must not be recharged before repair/restoration.
