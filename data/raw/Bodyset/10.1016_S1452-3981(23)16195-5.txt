Electrochemical noise measurement is one of the novel techniques currently being used in corrosion monitoring. Two major methods of analysis in use are the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM). This paper reviews the techniques fundamental background â€“ types of noise, physical data; description, classification and characteristics; mathematical background of random data and spectral analysis. Recent progress made in its application to corrosion monitoring and other electrochemical reaction phenomena are also examined.
