The results of this work may play an important role in understanding the precipitation behaviors of Ti-bearing inclusions in SWRH 92A tire cord steel.Tire cord steel is widely used in the production of tires for cars due to its high strength and toughness Non-metallic inclusions such as oxide- or Ti-bearing inclusions, that exist in tire cord steel have serious detrimental effects on the drawing performance and fatigue properties SWRH 92A tire cord steel obtained from a Chinese steel mill was used as the analyzed material. Its chemical composition is shown in Eq. Chemical reactions for the formations of TiC and TiN in molten steel can be expressed by Eqs. The standard Gibbs free energy changes Expressions for The equilibrium constants Considering the equilibrium solubility products of Ti and C as TiC and TiN have the same NaCl cubic crystal structure There are several models With the assumption that segregation of the solute elements (Ti, C, and N) in the liquid phase can be ignored, and given that their actual concentrations are very low, the SWRH 92A molten steel can be considered as a dilute solution. The actual solubility products of TiC and TiN can then be calculated: By comparing the values of the equilibrium solubility products with the actual solubility products of TiC and TiN [Eq. When the temperature is cooled below the liquidus, austenite (γ-Fe) will gradually form. At the same time, segregation of the solute elements (Ti, C, and N) will be more serious and these will accumulate at the solid/liquid interface during solidification due to the rapid decrease in solubility (their equilibrium distribution coefficients are less than unity). On one hand, the equilibrium solubility products of TiC and TiN will decrease with the progress of solidification; on the other hand, the actual solubility products will increase rapidly due to the rapid segregation. Once the actual solubility products reach their equilibrium values, Ti-bearing inclusions will precipitate. In the current calculation, it was assumed that the solute elements were completely diffused in liquid phase and finitely diffused in the γ-Fe phase, so the Ohnaka model In addition, the relationship between the solid fraction and solidification front temperature ( According to the above analysis, the values of Furthermore, when substituting The above results indicate that the segregation ratios of the solute elements (C and N; the results of Ti is not given due to the unobvious increase) as well as the value of As mentioned above, TiC can hardly precipitate in the liquid phase and mushy zone, and thus is likely to be precipitated in the solid phase (γ-Fe). It was concluded that TiN could only form in the mushy zone at a very late stage for a solid fraction bigger than 0.99, which would lead to a short time for the growth process, i.e, the size of precipitated TiN inclusions will be very small. However, according to optical microscopy observations, particle sizes of 6–8 μm of Ti-bearing inclusions are found in actual tire cord rod The solubilities of TiC and TiN in γ-Fe are very small, so the solid phase can be considered as a regular solution. With this assumption, the precipitation behavior of TiC and TiN in the solid phase can be considered as being the same as that in molten steel. The corresponding calculated results are depicted in In this study, the precipitation behaviors of Ti-bearing inclusions (TiC, TiN, and TiC The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support for this work from the
