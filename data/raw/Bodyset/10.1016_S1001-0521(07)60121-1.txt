With miniaturization and complication of the shape of electronic devices in recent years, powder injection molding (PIM) seems to be a suitable process for fabricating the higher performance soft magnetic components. In this paper, high quality Fe-50Ni soft magnetic alloy was fabricated by PIM with carbonyl iron and nickel, and the effect of sintering process on its microstructure and magnetic properties were investigated. The mechanical and magnetic properties can be obviously improved by increasing the sintering temperature or using the hydrogen atmosphere instead of high vacuum, which causes by the increase of grain size and the densification. At the optimum sintering conditions, the PIM Fe-50Ni soft magnetic alloy with high properties are obtained, whose relative density, tensile strength, B
