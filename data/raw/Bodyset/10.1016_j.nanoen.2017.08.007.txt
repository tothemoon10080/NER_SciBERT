To accelerate the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on H2O oxidation regarding the energy conversion and storage approaches, the discovery and design of desirable cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts is of prime importance. This study demonstrates a novel layered perovskite via Co-doping strategy, i.e. LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-δ, which possesses significantly higher electrocatalytic activity, considerably lower overpotential and Tafel slope, remarkably higher mass activity (MA) and specific activity (SA) together with a better long-term stability than the undoped parent perovskite, the state-of-the-art IrO2 and the most active Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) under harsh OER cycling conditions in alkaline solution. These merits mainly originate from the presence of partial oxidation of surface Co3+ to Co4+ in LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-δ, an appropriate possible structure-dependent position of O p-band centre to the Fermi level and an increased amount of highly oxidative oxygen species O2

These findings not only improve the electrocatalytic activities of the layered perovskite family via optimal doping but also highlight the potential application of LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-δ as an earth-abundant, cost-effective, highly active and durable electrocatalyst for OER in energy conversion and storage technologies.The increasing concerns on global climate change and the growing demand for clean energy have sparked intense research interest in the development of efficient systems to convert and store sustainable and renewable intermittent energy In response, transition metal oxides (e.g. cubic ABO In this work, we reported for the first time Co-doped layered perovskite LaSr  The electrochemical OER catalytic activities of LP-LSCF (m = 0.0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) were evaluated by linear sweeping voltammograms (LSVs) in O To gain better insights into the OER kinetics on LP-LSCF, Tafel plots of the Besides, the long-term stability of the developed catalyst for OER is also a major concern for the energy conversion and storage technologies. To assess the stability, the galvanostatic long-term performances of LP-LaSr Understanding the reasons credited for the excellent OER performance of LP-LSCF is significant for discovering and designing desirable materials. The outstanding OER electrocatalytic activities mainly originate from the following aspects correlated with the synergistic interaction of Co and Fe in LP-LSCF. Firstly, the introduction of Co via doping strategy not only increases the oxygen vacancies which enhance the mobility of oxygen ions as well as the surface oxygen exchange rate ( In summary, a novel layered LaSr Materials preparation and characterization, electrode preparation and electrochemical measurements, mass activity and specific activity calculations, supporting tables and figures, and other related information are presented.
