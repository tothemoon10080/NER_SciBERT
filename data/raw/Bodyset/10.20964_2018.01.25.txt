The anodic electrodeposition of CeO2 thin film was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical noise (EN) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRD. The CV results reveal that the electroplating behavior of CeO2 on 316L stainless electrode is mainly electrochemical-controlled. It is found that the potential moves in the positive direction slowly when the electroplating current density (J
                     k) is small (0.01-0.05 mAÂ·cm-2) and moves quickly in the positive direction to reach a plateau in the case of much larger J
                     k value, suggesting a progressive and instantaneous nucleation/growth mechanism, respectively. New parameters are proposed from EN analysis to investigate the relationship between the EN feature and the CeO2 thin film structure. It is interesting to infer that parameter n
                     2 presented the same variation trend with the crystallite size from the XRD measurements with the electroplating current density.
