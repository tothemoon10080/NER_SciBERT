It is known that superfine aluminum powders (SFAP) can successfully replace the micron-sized aluminum powders (10–100 μm) in propellants. Such substitution leads to an increase in the combustion efficiency of aluminum and also leads to decreased agglomeration of the combustion products and reduction of two-phase losses It has been experimentally established that additives to the Ar gas used in EEW, such as chemically active gases (O As an alternative to a protective film of oxide, aluminum diboride (AlB Boride-encapsulated particles of SFAP were obtained by EEW of aluminum wires with a boron-containing coating. From the EPMA (Electron Probe Micro Analysis) data plotted in During EEW the initial products of electrical explosion (T ∼ 10 The temperature for the onset of intensive oxidation (t The maximum rate of oxidation (v The degree of conversion (degree of oxidation) of Al in a certain range of temperatures (α, %), The ratio of the oxidation thermal effect (from the area of the peak under a DTA-curve) to the corresponding value of the mass increase (from a TGA-curve) of the analyzed sample (S/Δm, arb. unit). The standard mass of SFAP samples under investigation was ∼ 5 × 10 Aluminum diboride coating, as applied to SFAP particles in the process of electrical explosion of aluminum wires, leads to an increase in the dispersiveness by ∼2 times because of lower agglomeration. The properties of SFAP particles with the diboride coating are changed: their thermal stability (on 30–40°C) is higher than SFAP obtained in an Ar medium or in a medium of Ar with N This work has been supported by the Korean Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) through the Research Center for Machine Parts and Materials Processing (ReMM) at the University of Ulsan.
