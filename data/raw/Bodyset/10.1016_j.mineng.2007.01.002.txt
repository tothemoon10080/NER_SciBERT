The leaching of oxides in high strength brines is advantageous because of favourable leaching kinetics even at atmospheric conditions due to enhanced proton activity, and the catalytic effect of chloride ions due to complexation with metal ions. A proper understanding of hydration theory, practice of measuring proton activities in concentrated acid–chloride systems, and their applications to rationalise leaching kinetics is beneficial for further development of chloride processes. In the present study, a hydration number of 1 or 2 for the chloride ion and a constant ionic activity coefficient for the hydrated chloride ion has been proposed for the theoretical evaluation of pH of concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions. A comparison of the results based on hydration theory and extended Debye–Hückel equation with the experimental results based on acidity functions, glass electrode, and hydrogen electrode shows the importance of liquid junction potential corrections for measured values based on potentiometric methods. The proton activity based on electrode potentials reveals a hydration number of 6–7 which is consistent with an ion-pair hydration model (H3O+)(H2O)6–7Cl−. Chloride ions facilitate the dissolution of copper(II) oxide and goethite in acid solutions. The rates of dissolution of these oxides in hydrochloric acid solutions are first order with respect to proton activity due to the formation of adsorption complexes such as Cu(OH)Cl0 and Fe(OH)2Cl0. Hydration, chloro-complexation and hydrolysis of metal ions play important roles in the selective leaching of nickel over iron from laterite ores by acid–chloride lixiviant system.The hydrometallurgical processing of oxide and sulphide ores/concentrates in high strength brines is advantageous because of several reasons: (i) faster leaching kinetics even at atmospheric conditions caused by enhanced proton activity, (ii) catalytic effect of chloride ions due to complexation with metal ions, (iii) hydrolysis and selective precipitation of iron at high temperatures and moderate acid and chloride concentrations, (iv) relatively easy filtration of slurries, and (v) the possibility of regeneration of lixiviant by pyrohydrolysis ( Hydration theory states that the increase in proton activity in concentrated acid solutions is a composite effect of an increase in H  The aims of this paper are: to briefly review the assumptions involved in the experimental and theoretical methods used for the determination of proton activity and/or pH, to report the measured pH values of a series of solutions of HCl (0.1–6 to compare and contrast the results based on a glass or hydrogen electrode with those based on other experimental or theoretical methods which consider a range of extrathermodynamic assumptions such as the acidity functions, extended Debye–Hückel equation, and a modified hydration theory, to demonstrate the applications and limitations of proton activity to rationalise the rate of dissolution of goethite and copper oxide in hydrochloric acid solutions and to rationalise the beneficial effect of chloride ions on leaching kinetics, and to discuss the role of acid and chloride in selective leaching of nickel over iron from a laterite ore. The hydrogen electrode Pt(s)/H Redox systems such as Pt/ferrocene/ferricimium or Pt/ferroin/ferrin have also been used as reference electrodes for pH measurements ( The hydration theory correlates the ionic activity ( The assumption proposed in the present study is that The Hammett acidity function ( As shown in In the present study the pH measurements based on the glass electrode were made at 25  The glass electrode has been widely used for pH measurements in high ionic strength chloride salt solutions containing acids of low concentrations. There has been no correction for   Previous studies showed that the electrode potential measurements based on a hydrogen electrode can be used to determine the proton hydration number in order to support the hydration theory ( The increase in acid concentration and/or the background salt concentration increases the rate of dissolution of metal oxides such as goethite and copper(II) oxide (  According to  The acid independent low rate of dissolution of goethite in dilute acid solutions shown in It is clear that the rates of dissolution of copper oxide and goethite are controlled by the surface reaction. This is further supported by the high activation energy of 52 Although the proton activity in hydrochloric acid is lower than that in perchloric acid at concentrations >1 The results plotted in Figs. Nickel(II) does not form chloro-complexes due to the higher stability of the hydrated ion high acid in two of the data points in curve (p) of high chloride in one of the data points in curve (q) of High acid causes faster leaching kinetics and high extraction of both nickel and iron (p), while the iron leached stays in solution as high acid favours both Eqs. The results and analysis presented in this paper show that the glass electrode can be used to measure proton activities and pH in concentrated chloride solutions, provided that appropriate corrections are made for liquid junction potentials. Reliable values for proton activities and pH in HCl solutions can also be calculated using the hydration theory by assuming a hydration number of 2 for the chloride ion. The predicted values are in good agreement with the pH values based on acidity functions assuming that the base (B) and protonated base (BH The enhanced proton activity in concentrated chloride solutions is a composite effect of the enhanced acid concentration and the depleted water activity due to hydration of ions. Thus, the increase in proton activity coefficient as a function of decrease in water activity reveals the structure of hydrated HCl as H Although it is essential to conduct further studies for systems at elevated temperatures the rate of dissolution of copper(II) oxide and goethite can be rationalised on the basis of surface adsorption equilibria, which involve the formation of adsorbed species such as Cu(OH)Cl
