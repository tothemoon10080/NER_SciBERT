 The conference was attended by approximately 200 delegates, many of whom are very well-known and accomplished in the field of flotation. The standard of authorship and presentation did justice to an important era of change and development in flotation, and was well-balanced between academic fundamentals and industrial practice. Three fields of progress were evident. These were: the modern technologies of quantitative mineralogy and surface chemistry, which have developed to a position of general use in the practice of concentrator performance assessment; the use of ultrafine milling in niche applications; and the pursuit and assessment of larger equipment. These features were the key message of the conference: new technologies, scales and approaches in flotation are finding significant industrial use. The conference was divided into two, 2-day symposia – the first on ‘Flotation Fundamentals’ and the second on ‘Applications and Plant Practice’. MEI Conferences are characterised by attendance of a range of delegates, practitioners and researchers, from across the planet, and attending with different agendas. This was no exception with plenty of sharing and debating from various perspectives. As expected, best value was obtained by those who attended both symposia, as discussion certainly built up through the week, drawing on aspects from various previous presentations and discussions. Between the discussions during coffee and lunch breaks, and the technical sessions, the purpose of the conference was fulfilled in providing a forum for new insights and contacts with the flotation industry for all those who attended. The sponsorship of the conference by 11 industrial and research companies is appreciated, and underpinned the relevance of the new work presented.
