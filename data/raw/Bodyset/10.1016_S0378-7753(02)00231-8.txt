Electrochemical experiments that intend to characterise the state of charge (SOC) of lead–acid battery positive plates are presented. These experiments are designed for potential battery plate production quality control and in situ monitoring of battery condition. A small size probe, consisting of a counter and a reference electrode encased in a glass body ending to a fine aperture tip and pressed onto the specimen, was used to apply cathodic galvanostatic pulses on positive plate battery samples. Although this probe arrangement is similar to that of a coulometric thickness gauge, the porous nature of the battery plate results eventually in full discharge of the entire specimen. However, during the initial stages of specimen discharge using the contact probe, a potential arrest was observed for fully charged and partially discharged samples and it was attributed to the time needed for the thickness of a PbSO4 film formed during discharge and the corresponding resistance under the probe’s tip to reach a critical value for the discharge to spread to the rest of the sample. The duration of this potential arrest was found to be related to the positive plate’s SOC indicating the possibility of using the technique in positive plate quality control or in situ monitoring.Rechargeable batteries are receiving increasing attention as the demand for environmentally clean energy sources expands. Traditional applications include starting, lighting and ignition of automobiles, electric traction and uninterruptible power supplies used in telecommunications, substations, chemical plants and nuclear installations The emerging electric vehicle technology aiming to the development of fuel-cell/battery hybrid electric cars The electrochemistry of both positive and negative plate electrodes and lead–acid battery grids has been thoroughly studied in the past and manufacturing of the main components of the various types that are commercially available is a mature technology Simple monitoring of the voltage difference across the battery terminals, although in principle the most direct method for SOC estimation, is not very useful in early diagnosis of battery failure since significant voltage changes during discharge only occur abruptly and just before the battery’s life end. Therefore, other techniques which follow phenomena directly or indirectly linked to the SOC have been developed as diagnostic tests: specific gravity tests and acid stratification monitoring using simple or optical hydrometers Coulometric determination of metal oxides on metallic substrates by controlled electrochemical reduction of small specimens has long been established as a technique to quantify and characterise oxidised metal films such as tin oxides on Sn or cuprous/cupric films on Cu This work is investigating the possibility of using a small probe based on the same general principle of the coulometric thickness gauge, to evaluate the SOC of positive lead–acid battery plates by local (or at least partial) discharge-reduction of their PbO The aim of this work is to correlate the features of the constant current discharge of positive battery plate specimens obtained with the help of a small electrode probe, with the SOC of the battery specimen and set the principles of using this technique for the development of coulometric probes for battery plate quality control during production or (with appropriate miniaturisation) in situ determination of the SOC of positive plates during battery operation. The two modifications of the cell used for the normal discharge of the entire positive plate specimen (referred to as total discharge hereafter) and for discharge via the coulometric small probe (referred to as probe discharge or contact mode discharge hereafter) are presented in In the case of total specimen discharge ( In the case of probe discharge experiments ( Positive lead–acid battery plates were taken from a UK6TN Hawker–Oldham tank starter battery. Each battery plate had a nominal 8 Sulphuric acid from Aldrich (double distilled, PPB/Teflon The positive plate battery specimens were first characterised with respect to their capacity,  The inset of  The average resistance In order to produce positive battery plate specimens of different SOC, specimens were discharged at a current density of 27.68 To correlate the remaining available charge with the DOD of specimens thus produced, the latter were potentiostatically reduced at an overpotential Finally, to correlate the remaining charge with the amount of active PbO Thus, the procedure adopted for obtaining specimens of different SOC’s resulted in specimens whose DOD could be correlated to their SOC, expressed either as remaining charge or remaining PbO  The initial voltage drop (within tens or a few hundred seconds) after the application of the constant current for both experiments is due to Ohmic losses ( The top inset of At a first sight it would seem that this feature corresponds to the complete discharge of the area under the tip, before the discharge spreads through the porous specimen to the rest of the sample. This possibility is unlikely due to various reasons. First of all SEM micrographs of specimens discharged only for 10  It should be noted that similar results were obtained on positive plate specimens of another battery type (Hawker–Oldham EA13) too as well as in solutions of 3 and 1 Discharging positive lead–acid battery specimens under galvanostatic control by firmly contacting on its surface the fine aperture tip of a small probe containing a counter and a reference electrode in an insulating glass body, gave rise to The prominence of this short-time potential arrest during probe discharge experiments of fully charged plate specimens and its gradual disappearance for partially discharged specimens can be used in the development of a battery plate production quality control procedure. Each plate could be rapidly tested in the production line by simply pressing a discharge probe on it and applying a galvanostatic pulse. Since the measurement is taken over a small plate area and, more important, during this short potential arrest no deep discharge is observed even under the probe’s tip area, the method can be considered as non-destructive. Although the application of the technique in battery plate quality control seems rather straightforward, its potential use for the development of an in situ battery SOC probe is more demanding and would require more research both into the fundamentals of the process and into probe design matters. First of all, a detailed correlation between battery DOD and the duration of the potential arrest (as quantified by the inflection point of the P.J.
