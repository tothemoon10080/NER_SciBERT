The effect of rutile crystal shapes on its settlement in a modified slag was studied by theoretical analysis, FactSage simulation, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the settling velocities of spherical rutile crystals are faster than those of other shapes of rutile crystals under the same volume conditions, and the shape transformation of rutile crystals from rod to sphere can be achieved by adding titanium slag to Ti-bearing blast furnace slag. The volume fractions of the rutile crystals in the upper and lower parts of the modified slag are 30% and 71% when the added titanium slag increases to 278 g, indicating that rutile settling is obvious. Due to the rutile settling, half shaker sorting task is saved, and the recovery rate of TiO2 is significantly increased. The TiO2 content of rutile is greater than 93%, and the total content of CaO and MgO is less than 0.4%, meeting the requirements for the raw materials of titanium white in the chloride process.
