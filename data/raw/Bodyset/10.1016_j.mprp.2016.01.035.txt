He was also executive director of APMI International, the professional society for powder metallurgy (PM) that he helped found in 1959, and served as publisher of the International Journal of Powder Metallurgy. He attended Carnegie Institute of Technology and graduated from Yale University in 1945 with a degree in metallurgical engineering and served in the Pacific during World War II as a bomb disposal officer with the U.S. Navy. He wrote extensively about the technology of powder metallurgy (PM) and was co-editor of six books in the series Perspectives in Powder Metallurgy, published by Plenum Publishing Corp and MPIF. He received the prestigious Powder Metallurgy Pioneer Award in 1992 and the Distinguished Service to Powder Metallurgy Award in 1988, both from MPIF. In 2007, to honor his lifetime accomplishments, MPIF created the Kempton H. Roll PM Lifetime Achievement Award which is presented every four years.
