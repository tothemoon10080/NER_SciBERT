CaCl2 has played an indispensible role in many extraction processes for metallic titanium from titanium dioxide. In this paper, behavior of CaCl2 in reduction process of titanium dioxide by calcium vapor was investigated and analyzed by means of XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (Scanning electron microscope), EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectrometer), DSC–TG (Differential Scanning Calorimetry–Thermogravimetry) and thermodynamic calculation. The results show CaCl2 has a strong moisture absorption behavior and easily transforms CaCl2·nH2O (n
                     =6, 4 and 2). Then CaCl2·nH2O would dehydrate to be CaCl2·H2O step by step and CaCl2·H2O as an unstable compound would further dehydrate to be CaCl2 or decompose to be CaClOH and CaO with temperature increasing. Additionally, CaCl2 could volatilize on the experimental condition as well. When CaCl2 was added in TiO2 as raw materials, these above behaviors of CaCl2 and CaCl2·nH2O could not only discharge some gas or vapor to make raw material of TiO2 porous, but also would conduct TiO2 to form CaTiO3 phase in raw material. The above facts would help the calciothermic reduction process of TiO2 more easily proceed.Metallic titanium, as one of indispensable materials in human society, is widely used in many applications, such as aerospace, military industry, chemical engineering, metallurgical engineering, ocean field, oil field, medical device and architectural design. From 1940s, Kroll process was invented to produce sponge titanium and has been the current industrial production method For the calciothermic reduction processes of TiO In the above reduction processes of TiO Anatase titanium dioxide (A.R.) was used as the raw material, metallic calcium (Ca A certain amount of TiO To investigate the phase and microstructure changes of preform feeds, the above preform feeds were heated constantly for different times in vacuum furnace under less than 10 The phase of reduction products and sintered products were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku (Japan) D/max-3B X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation.
