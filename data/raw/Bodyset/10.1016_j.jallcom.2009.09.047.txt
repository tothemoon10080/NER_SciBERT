The effect of AgTaO3 on the electrical properties of (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 lead-free ceramics was systematically investigated, and the phase transition behavior of the ceramics was also studied in terms of high temperature X-ray diffraction. The experimental results show that Ag+ and Ta5+ ions diffuse into the (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 lattices to form a stable solid solution with orthorhombic structure, and also lead to the decrease in the orthorhombic to the tetragonal phase transition temperature and the Curie temperature. The 0.92(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3–0.08AgTaO3 ceramics exhibit optimum electrical properties (d

                     x)(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3–xAgTaO3 ceramics are much superior to pure (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 ceramics. X-ray diffraction patterns for the 0.92(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3–0.08AgTaO3 ceramic at different temperatures indicated a pure perovskite phase with an orthorhombic structure at below 160°C, a tetragonal structure at 160–350°C, and a cubic structure at above 360°C. As a result, the (1−

The thermal-depoling behavior of the It is generally thought that the enhancement of the piezoelectric properties for the KNN ceramics is mainly attributed to the coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases because the ceramics with the coexistence of two phases possess more possible polarization states (1 The author thanks the support of College of Materials Science and Metallurgy Engineering of Guizhou University.
