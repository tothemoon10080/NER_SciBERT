Sulphur dioxide removal efficiencies were measured in a pilot-scale column packed with Pall plastic rings, at 20°C and atmospheric pressure, with sulphuric acid solutions (1.2–6.6M) containing hydrogen peroxide (0.13–0.83M) as the scrubbing liquid, for different sulphur dioxide partial pressures in the range of 100–500Pa in the inlet air.
                  A mathematical model previously developed to interpret laboratory experiments was adapted and used to treat the results of the pilot-scale runs for a wide range of operating conditions of gas and liquid flow rates, SO2 partial pressures in the gas phase, H2O2 and H2SO4 concentrations of the solution. A quite satisfactory agreement was found between kinetic parameters deduced from the tests achieved in laboratory and pilot-scale contactors up to 5M in H2SO4.
                  It appears, therefore, that this model can provide good predictions of the absorption performances of industrial columns and be really helpful to design scrubbers for SO2 abatement with hydrogen peroxide.As sulphur dioxide is a major atmospheric pollutant generating acid deposits, its abatement in flue gases is of significant industrial concern. SO As an example, in large scale metallurgical—sulphuric acid plants, scrubbing the tail gases with H Despite little research has been made on the chemical absorption of SO A laboratory investigation relative to sulphur dioxide absorption into aqueous and sulphuric acid solutions containing hydrogen peroxide was presented in authors’ previous papers The aims of the current study are: to check that values of this parameter determined at a pilot scale are quite similar, as evidenced by its independence of the hydrodynamic conditions occurring in contactors; to get a broad understanding of the effects of varying operating conditions on the absorption efficiency. The experimental system is illustrated in The liquid is distributed on the top of the bed by means of a conical tube of pulverization and the liquid level under the packing kept at a low distance to reduce the mass transfer end effects. The gaseous mixture is made of SO Sampling of gas simultaneously at the input and the output of the column is performed continuously through membrane dryers followed by a two-channel UV analyser which gives the SO The column is operated counter-currently with recycle of the scrubbing liquid. Sulphuric acid solutions with added hydrogen peroxide were used. The liquid temperature is controlled by means of a heat exchanger placed in the liquid loop and supplied with cold water from a refrigeration unit. The liquid temperatures at both ends of the column are checked by thermometers. A screening series of absorption tests was conducted at 20 ± 0.5 The system was allowed to reach a quasi steady state indicated by no significant changes of column temperature and input and output SO Experimental investigations were conducted for various inlet SO A mathematical model was developed to simulate the SO For a pseudo-first-order reaction (with the condition The factor multiplying The determination of the OKP values was achieved previously from numerous experiments conducted at 20 The simulation of the pilot-scale column required the knowledge of the mass transfer characteristics of the packing for the experimental gas and liquid flow rates used. The determination of the specific interfacial area The variation with For sake of comparison and taking into account the specific physical properties of H The gas side mass transfer coefficients The following correlation was found for various liquid and gas velocities:  The volumetric liquid-phase mass transfer coefficients The variation of Dividing the packed column into short incremental volumes, the simulation was made, element by element, computing for a given OKP the SO Computations of OKP were made using collected absorption data, by minimizing the deviation between experimental and calculated absorption efficiencies. Values of OKP (actually of the inverse parameter One can firstly observe a regular increase, with a satisfactory scattering, of OKP In addition, the quite good agreement between the kinetic parameters deduced from the tests achieved respectively with laboratory (curve b) and pilot-scale (curve a) contactors up to a concentration of 5 It appears moreover from the results that the determination of kinetic parameters is affected with a degree of uncertainty at low acidity due to very fast kinetic conditions close to the instantaneous reaction regime obtained with NaOH solutions. In this range of acidity also, some extra absorption tests have to be achieved in the presence of low concentrations of H Finally, all these additional absorption data should allow us to obtain a reliable expression for the variation of OKP with  It appears clearly that, for a given H The response to an increase of the liquid flow rate is obviously a higher SO The influence of a reduced gas flow is only a slight increase of the SO A good knowledge of the reagent consumption is obviously required for the development of industrial applications of a reactive scrubbing process. It can be observed from a series of results presented in The kinetic parameters relative to SO This model, coupled with the determination or the estimation of mass-transfer and hydrodynamic characteristics, can be applied to the simulation or design of industrial scrubbers. It appears nevertheless that the present validation of kinetic parameters is affected with a certain degree of uncertainty at low acidity, due to very fast reaction kinetics and, at high acidity, to a lack of absorption data. In order to be able to simulate this gas treatment process in a wide range of practical industrial operating conditions, we plan to investigate: the effect of temperature by achieving similar runs at several higher temperatures, at laboratory and pilot scales; a different modelling for SO the range of high acidities (greater than 5 S.
