Friction stir processing (FSP) followed by aging treatment is used to modify the microstructure and improve the mechanical properties of the as-cast AE42 rare earth-containing magnesium alloy. FSP results in grain refinement and microstructural homogenization. The grain size decreases from 81 to 7.4 μm because of continuous dynamic recrystallization. After FSP, basal texture forms, and Mg17Al12 and Al11RE3 phases disappear, while a new Al2RE phase appear. After aging treatment, precipitation of Al2RE phase appears and the intensity of texture reduce. Tensile properties of the FSP specimens exhibit an anisotropy obviously before and after the aging. Deformation mechanism of the FSP specimens follows the dislocation basal slip and the extension twin. Factors influencing strength of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy are (a) secondary phases, (b) texture and (c) grain size.AE42 magnesium (Mg) alloy, as a rare earth (RE)-containing alloy, has high specific strength, stiffness, light weight and good thermal resistance. Therefore, it is widely used in aviation, aerospace and auto industry [ Grain refinement is very effective for improving mechanical properties of the AE42 Mg alloy. Many severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques have been developed, such as equal-channel angular pressing [ Friction stir processing (FSP) is a SPD technique, which uses principle of friction stir welding (FSW) [ Comparing to traditional SPD techniques, FSP can fabricate bulk fine-grained Mg alloys with a high ratio of high angle grain boundary (HAGB) equal to 95–97%, which guarantees high ductility [ FSP has also been used to prepare fine-grained AE42 Mg alloy. Arora et al. [ Refinement of grains and precipitates leads to the strength enhancement. However, some previous studies demonstrated that the strength of FSPed fine-grained Mg alloys decreases, which is mainly attributed to the strong grain orientation generated during plastic deformation [ FSP usually leads to rapid dissolution and breakup of the second phases in Mg alloys, which diminishes precipitation strengthening effect. In order to significantly improve the strength of the FSPed AE42 Mg alloy (containing 3.9% Al, 0.3% Mn, 0.2% Zn, 1.2% Ce, 0.6% Nd, 0.6% La, 0.1% Pr and 0.1% Si), we implemented aging treatment directly after FSP. Hence, the second goal of our work was to study the influence of aging treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the FSPed AE42 Mg alloy. In this study, as-cast AE42 Mg alloy plate (160 × 60 × 4 mm Specimens for optical microscope (OM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) were cut perpendicularly to the PD ( Specimens for microhardness measurements were cut vertically relative to the PD and then ground and polished. Tests were performed using a 401 MVD microhardness tester with a square based pyramidal shaped diamond indenter. Indentations were made every 0.5 mm with a 200 g load and 10 s dwell time. Each test was repeated at least three times to guarantee the accuracy. Three sets of tensile specimens were prepared: base metal (BM), stir zone (SZ) of FSPed alloy and aged specimen. In each set two specimens were cut along the PD and TD, respectively. Thus, the specimens were marked as BM-PD, BM-TD, FSP-PD, FSP-TD, FSP + AG-PD, and FSP + AG-TD, respectively ( A defect-free basin-shaped processed zone was observed at the cross-section of the FSPed AE42 Mg alloy (           Being an SPD technique, FSP leads to grain refinement of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy. Processing temperature, plastic strain and strain rate affect the grain refinement. In general, continuous dynamic recrystallization is the main recrystallization mechanism in Mg alloys. During FSP, SPD leads to increased dislocation density and internal energy accumulation inside the grains. In order to reduce the internal energy, dislocations rearrange forming LAGBs, which then gradually transform into HAGBs during the subsequent plastic deformation. This is different from the traditional discontinuous dynamic recrystallization mechanism, in which new recrystallized grains form by sub-grains merging and rotating rather than by nucleation and growth [ Basal slip has much lower CRSS than non-basal slips, therefore, it is easily activated during FSP resulting in the basal texture formation. The maximum polar density of a typical FSP specimen is typically 2.75 times higher than of BM [ The stir tool has a significant effect on the distribution of grain orientation along the thickness direction. Yuan et al. [ Besides grain size and grain orientation, second phases also change significantly. After FSP, both β-Mg Aging treatment does not result in the obvious grain growth of the FSP specimen ( Furthermore, aging treatment significantly decreases the texture intensity, and the texture component changes. First, the increase of grain size leads to the decrease of polar intensity after aging treatment [ Aging treatment also has a significant effect on the second phases. On the one hand, aging treatment promotes precipitation of Al According to the Hall-Petch relationship, grain refinement could increase the strength of the material. However, the YS and UTS values of fine-grained FSP-PD specimens are lower than the corresponding values of the coarse-grained BM-PD specimens ( In addition to the grain size and texture, second phases also have a significant effect on the strength of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy. First, dissolved β-Mg Furthermore, tensile direction also affected the strength of the FSPed AE42 Mg alloy. YS and UTS values of the FSP-PD specimen are noticeably lower than the corresponding strength values of the FSP-TD specimen. The c-axis of the grains is roughly parallel to the PD which is the tensile axis, and perpendicular to the TD. This feature causes that the SF of FSP-PD specimen is higher than that of FSP-TD specimen, presenting the texture softening effect when it is tested along PD. Tensile test results indicate elongation improvement after FSP regardless of the tensile direction because of the following reasons. First, FSP eliminates casting defects and improves densification of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy. Second, FSP results grain refinement and microstructural homogenization, which improves the coordinated deformation ability of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy. Third, FSP leads to the dissolution and mechanical breaking of coarse second phase particles, reducing stress concentration and improving crack nucleation and propagation resistance [ Aging treatment results in significant increase of the YS and UTS values of the FSPed AE42 Mg alloy. On the one hand, aging treatment induces precipitation strengthening effect because of the precipitation of Al However, aging treatment decreases elongation of FSPed AE42 Mg alloy because second phase particles are beneficial for microcracks nucleation at the early stages of the tensile deformation [ Thus, factors influencing strength of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy can be placed in the following order (from strongest to weakest): second phases, texture and grain size. Meanwhile, this study indicates that FSP followed by aging treatment significantly improves mechanical properties of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy and provides it with high strength and good ductility. Effect of FSP on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy is investigated and the following concluding remarks can be made. FSP results in the microstructural refinement and homogenization of AE42 alloy. The grain size decreases from 81 to 7.4 μm due to continuous dynamic recrystallization and severe plastic deformation. Obvious basal texture is generated with c-axis angled at deflecting ~20° relative to the PD. After FSP, both β-Mg After aging treatment, the grain size of FSP specimens increases to 7.9 μm. Aging treatment facilitates precipitation of Al Comparing to BM, the YS and UTS of the FSP specimen decreases, and elongation significantly increases along the PD. However, YS, UTS and elongation values along TD improve significantly. Comparing to the FSP specimen, the YS and UTS values of the FSP + AG specimen improve, while elongation decreases regardless of the tensile direction. Moreover, both FSP and FSP + AG specimens exhibit an obvious tensile anisotropy. Deformation of the FSP specimen follows a basal slip and extension twin mechanism. Factors influencing strength of the as-cast AE42 Mg alloy are (a) secondary phases (being the most affecting factor), (b) texture and (c) grain size.
