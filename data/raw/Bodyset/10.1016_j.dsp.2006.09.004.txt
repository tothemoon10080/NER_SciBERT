Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are brain waves, which are recorded using scalp electrodes. Generally, signal attenuate on recording and amplitude of the evoked potentials (EPs) are low when merged with the base brain waves. Therefore, mathematical tools are needed to analysis the time series (EEGs) to discover the EPs in the base EEGs. This paper reviews spectral analysis based on periodic amplitude analysis (PAA), wavelet transform (WT), fast Fourier transform (FFT), and fractal dimension (FD) of EEGs to predict the evoked potentials.
