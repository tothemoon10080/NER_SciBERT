The palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of thiol esters with bis(iodozincio)methane or 1,1-bis(iodozincio)ethane gave Reformatsky-type enolates. They can react with some electrophiles to give the corresponding adducts and were also trapped by silylation reagents to afford silyl enol ethers. As the method applicable to the thiol ester carrying ketone moiety, it afforded zinc enolates carrying ketone in the same molecule.Bis(iodozincio)methane ( According to palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of Various electrophiles can be applied as a substrate to the obtained enolate, as shown in The preparation of the zinc enolate, which has ketone group in the same molecule, is quite useful. To broaden the scope of this method, the formed zinc enolates were transformed into the silyl enol ethers. The silyl enol ethers have been important reagents especially for cross-aldol reactions, but the selective preparation of those compounds are still needed. As shown in As shown in As shown in Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were taken on Varian UNITY INOVA 500 ( A mixture of zinc powder (150 mmol), diiodomethane (1.0 mmol), and PbCl A mixture of zinc powder (150 mmol), 1,1-diiodoethane (1.0 mmol), and PbCl To a solution of Pd                To a solution of Pd      Tri(2-furyl)phosphine (0.082 mmol) in THF (1.0 mL) was added at 25 °C to a solution of Pd                  To a solution of Pd      This zinciomethylation of thiol esters offers an efficient method to give zinc enolates carrying additional ketone regio-, chemo-, and stereoselectively. The enolates can be isolated as the corresponding silyl enol ethers, which are important nucleophilic reagents for organic synthesis. The preparation of the silyl enol ether, which carries ketone moiety in the same molecule, is one of the most useful applications of this method.
