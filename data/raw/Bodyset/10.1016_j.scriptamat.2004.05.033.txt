A nanostructured bulk metallic alloy reinforced by μm-ceramic particles was prepared using nanoprecipitation in glassy matrix phase of a Cu60Zr30Ti10 bulk glassy alloy containing 10 vol% ZrC dispersoids by a heat treatment. Structure of the matrix consists of a nanocrystalline phase less than 5 nm in diameter and a small amount of the residual glassy alloy phase. Composite effects of the nanoprecipitates and ZrC dispersoids on the mechanical properties of the Cu60Zr30Ti10 bulk glassy alloy were investigated by compressive test at room temperature. Both fracture strength and ductility of the Cu60Zr30Ti10 glassy alloy were improved by μm-ZrC dispersoids at as-cast state. This composite material after heat treatment showed lower ductility but higher fracture strength due to nanoprecipitation of the glassy matrix.A number of bulk glassy alloys have been formed by a copper mould casting technique in Mg–Ln–TM This paper is intended to show influence of nanocrystallization in a glassy matrix phase on mechanical properties, compressive strength, Young’s modulus, and plastic elongation, of a bulk glassy alloy containing hard ceramic dispersoids, and to demonstrate performance of this kind of composite design, i.e., bulk nanostructured alloy reinforced by μm-hard-ceramic particles. For base alloy, a Cu Pre-alloy ingot of Cu  In order to investigate the detailed structures of the samples, As-qCZT10 and 7.8CZT10, TEM observations were conducted. Bright-field images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the matrix and dispersoid for the As-qCZT10 are respectively shown in After the annealing, structure of the composite material became nanostructured intermetallic alloy reinforced by μm-ZrC ceramic particles with little residual glassy alloy phase as stated above, and this structural change was considered to bring about significant changes in mechanical properties. In order to clarify the reasons for the change in the mechanical properties with the ZrC dispersoids and nanoprecipitates, fracture surfaces of As-qCZT, As-qCZT10 and 7.8CZT10 under compressive test were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and shown in It is fairly expected that the internal stress exists especially around the ZrC particles and has influence more or less on the mechanical properties. Further investigations of this material are needed for us to clear the composite effects taken with both μm- and nm-particles. By annealing a Cu
