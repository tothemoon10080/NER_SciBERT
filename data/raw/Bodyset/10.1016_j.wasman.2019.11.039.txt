One of the hallmarks of modern society is the increase in the use of electrical and electronic devices. Almost everyone and everywhere (homes, schools, small and large businesses, public services, etc.) use electrical and electronic devices, which are often replaced with new ones in very short periods of time, one year for about 40% of the users ( WEEE is a complex waste stream due to the wide variety of substances used as raw materials for the production of electrical and electronic equipment, as well as the variety of various electrical and electronic products produced. This equipment together with its still-operating parts, hazardous substances (mainly additives used as flame retardants) and its recyclable materials (including precious metals such as gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt)) - very often end up in landfills or waste incinerators which are often unsuitable for accepting this type of waste. Even worse, in some cases these wastes are disposed in uncontrolled landfills or exported without reliable information about their final fate, creating serious environmental problems and at the same time allowing the loss of valuable non-renewable natural resources. Considering the economic/environmental facts, regulations have been issued in EU and worldwide for the management of WEEE through recycling/recovery of metals from this waste stream ( Material recovery has been set of highest priority, as: high production of electric and electronic products utilizes increasing quantities of materials, the resources of these materials (rare earth and other precious metals) are limited and only available in a few places on earth, the disposal of these precious compounds is ecologically and economically unreasonable, the recovery of these valuable elements is challenging, i.e. intense efforts in research and development are necessary, it is important to consider both the high value parts of e-waste that can be recovered as well as the low value residuals which must be managed in an environmentally sound way. The content of this special issue reflects some the latest trends in WEEE recycling, under the prism of urban mining. Some papers focus on specific WEEE streams management, while others consider policies and strategies adopted to achieve the goals set on WEEE recycling.
