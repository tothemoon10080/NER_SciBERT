The federal US regulations describe various types of fresh sausages and their production systems. Definitions of individual types of fresh pork sausages are also outlined. Raw materials (as well as limitations) and casings utilized in production of fresh sausages, as well as seasonings, including regional variations, are described. Hot boning system utilization in fresh sausage production is also discussed. Specific formulations as well as examples of processing procedures of the more popular types of fresh pork sausage are given in table format. German sausage made from ground pork, and/or lamb, turkey, chicken. Boning before chilling (before rigor). A two phase system, with the dispersed phase containing solid or liquid fat particles and the continuous containing water. Obtained by forcing meat and bone, under high pressure through a sieve or similar device to separate the bone from the edible meat. German strongly flavored sausage made from raw ground pork, which is preserved by curing and smoking. German mildly seasoned fresh or smoked sausage. Fresh sausage under the US regulations is defined as fresh, uncured (however, some are cured). Its taste, texture, tenderness, and color are related to the ratio of fat to lean content, and trimmings from primal cuts are often used as raw material. Ice or water is limited to 3% of the total formula. Fresh sausage must be stored under refrigeration and thoroughly cooked before consumption. Binders and extenders are permitted except when prohibited by regulation. There are essentially seven decisions when making fresh sausage: selection of raw materials (species, location of tissue in a carcass, fresh or frozen, and fat content); comminution of the tissue (emulsion to coarse grind); selection of seasonings (flavor) and additives (chemical and physical properties); mixing (uniformity); alteration of the protein (physical propersties and yield); shaping of product (selection of desired form and casing type, if used); and type of storage (normally refrigerated or frozen). Consumers are responsible for cooking (effecting flavor and safety of the sausage). The definition of fresh sausage is not always clear and covers a variety of items manufactured from meat tissue. Many nationalities often have their own specialities of fresh sausage that are tailored to their own organoleptic preferences. The most popular US fresh sausage is ‘fresh pork sausage’ made from individual pork cuts or from the total muscle mass of carcasses (e.g., whole hog carcasses), which is minced and seasoned. However, even the US fresh pork sausages can differ in texture, tissues used, seasonings, type of casings (or without casings), and meat/fat content. The most popular formats of pork sausages are links or patties that are usually consumed at breakfast with gravy (often pork sausage gravy) and eggs in a variety of cooking procedures. Fresh pork sausage is usually not smoked, but smoked variations are also available. All fresh sausages should be cooked before eating, even those that have been smoked. A definition (according to the US meat inspection) of fresh sausage can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, 9 CFR 319 Subpart E. ‘Fresh pork sausage’ can be prepared from fresh or frozen pork, (not including pork by-products), can contain some mechanically separated (species) tissues, can be seasoned, cannot contain more than 50% fat in the finished product, and can contain a maximum of 3% water or ice. ‘Fresh beef sausage’ can be prepared from fresh or frozen beef (not including beef by-products), can contain some mechanically separated (species) tissues, can be seasoned, cannot contain more than 30% fat in the finished product, and can contain a maximum of 3% water or ice. ‘Breakfast sausage’ can be prepared from fresh or frozen meat (including meat by-products), can contain some mechanically separated (species) tissues, can be seasoned, cannot contain more than 50% fat in the finished product, and can contain a maximum of 3% water or ice. ‘Whole hog sausage’ is similar to ‘fresh pork sausage’ except that the pork must be in the same proportion as found in a single carcass and mechanically separated (species) tissue must likewise be in proportion of the species used. ‘Italian sausage products’ are more difficult to define because there are several subcategories, such as cured (must be in the product name) or uncured, cooked (must be in the product name) or uncooked, smoked (must be in the product name) or unsmoked, and seasoned (can include paprika, vegetables, and monosodium glutamate). They can include a maximum of 3% ice or water. ‘Uncooked smoked sausage,’ is smoked with hardwood or other nonresinous material, seasoned, and shall not contain more than 3% added moisture and no more than 50% fat. ‘Pork sausage’ or ‘sausage meat’ in the UK has 65% meat with 60% lean meat, of which 80% is pork; for beef and other sausages, the meat content is reduced to 50%, of which 50% must be lean meat and 50% must be named meat. Tissues used for manufacturing fresh sausages should have a low bacterial count (because no heat is used to reduce their numbers) and the products should be handled under strict sanitation and the temperature should be maintained at or below 2 Color of the trimmings will influence the color of the sausage. Pale, soft, and exudative pork tissue will not only result in a lighter color but also result in more shrinkage when cooked. Dark, firm, and dry pork tissue will result in darker sausages with a pH more favorable for bacterial growth; however, this tissue will have increased water-holding capacity. The percentage of red (darker) as opposed to white (lighter) fibers in muscles is influenced by the animal's genetics and the location in the carcass, with the more active muscles (e.g., the heart, shank, neck, and many muscles in the fore quarter) being darker. Even in the hind leg area, different muscles have different amounts of pigmentation and different muscle fiber types. Species, age of the animal, and exercise will also influence the color. Beef and lamb tissues are usually darker than pork tissue, which is usually darker than chicken tissue. As animals age, muscles usually become darker, and as tissue dries out, it darkens. Mechanically deboned tissue contains more red pigment due to an increase in bone marrow and a decrease in connective tissue. The quantity of connective tissue can have influence on tenderness and chewiness as well as on emulsifying stability in emulsified products. Again, the active shank muscles, cheek muscles, and a portion of the fore quarter are higher in connective tissues. However, fresh sausage is minced and is usually not an emulsion; therefore, tenderness and emulsifying stability are usually not a major problem. Fresh pork sausage in the US must use pork trimmings that do not exceed an average maximum of 50% trimmable fat. An entire pork carcass will yield approximately 50–70% of sausage tissue, if the whole carcass is utilized. Seasoning varies according to the individuals manufacturing the products. Some of the more popular seasoning mixtures can be found in Binders and extenders are permitted (under the US regulations 9 CFR 319 Subpart E) in fresh sausage except where prohibited by regulations; for example, ‘pork sausage’ (9 CFR 319.140), ‘beef sausage’ (9 CFR 319.142), ‘whole hog sausage’ (9 CFR 319.144), and ‘Italian sausage’ (9 CFR 319.145). Sex and age can influence boar taint, which can impart an undesirable flavor and odor to sausage products. Older, intact boars are the major (but not the only) contributors of this undesirable problem. Sausage might be stuffed into casings, linked or not linked, or sold as sausage meat (loose or unstuffed). Natural casings are the small and large intestines of hogs and come in sizes of extra narrow (29 Prerigor sausage production (muscle removal from carcasses by hot boning before chilling) is gaining in popularity. This technique is particularly utilized when whole hog sausages are manufactured because tenderness is not a major problem when utilizing minced tissue. One major advantage of prerigor sausage manufacturing is extended shelf life (can almost be doubled) of the sausage as a result of the salt microbiologically stabilizing the fairly clean tissue before extensive microbial growth and increased chilling efficiency compared with chilling and then boning. Hot boning can also increase yield. Modern whole hog processors today often utilize 240–350 In principle, ‘fresh sausage’ is one of the simplest types of sausage to make, as it is usually neither cured and cooked nor smoked before being sold. It is simply minced tissue that is seasoned, mixed, and stuffed into a casing or sold in bulk. The typical ‘fresh pork sausage’ is processed by mincing through a 12.5 However, some products are cooked (meat precooked before manufacture). Some products after manufacturing are fried. Some are cold or hot smoked and then, in some cases, cooked (62 Other types of fresh sausage are subsequently described.           Polish (Kielbasa): This is a pork or pork (70%) and beef (30%) sausage that is minced through a 6 Italian pork sausage: Some varieties are uncooked, smoked sausage and should be cooked before consuming. ‘Hamburger or burger’ has several meanings to different people, depending on where it is purchased. Retail hamburger is simply fresh (uncooked) ground beef without any additives that is sold refrigerated, packaged with oxygen-permeable film or vacuum packed (which extends shelf life but the product is darker in color when opened), or frozen, thus fitting much of the definition of fresh sausage. Burger at retail is fresh ground beef often containing seasoning, additives, and/or cheese and vegetables, which is closer to the definition of fresh sausage. Hamburger and burger if purchased at a fast-food restaurant is cooked (outside of fresh sausage category) and served with a bun ( ‘European fresh sausage-type products’ include ‘meat loaves,’ ‘meat pies,’ ‘puddings,’ flans,’ ‘pates,’ and fermented products such as ‘salamis’. Many other ‘International products’ also fall into the fresh category. For example, those containing soy can include ‘Boerewors’ (South Africa), ‘Longaniza’ (Philippines), ‘Native Longaniza’ (Philippines), ‘Formulated Beef Patties’ (USA), ‘Formulated Gyro Patties’ (Philippines), ‘Mutton Patty or Maharaja’ (India), ‘Grilled Chicken Patty’ (India), ‘Beef Patty’ (Indonesia), ‘Pork Breakfast Patty’ (USA), ‘Turkey Sausage Patty’ (USA), ‘Turkey Breakfast Patty’ (USA), ‘Chicken Patty’ (USA), ‘Beef Kekaba’ (Pakistan), ‘Beef Burger’ (Italy), ‘Chicken Sausage’ (Indonesia), ‘Food Service Chicken Burger’ (UK), ‘Veal Pojarski Steak’ (UK), ‘Chicken Mignon’ (UK), ‘British Breakfast Banger’ (UK), and ‘Pizza Topping’ (USA) from Hoogenkamp (2001). Many more international fresh sausages containing other additives and extenders could be added to the list if space permitted. Spices sometimes utilized in fresh sausages can be seen in
