This research was conducted to find the most suitable parameters to separate minerals from irradiated dried shrimps and mussels (0 and 5kGy) for thermoluminescence analysis using density separation and modified acid hydrolysis (at 50째C with continuous agitation) methods. Nonirradiated samples gave TL glow curve of low intensity with peak after 300째C except dried mussel sample, which gave false positive result. This problem was absent in minerals separated by acid hydrolysis. TL ratios of all nonirradiated samples were <0.1 irrespective of method used for mineral separation. Minerals separated from irradiated samples by density separation showed very high intensity of TL glow peak before 200째C, where results from irradiated dried shrimp samples were better because of good availability of minerals. The minerals separated from irradiated samples by acid hydrolysis showed slightly low TL intensity and glow curve peak was found at about 200째C. However, acid hydrolysis method was less laborious and required less sample weight as compared to density separation method. TL ratios of all irradiated samples were >0.1 confirming the quality of minerals on TL discs.Food irradiation is being used commercially in more than 55 countries of the world to improve hygienic quality, control of germination, retard sprouting and enhance physical attributes of a food product. All these factors contribute to improve shelf life and safe marketing of an irradiated food and proving importance of irradiation to address dynamic food needs of growing world population ( Among others, thermoluminescence (TL) analysis is also adopted as the European standard for the identification of irradiation history of food from which enough silicate minerals can be separated ( In this study, the thermoluminescence technique was studied using density separation and modified acid hydrolysis method to separate silicate minerals from gamma-irradiated dried shrimps and mussels. In modified acid hydrolysis method, lower temperature (50 Dried shrimp ( Minerals were separated from control and irradiated samples using density separation and modified acid hydrolysis method (  The TL glow curves of minerals extracted with the both methods from nonirradiated and irradiated dried mussel samples are presented in EN 1788 protocol (2001) recommends the confirmation of TL Nonirradiated samples could easily be identified by their low TL glow curve intensity with peak after 300 This research was supported by the
