Background
                  Hoffa's fracture is a coronal oriented fracture of the femoral condyles. Isolated coronal fracture of medial femoral condyle with intact lateral femoral condyle is extremely rare in the pediatric patients. There are only few cases of a medial femoral condyle Hoffa's fracture in a skeletally immature patient that have been reported in the literature.
               
                  The Case
                  In this case report; we present a case of a 12-year-old boy with Hoffa's fracture of the medial femoral condyle, successfully managed by open reduction and internal fixation.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Pediatric Hoffa's fractures are very rare and can be missed. Treatment should be with open reduction and internal fixation to prevent further complications in the long term.Hoffa's fracture, first described in 1904 [ A 12-year-old boy presented to our emergency department with right knee pain and inability to bear weight. History revealed that the patient sustained an injury from a heavy object that fell on his knee. Clinical examination revealed that his knee was swollen and tender, but had no open wounds and the range of motion was restricted due to pain. Neurovascular examination was normal with no signs of compartment syndrome. Radiographs of the knee revealed a medial Hoffa's fracture ( The coronal plane fracture of the femoral condyle was first described by Hoffa in 1904 [ To conclude, we believe that the diagnosis of this fracture can be easily missed, so one should keep this in mind when dealing with traumatized knees in children. It is better to treat this fracture with open reduction and internal fixation to prevent further complications in the long term.
