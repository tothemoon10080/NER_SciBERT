The interactions between fine and coarse hematite particles were investigated, and their effects on the flotation of the hematite using sodium oleate as a collector were studied through micro-flotation tests, supplemented by optical microscopic analysis, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theoretical analysis, and focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) particle/aggregate size analysis. The micro-flotation results show that the recovery of hematite from fine-coarse hematite mixtures did not decrease monotonously with increasing the fine hematite mass ratio. The highest recovery was obtained when the fine and coarse hematite were approximately equal in mass ratio, indicating that the interactions between fine and coarse hematite particles could promote the overall flotation recovery. The results of optical microscopy analysis, EDLVO calculation, and FBRM measurements showed that the interaction energies and aggregation tendencies between fine and coarse hematite particles were stronger than that among the fine hematite particles, and the aggregation would weaken when the coarse and fine fractions were mixed in extreme mass ratios, which explained the observed effects of different mixing ratios of fine and coarse hematite particles on their flotation.Flotation is regarded as one of the most important techniques for the separation of minerals, especially for the finely disseminated ores, where fine grind is essential to achieve the liberation of the value minerals from the gangue ( The low collision efficiencies of fine particles with bubbles are generally caused by the small mass of the particles and consequently their low momentum in the flotation pulp, resulting in a low rate of flotation recovery ( In the case of iron ores, fine and ultrafine hematite particles are inevitably produced during the process of dressing finely disseminated iron ores ( Therefore, in this work, the interactions between fine and coarse hematite particles and the resulting flotation of the fine-coarse hematite mixtures using sodium oleate as a collector were investigated through micro-flotation tests, supplemented by optical microscopy analysis, extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theoretical analysis, and focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) particle/aggregate size analysis. The hematite samples used in this study were obtained from Anshan (Liaoning Province, China). Hand-picked hematite lumps were crushed, ground, and then enriched by using a shaking table to remove light gangue minerals. Two size fractions were generated for the experiments. A fine (<18 Sodium oleate (NaOl) which was used as the collector in this study was chemical pure. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) of analytical grade were used as pH regulators. Distilled water was used in all the experiments. The schematic diagram of the micro-flotation apparatus is shown in In a typical flotation test, 2 The mineral particles (1 Zeta potentials of the hematite particles were measured by a Malvern Instruments Nano-ZS90 zeta potential analyzer at room temperature. A mineral suspension containing 0.01 Contact angle measurements were performed with a FTA-200 contact angle goniometer using a sessile drop technique. Hand-picked pure hematite samples were cut to a proper size approximately 2 The focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) is a probe-based instrument which is inserted directly into a process slurry to study how particle size and count change over time, which allows real-time in-situ measurement of highly turbid samples ( In this study, the FBRM particle/aggregate size measurement was performed with a Mettler Toledo G400 FBRM instrument. 2 The flotation performance of coarse hematite as a function of slurry pH is shown in Based on the above flotation tests, the effect of NaOl concentration on the flotation recoveries of coarse and fine hematite was studied and the results are shown in In order to study the effect of fine hematite on the flotation of fine-coarse hematite mixtures, a theoretical recovery ( The actual recovery ( Since the mechanical entrainment of the flotation tube used in this study is very low, it can be assumed that the recovery of hematite is realized only by genuine flotation. Therefore, the contribution of fine hematite to improve the actual recovery ( The flotation recovery and flotation rate of fine particles are usually lower than that of the coarse particles, and the fine particles also consumes more collectors on a unit mass basis. Hence, it is reasonable to observe that the actual recovery ( Therefore, it can be inferred from the flotation results that the nature of the aggregation between the fine and coarse hematite particles depended on the mass ratio between the fine and coarse hematite. The interactions seemed to be the most beneficial to flotation when the mass of the fine hematite approximately equaled the mass of the coarse hematite. However, at extreme mass ratios, i.e., either too much fine hematite or too much coarse hematite, the interactions did not benefit flotation. In order to investigate the interactions between fine and coarse hematite further, hematite particles after conditioning were analyzed by optical microscopy and the results are presented in It is necessary to investigate interactions between fine and coarse hematite particles without considering the mass ratios, according to the results of flotation ( van der Waals interaction, V Electrostatic interaction, V Hydrophobic (or hydration) interaction, V The values of the above interaction energies are calculated based on the following expressions: van der Waals interaction, V  Electrostatic interaction, V  Hydrophobic interaction ( H According to The data of water surface free energy used in this calculation is presented in The chord length distribution (CLD) presented in FBRM were all unweighted, which aimed to report the variation of the number of fine particles in the slurry ( As shown in The CLD of the slurry at 180 When there were too many coarse particles in the mixture of fine and coarse particles, such as the condition in In this study, the interactions between fine and coarse hematite particles and their effects on flotation using sodium oleate as a collector were investigated. The main observations and conclusions are as follows: The micro-flotation results showed that the recovery of mixtures of fine and coarse hematite did not decrease monotonously with increasing the mass fraction of the fine hematite, and the highest hematite recovery was obtained when the fine and coarse hematite were approximately equal in mass. The EDLVO theory calculation showed that the interaction energies between fine and coarse hematite was stronger than that among fine hematite particles. These calculation results were corroborated by the optical microscopic observation that showed that the aggregation in the mixture of fine and coarse hematite particles could be realized at a relative low sodium oleate concentration. FBRM particle/aggregate size measurement confirmed that maximum aggregation occurred when there were equal mass of coarse and fine hematite, and the aggregation weakened when the coarse and fine hematite were mixed at extreme mass ratios of either too much coarse or too much fine hematite. This was likely caused by the “grinding/attrition” effect of excessive coarse particles and the insufficient coarse particles as the “carriers” at the extreme ratios. These aggregation behaviors may explain the observed effects of different mixing ratios of fine and coarse hematite particles on their flotation.
