The comparative effects of high-energy milling on solid-state thermal syntheses of different magnesium borate compounds from MgO–B2O3 and MgO–B(OH)3 mixtures were investigated for initial MgO:B2O3 mole ratios of 1:0.125, 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 at temperatures between 500 and 900°C. It was observed that magnesium oxide–boric acid mixtures react only by high-energy milling to form hydrous magnesium borates. Following high-energy milling of the initial solid mixtures, anhydrous magnesium borate compounds started to form at temperatures as low as 500°C, and purer and more crystalline phases were obtained at higher temperatures compared to unmilled compositions.Mechanochemistry is concerned with the physical and chemical changes of materials caused by mechanical energy Magnesium borate compounds having MgO· In this study, the effect of high-energy milling on thermal syntheses of different magnesium borate compounds from magnesium oxide–boron trioxide (MgO–B High-energy milling experiments were performed for 20 The X-ray diffraction patterns of high-energy milled mixtures (  When high-energy milled or hand-mixed samples were heated separately at 900 For MgO:B The effect of temperature on the formation of different anhydrous Mg borate compounds was investigated at MgO:B O-M-H(500)-1:1 sample has some peaks of magnesium borates in its XRD pattern with higher amounts of MgO whereas A-M-H(500)-1:1 sample is in X-ray amorphous state with smaller amounts of MgO. This can be explained by the amorphization of crystalline hydrous Mg borate phases observed only in the high-energy milled MgO–B(OH) The infrared spectra of the samples with MgO:B For the first time, the comparative effects of high-energy milling on the synthesis of different magnesium borates from solid–solid mixtures of MgO–B The author wish to acknowledge Peter Baláž and Maria Galdova from Instiute of Geotechnics of SAS (Slovakia), Juraj Černák from Pavol Jozef Šafárik University (Slovakia), and Abidin Temel and Filiz Ercan from Hacettepe University (Turkey) for their helps during experimental studies.
