                     6O42]6− and a new mononuclear vanadium complex [VON(CH2CH2O)3] (2) were synthesized by controlling conditions of solvothermal synthesis and characterized by single crystal XRD, IR, XPS and EA, respectively. The compound 1 presents interesting antiferromagnetic interaction in solid state and luminescent property in aqueous solution.Polyoxovanadates (POVs) and mononuclear vanadium complex have attracted extensive interest owing to their various structures and potential applications in many fields, such as the molecular magnets and sensor technology In our previous work, we explored the new synthesis route in organic media with soluble vanadium precursors and prepared polyoxovanadate-supported vanadium complex by covalent bonds Parallel experiments indicated that the use of GeO Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the structure of compound Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compounds In recent years, POVs have attracted much attention since they can serve as molecular magnets comprising isotropic spin 1/2 vanadyl (VO The luminescent property of polyoxovanadate clusters could be interesting, as compound In summary, two vanadium-based complexes [Me We are grateful to the  [Full details of synthesis and characterization: IR, XP, PXRD, 1/
