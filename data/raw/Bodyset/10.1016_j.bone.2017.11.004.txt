Introduction
                  We still lack understanding of why some implants fail while most remain stable after decades of use. Proinflammatory cytokines, matrix proteins and bone regulating cytokines of the RANKL/OPG (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand/osteoprotegerin) and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are mandatory for normal bone repair but their spatial and temporal role in the healing of primary total hip arthroplasties (THA) has not been previously shown.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  Twenty-four osteoarthritis patients with one-sided well-fixed primary THA were prospectively monitored during 18years (18Y) with repeated blood samples, clinical variables and radiographs. Eighty-one healthy donors divided in three age- and gender-matched groups and twenty osteoarthritis patients awaiting THA and serving as control of the validity of stored plasma in THA patients, were included. Plasma was analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, osteopontin (OPN), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC/osteonectin), osteocalcin (OC), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), N-terminal propeptide of collagen type I (P1NP), RANKL, OPG, the Wnt agonistic ligands (Wnt)-1 and Wnt-3a, and the Wnt antagonists sclerostin, Dickkopf (Dkk)-1, Dkk-3, Dkk-4, secreted frizzled related protein (sFRP)-1, sFRP-3 and Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif-1).
               
                  Results
                  Inflammatory mediators in arthroplasty patients (CRP, IL-6, OPN) increased significantly on day one after surgery vs preoperative value (PR) and healthy subjects and returned to baseline at 6W. TNF-α did not change relative preoperative level or healthy subjects. SPARC and OC increased in a biphasic fashion with the primary phase beginning shortly after surgery and lasting 3M (SPARC) and 2Y (OC) while the secondary phase peaked at 1Y (SPARC) and 13Y (OC), with both returning to basal level at 15Y. BALP peaked at 3M after surgery with a return to basal level at 2Y followed by a continuous increase from 5Y until 18Y. P1NP increased immediately after surgery and returned to basal level at 6W followed by a new peak at 10Y returning to basal at 13Y. IL-8 and IL-1β peaked at 5Y post-THA and returned to basal level at 10Y. RANKL/OPG and Wnt/β-catenin remained at preoperative levels until 5Y post-THA when a sustained increase in OPG level, paralleled by a sustained decrease in sclerostin, started and lasted until 18Y. Despite a strong increase by RANKL at 13Y, the OPG/RANKL-ratio remained high between 5Y and 18Y. Dkk-1 and sFRP-1 remained at basal level until 5Y followed by a peak at 7Y and a return to basal level at 15Y. Similarly, RANKL increased after 5Y, peaked at 13Y and returned to basal levels at 18Y, thus coinciding with Wnt-1. In contrast, Wnt3a, Dkk-3, Dkk-4, sFRP-3 and Wif-1 did not differ from preoperative levels or healthy subjects during the course of the follow-up.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The primary peak of proinflammatory cytokines involved in the initiation of bone healing after trauma is in line with previous results. The primary phase of increased matrix proteins, P1NP and BALP paralleled by RANKL, OPG and Wnt/β-catenin remaining at preoperative level until 5Y, support a strong formation of mineralized matrix and to a lesser degree bone during this phase. The secondary proinflammatory peak at 5Y is likely a trigger of coupled bone remodeling and neosynthesis as it is followed by increased levels of the bone anabolic turnover marker, BALP, and mediators of the RANKL/OPG and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. A continuous increase by OPG level and the bone turnover marker, BALP, lasting from 5Y until 18Y and paralleled by a similar decrease in sclerostin level support their being key regulators of bone anabolism, whereas the transient and opposed activities of RANKL, Wnt-1, Dkk-1 and sFRP-1 serve as fine tuning tools during the coupled remodeling phase.Despite a considerable number of in vitro studies investigating the immune responses to wear debris, we are still in the dark as to why wear generated in the vicinity of all hip implants only causes a limited number of implants to fail whereas a majority survive 20 Many studies of prosthesis loosening have shown wear particles to be engulfed by phagocytic cells causing them to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases which are believed to play an important role in periprosthetic osteolysis by aiding in the differentiation, maturation and activation of osteoclasts The tight interdependence and interplay between various systems and pathways in bone repair has been the focus of many studies The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from every patient prior to inclusion. This study, with level of evidence II, complies with the STROBE-statement for observational studies Venous blood was drawn into EDTA tubes from THA patients on the day before surgery (PR), one day after surgery (PO), 6 An important issue when storing blood samples over extended periods of time is the degree of degradation which could have significant impact on the interpretation of data. To ascertain the validity of stored plasma, plasma levels of biomarkers in THA patients taken before surgery and stored for 18 Data are presented as the mean Basal demographic and laboratory data along with plasma cytokine levels are presented in As expected, the preoperative HHS and pain scores improved vs 1 Comparison of plasma from THA patients taken before surgery (PR), i.e. stored 18 Results from the statistical comparisons are given in Data from the statistical analyses of matrix proteins and bone turnover markers (OPN, SPARC, OC, BALP, P1NP) in total hip arthroplasty patients versus healthy control patients and differences between preoperative levels and peak levels after surgery within the group of hip implant patients are given in Data from the statistical analyses of cytokines in total hip arthroplasty patients versus healthy control patients and differences between preoperative levels and peak levels after surgery within the group of hip implant patients are given in As the follow-up of THA patients span over a period of two decades, we believed it to be of importance to correct for any gender and age-related changes in biomarker levels by including matched healthy control subjects along the length of the follow-up. In affirmation, plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in the current study came out significantly higher with increasing age in healthy subjects. These observations are in accordance with previous reports showing higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in elderly individuals Previous studies in patients undergoing major surgical procedures, including arthroplasties, have shown a pronounced and short-lasting increase in systemic levels of IL-6 and CRP early after surgery, believed to be a general physiological response to injury aimed at preparing the innate immune system to coming challenges and linked to the magnitude and duration of the surgical trauma rather than to the site of trauma The nature of the tissues harbored in the interfaces during the early years after surgery has been a matter of much debate. Cadaver retrieval studies investigating the interfaces of human uncemented porous-coated hip implants have shown a wide variation of tissues ranging from exclusively fibrous tissue to its combination with woven, cancellous or compact bone Matrix synthesis begins immediately after surgery, as shown by the strong increase of P1NP on day one post-THA with a return to basal level within weeks ( Mineralization of the matrix follows in the footsteps of ECM formation (P1NP) and begins by formation of matrix vesicles budded from the surface membrane of chondrocytes and osteoblasts. The vesicles contain calcium and inorganic phosphate (Pi) which precipitate to form hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals that propagate into the ECM and fill the spaces between the fibrils A pronounced and highly significant peak in plasma IL-8 and IL-1β appearing 5 A simultaneous increase in IL-8 and IL-1β could herald the introduction of infectious agents via the circulation as both cytokines can be induced by nearly all microbial products One of the most investigated factors linked to prosthesis failure is the phagocytosis of wear particles by immune cells causing them to release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with IL-1β being a prime factor in the pathology of osteolysis The most plausible explanation to the late peak of IL-1β and IL-8 is that it is part of the secondary proinflammatory phase which is mandatory for bone healing to proceed normally. It will stimulate the transformation of stem cells into osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts and start the coupled remodeling phase characterized by woven bone of the callus being replaced with lamellar and cortical bone A strong secondary phase of increased P1NP support a renewed ECM synthesis which begins after the late proinflammatory phase and reaches a peak at 10 The role of canonical Wnt in the regulation of the ECM has gained much support in recent years showing the pathway to directly and indirectly activate ECM biosynthesis and to be in continuous cross-talk with cell-matrix adhesion proteins The importance of the Wnt pathway in bone homeostasis did only emerge at the beginning of this century but has since been widely investigated and has revealed some of its secrets and, above all, its complexity and importance as a master controller of bone formation The lack of response by Wnt3a, Dkk-3, Dkk-4, sFRP-3 and Wif-1 in the present study showed that they have a subordinate role in prosthesis healing as opposed to their roles in other bone related conditions In the current study we present data from patients with one-sided well-fixed hip implants after a follow-up of 18 A limitation of the present study is the number of subjects. As opposed to sclerostin, which is the exclusive product of osteocytes, other mediators are more or less bone specific as they are also produced by other tissues. A strength of the study is that biomarkers were analyzed during two decades in the same population of THA patients by use of a highly accurate and sensitive technique allowing for detection of low levels and small changes The authors have nothing to disclose.
