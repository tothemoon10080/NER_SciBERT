Oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions are exceptional carriers for a wide range of industrial applications, and for several bioactive compounds in functional foods and additives, promoting their homogeneous dispersion in the end product, as well as protecting them from interaction with other ingredients, and from degradation during end product transformation, storage, and preparation. This chapter describes the main features of O/W nanoemulsions for the delivery of bioactive compounds, giving insights on their methods of fabrication, especially from the perspective of industrial applications. In addition, this chapter provides recent examples of O/W nanoemulsions designed and developed for the encapsulation of different classes of payload compounds with diverse functionalities, ranging from the antimicrobial activity of essential oils, to the health-beneficial properties of polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamins, and lipids, as well as organoleptic features of flavors. The main bioactive compounds used in food functionalization include phytochemicals, micronutrients, and dietary fiber. However, their biological functions are often lost owing to their poor dispersibility in foods, physicochemical instability under food processing conditions (temperature, light, oxygen, interaction with food matrix ingredients), and in the gastrointestinal tract (pH, enzymes, presence of other nutrients), as well as insufficient gastric residence time and low permeability within the gut ( For example, polyphenols, which represent a heterogeneous group of phytochemicals with well-recognized beneficial effects on human health ( Carotenoids, another group of phytochemicals such as xanthophylls and carotenes, also exhibit remarkable health-beneficial properties ( Bioactive lipids, such as omega-3, 6, and 9 unsaturated fatty acids, are also phytochemicals with well-recognized health-beneficial properties. However, numerous challenges exist in the production, transportation, and storage of fatty acid-fortified functional foods, since these lipids are extremely susceptible to oxidative deterioration ( Essential oils (EOs), phytochemicals characterized by diverse biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, expectorant, carminative, pesticidal, and above all antimicrobial properties ( Micronutrients, including dietary minerals such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and chromium, are necessary to the human body only in very small quantities, but their deficiency can cause serious health problems. Their incorporation in foods is challenged by their interaction with food constituents, such as lipids and proteins, which may cause a loss or decrease of their bioavailability, as well as food alteration ( Dietary fibers, which represent a group of plant carbohydrates that are resistant to hydrolysis by enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract, are important components of the diet because of their functional and metabolic effects ( It is therefore clear that current difficulties associated with the development of functional foods are associated with the effective incorporation of bioactive compounds in food matrices: there is a pressing need for edible delivery systems to encapsulate, protect, and release bioactive compounds which are suitable for the food industry ( In particular, it is highly desirable to enable the control the In-body behavior should be characterized by controlled release from the food matrix, preferably triggered by environmental changes, such as pH (chewing, gastrointestinal tract), temperature (body temperature, cooking), mechanical shear (chewing, mastication), enzymes (gastrointestinal tract), addition of moisture (dissolution, chewing), controlling the fate of bioactive compounds during gastric and intestinal digestion, and maximization of the bioavailability of the active compounds, taking into account epithelial cell uptake, absorption in the bloodstream, and reaching the target sites. Oil-in-water (O/W) food nanoemulsions are ideal candidates for carriers of lipophilic bioactive compounds such as polyphenolic compounds, carotenoids, EOs, and unsaturated fatty acids, due to the affinity of their core for bioactive components, their wide food compatibility, the simple industrial scalability of their manufacturing process, and their ability to cross biological membranes ( O/W nanoemulsions are composed of oil droplets, with mean droplet size typically ranging from 20 to 200 Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable systems, which naturally tend to phase separation to minimize their free energy. The reduction of mean droplet size to nanometric values contributes significantly to imparting physical (meta)stability against gravitational separation phenomena, because Brownian motion effects tend to dominate over gravitational forces. In addition, nanoemulsions exhibit a lower tendency to droplet aggregation than conventional emulsions, because the strength of the net attractive forces acting between droplets usually decreases with decreasing droplet diameter ( However, coalescence phenomena due to Ostwald ripening are reported to severely affect nanoemulsion stability when oils with high water solubility are used as the disperse phase (i.e., EOs). During Ostwald ripening, larger droplets grow at the expense of smaller ones, because of molecular diffusion of oil between droplets through the continuous phase, owing to the higher local oil solubility of smaller droplets as opposed to larger ones ( The encapsulation of bioactive compounds in O/W nanoemulsions enables their efficient incorporation in foods because of easy fabrication by high-throughput processes Depending on the properties of the bioactive compounds (in particular, lipophilicity vs. hydrophilicity), the payload localization within an O/W nanoemulsion droplet may be predominantly either within the inner oil phase (bioactive-enriched core) or into the outer stabilizer film (bioactive-enriched shell), with obvious implications for stability, release, and bioavailability of the encapsulated bioactive compounds ( Nanoemulsions are also reported to enhance the beneficial effects of encapsulated bioactive compounds, owing to the synergistic combination of nanometric droplet size and co-administration of a lipid (such as medium chain triglycerides or vegetable oils), which are able to enhance transport through the intestinal walls and cell uptake ( Nanoemulsions with a solid lipid core, also termed solid lipid nanoparticles, exhibit increased chemical protection of the payload against degradation, a higher encapsulation efficiency (>90%), and a better controlled release, due to immobilization of the encapsulated compounds in the solid lipid matrix ( The fabrication of nanoemulsions is in general carried out at high throughput using mechanical processes, based on a top-down approach for the disruption of larger systems into homogeneously sized droplets with desired properties. However, bottom-up approaches are also possible through direct assembly of molecular building blocks into structured systems. Mixed approaches are typically used for complex systems (i.e., multilayer emulsions), where molecular assembly and comminution processes are combined. Top-down approaches are mainly based on comminution by mechanical size reduction techniques, through focused particle stressing in a process fluid, where intense fluid-mechanical stresses are generated. In particular, the most used systems for nanoemulsion fabrication in the food and nutraceutical industry, colloid milling and HPH, are mainly based on stress transmission through a surrounding fluid. However, less energy-intensive top-down approaches are possible, such as membrane emulsification. In comparison to bottom-up processes, top-down approaches offer the significant advantage of minimal use of chemical additives (  Colloid mills represent a low-cost and easily scalable method of nanoemulsion fabrication. However, the final emulsion droplet size is generally larger compared to other comminution systems (i.e., HPH), and loss of bioactive compounds might be an issue owing to adhesion to the inner surface of the milling chamber (   The emulsification process is influenced by the efficiency with which the energy dissipated in the homogenization chamber is transmitted to the particles or droplets to be comminuted. In particular, among the possible homogenization chamber geometries, the orifice valve appears to be one of the most efficient at producing fine emulsion droplet for a given energy input ( However, emulsification by HPH does not involve only the droplet break-up, but also the absorption of the emulsifier on newly formed interfaces to prevent recoalescence phenomena. Our recent work showed that the properties of the emulsifier also play a very important role in the efficiency of the emulsification process ( This concept is further elucidated in In comparison with media milling and HPH, Despite the fact that most of the literature results report membrane emulsification as a process to produce micrometric size emulsions, optimization of membrane type and emulsion formulation, together with precise control of processing conditions, may enable the fabrication of nanometric size emulsions ( The drawbacks of direct membrane emulsification, such as low productivity and the strong dependence of emulsion uniformity on the viscosity of the disperse phase and on the size distribution of the membrane pores, can be overcome by premix membrane emulsification, where a preliminary coarse emulsion is passed through a microporous membrane into the continuous phase ( Current challenges to nanoemulsion fabrication by top-down approaches include the minimization of energy consumption while preventing re-aggregation and segregation of small and large particles ( Submicrometric systems can also be produced through physicochemical processes, in general based on bottom-up approaches to the spontaneous association of molecules or larger building blocks around the bioactive compounds, driven by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces tending to thermodynamic equilibrium. The entity of the forces involved can be controlled by environmental factors, such as temperature, concentration, pH, and ionic strength of the system ( In general, fabrication of nanoemulsions via bottom-up approaches is based on the dissolution of the bioactive compounds and eventual additional lipid phase in a suitable organic solvent, followed by their separation in nanometric droplets through a nonsolvent addition in the presence of stabilizers (  This process is relatively simple, prevents the encapsulated drug from being degraded during processing, consumes low amounts of energy, and allows an easy industrial scale-up. Moreover, the formed nanoemulsions are kinetically stable and can be considered irreversible ( The The rapid diffusion of the organic solvent in the aqueous phase promotes the formation of nanoemulsions, enabling their preparation in one step, at a low energy input, with a high yield of encapsulation. However, the use of this technique is limited to water-miscible solvents ( In mixed approaches, molecular assembly and comminution processes are combined to fabricate complex systems. In the case of nanoemulsion, a mixed approach can be used to produce multiple-layer polyelectrolyte nanoemulsions through the layer-by-layer method ( The The main disadvantage of this approach is the need for dilution of the nanoemulsion systems in order to exploit the electrostatic attraction forces between oppositely charged biopolymers, and therefore an intrinsically low suitability for industrial application, where intensive concentration steps are generally not desirable. The use of O/W nanoemulsions as delivery systems for different bioactive compounds for food and pharmaceutical applications has been deeply investigated in recent years. In recent years, increasing interest has been shown in the use of EOs as natural antimicrobial agents for food preservation against food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria. Due to their low solubility in water, EOs need to be encapsulated in appropriate delivery systems to promote their efficiency ( Several studies have been conducted on the use of nanoemulsions for the encapsulation of different bioactives, such as polyphenols ( In addition, nanoemulsions were also shown to enhance the beneficial effects of encapsulated bioactive compounds when administered orally. For example, using a mouse ear inflammation model, higher anti-inflammation activity was observed when curcumin was administered orally encapsulated in nanoemulsions ( Vitamins, such as α-tocopherol ( Furthermore, deposition of multiple layers of stabilizers and biopolymers around oil droplets via the layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition technique has been extensively studied in order to provide tailored interfacial properties to the nanoemulsions. For example, the deposition of chitosan layers on emulsion droplets was reported to retard lipid oxidation of encapsulated omega-3 fatty acids, avoiding the development of off-odor and loss in nutritive value ( Encapsulation of bioactive compounds represents an efficient and widely applied approach in the food industry to promote homogeneous dispersion in the food product, to improve protection from interaction with other ingredients, and prevent degradation during food transformation, storage, and preparation, as well as to control release. To date, O/W nanoemulsions represent a simple yet effective delivery system for poorly water-soluble bioactive compounds with lipophilic moieties, owing to their ease of fabrication, formulation flexibility with a wide range of food-grade ingredients, and food and biological compatibility. In particular, O/W nanoemulsions can be produced through top-down approaches, which are based on robust and easily scalable processes, but which are energy-intensive. In contrast, bottom-up approaches, based on controlling the environmental conditions of colloidal assembly, are significantly less energy-demanding processes, but often require the use of organic solvents, which are not desirable in food applications. Mixed approaches, such as the layer-by-layer technique, are instead currently used to add structural complexity and functionality to nanoemulsions. To date, O/W nanoemulsions have been applied to the delivery of a wide range of bioactive compounds in order to develop efficient strategies of natural food preservation (EO nanoemulsions), to add health-beneficial properties (nanoemulsions encapsulating polyphenols, carotenoids, vitamins, or fatty acids), as well to deliver flavors. Future trends are toward the development of nanoemulsion-based delivery systems with an increased compatibility with food matrices, and higher capability to cross biological membranes, in order to answer two different needs, one related to the increase in the use of bioactive compounds in food products with beneficial effects on human health, the other related to the design of novel foods tailored for personalized nutrition of groups of the population, such as young or elderly people, with particular dietetic requirements. The increased awareness not only among researchers and medical doctors, but also among consumers, of disease and illness prevention through everyday diet is currently opening new possibilities for the introduction in the market of an increasing number of novel functional food products, which, if sustained by strong advances in science and technology to overcome issues of delivery, compatibility, and industrial scalability, could sustain the agro-food industry of developed countries in the very aggressive global scenario.
