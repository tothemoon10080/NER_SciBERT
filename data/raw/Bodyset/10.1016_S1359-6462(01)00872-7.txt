An amorphous cast iron has been developed by Inoue et al. through a small addition of B into commercial FC20 cast iron In the present study, we report the improvement of glass forming ability (GFA) of pig iron by B, Si and Zr additions and preliminary results on the fabrication of bulk nanostructured materials of pig iron through warm processing. Ingots (30g) with the compositions listed in A mixture of α-Fe and cementite (Fe Warm processing to form bulk specimens has been carried out using pulverized amorphous powders of the alloy PSBZ at a temperature of 520°C with an external pressure of ∼1 GPa and holding time for 2 hrs. Through the addition of a small amount of Si, B and Zr that have large atomic differences and negative heats of mixing with Fe, fully amorphous ribbon of pig iron can be prepared by melt spinning.
