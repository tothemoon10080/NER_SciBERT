Precipitation of Mg3(AsO4)2 for the removal of arsenic (As) from a molybdenum oxide processing plant liquor containing 70.9g/L Mo(VI) and 469mg/L As(V) was performed. The Stabcal software was used to model the speciation and solubility equilibria, and to identify the pH conditions at which optimum precipitation can be carried out. The optimum pH range for As(V) removal is between pH 7.5 and 10.2. This avoids the need to adjust the liquor pH to affect the precipitation. By adding magnesium chloride or sulphate at a Mg:As molar ratio of at least 2:1, As(V) could be removed to less than 5mg/L at pH 10.2 resulting in a pure Mo(VI) liquor from which a high purity product of 99.9% MoO3 could be produced by acidification.Different techniques have been established for the removal of arsenic from ground water, wastewater and process liquors ( Following the pioneering work of Lime has also been used extensively to remove arsenic during water/waste water treatment ( Of interest to this study are the results reported by Details of a flowsheet ( The equilibrium reactions illustrating the stability of several hydroxides, arsenates and molybdates relevant to the study, are shown in The removal of As(V) by precipitation of Mg(II) –As(V) is ideal as Mg(OH) If the solubility of the salt M Then the solubility of salt M The solubilities of AsO This study investigates the possibility of selective precipitation of magnesium arsenate using speciation diagrams, solubility measurements and characterization of the precipitated product by XRD. The Stabcal program was used for the Mo–Mg–As–H All chemical reagents used in the laboratory tests were of analytical grade. In previous studies the molybdenum loaded organic phase was stripped with ~ The ICP-MS (ICPM-8500) analysis of the stripped liquor at a pH of 10.2 produced using 12.5% (w/v) NH The maximum Mg(II) concentration allowed before MgMoO Samples were taken at different time intervals, filtered using a 1 In a larger scale experiment a 20 Due to the lack of reliable information on As(III) precipitation noted in The equilibrium reactions illustrating the stability of several hydroxides, arsenates and molybdates relevant to the study, shown in  Likewise, the inclusion of several As(III) species (such as AsO The optimum pH conditions were determined after several speciation modeling runs which were conducted to evaluate the possibility of precipitating Mg   The oxidation of the synthetic As(III) solution by adding H The stoichiometric requirement for producing Mg The precipitation of Mg(OH) The removal of As(V) at pH Although Mg According to The morphology of the precipitated material is important for plant practice as a subsequent filtration stage after precipitation is required for removing Mg According to the product specifications for commercial MoO From the precipitation study, optimum plant operation conditions could be set at pH 9–11, ambient temperature and reaction time less than 10–20 The removal of As(V) from the molybdenum strip liquor produced from a solvent extraction circuit is essential for the production of high purity MoO This work was supported by the
