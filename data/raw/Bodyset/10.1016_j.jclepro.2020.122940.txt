The massive unconventional petroleum resources of Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada are currently being excavated and processed using the hot water bitumen extraction (HWBE) process and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology. A major challenge associated with HWBE process is high energy intensity for maintaining an operation temperature of 40–55 °C. Solvent-assisted ambient aqueous bitumen extraction processes, in which a portion of solvent is added for oil sands pretreatment prior to extraction process, have been reported to be capable of reducing the energy intensity via ambient temperature oil sands extraction operations. However, there is still a gap between the current solvent-assisted process and industrial expectations. This study focuses on optimization of biodiesel-assisted ambient aqueous bitumen extraction, an example of the solvent-assisted process, by incorporating methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) and ethylene oxide-propylene oxide (EO-PO) copolymer in oil sands pretreatment. The idea is to take advantage of such chemicals and demulsifiers used downstream of heavy oil (known as bitumen) extraction process by their addition upfront as in the case of biodiesel-assisted hybrid extraction process. With the incorporation of these chemicals and demulsifiers in the improved biodiesel-assisted process, both bitumen liberation and bitumen flotation efficiency were improved significantly with the addition of biodiesel/MIBC mixture at 10 wt% of bitumen. The results from bench-scale experiments revealed a higher bitumen recovery and a cleaner bitumen froth by the improved biodiesel-assisted process at ambient temperature as compared with the traditional biodiesel-assisted process, as well as current industrial HWBE process, featuring a cleaner production of heavy oil from Athabasca oil sands and other heavy oil resources.Oil sands in Northern Alberta, Canada, are one of the largest crude reservoirs in the world, with an estimated 165-billion barrels of heavy oil (known as bitumen) reserve that is commercially recoverable ( Many progresses have been achieved in developing solvent-assisted ambient aqueous bitumen extraction (SA Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) is a frother widely used in mineral processing industry ( Polymeric demulsifiers are widely used in petroleum industry to demulsify the emulsified water droplets in crude oil for desired phase separation of water from crude oil ( An industrial-grade naphtha and a low-grade Athabasca oil sands were obtained from Syncrude Canada Ltd. The Athabasca oil sands are one of the heaviest crude oil resources and are extremely difficult to extract the heavy oil known as bitumen from them. As described in The procedures of bench-scale bitumen extraction tests are shown schematically in To achieve good analysis of bitumen froth, the bitumen froth collected were analyzed using two different methods. In one case, both primary and secondary froths were analyzed for bitumen, solids, and water content using a well-established Dean-Stark procedure with toluene as refluxing solvent ( VDF bitumen blended with biodiesel (case of basic BA Interfacial properties between bitumen and process water are important factors for bitumen recovery and highly dependent on chemicals added to bitumen ( Bitumen liberation and aeration are two major sub-processes in extracting bitumen from mineable oil sands ( To gain a sound understanding of bitumen flotation efficiency which is affected by the characteristics of bubbles, the effect of MIBC and/or EO-PO demulsifiers on foaming behavior of process water was studied using a graduated glass column. The solution was prepared by adding VDF bitumen with or without chemical additives to process water at a concentration of 0.5 wt%. Proper ultrasonication described in a previous paper was applied to better disperse bitumen in solution ( The size of bitumen droplets in the process water was determined using a focused-beam reflectance measurement (FBRM; Lasentec S400A, Mettler-Toledo, OH, USA). The principle and operating parameters of FBRM were reported in another study ( Bitumen aeration characteristics was evaluated by determining the induction time ( This study focused mainly on the extraction tailings. The tailings from oil sands extraction tests were collected in a graduated jar with the descending of the mudline being recorded to up to 50 h. Details on experimental procedures were reported in a previous publication ( Bench-scale bitumen extraction from real oil sands was conducted in this study to examine the total hydrocarbon recovery using the modified BA As shown in More importantly, increasing MIBC dosage in biodiesel was found to further improve both primary and secondary recovery, with a further increase in total recovery up to ∼25%. The addition of 1500 ppm (0.15 wt% of bitumen) EO-PO showed a further improvement in both primary and secondary recovery (shaded bars). The results clearly show a significant increase in bitumen recovery by including MIBC and EO-PO in a total solvent mixture addition rate of 10 wt% bitumen using the modified BA As shown in The salty water in petroleum emulsions could cause severe problems to downstream oil upgrading and refining operations ( To examine this hypothesis, bitumen froth was diluted using naphtha to simulate an industrial naphthenic froth cleaning process. The water content in the treated diluted bitumen, mostly in the form of W/O emulsions, was determined by Karl-Fischer coulometric titration. The water content present in both primary and secondary froths in the basic BA In addition to bitumen recovery and froth quality, tailings consolidation is another important factor for sustainable development of oil sands resources. In this study, the normalized mudline height, As shown in The results of bitumen extraction tests using real oil sands ( The bitumen extraction from oil sands is known to be influenced by the viscosity of bitumen ( As well elaborated by With the addition of biodiesel to 10 wt% of bitumen, the bitumen-water interfacial tension, To study the role of MIBC and EO-PO addition in enhancing bitumen extraction, the effects of these chemical aids on bitumen liberation from real oil sands, real-time bitumen recession and release of bitumen from oil sands were investigated using a custom-designed on-line visualization system ( Replacing unmeasurable interfacial tensions with Young’s equation in Equation Although biodiesel addition increased ultimate bitumen liberation, Flotation is an important part of bitumen extraction from mineable oil sands. To effectively recover bitumen after its liberation from sand grains, the emulsified bitumen droplets need to attach to air bubbles which float to the top of slurry under buoyancy force where they are collected as bitumen froth ( In addition to increasing bubble surface area flux (S Since MIBC addition is shown to reduce bitumen-water interfacial tension ( Once an air bubble collides with a bitumen droplet, a contact time is required for the bitumen droplet to attach to the air bubble surface, known as bitumen aeration. The minimum time required for bitumen attachment to air bubbles is known as induction time ( Based on results discussed above, the critical role of adding MIBC and EO-PO in biodiesel in improving bitumen flotation schematically shown in Synergy of frother (i.e., MIBC) and polymer demulsifier (i.e., EO-PO copolymer) in BA  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
