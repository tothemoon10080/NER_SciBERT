Fractures of the radial head are the most common fractures in the elbow, and they frequently have associated ligamentous, cartilaginous, or other bony injuries. Clinical assessment and radiological investigation allow for accurate diagnosis and the formulation of a management plan. Undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures with no rotational block to motion can be treated nonoperatively with excellent results expected. The minimum amount of displacement in a partial articular radial head fracture required for open reduction and internal fixation to provide a superior outcome to nonoperative management is still unknown. Medium-term data suggest that patients with comminuted radial head fractures do well with radial head replacement.
