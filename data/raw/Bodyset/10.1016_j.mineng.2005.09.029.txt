Chemical and mineralogical changes were studied during experimental sulphuric acid leaching of oxide copper ores from Mina Sur, Chuquicamata, Chile, to validate predictive tools for the heap leaching process.The continuous efforts to improve the recovery of copper in heap leaching operations ( The principal ores at Mina Sur, are chrysocolla, atacamite, copper wad and pitch with quartz, feldspars, phyllosilicates, iron oxides and hydroxides as gangue minerals; each geologic unit is assigned a Geo-Metallurgical Unit (UGM) based on chemical and physical quality graded from 1 to 5 marking increasing aptitude for successful Cu extraction. Blending is the option to process them, however gangue behavior has to be improved to minimize errors. A previous experimental study with synthetic aggregates ( Ores (“Grava Exótica” Ex and “Grava Achocolatada” Ach), were characterized macroscopically, microscopically and X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the <2 Copper content and CEC represent extreme values for both ores ( However XRD of the <2 The acid pretreatment leached 60% of Cu in the Ex ore and 100% in the Ach ore; a clear sulphatation of clasts surfaces is observed and not-reacted chrysocolla (Ex) remains in the nuclei of some clasts after the leaching experiment. Neoformed phases are chalcantite (Cu Leaching recovered was 93% in the Ex ore and and 83% Cu in the Ach ore; water rinsing and elution recovered 0.37% and 0.19% respectively in the Ex ore, and 2.56% and 3.08% in the Ach ore. From 3% of Cu retained in the Ex ore, 18% is recovered by rinsing and elution and from 5% of Cu retained in the Ach ore, 100% is recovered in these two steps. Cu recovery during elution is directly dependant on the CEC. Mineral characterization by microscopy together with XRD clay phase specification in the <2 Water rinse and elution identify elements physically and chemically retained respectively by the gangue. Cu recovery is related directly to the CEC of both ores, these validating the previous previous studies with synthetic aggregates.
