For the synthesis of a high-performance photocatalyst, titania nanotubular films deposited with noble metal particles were fabricated by a wetting and annealing process, and the surface characteristics of the TiO2 photocatalyst were investigated. To examine the photocatalytic properties, the efficiency of the dye decomposition rate was evaluated. The photocatalytic results confirmed the dye-destroying effectiveness of the titania nanotubular catalysts deposited with noble metal particles. The wetting and annealing process can be applied to produce a titania photocatalyst with high functional properties.Nanotubular structures have attracted considerable interest since they combine the advantages of being nanosize, such as having a high specific surface area, and anisotropic, which affects their electronic, photonic, mechanical, and chemical properties In this study on the synthesis of titania nanotubes deposited with noble metal particles, a wetting and annealing process was applied Commercial-grade titanium plates (99.6 For the synthesis of nanoparticles on TiO  The metal particles deposited on the anodic TiO In order to investigate the effects of annealing on the precipitation of palladium nanoparticles, polymer compound composed of PLA/Pd(OAc)  The chemical composition on the cross-sectional area of titania nanotubes, shown in  After running the dye decomposition test, 43.2% and 78.4% of the dye from the photocatalytic reaction of the anodic TiO To synthesize a high-performance photocatalyst, titania nanotubular films covered by noble metal particles were fabricated, and the surface characteristics of the TiO
