Surface sulfidization is the key to achieving good flotation performance of smithsonite, but its reaction mechanism at the atomic level remains poorly understood. In this work, the interaction of two S-species, i.e., S2− and SH− with smithsonite (0 0 1) surface in presence of water molecule was investigated using the density functional theory (DFT). The results indicated that the initial adsorption position of H2O molecule on the smithsonite surface had an important influence on the sulfuration reaction. There was no chemical interaction between S-species and smithsonite surface when the H2O molecule was perpendicularly placed between the S-species and surface Zn atom. However, when the H2O molecule was placed nearby the surface Zn atom, S-species repelled the H2O molecule from the surface and took place chemical interaction with the Zn atom. DOS analysis showed that the interaction of S-species with smithsonite surface in presence of H2O molecule nearby Zn atom mainly involved the S3p orbital and Zn 3d 4 s orbitals. Despite the partial overlap of 3p orbital with Zn 3d 4 s orbitals confirmed the chemical interaction between S-species and surface Zn atom, such interaction was not well strong and stable in nature due to the presence of S 3p and Zn 3d orbitals at different energy levels, which made them inferior matched with each other. Compared with S2−, HS− repelled the H2O molecule from the surface more easily and interacted with surface Zn atom, as confirmed by the electron density analysis.Zinc sulfide ores are the main source of zinc due to the fact that zinc in sulfide phase is easy to separate from gangues by conventional flotation techniques Smithsonite is the most important source of oxidized zinc, which is commonly recovered by flotation using cationic collector, anionic collector, or mixed anionic/cationic collectors depending on the accompanying gangues Aside from experiments, density functional theory (DFT) provides an effective tool to acquire the crystal and surface properties of minerals as well as the interaction between mineral surface and reagent molecules at the atomic level The smithsonite (0 0 1) surface was one of the most stable surfaces, but the available information on this surface is very limited. Thus, we used smithsonite (0 0 1) surface to simulate the interaction of smithsonite with various S-species in present investigation by using the Cambridge sequential total energy package (CASTEP) program. This program provides an effective implementation of DFT plane-wave (PW) pseudopotential method The smithsonite surface was modeled using (2 × 2 × 1) ZnCO In real flotation system, the mineral surface, especially for oxidized minerals, is covered by the water molecules, which has a significant influence on the interaction of mineral surface and flotation chemicals As shown in Similar to the initial model of S When the H In order to further illuminate the nature that S As can be seen from Similar to The electron density map is a very useful tool for vividly displaying the bond electron distribution between two atoms. To further investigate the interaction between S components and smithsonite surface in the presence of water molecule, an electron density analysis was performed, which the results are shown in In Our DFT results and analysis showed that: The initial adsorption position of H DOS analysis showed that the interaction of S-species (S Electron density analysis showed that the electron cloud distribution between SH The DFT results shed light on the fundamental aspects of surface sulfidization of smithsonite at an atomic level and inspire a new idea to enhance the sulfidization performance by change the water molecule adsorption positions.
