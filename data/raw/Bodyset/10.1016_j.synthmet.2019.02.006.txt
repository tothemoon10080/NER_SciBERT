The current study reports the fabrication of a nanocomposite with improved microwave absorption and interference shielding properties by introducing multi-wall carbon nanotubes and Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto carbon fibers through an electrophoretic co-deposition process. The results revealed that the Fe3O4/multi-wall carbon nanotubes@carbon fiber nanocomposite structure with a high specific surface area of 87.12 m2. g−1 was successfully fabricated. The epoxy-based composite filled with the nanocomposites had both of the magnetic and dielectric losses at 8.2–18 GHz frequency range. The maximum reflection loss of −17.1 dB with an effective absorption bandwidth of 8 GHz was obtained for the sample filled with 20 wt.% of the nanocomposite with a thickness of 2 mm. The best electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 35 dB was observed for the sample with a thickness of 5 mm. The achieved excellent microwave absorbing properties are attributed to the different wave attenuation mechanisms of the nanocomposite and their synergetic effects.In the past two decades, a large number of studies have been devoted to the development of high-performance electromagnetic (EM) wave shielding and absorbing materials, since the negative effects of the EM radiations on the efficiency of high-tech electronic devices and also health of humans are being broadly clarified over time [ Owing to the unique features of CFs such as light weight, remarkable tensile strength, great surface area and high chemical inertness also considering the exceptional mechanical and electrical properties (such as huge dielectric losses) of CNTs, the CNTs@CFs composites have been proposed as a promising filler in the preparation of polymer-based advanced composites which can enhance both of their mechanical and microwave shielding properties [ Considering the above-mentioned discussions, although CNTs@CFs composites exhibit superior mechanical and EMI SE properties, however the non-magnetic nature of CFs and CNTs can cause secondary EM pollution. Therefore this type of fillers cannot be used as an efficient microwave attenuative material to fabricate high-performance microwave absorbing composites. To overcome this problem, a magnetic nanomaterial for example magnetic iron oxide (Fe In the present study, considering the above-mentioned advantages of MWCNTs, CFs and Fe FeCl The Fe Structural investigations on the as-prepared Fe The size of the as-prepared Fe The XRD patterns of the as-prepared Fe XPS analysis was utilized to precisely characterize the chemical properties of the Fe To further investigate the chemical properties of the Fe In order to investigate the microstructure of the Fe The specific surface area and pore size of the Fe To investigate the magnetic properties of the as-prepared Fe  The interaction between EM waves and a material can be investigated using its dielectric and magnetic properties. In this regard, the complex permittivity As shown in 3.6. EM wave shielding properties of the samples Considering transmission line theory, the reflection loss (RL) of a single-layer composite can be calculated using following equation [ In which,  Considering Debye dipolar relaxation theory (especially proposed for dielectric materials) can be utilized to more accurately investigate the interaction between incident EM waves within the composite’s components and clarify the main wave attenuation sources. According to this theory, relative complex permittivity is expressed by the following equations [ In this equation, According to Eqs. As a result, the graphs of According to The nano dimensions of the as-prepared Fe Effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) is the other desirable feature which intensively influences the applicability of a microwave absorbing material. According to definition, EAB is a frequency range in which the minimum RL value of a microwave absorbing material is less than -10 dB [ The sample’s EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) values with different thicknesses were measured in the 8.2–18 GHz frequency range and the results are shown in Furthermore, the overall EMI SE (directly determined through S-parameters) could be determined by following equation [ In which, S Considering  The presence of MWCNTs in the microstructure of the fabricated NCs in this work can be considered as the main reason in back of the enhanced EM waves attenuation properties of the fabricated epoxy-based composite compared to similar works, since this material can increase the microwave absorption proficiency through its various EM waves’ energy attenuative mechanisms. Toward a better understanding of these mechanisms Finally, it can be deduced that the high EM wave absorption efficiency, wide effective absorption bandwidth and good EMI SE of the NC can be attributed to its various absorption mechanisms of EM waves arisen from the component’s characteristics and the synergetic effects of these mechanisms. The Fe The physicochemical studies represented that the Fe The fabricated NCs due to the presence of MWCNTs and Fe The magnetic properties measurements showed that due to the reduction in the effective mass/volume portion of the Fe The EM properties characterizations showed that the fabricated NCs had both magnetic and dielectric EM wave weakening loss sources simultaneously that are essential to obtain an enhanced EM wave protection performance. The microwave absorption measurements indicated that the highest RL of about -17.1 dB with an effective absorption bandwidths of about 8 GHz in the frequency range of 8.2–18 GHz was obtained for a 2 mm epoxy-based composite containing 20 wt.% of the Fe The best EMI SE of about 35 dB was related to the sample with the thickness of 5 mm. The appropriate microwave absorbing properties of the fabricated NC structure can be related to its different wave attenuation mechanisms and their synergetic effects.
