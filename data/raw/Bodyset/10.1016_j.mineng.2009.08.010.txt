Industrial scale Horomill® and hybrid HPGR/two-compartment ball mill applications at puzzolanic portland cement production were presented with emphasis on the general operational characteristics of the circuit configurations, size reduction and energy efficiencies of the Horomill® and two-compartment ball mill grinding conditions. Horomill® circuit configuration indicated to have advantages in terms of production of high strength cement as compared to Hybrid HPGR/two-compartment ball milling, depending on the classification performance of the separators influencing the circuit performance.Conventionally multi-compartment ball mills are used in finish grinding of cement. However, they are relatively inefficient at size reduction and have high energy consumption, so it is increasingly common to find grinding technologies such as High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR), vertical mills and Horomill They were introduced in 1993 at Buzzi Unicem’s Trino plant in Italy with the purpose of reducing energy costs. Details of the operating principle of Horomill This study presents the size reduction efficiencies and specific energy consumptions of an industrial scale Horomill Simplified flowsheets of the investigated circuits are given in In the context of sampling studies conducted around Hybrid HPGR/two-compartment ball mill circuit, following the circuit sampling, the ball mill was crash-stopped and samples were collected inside the mill at approximately 1 Comparisons of Horomill Comparison of the final product size distributions measured by laser sizing technique is given in A comparison of the Horomill In the two-compartment ball milling case, size reduction efficiency in compartment-1 and compartment-2 was evaluated individually based on the Size distributions of mill feed and the sample collected in compartment-1 at a length of 2 In compartment-2 size distributions at the 4.1 and 5.2 As can be observed from Another characteristic feature which can be observed in the second compartments of cement mills is the progressive fineness decrease towards the last meter of the compartment due to the coarse particle accumulation and probable blockage at the discharge diaphragm as the size distribution at the 5.2 Size distributions at the last meter of both compartments indicated that the assumption considered in the evaluation of the size reduction efficiency is highly dependent on the operational characteristics of the mill such as grindability or breakage characteristics (raw meal, kiln, cooling and pre-crushing conditions), mill feed size distribution (pre-crushing and air classifier performance), diaphragm screening performance (blockage of diaphragm with material or balls, crack formation on the diaphragm both affecting open area per cent), air flow rate (especially in air-swept type mills), liner and ball wear conditions which will influence the size reduction progress during grinding. Data presented provides some useful insights into the operational and size reduction characteristics of Horomill The specific energy consumption figures indicated approximately 15% energy saving in Horomilling case. However, as recorded in the literature, it is difficult to make a direct comparison as the energy efficiency figures will vary depending on the Horomill The authors gratefully acknowledge to the plant staff at Moctezuma Tepetzingo Cement Plant (Mexico) and OYAK Bolu Cement Kazan Grinding Plant (Turkey) for their permission to publish the case studies, Professor A.
