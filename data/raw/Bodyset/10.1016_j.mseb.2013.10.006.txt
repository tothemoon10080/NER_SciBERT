                      alloy of fine grain size was successfully synthesized by a modified mechanochemical treatment from Sm11.83Fe88.17 cast alloy. The effects of the Ca-added mechanical milling and the following heat treatments on the characteristics of the alloy samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. The results indicate that, after a 6h milling of the mixture of hydrogen decrepitated Sm–Fe powders and Ca granule, general tendency for the as-milled powders was not only to discompose into amorphous α-Fe and Sm–Fe phase, but also to disproportionate into SmH

                      without obvious α-Fe phase and Sm oxide after a washing treatment. The magnetic measurements showed that the coercivity of more than 16kOe was obtained for the mechanochemically synthesized sample, while its squareness of the demagnetization curve was much improved, compared with the samples without Ca-added mechanical milling or reduction–diffusion treatment, due to its high purity and mean grain size found to be approximately 40–65nm.Intense researches have been initiated for Sm Sm Additionally, it has been reported that Sm–Co nanocrystalline alloy can be produced by a mechanically activated reaction of Sm Therefore, in the present work, we are aiming at development of a modified mechanochemical route to produce the high coercivity Sm A Sm In this experiment the amount of metallic Ca was set at 9.0 The crystal structure and microstructure of the powders at different stages were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Magnetic measurements of epoxy-bonded Sm   Evidently, the friability of the particles is increased by the microcracks, which would be helpful for the intended mechanical milling and heat treatment as well as support the particle fineness. HD powders coarsely pulverized are shown in  Meanwhile, in this study, the broadened X-ray lines probably indicate not only the formation of an amorphous structure of the Sm  Furthermore, it is supposed that in this study, metal Ca is added not only to decrease the oxidization extent of Sm in the milling process, but also decrease the depletion extent of metal Sm at the same time due to its better ductility, and both would effectively prevent the precipitation of the soft magnetic α-Fe phase which has a negative effect on the coercivity. According to the foregoing experimental data and the mechanism of ductile-brittle components The excess of metal Ca un-oxidized is supposed to reduce the Sm oxide to its metal state and react with α-Fe precipitated to reform Sm It has been reported that the As indicated in It is also observed that the intensity of the peaks from the 2 to 17 structure is suppressed by nitrogenation and these peaks are broadened, which indicate the fineness of the grain size, the result is in good accordance with the earlier investigations For the samples of comparisons, as shown in   The magnetization measurements are in agreement with the XRD results, and both of them reflect the disappearance of the magnetically soft α-Fe phase and pure content of the magnetically hard Sm The effects of the modified mechanochemical treatment on the microstructure and magnetic properties of Sm The present investigation is supported by the
