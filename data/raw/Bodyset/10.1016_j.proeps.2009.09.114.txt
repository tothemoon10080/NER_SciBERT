Using a new type of emulsified flotation reagent ZFC for flotation research of Qianjiaying and Huaixiao coal samples, experimental results show that the reagent has excellent performance, good stability and high selectivity, which promotes the coal flotation. Compared with the flotation with diesel at the similar clean ash content, the ZFC can increase clean coal recovery and combustible material recovery of 0.39%-14.75% and 0.36%-17.52%, respectively. The dosage of ZFC is less than the used diesel oil and the oil saving rate reaches up 70%. The flotation mechanism of ZFC was also studied by measuring the wetting heat and Zeta potential.
