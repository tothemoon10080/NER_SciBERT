The purpose of this chapter is to elucidate mineralogical characteristics and the processing of massive sulfide base metal ores from the Bathurst-Newcastle mining area. Many volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) base metal deposits occur in the Bathurst-Newcastle mining area in New Brunswick, Canada. Some deposits are currently being exploited, some are in the developmental stage, some have been tested and are currently dormant, some have been mined out, and others are in different stages of exploration. The ores in these deposits are fine-grained, and it is not easy to obtain high metal recoveries from most of these ores by mineral processing techniques. The metals are recovered in at least three concentratesâ€”zinc, lead, and copper. Silver and gold are recovered as by-products in the lead and copper concentrates. Mineralogical investigations of ores have aided mineral processing engineers design and/or modify flow-sheets for improved recoveries of saleable grade products. This chapter discusses the ore characteristics and mineralogical properties that affect mineral processing of the ores from the Bathurst-Newcastle area.
