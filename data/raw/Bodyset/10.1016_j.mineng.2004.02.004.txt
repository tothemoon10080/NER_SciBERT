Chemical Hydrometallurgy is subtitled The book opens with a 14-page chapter entitled ‘Ore Minerals’ in which the author gives some importance to the necessity of mineralogical studies for hydrometallurgists. He briefly discusses silicates, oxides, and sulfides. The next two chapters are devoted to thermodynamics of aqueous solutions (148 pages) followed by another on kinetics (68 pages), and finally the last chapter (153 pages), entitled ‘Chemistry of Leaching Processes’ of which about one third is devoted to oxides and silicates and the remaining two thirds to sulfides. Here, the author discusses particular systems, some of them in a great detail. He also quotes heavily from the book A point of historical interest may be brought to light here. On discussing the mechanism of dissolution of UO Since the book is mainly devoted to theoretical principles, the reader should not expect to find flowsheets or drawings of equipment. It is a strict physico-chemical principles applied to hydrometallurgy. For those fond of speciation diagrams, they will find plenty of these here. The book will certainly appeal to those interested in thermodynamics. Some statements were not clear to the present reviewer. For example, on page 371, the author writes that, ‘The formation of a film of uranyl carbonate on the solid during the leaching of UO No book is published without typographical errors, and this book is no exception but the errors are very few indeed. For example, something is wrong in the last equation on page 77, and in the last equation on page 122 Ag Comprehensive information on books in mineral processing and extractive metallurgy can be found on the ‘Books News’ pages of
