For continuous random variables, their distribution data can be approximated to generalized exponential-sum distribution functions by optimization tools like TOMLAB. Generalized exponential-sum distribution functions have larger representations and wider applications than pure exponential-sum distribution functions. On the bases of the n-fold convolution of pure exponential-sum distribution functions, the n-fold convolution of generalized exponential-sum distribution functions has been developed in this paper. Compared with the n-fold convolution of pure exponential-sum distribution functions, the results presented in this paper for the calculation of the n-fold convolution of generalized exponential-sum distribution functions are more general and applicable. As a matter of fact, the solution for computing the n-fold convolution of pure exponential-sum distribution functions is contained in the solution for the calculation of the n-fold convolution of generalized exponential-sum distribution functions. Limited testing results show that the formulae presented in this paper are correct.The sum of For many continuous random variables, their distributions can be approximated to exponential-sum distribution functions. Kammler Obviously, compared with the pure exponential-sum distribution model, The Performing Laplace transform to Consequently, the problem is reduced to solve the inverse Laplace transform of ‚àè Taking the same strategy as in  As the result, we have developed the general analytical solution for Again, using the same strategy as in To this point, we have completed the derivation of the solution for the Taking Let us then test the case when the density distribution function is one-exponential. Furthermore, we assume Here Obviously, Taking Assume that By definition, we have Consequently, we have shown that Above limited testing results show that the presented formulae for calculating the The This work was supported in part by US Department of Energy under grant no. DE-FG22-95PC95220. Here, the following elementary function is considered:  Formula Let us prove it is correct for According to above assumption, we have: Expanding above equation and combining relevant items, we get:  Obviously, the theorem is correct for From
