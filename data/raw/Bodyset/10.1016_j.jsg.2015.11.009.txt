The Simplon Fault Zone is a late-collisional low-angle normal fault (LANF) of the Western Alps. The hanging wall shows evidence of brittle deformation only, while the footwall is characterized by a c. 1 km-thick shear zone (the Simplon Fault Zone), which continuously evolved, during exhumation and cooling, from amphibolite facies conditions to brittle-cataclastic deformations. Due to progressive localization of the active section of the shear zone, the thermal-rheological evolution of the footwall resulted in a layered structure, with higher temperature mylonites preserved at the periphery of the shear zone, and cataclasites occurring at the core (indicated as the Simplon Line). In order to investigate the weakness of the Simplon Line, we studied the evolution of brittle/cataclastic fault rocks, from nucleation to the most mature ones. Cataclasites are superposed on greenschist facies mylonites, and their nucleation can be studied at the periphery of the brittle fault zone. This is characterized by fractures, micro-faults and foliated ultracataclasite seams that develop along the mylonitic SCC′ fabric, exploiting the weak phases mainly represented by muscovite and chlorite. Approaching the fault core, both the thickness and frequency of cataclasite horizons increase, and, as their thickness increases, they become less and less foliated. The fault core itself is represented by a thicker non-foliated cataclasite horizon. No Andersonian faults or fractures can be found in the footwall damage zone and core zone, whilst they are present in the hanging wall and in the footwall further from the fault. Applying a stress model based on slip tendency, we have been able to calculate that the friction coefficient of the Simplon Line cataclasites was <0.25, hence this fault zone is absolutely weak. In contrast with other fault zones, the weakening effect of fluids was of secondary importance, since they accessed the fault zone only after an interconnected fracture network developed exploiting the cataclasite network.The Simplon Fault Zone is a late-collisional low-angle normal fault (LANF) of the Western Alps. LANFs have dip angle <30° and are quite common in different tectonic settings, particularly in rift systems (e.g. In large-scale LANFs, which crosscut a several-km thick section of the continental crust, deformation in the footwall, which experiences a relevant exhumation, evolves from higher-temperature ductile crystal-plastic mechanisms to lower temperature brittle cataclastic mechanisms, consistent with the fault models of LANFs are typical examples of relatively weak faults, since they are not optimally oriented if compared to the Anderson's fault model ( Phyllosilicates, even in relatively small quantities, dramatically influence the mechanical behaviour of rocks (e.g. In this contribution we investigate the structural evolution of phyllosilicate-rich mylonites deformed under brittle conditions (producing very fine-grained cataclasites) along the Simplon Line (SL), which develops in mylonitic rocks of the Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ; By means of meso- and micro-structural analysis, we have characterized the evolution of the weakening mechanisms that were active along the SFZ and SL. We will focus particularly on (1) microstructures produced by brittle activation of the phyllosilicate-rich mylonitic foliation, (2) evidence of activity along misoriented structures, and the contemporaneous lack of nucleation/activity of Andersonian surfaces, which provide a measure of the fault zone weakness, and (3) the progressive strain localization, which eventually allowed fluids to access the fault core, possibly inducing further weakening. The Simplon Fault Zone (SFZ) dips at c. 25° towards the SW, and its trace extends over 30 km in Switzerland and Italy, between the Rhone and Ossola Valleys ( The footwall of the SFZ corresponds to the Toce Dome, which, together with the Ticino Dome, forms the Lepontine Dome ( The brittle detachment dividing the footwall from the hanging wall consists of a narrow zone, the Simplon Line (SL), mapped by The hanging wall preserves older structures, showing metamorphic deformations corresponding to four different regional folding phases predating the SFZ (e.g. Based on these observations, two different scenarios have been proposed for the SFZ evolution.  In either model, exhumation of the footwall fault rocks requires deformation at different crustal levels under a wide range of temperature conditions ( The SFZ is well exposed in large and high-quality outcrops and has been extensively studied ( In the following, we will describe additional outcrops of cataclasites of the SL that we have found and mapped in the last years, and follow up on interpretations of stress on the SL. In this study we focus on the final brittle evolution of the SL, which can be reconstructed in some selected outcrops in the Staffelgrat, Simplonpass, Nideralp, Zwischbergental and Monscera Pass areas (SG, SP, NA, ZW and MS in In all outcrops the contrast between hanging wall and footwall fault rocks and minor structures is evident, both in terms of deformation style and orientation of fabric elements ( In The key outcrops of our study are indicated in the geological map of the SL (numbered locations in In the next sections we will describe the different structural domains of the SFZ, starting from the distal footwall rocks in zone 1, constituted by the distal high temperature mylonites, and then, approaching the SL, we will continue with zone 2, with low temperature mylonites. Then we will address zone 4 – the hanging wall rocks, and we will conclude with zone 3 - the fault core ( High temperature mylonites outcrop at distances (perpendicular to the fault) between c. 750 and 250 m from the SL ( The pervasive mylonitic foliation Sm is defined by the alternation of quartz layers and phyllosilicate films, showing an average attitude of 264/23 (azimuth/dip; The perfectly along-dip mylonitic lineation Lm marked by quartz ribbons and phyllosilicate aggregates is consistently present in the whole footwall and its average plunge/trend is 244/21 ( At the micro-scale, as described by Brittle structures recognized in Zone 1, and attributed to the extensional phase responsible for the SL, include high-angle conjugated joints and minor fault planes with average attitude of 255/56 and 057/52 respectively (azimuth/dip, Lower-temperature greenschist facies mylonites outcrop in the area between the more distal high-temperature mylonites (zone 1) and the SL (zone 3), hence at distances of up to c. 250 m from the SL ( Zone 2 quartz ribbons and veins are also characterized by a bimodal grain size distribution, consistent with In contrast with footwall mylonites, hanging wall rocks ( Here we describe some typical hanging wall paragneiss from the Siviez-Mischabel Nappe in Zwischbergental (ZW in Microstructural analysis reveals a markedly different fabric with respect to footwall mylonites: quartz in lithons is characterized by equigranular crystals with a grain size of c. 200 μm, without evidence of the recrystallization processes typical of zones 1 and 2; phyllosilicates are represented by white mica and chlorite flakes with grain sizes of up to 500 μm ( This zone is the most proximal to the SL ( We define as zone 3A ( At the microscale the first occurrence of protocataclasite is revealed by cataclastic seams 100–300 μm thick ( Approaching the SL, in zone In the field, the fault core (zone z3C, In both zones z3B and z3C, we locally observe the presence of calcite veins, and some ultracataclasites of zone z3C are cemented by the same carbonates ( Brittle/frictional deformation along the SFZ is characterized by four main processes, represented in what we call zone 3 ( The first evidence of nucleation of brittle deformation is concentrated along the SCC′ shear bands in mylonites, and particularly around the tip of the favourably oriented mica flakes; at the same time, intragranular microkinking requires slip along (001) cleavage. A similar behaviour has been observed in lab tests performed by In volumes of the fault zone where this behaviour is observed (zone 3, Based on results of stress inversion (section Normalized slip tendency  Given that detailed field observations did not reveal any Andersonian faults or fractures in the inner damage zone and core zone (zone 3), we can safely assume μ  We consider now deformation after the nucleation of brittle/cataclastic structures along the mylonitic foliation. After the first fractures have nucleated with a low dip angle, they are exploited by increasing slip and the network of low-angle ultracataclasites develops (e.g. The fault core and inner damage zone locally exhibit the presence of carbonate veins and carbonate-cemented cataclasites (zone 3D), implying influx of fluids and related solute transport. These fluids exploited the permeable fracture network in the fault zone, represented by dominant shear fractures and only minor tensional cracks ( Field and microstructural observations provide evidence of brittle deformation along the SL, with nucleation and progressive development of misoriented cataclasites leading to localized deformation. We can resume the main and more significant features of this process in a few points: brittle deformation nucleates along low-angle (misoriented) mylonitic foliation planes where phyllosilicates are concentrated and iso-oriented; cataclastic layers develop along mylonitic foliation and show a progressive thickening with ongoing deformation; earlier-stages cataclasites are foliated, whilst the more developed ones show a random fabric; high-angle Andersonian faults and fractures do not develop where cataclasis exploits the phyllosilicate-rich foliation; the friction coefficient for these low-angle misoriented cataclasites is μ carbonate veins and cement locally impregnate the cataclasites, and are related to fluids that exploited the brittle fault and fracture network, circulating after the onset of brittle deformation; the weakness of the SL is not related to the effect of fluids. These observations illustrate an intrinsic link between mechanical anisotropy, associated with the mylonitic fabric, and the nucleation and progressive evolution of misoriented and weak fault planes. Fluids circulation appears as secondary and more local weakening mechanism, which develops exploiting the permeability created by brittle faulting. This means that the primary factor determining the development of a misoriented, low-angle regional-scale fault like the SL, is the presence of pre-existing weak planes, represented by phyllosilicate-rich foliation planes.
