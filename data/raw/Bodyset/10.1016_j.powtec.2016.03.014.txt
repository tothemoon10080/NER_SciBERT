Vanadium–silicon alloys were produced by a powder metallurgical processing route. To this end, mechanical alloying of V–Si alloys with varied Si concentrations was carried out in a planetary ball mill. Si is an effective strengthening element for V alloys due to the solid solution strengthening effect and the formation of vanadium silicides at higher Si concentrations. The influence of the Si concentration, ranging between 2 and 25at.%, on the properties of the mechanically alloyed materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and microhardness measurements.The interest in new high temperature materials for applications at temperatures beyond 1000 V–Si powder mixtures with Si concentrations of 2 The XRD analyses of the different V–Si alloys after milling for different time steps in a planetary ball mill are shown in The influence of increasing Si concentration on the powder particle size of the V–Si alloys is shown in Furthermore, Moreover, there is a significant effect on the hardness of the compound V–25Si after 100 This study shows the influence of the Si concentration and the effects of the milling process on the properties of mechanical alloyed V–Si powders. An increase of Si requires longer milling times and accordingly a higher energy input to dissolve up to 25  diameter focused ion beam technique Vickers hardness mechanical alloying silicon scanning electron microscope scanning transmission electron microscope total pattern analysis solution vanadium vanadium–silicon solid solution vanadium–silicon alloy with x at.% of Si X-ray diffraction (analysis) The authors would like to thank Ellen Baken from FEI NanoPort Europe Eindhoven (Netherlands) for the STEM micrograph (
