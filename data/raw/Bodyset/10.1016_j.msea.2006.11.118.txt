Experimental investigation has been carried out to evaluate the effect of titanium carbide addition on the composite steel preforms. The cold upsetting of the composite steel preforms with varying TiC contents, namely, 3% and 4%, and different aspect ratios, namely, 0.42, 0.67 and 1.0, and lubricating conditions namely, nil lubricant, graphite and zinc stearate lubricants, was carried out using 100tonnes capacity Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and the deformation behavior of the same was determined. The influence of TiC addition, in the steel composite, on the percent theoretical density attained, axial stress and Poisson's ratio were studied. The effect of initial preform geometry and lubricating conditions on the densification and deformation behavior have been studied.bulged diameter of the preform after deformation contact diameter of the preform after deformation initial diameter of the preform height of the barreled cylinder after deformation initial height of the cylindrical preform instantaneous strength coefficient instantaneous strain-hardening exponent true strain in the hoop direction true strain in the axial direction conventional Poisson's ratio new or instantaneous Poisson's ratio density of the preform after deformation density ratio theoretical density of the fully dense material initial preform density of the cylinder true stress in the axial direction Manufacture of precision engineering components from powdered materials today has become an established mass-production technology. The growth of the P/M industry is based primarily on its ability to produce intricate shapes and close tolerances with a maximum of material utilization Shabaik Even though the literature deals with composite on titanium carbide, densification behavior of the titanium carbide in the steel has not been studied so far. Most of the research works Iron powder (−150 Fe–1% C–3% TiC Fe–1% C–4% TiC The ball mill was operated for 30 The compacting pressure was controlled so as to obtain density levels of 7.656 After the sintering operation, the preforms were cold upset-forged with different frictional conditions by applying lubricants, namely, graphite, zinc stearate and molybdenum disulphide, and also with no application of lubricant, using a 100 The present investigation is based on the analytical determination of the deformed density, the Poisson's ratio, stresses and strains. According to Abdel-Rahman and El-Sheik Further, the conventional hoop strain ( The new or instantaneous Poisson's ratio ( The conventional Poisson's ratio ( The true axial stress is calculated as follows:  Upon the investigation of the densification pattern of the two composite steels, it can be attributed that no lubricant has induced enhanced level of densification with increased bulging, whereas lubricants such as zinc stearate and graphite have resulted in poor rate of densification with reduced bulging. Increase in percentage content of TiC decreases the densification rate. Increasing percent content of TiC decreases the Poisson's ratio value.    Based on the analysis of the experimental data of the present investigation the following major conclusions are drawn: The fractional theoretical density ( The variation in Poisson's ratio with respect to the relative density was fond to be dependent of the preform geometry and the composition of the system investigated. The applied stress was very much affected by the initial preform geometry, percentage of titanium carbide content and the lubricant used.
