Ti-bearing blast furnace slags have been regarded as an important secondary material in modern society, and the efficient recycling of Ti oxides from it is of key interest. For this reason, more thermodynamic data is needed regarding the phase relations in different composition ranges and sections. Therefore, the equilibrium phase relations of CaO–MgO–SiO2–Al2O3–TiO2 system in a low w(CaO)/w(SiO2) ratio of 0.6–0.8 at 1250 °C in air and fixed concentrations of MgO and Al2O3, were investigated experimentally using a high temperature equilibration and quenching method followed by SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer) analyses. The equilibrium solid phases of perovskite (CaO·TiO2), a pseudo-brookite solid solution (MgO·2TiO2, Al2O3·TiO2)ss, and anorthite (CaO·Al2O3·2SiO2) were found to coexist with the liquid phase at 1250 °C. The calculated results of Factsage and MTDATA were used for comparisons, and significant discrepancies were found between predictions and the experimental results. The 1250 °C isotherm has been constructed and projected on the CaO–SiO2–TiO2-8 wt.% MgO-14 wt% Al2O3 quasi-ternary plane of the phase diagram. The obtained results provide new fundamental data for Ti-bearing slag recycling processes, and they add new experimental features for thermodynamic modeling of the high-order titanium oxide-containing systems.Circular economy and sustainability of metals [ TiO The objective of this study was to investigate the equilibrium phase relations for the CaO–MgO–SiO High purity of CaO (99.9 wt%), SiO A high temperature equilibration and quenching method [ The polished cross-sections were carbon coated, and the phase assemblies and compositions were measured using Tescan MIRA 3 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, Tescan, Brno, Czech Republic) equipped with an UltraDry Silicon Drift Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometer and NSS Microanalysis Software (EDS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). An accelerating voltage of 15 kV, and a beam current of 20 nA were employed. At least six analysis points were randomly selected from each phase for statistical reliability, and Proza (Phi-Rho-Z) matrix correction procedure was employed for raw data processing. The standards utilized in EDS analyses were metal Al (for Al, Kα), calcite (for Ca, Kα), metal Mg (for Mg, Kα), olivine (for O, Kα), quartz (for Si, Kα), metal Ti (for Ti, Kα). Only the results with standard deviation of the phase compositions less than 1% will be employed to construct the phase diagram. There are many commercial thermodynamic softwares nowadays that could be used to make the predictions for the equilibrium phase relations including Factsage [ In MTDATA simulation, a quasi-ternary liquidus contour section for the Ti-bearing slag system was calculated using the Mtox database, vers. 8.2 [ For the 1250 °C isotherm section calculated by MTDATA, the solid stoichiometric and solution phases as described in Mtox database are (Va is a vacancy in a sub-lattice): Stoichiometric phases of cordierite (Al In the present study, the equilibrium experiments were carried out in air, according to the predominance area diagram for Ti oxides in For confirming the attainment of equilibrium, SEM-EDS line scans were measured for the equilibrium phases of sample S6 to demonstrate the element distributions in Sample compositions within 5 wt%-25 wt% TiO For the lower For It is worth to mention that the contents of MgO and Al Predictions of the equilibrium phase relations were done using Factsage and MTDATA under the same experimental conditions, comparisons between the prediction and the present experimental results are shown in For the two-phase field of liquid in equilibrium with CT at 1250 °C, both predictions agree well with the experimental data. However, in the CAS The 1250 °C isotherm was constructed in Results from the present experimental work give some indications about the equilibrium information for the CT and pseudo-brookite phases, both of which have been considered as the potential Ti-enrichment phases in the selective crystallization and separation techniques [ Compositions of the molten phase within the CaO–MgO–SiO This work was financed by the
