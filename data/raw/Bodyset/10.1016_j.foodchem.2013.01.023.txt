The production of grape juice concentrate on an industrial scale was evaluated and samples from the main steps of processing have been collected and analyzed. The sampling steps included the selection and washing of grapes (Nevsehir Patlak variety), pressing in order to obtain the juice separate from the seed and the skin fraction, pasteurization, clarification, filtration, evaporation, and filling-packing at 27°C with a Brix of 45°. Samples from each of the processing steps were analyzed by a number of spectrophotometric analyses. A series of anthocyanin compounds was identified using HPLC-MS, and the fate of anthocyanins, quercetin rutinoside and procyanidins was followed using HPLC. The results indicate that the removal of seed and fruit skin removes most of the procyanidins and anthocyanins, while subsequent clarification and filtration treatments further reduce the anthocyanin content.It has been reported that there is an inverse association between the consumption of some fruits and vegetables and mortality from age-related diseases. This could be partly attributed to the presence of antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds, in the diet ( Grapes can be consumed as fresh fruit, but they may also be dried, processed into wine, vinegar, fruit juice concentrate (and then processed into fruit juice), Changes in antioxidants during wine processing ( Fresh grape samples (Nevsehir Patlak variety), intermediate by-products and final grape concentrate products were collected in three replicate and independent processing events in 2007, from a fruit juice factory in Turkey. The main processing steps in the grape juice concentrate production are: selection of grapes; washing; removal of stalks; pre-heating at 40–50 Samples from several steps in the entire production chain, i.e. fresh grape, press cake waste, steps post pasteurization, clarification, filtration and end-product grape concentrate ( Moisture content of the samples was analyzed according to “Association Official of Analytical Chemists” ( Extracts for spectrophotometric analyses were prepared by adding 3 For analyses by HPLC-PDA and LC-MS, 25 (±0.05) mg freeze-dried sample was extracted with 2.0 The total phenolic content was estimated using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent ( Total flavonoid content was determined according to Total antioxidant activities were evaluated by the ABTS (2,2-azinobis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid diammonium salt) method, the FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) method, the CUPRAC (copper reducing antioxidant capacity) method, and the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl) method, as described previously ( An Accela HPLC-PDA (Thermo, Bannockburn, IL, USA) coupled to a LTQ Ion Trap-Orbitrap FTMS hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo, Bannockburn, IL, USA) system was used to identify the major anthocyanins present in the processing samples. The same gradient conditions as used for quantitative HPLC (described below) were applied, while using a LUNA 3 The system used to determine the content of individual anthocyanins was composed of a Waters 600 control unit, Waters 996 PDA detector and column incubator at 40 Procyanidins were evaluated using hydrolysis with phloroglucinol ( All analyses were performed with three technical and three biological replicates. Data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software (version 11.5, SPSS Inc.) for the analysis of variance (ANOVA), based on An industrial grape concentrate production line was sampled at different stages of the process ( Total phenolic and total flavonoid contents of grape juice concentrate processing samples are shown in The results indicated that the press out fraction which is composed of grape seed and fruit skin had the highest total phenolic (2793 Aqueous methanol extracts from grape and from grape juice concentrate were analyzed using HPLC ( In grape fruits, 8 main anthocyanins could be annotated using accurate mass LC-MS with PDA detection: monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin, in addition to malvidin acetylglucoside, peonidin coumaroylglucoside and malvidin coumaroylglucoside ( The procyanidins in grape berries were composed for both catechin and epicatechin. The content of total catechin and epicatechin (free and bound) was found to decrease strongly after processing them into juice concentrate ( The effect of different processing steps during the production of grape juice concentrate was studied, paying particular attention to the main antioxidants in red grape, the anthocyanins and procyanidins ( The observed fate of the anthocyanins and procyanidins during the various processing steps in general reflects their localization within the fruit. Procyanidins occur both in the seeds and the berry skin ( Some anthocyanins (e.g. delphinidin glucoside) are well represented in the unprocessed fruit, but have largely disappeared from the pasteurized material ( Compared to the marked anthocyanin loss observed in the present research on grape juice processing, from 616 Similarly, grape processing techniques involved in wine production may have contrasting effects on the content of phenolic compounds. The order and duration of treatments such as maceration, fermentation, or ageing steps in red wine may have strong effects on the final phenolic composition ( Large losses of potentially valuable polyphenolic compounds are common during the production of grape juice concentrate on an industrial scale. In this study, the precise processing steps where these losses can be reduced have been identified. These critical steps may be greatly improved or better controlled to enhance the phenolic content of grape products. In Turkey, the waste materials from industrial grape processing, like the press cake, is basically used as animal feed. However, regarding their relative high content of procyanidins and general antioxidant capacity, recovery from and better utilization of valuable metabolites in these wastes should create new opportunities worthy of taking into consideration. Opportunities may be both an improved extractability to enhance antioxidant levels in the grape products, and using grape waste as a valuable source of natural antioxidants that could be exploited as valuable food additives or supplements.
