Production capacity of a fully air-swept industrial scale two-compartment KHD Humboldt Wedag® cement ball mill was optimized with the aid of simulation. It was proposed to operate the mill as a single compartment by eliminating the pre-drying compartment. In this respect, grinding performance of the air-swept ball mill was evaluated and modelled as a perfectly mixed single tank using the perfect mixing ball mill modelling approach (Whiten, 1974). Static separator was modelled by efficiency curve model (Whiten, 1966). The empirical breakage function required in the estimation of average specific breakage rates was measured by drop-weight technique. The full scale model parameters were used to simulate the raw meal mill grinding circuit with the aid of JKSimMet Steady State Mineral Processing Simulator. Simulation results indicated 23% production capacity increase in cement throughput in case the pre-drying compartment was used in grinding.particle size fraction particle size fraction mass flowrate of mill feed (ton/hour) mass flowrate of mill discharge (ton/hour) specific breakage rate of size fraction specific discharge rate of size fraction normalized discharge rate of size fraction single column step triangular breakage function matrix mass of size fraction volumetric feed rate (m mill diameter (m) mill length (m) ratio of breakage rate to normalized discharge rate fraction of feed reporting to overflow fraction undergoing “real” classification (1-bypass fraction) reduced efficiency curve fish hook parameter size of a particle in feed which has equal probability of going to underflow or overflow (cut size) model parameter to preserve the definition of particle size ratio of reduced efficiency curve sharpness parameter Air-swept raw meal ball mills introduced by the cement mill manufacturers F.L.Smidth Breakage function and breakage rate parameters are determined by laboratory experiments in Austin’s approach ( In this study, production capacity of a fully air-swept dry grinding raw meal ball mill circuit was evaluated by modelling the mill using the perfect mixing modelling approach ( The simplified process flowsheet of the sampled circuit with the sampling points is given in Steady state condition of the circuit was verified by examining the variations in the values of operational variables of the ball mill and the static separator in the process control room system. Sampling was started when the steady state condition was achieved. Representative amount of samples were collected from the shown sampling points in Samples were prepared by using a riffler for dry sieving from the top size down to 150 Measured particle size distributions and operational tonnage flowrates were used to perform mass balance calculations around the circuit with the aid of mass balance module of the JKSimMet simulator to calculate the best fit estimates of the size distributions and tonnage flowrates. Mass balanced flowrates and calculated fineness as 0.045 The circuit was crash-stopped to collect samples from inside of the mill after completing sampling of the circuit streams. A view of mill inside at the crash-stop condition is given in Sample collection dips were formed by digging out the mill charge (mill powder It should be mentioned that, it is crucial to collect representative samples in any sampling operation. The technique used in this study provided collecting representative inside mill samples at the regarding sample collection dip. Collection of material and ball samples just above the charge surface (which is common in such sampling procedures) will not give statistically representative results for the evaluation of ball charge load and distribution which affects the size reduction performance of the mill. Sample amount collected at each sample collection dip were tabulated in The mill modelling approach was to use average mill hold-up particle size distribution when calibrating the model parameters of perfect mixing model proposed by Mill inside fineness curve established using the 0.045 probable increase in amount of fine material due to the low air flow rate, such that, less fines extracted from the mill, increase in mill inside temperature which could lead to cushioning effect as explained by probable agglomeration of fine particles inside the mill which could have decreased the transportation (discharge) rate of particles through the mill. This claim could be supported by the work of ( material coating observed at the discharge grate could have affected the fine material accumulation amount in the mill and decreased the grinding performance of the grinding media. Particle size distribution of the mill discharge estimated by mass balance calculations was found to be finer than that of the sample collected at the mill discharge end which corresponded to the sample at the seven point fourth meter of the grinding length. This condition is expected under sufficient screening effect of the discharge diaphragm ( Mill powder was expected to discharge through the middle grate of the discharge diaphragm as the grate opening was wide enough (8 Another observation was the existence of coarse particle accumulation in the mill. Certain amount of coarse particle accumulation within the size range of −25 In order to assess the classifying performance of the mill liners, ball samples were collected during the inside mill powder sampling by screening out the balls over a screen with 25 Drop weight technique was used to characterize breakage distribution function of the mill feed material so as to reflect breakage characteristics to the model parameters of the mill. Breakage test was conducted on single particles in the size fraction of −9.5 Investigated raw meal mill feed constitutes 74% limestone, 24% clay and 2% iron ore by weight. According to the recorded findings ( Standard Bond work index value of the mill feed material was also experimentally determined as 11.03 Air-swept ball mill was modelled using the perfect mixing modelling approach ( In these equations, In order to correct the variations in residence time, Normalized discharge rate function variation established using the estimated mill hold-up ( There is a critical particle size in the mill which is denoted by In this study, the modelling approach was to consider the mill as a perfectly mixed single tank as the whole length of the mill was lined with classifying liners. Specific discharge rate functions ( Specific breakage rate function is presented in The Grinding efficiency in ball mills depends on the classifying performance of air separators as explained in the study of (         The fraction of feed reporting to underflow ( Fish-hook parameter characterizes the difference between the maximum percentage of fine material amount that appears in coarse stream (underflow of the separator) and the by-pass percentage. Model fitted efficiency curve parameters used in the simulation of the circuit are given in Simulation model of the circuit was designed in simulation module of the JKSimMet simulator by defining the perfect mixing model parameters of the air-swept ball mill and efficiency curve model parameters of the static separator given in As a consequence of the proposed modification in the mill and the expected capacity increase, a series of operational modifications will be required such that, regulation of static separator operational parameters. For instance, particle size distribution of the static separator feed (mill discharge) is estimated to become finer as indicated by the simulated particle size distributions which will require the optimization of the static separator. Parameters that can be adjusted in the classification process to attain the target fineness were recorded in the literature by varying of the air flow rate; increase in air flow rate will decrease the cut size ( adjusting of the deflector over the bottom of the inlet duct through which the powder carrying air enters the separator; position of the deflector can be adjusted which will effect the cut size ( adjusting of the top outlet duct; where the cut size can be varied by vertical adjustment of the air outlet duct at the top of the separator. For a constant air flow rate, increase in the length of the duct will lead to decrease the cut-size (finer product) or vice versa. Air flow rate in the duct of the mill should be increased before the adjustment of the static separator parameters (i.e., angle setting adjustable vanes, deflector) by controlling the by-pass amount. The cyclone performance will change depending on the cyclone geometry such that, as the cyclone diameter decreases and the length of the conical section increases, centrifugal force effect on the particle flow pattern will increase and will lead to effective separation of powder carrying air as explained by Conventional two-compartment fully air-swept KHD Humboldt Wedag® raw meal ball mill operating in closed circuit with a static separator was modelled and simulated to evaluate the probable capacity increase in the circuit in case the pre-drying compartment was used in the grinding stage. The mill was modelled as a perfectly mixed single tank as the material discharge was provided only by air-sweeping. Performance of the separator was assumed to not change in the simulation stage. Simulation results indicated that, 23% capacity increase in the cement throughput could be achieved at the steady state condition by operating the pre-drying compartment at the same ball charge level and ball size distribution, without any change in the product cyclone capacity, and by assuming that the process of pre-drying is performed in the ball mill upstream. However, air flowrate through the mill should be critically regulated as the velocity of the air controls the particle size distribution of the mill product in addition to the operational parameters of the static separator at the new operational condition for a stable and optimum production rate. Grinding heat generated could increase which may lead to agglomeration of particles unless reduced. The new design may require larger dust collectors, larger ventilation fans which will bring additional cost.
