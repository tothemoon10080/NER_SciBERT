Arthroscopy is emerging as an invaluable tool for diagnosing and treating elbow pathology. In addition to the advantages of less scarring, decreased risk of infection, less postoperative pain, and a more thorough visualization of the elbow joint, arthroscopy is particularly well suited to the treatment of athletes trying to minimize rehabilitation and inactivity. Indications for elbow arthroscopy now extend well beyond diagnosis and loose body removal, and include the treatment of impingement, arthritis, contractures, fragment stabilization for osteochondritis dessicans, and treatment of certain fractures. This article reviews the basic principles and techniques of elbow arthroscopy and their application to common sports-related conditions, such as valgus overload syndrome, medial collateral ligament insufficiency, and the various causes of lateral elbow pain. Newer applications of elbow arthroscopy in fracture care are addressed as well.
