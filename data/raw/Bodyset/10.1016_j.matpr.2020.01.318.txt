In this paper, the complete process from procurement of material to successful fabrication of aluminum 6061 red-mud composite and microstructure examination has been explained. Composite has been fabricated by using stir casting method. A detailed description of fabrication process using stir casting setup has been established in institute laboratory has been given. Preheating of reinforcement particles has been done in a separate muffle furnace. Process of fabrication of moulds from mild steel rods used for castings have been described. Stir casting process for fabricating desired aluminum 6061 red-mud composite has been explained in detail. Heat treatment of the fabricated composite has been done to obtain better and uniform properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the fabricated samples has been done to explain uniform distribution of reinforcement particles inside the matrix. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the fabricated composite has been performed confirming the presence of reinforcement particles inside the matrix
