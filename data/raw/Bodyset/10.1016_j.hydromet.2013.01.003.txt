In recent years, the comprehensive utilization of low-grade manganese oxide ores has received much attention due to the shortage of high-grade manganese ore resources. In this study, low-grade manganese oxide ores were treated by reduction roasting using chemically pure sulfur as a reductant. Then, the roasted samples were subjected to sulfuric acid leaching to extract manganese (Mn). The effects of roasting temperature, roasting time, S/Mn mole ratio, sulfuric acid concentration, leaching temperature, stirring rate, leaching time and liquid-to-solid ratio on the Mn and Fe leaching were discussed. The leaching efficiencies of 95.6% for Mn and 14.5% for Fe were obtained under the following optimized conditions: 550°C of roasting temperature, 10min of roasting time, 0.50 of S/Mn, 1.0mol/L of sulfuric acid concentration, 25°C of leaching temperature, 200r/min of stirring rate, 5min of leaching time and 5:1 of liquid-to-solid ratio.Manganese is widely used in steel production, nonferrous metallurgy, chemical industry, dietary additives, cells and fine chemicals, and other applications ( Conventional pyro-metallurgical processes for utilizing manganese oxide ores are characterized by high production costs and energy consumption, low productivity, and environmental pollution. The reductants used for reduction roasting include coals, graphite or CO ( As reported, chemically pure manganese dioxide can be reduced by sulfur at the relatively lower temperature of 300–400 In the present work, chemically pure sulfur is used as a reductant for reduction roasting followed by acid leaching to extract manganese from the low-grade manganese oxide ores. A thermodynamics analysis of reduction roasting in the Mn–S–O system is first carried out, revealing that the intermediate products, MnS, is unstable and can react with other high valence manganese oxides (MnO Low-grade manganese oxide ores used in this study were obtained from Hunan Province, China. The sample was crushed, ground and screened to 80% passing through 0.074 The ground manganese ores and chemically pure sulfur were together put into a sealed stainless steel reactor after being thoroughly mixed. They were then roasted at given temperature for certain period in an electrically heated muffle furnace. The experimental schematic diagram is presented in In each leaching test, 10 The leaching efficiency of Mn/Fe can be calculated as follows: Mn content in the reduced product and leaching residue is detected by way of chemical analysis. About 0.2 As well known, the melting point of sulfur is 114 As shown in The major chemical reaction involved during the leaching process of manganese extraction from the roasted product is as follows: As MnS does not react with intermediate product Mn The effects of roasting temperature, S/Mn (mole ratio) and roasting time on the leaching efficiency of Mn were discussed under the following leaching conditions: sulfuric acid concentration, 2.0 The roasting temperature has a significant impact on the reduction of the manganese oxide ores, and the reduction efficiency can be indicated by the manganese leaching efficiency because manganese dioxide cannot be dissolved by sulfuric acid. The effect of the roasting temperature on the leaching efficiency of Mn is shown in As observed, the acid leaching efficiency of Mn increases from 79.6% to 95.1% as the roasting temperature increases from 350  As displayed in The Mn leaching efficiency as a function of S/Mn mole ratio is plotted in The effect of roasting time on the acid and water leaching efficiency of Mn is shown in The results in The effects of sulfuric acid concentration, stirring rate, leaching temperature and leaching time on the leaching efficiency were then investigated. The roasting conditions were a roasting temperature of 550 Keeping the other leaching conditions as the same (i.e., leaching time, 20 The leaching efficiencies of Mn and Fe, in Fixing the sulfuric acid concentration at 1.0 Under conditions of a sulfuric acid concentration of 1.0 The effect of leaching time on leaching efficiency was studied by varying the leaching time from 1 The leaching efficiency curves in To optimize the effect of liquid-to-solid ratio on the leaching efficiency, the reduced product was leached with liquid-to-solid ratio between 4:1 and 12:1 by keeping other conditions constant (sulfuric acid concentration, 1.0 From In our tests, applying the novel process to other types of low-grade manganese oxide ores, such as pyrolusite (24.24 These results indicate that this process is suitable to various manganese oxide ores. All of the leaching efficiencies reach above 90%. Furthermore, this technology has a bright future due to its good reactivity between manganese oxides and sulfur, low roasting temperature, and low production cost if chemically pure sulfur is to be substituted by industrial sulfur residues. A novel process for utilizing low-grade manganese oxide ores by sulfur-based reduction roasting–acid leaching was successfully developed in this study. Manganese dioxide can be quickly reduced by sulfur, forming Mn The authors would like to express their gratitude to the
