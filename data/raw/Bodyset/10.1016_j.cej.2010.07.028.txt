The influence of the size and behavior of clusters on mass transfer in fast fluidized beds is discussed. The reaction in a fast fluidized bed is considered to comprise inside diffusion and outside diffusion of the particles as well as intrinsic reaction kinetics. Based on this theory and method, the decomposition of ozone at ambient temperature is calculated in a fast fluidized bed with average and local bed structure parameters and the axial and radial dimensionless concentrations of ozone and averaged mass transfer coefficients are compared to experimental data from the literature. The agreement between calculation and experimental data is good.specific surface area of particle (m specific surface area of cluster (m active component concentration of gas in cluster phase (kg/m active component concentration of gas in dispersed phase (kg/m averaged component concentration of gas (kg/m active component concentration of gas near the surface of particle in cluster phase (kg/m active component concentration of gas near the surface of particle in dispersed phase (kg/m active component concentration of gas near the surface of particle on the surface of cluster phase (kg/m averaged active component concentration of gas near the surface of particles (kg/m drag coefficient in cluster phase drag coefficient in dispersed phase drag coefficient between cluster and gas in dispersed phase averaged drag coefficient gas diffusion coefficient (m diameter of cluster (m) diameter of particle (m) volume friction of cluster phase coefficient of mass transfer between gas and particles swarm in homogeneous gas–particles system (m/s) coefficient of mass transfer between gas and particles in cluster phase (m/s) coefficient of mass transfer between gas and particles in dispersed phase (m/s) coefficient of mass transfer (m/s) averaged coefficient of mass transfer (m/s) coefficient of mass transfer between cluster and gas in dispersed phase (m/s) the rate of reaction of ozone decomposition (s mass of naphthalene transferred from naphthalene particles to air flow in unit volume of the system (kg/(m mass transferred from particles to air due to aggregating and dispersing of the particles in unit volume of the system (kg/(m mass transferred from particles in cluster phase to air in cluster phase in unit volume of the system (kg/(m mass transferred from particles in dispersed phase to air in dispersed phase in unit volume of the system (kg/(m mass transferred from high-concentration gas in the cluster/dispersed to the low-concentration gas in the dispersed/cluster phase by diffusion and seepage (kg/(m mass transferred from particles on the surface of clusters to air in dispersed phase in unit volume of the system (kg/(m the mass of active component entered the element slice (kg) the mass of active component exited from the element slice (kg) the mass of active component entered the element slice in the dispersed phase (kg) the mass of active component exited from the element slice in the dispersed phase (kg) Schmidt number Sherwood number temperature of gas in cluster phase (K) temperature of gas in dispersed phase (K) temperature of particles in cluster phase (K) temperature of particles in dispersed phase (K) superficial gas velocity (m/s) superficial gas velocity in cluster phase (m/s) superficial gas velocity in dispersed phase (m/s) superficial particle velocity (m/s) superficial particle velocity in cluster phase (m/s) superficial particle velocity in dispersed phase (m/s) superficial slip velocity between gas and particles superficial slip velocity between gas and particle in cluster phase (m/s) superficial slip velocity between gas and particle in dispersed phase (m/s) superficial slip velocity gas between in dispersed phase and cluster (m/s) mass flux of solid (kg/(m voidage voidage in cluster phase voidage in dispersed phase averaged voidage voidage of inter-phase, i.e., the volume friction of gas except gas in clusters viscosity of gas (kg/(m density of gas (kg/m density of particle (kg/m the internal diffusion effectiveness factor of catalyst Due to the high gas–solid contact area and good mass/heat transfer of the circulating fluidized bed (CFB), it has been used successfully in many industrial processes, e.g., combustion of low-grade fuels, mineral processing, and fluid catalytic cracking. However, because the complicated mechanism between the fluid dynamics and mass transfer is not clearly understood, the design and scale-up of CFBs is still not an easy task. The main reason is the existence of solid clusters and strands in the fast fluidized bed This work discusses the mass transfer aspect of CFB. Many researchers have employed empirical correlations and theoretical approaches to predict the dimensionless mass transfer number inside a fast fluidized bed, e.g., the following empirical correlation was proposed by Frossling Using the above equation, many authors Recently, Paterson and Hayhurst Breault Recently, Dong et al. Our previous work According to the EMMS model The resolution of structure and gas–particles interaction in the fast fluidized bed is shown in In this case, the Yung–La Nauze In the above equations,   The mass It should be noted that when the interfacial area between the gas and particles in the cluster phase is calculated, the contact area between the particles on the surface of the cluster and gas in the dispersed phase should be subtracted as shown in Eq. Mass conservation calls for the following mass balance: Substituting Eqs. The averaged coefficient of mass transfer is defined as The equation for the averaged coefficient of mass transfer The traditional equation for the averaged coefficient of mass transfer as shown below: The purpose of developing mass transfer equations for the cluster phase and for the dispersed phase is to determine the concentrations of active component in the gas of the cluster phase and in the gas of the dispersed phase, According to the principle of mass transfer:  The mass of active component The mass of active component Thus the mass conservation equation for the active gas component in the dispersed phase can be expressed as Substituting Eqs. Similarly, the mass conservation equation for the active gas component in the cluster phase can be derived as follows: However, under steady conditions, the dispersion of particles should equal their aggregation, thus counteracting each other. Therefore, In this work, the averaged coefficient of mass transfer derived experimentally by Subbarao and Gambhir Since air is saturated with naphthalene upon entering the fluidized bed, the boundary can be written as: For the given conditions, the heterogeneous flow structure ( In this paper, a first-order irreversible reaction is assumed to take place in a fast fluidized bed. In order to determine the concentration of active component near the solid surface, the equations for mass balance between reaction and mass transfer in the dispersed phase, in the cluster phase, in the inter-phase, and in the overall unit of reactor are given as follows. For the dispersed phase, For the cluster phase, For the inter-phase, For the overall unit volume of reactor, Based on the above equations, the equation for the averaged concentration on the surface of particles can be written as In the above five equations only four equations are independent. Theoretically, only four among the five equations Unlike the conventional CFD model, which assumes uniform active concentrations in each calculating grid, in the MSMT model the active concentration in each grid can be divided into two parts: the active concentration in the dispersed phase In the dispersed phase: In the dense phase: Based on Eqs. Eqs. In this work, the averaged coefficient of mass transfer of the whole bed has been calculated, and the results of the simulation are compared with the experimental data reported by Subbarao and Gambhir However, in order to further test and verify the theory for the case affected by both mass transfer and reactions in a fast fluidized bed, the process of ozone decomposition performed by Ouyang et al. Dong et al.   The dimensionless ozone concentration as a function of the rate of the intrinsic reaction, which is simulated on the basis of averaged flow structure parameters, is shown in In Based on the above discussion and comparison, it was found that there are the heterogeneous gas–particles flow structure has significant effects on the mass transfer process and mass transfer coefficient in fast fluidized beds. By comparing the simulation and experimental data for ozone decomposition in a fast fluidized bed, the results suggest the theory of MSMT, based on the local bed structural parameter, can better characterize the natural properties of the process of coupled mass and reaction in the fast fluidized bed than other traditional methods. In addition, the compromises between inside diffusion, outside diffusion, and intrinsic kinetics is considered in the MSMT model, which provides a common method to deal with the process of coupled mass and reaction in a fast fluidized bed. And using the MSMT, the active component concentrations in the gas and on the surface of the particles in the dispersed phase, in the cluster phase, and in the inter-phase can be calculated; thus the controlling step in every phase and throughout the whole reactor can be disclosed, providing the theoretical basis for designing and operating a highly efficient fast fluidized bed reactor. To sum up, the MSMT model in this paper can provide more accurate information about mass transfer and reaction in fast fluidized beds than other traditional methods, and it is expected that the MSMT model will be used to successfully scale-up and design fast fluidized beds in the future. The author is grateful for the support for this work from the In this work, Gambit_2.2 was employed to generate the computational grid and Fluent 6.2.16 was used as the solver. In the calculation process, at first, the bed structure parameters can be solved by EMMS In the fluidized bed, the solid phase is often treated as fluid phase. Therefore, the Eulerian model can be used to model gas–solid fluidized bed reactors. And the granular kinetic theory is employed to calculate the viscous forces and the solid pressure of the particulate phase. The governing equations in Eulerian notation are given in The differential equations in The inlet at the bed bottom is designated as the velocity inlet boundary condition for both the gas and solid phases. The boundary condition at the top of the bed is a pressure boundary fixed at atmospheric pressure. Solids are leaved from the top due to drag force and then return to the computational domain from the bottom inlet with the same mass flux. Other boundary conditions are specified as the wall, which are all set as no-slip wall boundary conditions for both the gas and solid phases. The parameters of the simulations are described in In The equation for the averaged drag coefficient
