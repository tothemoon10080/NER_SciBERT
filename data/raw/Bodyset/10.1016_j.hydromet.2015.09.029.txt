The porphyry copper deposits normally contain arsenic minerals, particularly enargite (Cu Enargite is most refractory to leaching in acidic media as compared to other copper sulfides ( Among the alternatives, the leaching processes of enargite in sulfate media are the most suitable and attractive alternatives for the mining industry because once the arsenic is removed from the leaching solution, the copper can be recovered by the conventional and proven technology of solvent extraction and electrowinning. In some cases, the solutions can be integrated into existing copper recovery operations. Unfortunately, the dissolution of enargite in sulfuric acid media at atmospheric conditions using either oxygen or ferric ions as oxidants is extremely slow ( On the other hand, pressure leaching of enargite in sulfate media has been reported to yield a more rapid dissolution of enargite as compared to ambient pressure. The reactions that occur during the pressure leaching of enargite with oxygen can be written as follows ( where the fraction of HSO When ferrous ions are present in the leaching solution either from the addition of ferrous sulfate or produced by the leaching of other iron containing minerals, the formation of ferric ions will occur in the system according to the reaction: In this case, the following alternative enargite leaching reactions can also occur: The ferrous ions produced by reactions ( Regarding the kinetics of enargite leaching in sulfuric acid media, the pertaining literature data are summarized in Taking into account the above discussion, as already stated, the objective of the present research was the determination of the kinetics of the pressure dissolution of enargite in sulfuric acid solutions containing ferrous sulfate, and the verification of the role of the indirect leaching mechanism involving the ferric oxidation of enargite in this leaching system. The enargite for this study was obtained from a coarse ground primary sample from El Indio Mine (Barrick Co.), Chile, by manually concentrating using a magnifying glass and tweezers. Subsequently, this enargite was ground further and classified by size using a USA sieve series. The size fractions obtained had average sizes of 46, 64, 91 and 128 The theoretical amounts of arsenic in stoichiometric enargite is 19.02%, thus the value of 18.25% arsenic would correspond to 96.0% Cu As seen in this figure, all of the diffraction lines correspond to Cu The pressure leaching experiments were carried out in a 2-liter Parr titanium autoclave equipped with a temperature controller, a pressure register, a variable speed stirrer (with two axial impellers), an electrical heating mantle, and an internal cooling coil to control the solution temperature. A solution sampling system comprising an internal dip tube with titanium porous filter (2 The experimental procedure consisted of charging the autoclave with 950 In some experiments, the ferrous ion concentration was analyzed immediately on site after sampling. The method used was a volumetric titration with potassium dichromate using barium diphenylamine sulfonate as indicator. The ferric ion concentration was determined as the difference from the total iron concentration. In all the experiments, the initial concentration of H Preliminary experiments were carried out to determine the stirring speed necessary to maintain in suspension the various sizes of particles used in the leaching. These experiments were done using a glass vase (the autoclave liner) at room temperature and pressure, with 2 Most of the leaching experiments were carried out using 1 As seen in this figure, the addition of ferrous ions to the leaching solution has a large effect on the rate of enargite dissolution even for the lowest concentration of 9.0 The data shown in It should be emphasized that in this study, the concentration of Fe On this aspect, previous researchers have determined that the oxidation of ferrous to ferric by oxygen is catalyzed by cupric ions ( Additional leaching experiments were performed adding cupric sulfate to the leaching solution to determine whether the rate of pressure dissolution of enargite can be accelerated further. In these experiments, the initial solution contained a concentration of 8 It is clear from this figure that the initial addition of CuSO Several experiments were performed at temperatures in the range of 140 to 200 As seen in this figure, the temperature has a very large effect on enargite dissolution, which suggests that a chemical surface reaction could be the controlling step of the overall dissolution kinetics. It must be stressed at this point that the temperature should have a positive effect on the two kinetic processes occurring in the system, i.e. the enargite dissolution by the ferric ions and the oxidation of the ferrous ions to ferric.  Leaching experiments using enargite with different particle size were carried out under identical experimental conditions. The results are shown in The experiments carried out varying the initial sulfuric acid concentration in the range 0.3 to 1.2 On the other hand, experiments performed for various partial pressures of oxygen showed that this variable does affect the rate of enargite dissolution as seen in This result is due to the direct effect of oxygen on the rate of Fe In the data shown in A morphology analysis of the initial and partially reacted enargite particles were performed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results are illustrated in From the discussed experimental evidence, it became clear that a product layer did not form on the surface of the enargite particles. Therefore, the kinetics of enargite dissolution in FeSO Where the C In this equation, k is the apparent kinetic constant given by: Considering the results shown in The values of the apparent kinetic constant k at each temperature were determined from the slopes of the straight lines in From the slope of the straight line in The experimental data on the effect of the particle size also fitted very well the kinetic Eq. Based on the experimental results on the pressure leaching of enargite in FeSO The addition of ferrous sulfate to the leaching solution produces a large increase in the rate of enargite dissolution as compared to a solution containing only sulfuric acid. This indicates that the ferric ion is the principal oxidant of enargite and the main role of the oxygen is the oxidation of ferrous ions to regenerate the ferric ions. The addition of copper sulfate to the leaching solution did not affect the rate of enargite dissolution, indicating that the produced cupric ions from the enargite leaching are plenty to catalyze the ferrous to ferric oxidation by oxygen. In the range of temperatures studied (140â€“200 The kinetics of enargite pressure leaching in FeSO The authors acknowledge the
