This special issue provides the reader with a wealth of information on developments in the field of sol–gel deposited solar energy materials used in the switching devices and solar cells. Sol–gel processing has proved to be an important technique for the film deposition. Among the various advantages, sol–gel technique offers the special advantage of tailoring the physical properties of thin films. Currently, uses of the sol–gel process are increasing due to their applications in optics, displays and switching devices. The scope of this special issue covers the most recent developments of sol–gel deposited films and its solar energy applications. From this special issue, you will see the emerging ideas and concepts in the sol–gel processing of electrochromic, ion conducting and solar coatings and their commercial applications. I would like to thank the authors for the contribution of their papers, the reviewers for their dedication and timely review and the Publisher Elsevier Science for making this special issue possible.
