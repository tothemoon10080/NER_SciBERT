An experimental study of the comparative kinetics of dissolution of various synthetic copper sulphides (covellite, chalcocite, and digenite) in dilute chloride solutions has been carried out at ambient temperatures such as could be encountered in the heap leaching of secondary copper sulphide minerals.
                  The dissolution of sized synthetic covellite particles was carried out in dilute HCl solutions containing known concentrations of copper(II) and iron(III) at controlled potentials. The results show that the rate of dissolution is similar at potentials of 600 and 650mV, but is predictably less at a potential of 550mV. The rate of dissolution is remarkably similar to that of chalcopyrite under similar conditions and is largely independent of Cl− and HCl concentration in the range 0.2 to 2.5M and 0.1 to 1M respectively. The effect of temperature is significant and an activation energy of 71.5kJ mol−1 was derived which confirms a chemical or electrochemical rate-determining reaction on the mineral surface. A mineralogical study of the residue after leaching shows that most of the sulphur is associated with unreacted covellite and occurs as isolated globules on the surface with over 90% of the unreacted covellite surface free of sulphur.
                  Dissolution of synthetic chalcocite and digenite is rapid compared with that of covellite under the same conditions. At a potential of 500mV, the relatively rapid initial dissolution of chalcocite and digenite does not proceed beyond about 50% and 45% copper dissolution, respectively, as predicted from the thermodynamics. These results confirm the formation of a covellite-like phase as an intermediate which cannot be leached at a potential of 500mV. An increase in the potential results in rapid dissolution of this “secondary covellite,” relative to primary covellite. These results provide useful information for the conditions that should be used for the heap leaching of ores containing secondary copper sulphide minerals.The recovery of copper by heap leaching of low-grade ores containing secondary copper sulphide minerals is becoming increasingly important as the easily leached oxide ores are being depleted. The present authors have recently published the results of a study of the dissolution of chalcopyrite concentrates and ores under conditions that could be appropriate to heap leaching of ores containing this refractory mineral. In dilute chloride solutions at ambient temperatures, the results were obtained that have shown that the rate of leaching of chalcopyrite under these conditions is enhanced if the solution potential is controlled within a potential window (550–620 In the case of the secondary copper sulphide minerals, chalcocite (Cu An alternative approach using dilute chloride solutions has been applied in at least one case ( Although there is a considerable body of published information on the dissolution of secondary copper sulphides in chloride solutions, the emphasis has been on elevated temperature processes aimed at concentrates. Research on the rates of dissolution of secondary sulphides in dilute chloride solutions at ambient temperatures is therefore desirable. In particular, the solution potentials required to effectively leach these minerals are not known with any certainty in dilute chloride solutions. In the absence of suitable natural samples of these minerals, chalcocite, digenite and covellite were synthesised and leaching experiments have been carried out under conditions similar to those used in previous studies with chalcopyrite ( Covellite (CuS) is a copper sulphide mineral which contains 66% copper and it is now considered as being Cu At elevated leach temperatures, it is generally considered that the relative rates of dissolution are chalcocite The first systematic report of CuS leaching in ferric sulphate media was reported by Note that this and other equations are written as published in the literature and not in terms of Cu  Various papers (   Chalcocite, (Cu  The first step is faster than the second and is only slightly affected by temperature which suggests that it could be controlled by mass transport processes. The second, slower step is more strongly dependent on the temperature. In this and subsequent equations and discussion, the term “secondary covellite” is used to describe the product of the first stage of oxidation of chalcocite although the original description as “blaubliebender” covellite has been shown to be inaccurate in that the intermediate species is a complex mixture of sulphides within the compositional range Cu  Many publications have confirmed that secondary covellite is formed as an intermediate product during the dissolution of chalcocite ( It is generally accepted that the intermediate or secondary covellite is more reactive than the primary mineral ( Digenite can be represented as Cu Although shown as reactions involving oxygen, it was shown that copper(II) ions (produced by re-oxidation of copper(I) by dissolved oxygen) is the active oxidant. Again, the second step is much slower than the first for which the rate is controlled by boundary layer diffusion of the copper(II) ions to the particle surface. The rate of the second step reaction follows a shrinking core model and is controlled by diffusion through a porous product layer. The activation energy of the first step is 15.8 The thermodynamics of the oxidation of covellite by copper(II) or iron(III) ions in chloride solutions are not as favourable as that for chalcopyrite and chalcocite, as shown by the curves in The curves for the reduction of iron(III) and copper(II) have been calculated so that they intersect (i.e. are in equilibrium) at a potential of 580 The requirement for spontaneous oxidation of covellite is that the potential for the oxidant couple be greater than that for the oxidation of covellite. Thus, at 580 Thus, using the data for the metastable species quoted by Copper sulphide samples were synthesised with stoichiometric quantities of acid-washed copper wire and reagent grade elemental sulphur powder which were placed in separate Vycor boats and sealed under vacuum in a Vycor tube. For covellite, copper wire (1 Agitated leaching experiments at controlled potential were carried out as described in a previous publication ( The solution potentials were monitored using a platinum ring electrode with a combined Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 Leaching experiments were carried out at various potentials, chloride and acid concentrations and temperatures. Unless otherwise stated, the normal conditions involved the use of a solution of 0.2 The effect of the potential on covellite dissolution has been investigated in 0.2 The rate of copper dissolution is similar (about 80% after 1000 The effect of chloride ions on the rate of dissolution of covellite has been investigated at a controlled potential of 600 Leaching experiments were carried out in 0.1  Again, the effect of temperature on the rate of dissolution of covellite was investigated in 0.2 The slopes of the approximately linear sections of the plots were used in the Arrhenius plot in The effect of dissolved oxygen on the rate of covellite leaching was investigated because the rate of dissolution of chalcopyrite was found to be enhanced in the presence of dissolved oxygen ( Addition of fine pyrite has been shown to catalyse the leaching of chalcopyrite under similar conditions and Also shown in The mineralogy of the residue from the dissolution of covellite under normal conditions after 1500 The mineral map obtained on the residue after dissolution for 1500 A detailed discussion of the mechanism involved in the deportment of elemental sulphur in the case of chalcopyrite dissolution has recently been presented ( Leaching experiments were carried out with synthetic chalcocite at various potentials, 500 It is apparent that the rate of copper dissolution from chalcocite is rapid compared with that of covellite and that the rate of copper dissolution increased with increasing potential up to 600 This result confirms the thermodynamic prediction that oxidation of chalcocite to covellite is possible under these conditions but that 500 Leaching experiments were also carried out with synthetic digenite at various potentials, 500 The results of this study have provided some useful pointers to the optimization of the heap leaching of secondary copper sulphide minerals. The slow rate of leaching of primary covellite relative to that of secondary material produced by oxidation of chalcocite or digenite indicates that recovery of at least 50% copper from chalcocite is likely to be rapid while copper recovery from covellite in the ore will be slow. Although low potentials (below 550 The absence of any strong dependence of the rate of covellite dissolution on the chloride concentration suggests that it is not necessary to increase the chloride concentration in the raffinate solutions to concentrations above 20 Similarly, the lack of dependence of the rate of covellite dissolution on pH shows that acid consumption could be reduced by operation of the heaps at pH values about 1.5 and possibly as high as 2. The high activation energy for the dissolution of covellite indicates that, as in the case of chalcopyrite, even small increases in heap temperatures could provide significant benefits in terms of increased rates of copper recovery. The results of an experimental program to study the comparative kinetics of dissolution of sized synthetic covellite, chalcocite and digenite particles in dilute acidic chloride solutions at controlled potentials has shown that: The rate of covellite dissolution is similar at potentials of 600 and 650 The rate of covellite dissolution is largely independent of the chloride and HCl concentration in the range of 0.2 to 2.5 The rates of leaching of chalcocite and digenite are rapid compared with that of covellite. At low potentials, chalcocite and digenite convert to secondary covellite which can only be dissolved at potentials of about 550 A mineralogical study of the residue after leaching of covellite has shown that most of the sulphur is associated with unreacted covellite as isolated globules on the surface with over 90% of the unreacted covellite surface free of sulphur.
