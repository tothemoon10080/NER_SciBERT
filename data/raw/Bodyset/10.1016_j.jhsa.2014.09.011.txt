Acute distal radius fractures are commonly treated by volar locking plate fixation and typically involve reflection of the pronator quadratus for adequate exposure of the fracture. Recently, attention has been centered on the role and repair of the pronator quadratus. This article presents an alternative approach to fixation of distal radius fractures with a pronator-sparing technique that offers similar short-term radiographic outcomes to the conventional volar plating approach.
