Unlike conventional or tight gas reservoirs, shale gas or oil reservoirs have complex fracture networks that are often developed due to the interactions between natural and hydraulic fractures. Another major characteristic of shale reservoirs is that a good portion of shale gas can be in adsorbed state. In order to capture these characteristics of shale reservoirs numerically, PSU-SHALECOMP, a compositional dual-porosity, dual-permeability, multi-phase reservoir simulator is employed together with the implementation of stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) approach. In this approach, three of the reservoir parameters are altered to define hydraulic fractures in the form of SRV. These altered properties are SRV fracture permeability, SRV fracture porosity and SRV fracture spacing. In the validation phase of these computationally inexpensive SRV models, rock and fluid properties and reservoir conditions representative of a Marcellus shale reservoir and normalized field data from Marcellus shale wells to history-match the production performances were used. It is shown that the PSU-SHALECOMP simulator with the implementation of SRV model is capable of matching the historical data effectively and rapidly. In pursuit of successful validations of various production scenarios, several carbon dioxide injection scenarios were performed to see the performance of the PSU-SHALECOMP simulator in depleted Marcellus shale reservoirs.As the oil and gas industry shifts producing from conventional reservoirs to unconventional reservoirs such as coal-bed methane (CBM) and shale oil and gas reservoirs, the unconventional reservoir rocks are studied in more detail, and it is recognized that their pore geometry is much more complex ( Over the years, many numerical model solutions and workflow have been studied and created. The most common formulation used in reservoir simulation is the single-porosity-reservoir approach. Single-porosity models have only one pore system in which fluids can flow toward production wells ( In shale and CBM reservoirs, flow interaction between successive blocks has to be taken into account; therefore, a dual-porosity/dual-permeability formulation is needed to be employed to capture the fluid flow within matrix systems ( The In The In reservoir simulation applications, conventional representation and design of hydraulic fracturing is achieved by placing discrete transverse fracture planes in the computational domain. Discrete fracture network (DFN) modeling is the most widely applied approach to model shale-gas reservoirs where the entire reservoir is discretely created, including the network fractures, hydraulic fracture, matrix blocks, and unstimulated areas ( In this study, formulation of the compositional fluid flow in dual-porosity, dual-permeability domains is discussed. The implementation of the This study provides a novel approach to numerical representation of multi-component gas flow in stimulated shale reservoirs by incorporating a compositional dual-porosity, dual-permeability, multi-phase reservoir simulator with the implementation of First part of our approach includes the development of a dual-porosity, dual-permeability, multi-phase reservoir simulator. In this section, a summary of the formulations that are implemented in Equation It is well known that fracture spacing in shale gas and coal bed methane matrix domains are rather small. Therefore, the gas flow for the component The gas flow potentials in the fracture and matrix domains are described by Equation In describing the water flow in the fracture only Darcian flow component is considered (Equation Equation Equation In this set of formulations, there are 2 Capillary pressure relationships Saturation constraints Mole fraction constraints In this study, Langmuir sorption isotherm equation (Eq. In the equation above i. e Langmuir sorption isotherm equation, In 2002, Manik et al. numerically captured Equation In this numerical model, the ideal adsorbate solution (IAS) theory is used to investigate carbon dioxide injection possibilities in formations that have shale gas reservoir characteristics. The IAS model assumes that the adsorbed phase behaves like an ideal solution as described by activity coefficients of unity for all values of pressure, temperature, and composition ( To calculate the multi-component sorption, 2 With a given set of independent variables ( Equation  In Equation Equation The gas component sorption rate over time interval An iterative linear equation solver (GMRES) and advanced matrix preconditioners (ParaSails and FASP) are incorporated into The numerical simulator is developed with no-flow outer boundary condition. The inner boundary condition options include water flow rate, gas flow rate and bottomhole pressure specifications. The wells can be modeled vertically or horizontally. Incremental material balance and residual checks are performed at the end of each time step. The code consists of a main program, seven subroutines and 24 functions. Shale reservoirs inherently have complex network structure. The concepts of single-plane-fractures and conductivity are insufficient to describe stimulation performance as in conventional reservoirs ( The concept of The Fracture intensity and fracture complexity are relatively new areas of interest for improving production results in low-permeability reservoirs with horizontal lateral completions. The goal of the stimulation process in all tight reservoirs is to maximize the surface area of productive rock and connect cleats to the wellbore ( Microseismic fracture monitoring tools have shown that large fracture networks can be generated in shale gas reservoirs. For example, in conventional reservoirs and tight gas sands, single plane fractures and fracture conductivity are enough to describe the characteristics of the stimulated zone for the numerical models (  Net fracture-extension pressure in brittle, heterogeneous rock such as Barnett or Marcellus shale formations will also cause stress-relief fractures (   In the construction of a numerical model, the distribution of reservoir properties is imported from a geological model including certain parameters such as permeability, porosity, net pay, and flow barriers, along with the distribution of all reservoir and non-reservoir facies ( Understanding the interaction of the hydraulic fracture with natural fractures is an essential component of stimulation design and production forecasting shale gas reservoirs ( As a universal characteristic of inverse computational protocols, each history-matching problem is exposed to non-unique solution quandary. In other words, almost any reservoir parameter can be adjusted to achieve a history-match ( The water saturation in the matrix and in the fractures are taken as 10% and 0.1%, respectively. The water phase is assumed as immobile (see In the construction of the numerical model, the reservoir temperature is 142 Â°F and the initial reservoir pressure of the reservoir is 3940 psi. The Langmuir volume constant for methane is 73 scf/ton and the Langmuir pressure constant of methane is taken as 726 psi. The duration of the production is set as 870 days since the commercial data provided is also for 870 days ( Process of history-matching based entirely on manual alteration of preselected history-matching parameters ( In the current study, it was decided to modify the values that have the most uncertainty or known least accurately depending on the available data. Fracture porosity, fracture permeability and fracture spacing values in the During our manual history-matching workflow, the simulation model is run for the entire historical period and the results were compared with the field data in-hand. After each run, some adjustments on the values of the parameters in There is no universally agreed standards to evaluate a successful history-match ( After successfully history-matching the field production data by using In this investigation, the reservoir is depleted for 30 years with a given bottomhole pressure production constraint, which is 615 psi. At the end of   The wells are altered to injectors at the end of the The average pressures of the drainage area at the end of 30 years of production for the commercial simulator and The pressure distributions at the end of the injection periods for both of the simulators can be seen in The average pressures of the unstimulated zones that are predicted by the commercial simulator and In this paper, the concept of stimulated reservoir volume ( It is shown that both simulators are able to predict production performances efficiently; however, double-porosity/single-permeability or double-permeability/single-porosity models over-predict the gas production in shale gas reservoirs due to not taking water presence in the rock matrix and gas-water transport through the rock matrix into account effectively, which ultimately results in forecasting larger cumulative production and injection values than the values that are forecasted by double-porosity/double-permeability simulator, Carbon dioxide sequestration potential in depleted shale reservoirs is also investigated. It is shown that most of the methane production is extracted within the The work reported in this paper was funded by  Cross-sectional flow area (ft Specific surface area of adsorbent (ft Formation volume factor of gas phase in fracture domain (rb/scf) Formation volume factor of water phase in fracture domain (rb/scf) Formation volume factor of gas phase in matrix domain (rb/scf) Formation volume factor of water phase in matrix domain (rb/scf) day Grid size of SRV zone in x-direction (ft) Grid size of unstimulated zone in x-direction (ft) Grid size of SRV zone in y-direction (ft) Grid size of unstimulated zone in y-direction (ft) Depth (ft) Diffusion coefficient (ft Diffusion coefficient of gas component Diffusion coefficient of gas component Fugacity (psi) Fugacity of component Fugacity of component Depth from datum to the center of the block (ft) Local gravitational acceleration (ft Conversion factor for gravitational acceleration (lbm-ft/lbf-s Reservoir thickness (ft) Absolute permeability (md) Permeability in the fracture domain (md) Permeability in the matrix domain (md) Relative permeability to gas in the fracture domain Relative permeability to water Relative permeability to water in the fracture domain Length (ft) Length of reservoir in x-direction (ft) Length of fracture (ft) Horizontal wellbore length (ft) Length of reservoir in y-direction (ft) Molecular weight of gas (lb/lb-mol) Number of transverse fracture planes Number of components Original gas in-place Original water in-place Pressure (psi) Capillary pressure (psi) Capillary pressure in the fracture domain (psi) Capillary pressure in the matrix domain (psi) Initial reservoir pressure both in matrix and fracture (psi) Pressure of gas phase (psi) Pressure of gas phase in the fracture domain (psi) Pressure of gas phase in the matrix domain (psi) Pressure of water phase in the fracture domain (psi) Pressure at standard condition (psi) Pressure of water phase in the matrix domain (psi) Pressure of pure component Sandface pressure (psi) Sandface pressure or bottomhole pressure in production stage (psi) Injection stage stopping criteria (psi) Gas production rate of component Inital flow rate (scf/d) Gas injection rate (scf/d) Sandface injection rate contraint(scf/d) Water production rate (stb/d) Sorption rate of gas component (scf/d) Gas constantâ¯=â¯10.731â¯ft Solution gas-water ratio of gas component Solution gas-water ratio of gas component Gas saturation Gas saturation in the fracture domain Gas saturation in the matrix domain Water saturation Water saturation in the fracture domain Water saturation in the matrix domain Stimulated reservoir volume Stimulated reservoir volume fracture permeability (md) Stimulated reservoir volume fracture porosity Stimulated reservoir volume fracture spacing (ft) Sorption volume constant (scf/lb) Sorption pressure constant (psi) Time (day) Reservoir temperature ( Temperature at standard condition ( Total velocity of gas phase (ft/day) Volume adsorbed of component Control volume (ft Equilibrium condition adsorption capacity (scf/lb) Equilibrium condition partial adsorption capacity of component Equilibrium condition adsorption capacity of pure component Equilibrium condition total adsorption capacity (scf/lb) Langmuir volume (scf/ton) Width of fracture (inch) Half-length of hydraulic fracture (ft) Mole fraction of component Mole fraction of the gas component Mole fraction of the gas component Mole fraction of component Compressibility factor Interporosity term of gas phase for component Interporosity term of gas phase for component Interporosity term of water phase in the fracture domain (scf/d) Interporosity term of water phase in the matrix domain (scf/d) Dimension control volume, Time step size (s) Fracture spacing (ft) Gas viscosity (cp) Water viscosity (cp) Spreading pressure of pure component Gas density (lb/scf) Water density (lb/scf) Sorption time constant (day) Flow potential of gas phase in the fracture domain (psi) Flow potential of gas phase in the matrix domain (psi) Flow potential of water phase in the fracture domain (psi) Flow potential of water phase in the matrix domain (psi) Fracture porosity Matrix porosity Partial fugacity coefficient of component Fugacity coefficient of pure component Pure component spreading pressure group at standard state condition (scf/ton) Spreading pressure group of pure component Multicomponent sorption objective function Gradient operator Divergence operator
