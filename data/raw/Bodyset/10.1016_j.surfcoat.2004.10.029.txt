For an application as biomedical materials of high performance with a good biocompatibility, the anodic TiO2 layer on Ti substrate has been fabricated by electrochemical method, and the characteristics of anodic titania film have been investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the titania film formed in acidic electrolyte with additives is mainly composed of anatase structure containing rutile. From the analysis of chemical states of the anodic film using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), phosphorus and sulfur were observed in the anodic film, which were penetrated from the electrolyte into the oxide layer during anodic process. From the result of biological evaluation in simulated body fluid (SBF), the anodic TiO2 film was effective for bioactive property.In biomedical implants and dental fields, titanium has been widely utilized for excellent corrosion-resistance and biocompatibility. However, Ti and its alloys are non-bioactive after being implanted in bone. Thus, for further improvement in biocompatibility the various implant surface modifications have been investigated. These surface modifications have included sandblasting A commercial grade pure titanium (99.6 wt.%) was used for anodization. The titanium specimens with dimensions of 8×10×0.5 mm were mechanically polished and degreased in After the anodic oxidation, the TiO To obtain the anodic TiO   The anodic oxide films on titanium are formed by anodization in electrolyte, for which anodic reaction in combination with electrical-field driven metal and oxygen ion diffusion lead to the formation of an oxide film at the anode surface, which can be written as: In these reactions the structure and morphology of anodic oxides can be varied by controlling the process parameters, such as electrolyte composition. To observe the effects of electrolytes on the microstructure of anodic TiO  From the results of thickness measurement the average thickness of anodic titania film formed in 1.5 M H  For the comparison of biocompatibility, etched titanium specimen prepared in HNO The anodic titanium oxide film for biomedical applications was synthesized by anodic oxidation in acid solution, and the surface characteristics of anodic TiO This work has been supported by the Kookmin University.
