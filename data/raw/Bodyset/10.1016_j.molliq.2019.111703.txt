This study aims to develop a UV/Iodide process, as a novel procedure of Advanced Reduction Processes (ARPs), and utilized it for photo-degradation, detoxification and mineralization of dexamethasone phosphate (DexP) in aqueous Solution. UV irradiation utilization leads to DexP photo-degradation of 27%, 49% and 60% after the photo-degradation within 2.5, 7.5 and 15min reaction time, respectively. Also, with UV/Iodide process photo-degradation of DexP increased to 42, 71, and 82% in 2.5, 7.5 and 15min reaction time, respectively. Therefore, the 2:0.9 molar ratio was chosen as the optimal and practical DexP / Iodide molar ratio to operate the main UV/Iodide processes. Since the concentration of DexP increased from 10 to 75mgL−1, the k

The UV/Iodide effluent was sampled at the photoreaction times of 5 to 15min and analyzed by LC-MS, to find the intermediates and possible pathways of DexP photo-degradation in the UV/Iodide process. Information from LC-MS indicated in first step DexP converts to compounds with a breaking ring through the attack of the reducer agents and, then, it degrades into linear compounds. Then, these breaking ring compounds are converted into simpler compounds such as acetic acid and formaldehyde. Ultimately, the linear intermediate are mineralized into CO2, and H2O. UV/Iodide process decreases the COD and TOC level about 70% and 74% within the photoreaction time 40min, respectively.There has been a great evidence on discharging sewages with pharmaceuticals substance into surface waters. There are several studies on endocrine disruption resulting from the discharging of pharmaceutical sewage into the rivers [ The lifetime and influence depth of the reducer species in the water is part of a second and 6 To perform the UI process, a lab-scale photo-reactor was employed at the batch mode. The utilized photo-reactor was a sealed tubular glass with a capacity of 150 Assessing the effect of pH (3 to 11), initial DexP concentration (10 to 100 Because measuring the amount of reducing species in solution is almost impossible; therefore, the pseudo-first-order (PFO) kinetic model was used to investigate the reduction of chromate (according to the Eqs. Considering the reducing DexP concentration and the fact that the rate of all reactions is always positive, a negative sign is utilized in these equations. It is worth to state that although Performing the liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis on the effluents of the photoreactor at the reaction times of 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) introduced an effective-cost indicator (figure-of-merit electrical energy per order (EEO)) for comparing of UV based treatment. E Photo-degradation of the DexP samples was performed after applying one of the UV /Iodide, and UV irradiation in each evaluation, to clarify the performance of the UV/Iodide treatment. In these tests, 25 The pH effect on photo-degradation of 25 To investigate of UV/Iodide process performance, the ratio of the Iodide, and DexP components of the UV/Iodide photoreactor were changed. According to the obtained results ( To investigate the kinetics and cost-effective analysis of the process, the UV/Iodide process was employed for 15 Various major anion including chloride, nitrate, bicarbonate, and sulfate exist in surface and underground water that might interfere with the agents’ photogenerated in AORPs and reduce their performance. These anions were considered in this regard to find their effect on photo-degradation in 25 The functional groups substituted on the bring shape of different molecules determine their extent of reactivity. Generally, if the C-attached functional group (such as F) are electron withdrawing, then the ring will be inactivated and will not react with reducer agents. The functional group in DexP is fluorine, which is more electronegative than carbon [ The UV/Iodide effluent was sampled at the photoreaction times of 5 to 15 Table 0.2.

Mineralization of organic compounds is explained as their conversion into highly stable compounds, e.g. water and carbon dioxide.
