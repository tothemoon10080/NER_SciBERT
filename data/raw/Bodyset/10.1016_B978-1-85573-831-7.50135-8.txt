Rotational moulding has significant advantages over other methods such as injection moulding and blow moulding for the production of large hollow plastic parts but at the same time it is limited by its dependence on the use of polyethylene (PE) as the base resin. Polyethylene is suited for rotomoulding because of its thermal stability, low cost and the low melting point. However, its low mechanical strength and stiffuess must be improved to meet product requirements. Rotational moulding of fibre and/or inorganic powder reinforced polyethylene has proved to be difficult to achieve due to segregation of plastic powder and the reinforcements. In this paper, it is proposed to develop a novel hybrid organic/inorganic resin, in effect a ‘pre-composite’, which will generate a microcrystalline reinforcing phase during the rotomoulding heating phase to achieve better distribution of reinforcement within the polymer matrix. For this investigation, a formulation of inorganic mixture of “Geopolymer” is developed to form a microcrystalline phase under injection moulding with the same heating conditions as those of rotomoulding. The mixing of “Geopolymer” with polyethylene powder is achieved in such a way that the inorganic component is uniformly dispersed in the resin while rotomoulding takes place. The preliminary results show an improvement in mechanical properties of Geopolymer-PE composites. Scanning Electron Microscopy clearly shows the existence of an acicular crystalline structure in nano-scale dimension on the fracture surface of geopolymer-PE composites, which is an interesting finding. This micro-/nano-crystalline phase acts as fibre-like reinforcement that is believed to give the improvement of mechanical properties.
