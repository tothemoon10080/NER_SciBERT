The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the natural chalcopyrite electrode was investigated in sulfuric acid and ferric sulfate solutions, in terms of cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and rotating disc electrode (RDE). The tafel slopes and electron transferred numbers were also calculated. The ORR process took place in the potential range of -0.450 V to 0.050 V vs. AgCl/Ag. The average transferred electron number for ORR on chalcopyrite in sulfuric acid was near to 4. The addition of ferric ion was shown to increase the dissolution rate of chalcopyrite, however, the transferred electron numbers for ORR experienced a slight reduce and then grown fast with the increase of ferric ions. The ORR process was found to be inhibited attributing to a Fenton-like reaction mechanism at high concentration of ferric ions and more intermediate H2O2 was supposed to produce accordingly.
