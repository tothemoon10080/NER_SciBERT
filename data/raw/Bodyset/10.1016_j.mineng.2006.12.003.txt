The fine grinding of ores is increasing due to the depletion of coarse grained, easily processed ore bodies and the increased need to process disseminated, fine grained deposits. The main reason ball mills are not utilised for fine grinding is the perceived poor energy efficiency generally experienced when grinding to fine sizes. However there is a trend towards ball mill grinding for product sizes below the traditional ball mill cut-off of 45μm.
                  The effect of ball size on the feed and product size distributions in a fine grinding situation was studied. The grinding tests identified a number of trends for fine grinding, including:

The results supporting the claim that fine material is best ground with small media and coarse material with larger media. The smallest charge was most efficient at treating the finer feeds. The smaller charges were very ineffective and inefficient for grinding of the coarser feeds. Efficient grind was undertaken by smaller charges than that recommended by Bond’s ball sizing formula, and Operating work index analysis confirming the results of the As coarse grained, easily processed ore bodies are depleted, more disseminated, fine-grained ores are being treated. Adequate liberation of valuable components within a fine-grained ore is often only achieved once the particle size of the ore has been reduced to levels below the traditional ball mill cut-off of 45 To aid in the economic liberation of fine-grained minerals, fine grinding was identified in the early 1990s as a suitable process for the minerals industry. Liberation options include a coarse primary grind and produce a concentrate and middling with re-grinding of the concentrate and/or the middling to finer sizes to achieve final liberation or fine grinding of the whole ore. In recent years, the popularity of vertical and horizontal stirred mills, such as the Svedala Vertimill ( Fine grinding in traditional ball mills has not been utilised in the past due to the following perceived disadvantages: The mill speed has to be lower than the centrifugal speed of the mill otherwise the whole charge will rotate with the mill body and no grinding will occur. This speed limit fixes the maximum electrical power the mill can draw. The size of the inactive zone increases as the ball size becomes smaller. A large part of the volume of the mill has to be kept empty to allow the mill charge to tumble ( The main reason, however, is the poor energy efficiency generally experienced by horizontal tumbling mills when grinding to fine sizes ( While the above problems may be characteristic of horizontal mills, recent research and test-work by fine grinding media manufacturers, and the current use of the technology, has shown that these disadvantages can be overcome and that it is possible to achieve efficient size reduction in horizontal ball mills. It has been shown that either power consumption can be reduced or through-put increased for a nominated fine grind size, without the need to invest in new equipment if a horizontal ball mill is already in use. While stirred media mills have shown to be more energy efficient than ball mills for ultra-fine grinding (<25 Ball mills have been used for particle size reduction for many decades and a great wealth of information about their operation exists. Being a well known technology and with much research carried out in the past into grinding in a ball mill, further studies into fine grinding in a ball mill should result in confirmation of the viability of using ball mills for fine grinding situations. At grind sizes below 20–30 The aim of this experimental work was to study the effect of ball size on the feed and product size distributions in a ball mill fine grinding situation. It is well known from Bond’s comminution theories that the feed top size determines the largest ball size required for particle breakage. Eq. There are numerous sites world-wide using ball mills for fine grinding applications. The experimental regime consisted of 16 grinding tests (plus control repeats) and a Bond Work Index test on a gold ore sample. The 16 tests are made up of combinations of four different feed sizes and four different ball size distributions as detailed in The ore used for these tests was a typical quartz andesite rock. The ore had an initial size of approximately minus 15 The grinding charge for the tests consisted of a constant mass of various sized steel balls, as detailed in The mill used for the tests was a standard Bond Ball Mill, with an internal diameter and length of 30.5 For all of the tests, the mill was operated at 70 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a ball loading of 20% (by volume). The amount of ore used for each test was the mass equivalent to 700 The method used for the 16 grinding tests (plus four repeats) was based on that of the Levin Test ( In the grinding tests for this work, each sample was ground for 5 For the 1000 The Bond Ball Mill Work Index ( The feed top size determines the largest ball size required for particle breakage. Bond found that for a given feed size the largest size ball required could be estimated using Eq.  From Bond’s ball sizing formula, the recommended top ball size for this feed was 10 The results represented in For this feed, the calculated best top ball size was 14 Shown in From the calculated top ball size for this charge, the best size media would have been between Charges 3 and 4. Once again a smaller charge produced the more efficient grind, even though in this case the difference between the grinds produced by the two charges is very small and hence either would be suitable to grind this size feed. In Charge 3, represented in The estimated best top ball size for this 1000 From the grinding tests carried out on 55, 100, 500 and 1000 As can be seen in The shape of the distributions however, has changed over the duration of the grind. From This may be a good method for determining the charge top size relating to feed size as it demonstrates the size above which little grinding occurs. Further investigation of different work index ores and a comparison of the grinding rate of the individual size fractions, would delineate the particle size at which grinding becomes inefficient with the ball size used. This would indicate the feed size above which the ball size should not be used if efficient grinding is desired. The operating work index for each 5 Plots of the operating work index against the The operating work index analysis identified the change in efficiency which is thought to occur when grinding of individual crystal grain boundaries dominates over grinding of the matrix, typically between 20 and 30 The grinding test work carried out for this investigation was aimed at identifying trends in the energy consumption in fine grinding situations. Analysis of the results from these grinding tests has identified the following: Efficient grind curves for fine grinding form the same shape as those for traditional ball mill grinding (exponential decay). Small balls are most suited for fine feeds, while larger balls are suited to coarse feeds. Small media is the most efficient at generating fine particles, but is inefficient and unsuitable for breaking large particles. The most efficient top size balls for fine grinding appeared to be smaller than those predicted by Bond’s ball sizing formula. Operating work index analysis confirms the above results. Operating work index analysis identifying the change from grinding of the particle matrix to that of the crystal grain boundary at between 20 and 30 The possibility of using the size distribution curves over the duration of the grind to predict the feed size at which a ball charge becomes ineffective and inefficient.
