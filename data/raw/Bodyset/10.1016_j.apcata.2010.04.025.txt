This work involves the synthesis of composite three-way catalytic (TWC) washcoats consisting of 80wt% of γ-alumina as the main supporting material, promoted with 20wt% of ceria based solid solution. Pt in low loading (0.5wt%) was employed as the only active phase. Washcoats varying in the solid solution composition (Ce

                     ), prepared by coprecipitation, are comparatively investigated in an attempt to elucidate the effect of Ce, Zr and La oxide promoters on the catalytic activity and thermal durability. For this purpose, catalytic activity measurements as well as detailed structural and morphological evaluations (differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, oxygen storage capacity and DRIFTS analyses) were carried out before and after thermal aging in oxidative atmosphere. The catalytic performance was studied in loaded cordierite monoliths (TWCs form) under simulated exhaust conditions at the stoichiometric point. Doping ceria with Zr and La cation proved beneficial for both catalytic performance and thermal durability of the washcoat, with Ce0.4Zr0.5La0.1O1.9/γ-Al2O3/Pt sample presenting the optimum properties. The catalytic behavior is discussed based on oxygen storage capacity, noble metal dispersion and textural characteristics of the examined samples.Air pollution from automotive emissions still remains a major environmental problem. Nowadays, three-way catalytic converters employ a well established technology for the abatement of NO The continuously increasing release of harmful emissions from the automotive engines rendered more strict emission control standards. The biggest challenge, in order to reach the new standards, is the conversion of pollutants during the period of the cold start emission. To this line, effort has been made to locate TWCs closer to the engine. As a result washcoat materials with enhanced thermal stability (stable to temperatures up to ∼1000 Further improvement of the catalytic properties and thermal stability can be attained by the addition of trivalent cations M For operation at elevated temperatures a new generation of composite catalytic washcoat was developed consisting of alumina and CZ solid solution In our previous works Ce, Zr and La oxide promoters were found to strongly enhance Pt/Al Catalytic powders with five different compositions were prepared by simultaneous coprecipitation. In each case the catalytic support consisted of 80 In order to verify that the proportion of 80 For the addition of the active phase (Pt), the supports, in the form of powders, were impregnated in an aqueous solution of Pt(NH For the washcoat preparation, stabilized slurries with 15 The aging treatment was performed on fresh samples (powder and monoliths) in a muffle furnace in static air at normal atmospheric pressure for a period of 5 Before acquisition of the catalytic activity measurements, the monolithic samples were heated in flowing He (400 The X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer using nickel-filtered CuKα1 radiation (=1.54056 The nitrogen adsorption isotherms and BET surface areas were measured at 77 The thermal behavior of the two samples was examined in the temperature range 30–1300 Ultimate OSC was examined via thermogravimetry, with a Diamond Pyris (PERKIN ELMER) instrument, by monitoring the samples weight changes under cyclic heat treatment in flowing air. The heat cycle consisted of a first heat treatment up to 800 In the present study the Pt dispersion was evaluated by a DRIFTS-aided method based on CO chemisorption, as described in detail in our previous report Catalytic activity measurements were carried out in a 300 Air Liquide certified gas mixtures 7.83% NO in He, 10.1% CO in He, 10% C The redox characteristic of the simulated gas mixture was identified by the stoichiometric number The reactor inlet and outlet were analyzed using an on-line chemiluminescence NO The conversion performance of TWCs specimens was studied by increasing the reactor temperature in the interval of 50–550 Further, to test if the washcoating procedure affects the activity of catalytic powders, indicative (but not systematic) catalytic performance tests were performed on powder materials under similar reaction conditions as described above for the washcoated monoliths. Similar results were obtained in both cases (i.e., powder or washcoated monolith of the same chemical composition), implying that the intrinsic micro-structural characteristics of powder catalysts remain practically unaffected after washcoating. Differential thermal analysis was conducted in order to study the effect of the different oxide promoters in alumina's thermal stability. In As it can be observed from The XRD patterns of Pt/A, Pt/AC, Pt/ACZ, Pt/ACZL and Pt/ACL samples calcined in the temperature range of 600–1100 Upon thermal aging at elevated temperatures, structural modifications in all samples are displayed, which mainly involve the transformation of γ-alumina and the appearance of Pt In the case of the unpromoted sample Pt/A, heat treatment at 900 As it can be deduced from It is also worth mentioning the lack of detection of a pure lanthana or a zirconia-rich phase (phase of a t-symmetry) despite the elevated heating temperature. This fact, combined with the symmetrical shape of ceria's shifted peaks retained in the temperature range 800–1000 However, further increase of calcination temperature at 1100 As it can be derived, XRD results are in good agreement with DTA analysis, proving the beneficial effect of the oxide promoters’ addition in the thermal stability of alumina washcoat with the following sequence observed: Pt/ACL It is well known that introduction of lanthanide cations, like La In our case alumina's washcoat stabilization can be mainly ascribed to the presence of a small amount of lanthanum, possibly not fully incorporated into ceria lattice during coprecipitation, in a highly dispersed form covering the alumina surface, rather than to the formation of perovskite lanthanum aluminate phase. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that no other lanthanum containing structure besides ceria based solid solution was detected by XRD analysis. The crystallite sizes of the oxide promoters’ solid solutions as a function of calcination temperature are presented in Summarizing the findings of the XRD analysis it can be derived that Zr The evolution of textural characteristics (BET surface area and pore volume) of catalytic samples as the calcination temperature increases (from 600 to 900 Regarding the BET surface area ( These results are consistent with differential pore size distributions, PSDs ( To conclude, textural characteristics are significantly improved by the addition of the oxide promoters in the alumina washcoat; an open pore structure and high Noble metal dispersion is considered as a property of major importance for the performance of a catalytic system, as it refers to the metallic surface area available for surface catalytic reactions. In catalytic systems, where the supporting material consists of a mixed carrier with significant amounts of CeO The values of Pt dispersion of the five catalytic samples at the fresh state and after thermal treatment at 900 The enhanced dispersion of the active phase when significant amounts of ceria are introduced into the catalytic carrier is explained by means of noble metal–support interactions. Several studies have addressed ceria's ability to stabilize Pt in a high oxidation state under aging in oxidative atmosphere preventing severe sintering phenomena A thermogravimetry method, already reported in the literature Textural or morphological differentiations cannot account for the observed differences among the OSC values of the promoted samples, since the La- or Zr-doped samples (Pt/ACL, Pt/ACZ and Pt/ACZL) which display superior OSC behavior at the fresh state they also possess similar specific surface area values and particle sizes with the pure ceria–alumina sample (Pt/AC) which yields the lowest OSC values. The small impact of surface area on total OSC is expected given that the total OSC is referred as the amount of oxygen thermodynamically available under redox reactions Based on the above remarks it can be derived that the total OSC is mainly influenced by the nature of the dopant cations which strongly alter the bulk oxygen diffusion. The highest oxygen storage capacity of the samples Pt/ACZ and Pt/ACZL obtained at both calcination temperatures can be attributed to the induced structural defects (Frenkel-type anion defects) by Zr  The results of the catalytic activity of the thermally aged samples, subjected to heat treatment at 900 The practical merit of as prepared fresh Pt-only TWCs can be revealed from Analogous results concerning the catalytic performance of the aged commercial and Pt/ACZL TWCs are depicted in From the extensive investigation of this work and by correlating the morphological, structural properties, oxygen storage capacity and metal dispersion with the catalytic performance, very useful remarks can be attained. Based on the results of DTA, XRD and N On the other hand, significant variations in total oxygen storage capacity and metal dispersion values are detected among the modified catalytic samples. By comparing the catalytic performance with noble metal dispersion it can be realized that the latter is not an important parameter in this case, since sample Pt/AC which exhibits almost two-fold Pt dispersion values compared to samples Pt/ACZ and Pt/ACZL, at both calcination temperatures, yields much lower activity. Although, the number of active sites per g of catalyst (or equivalently the metal dispersion) is in principle a crucial factor for its conversion activity, it seems here that other factors have a more pronounced role. Obviously electronic type interactions between metal and support (metal–support interactions), resulting in more active sites in terms of their turnover frequency (TOF), could be taken here into account Finally, regarding Pt/ACL sample it should be noted that it provides higher activity and thermal stability at 900 In the present study, the important role of Ce, Zr and La oxide modifiers on Pt/Al Comparison of the catalytic performances of the optimal Pt/ACZL with a commercial bimetallic (Pt/Rh) TWC with 4.5-fold higher metal loading under realistic simulated exhaust conditions containing H The authors acknowledge financial support of this work by the
