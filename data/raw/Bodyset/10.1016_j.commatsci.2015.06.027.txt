In the paper “Application of the distinct element method and the extended finite element method in modelling cracks and coalescence in brittle materials” by Mansour Sharafisafa, Zeinab Aliabadian, Ali Mortazavi (Computational Materials Science 91 (2015) 102–121, doi: 10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.04.006), due to this reason that this work was totally done in the Department of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran, Iran) and by Mansour Sharafisafa, Zeinab Aliabadian and Ali Mortazavi, we would like to change the authorship of the paper to reflect real contribution to the work. The authors apologize for this oversight.
