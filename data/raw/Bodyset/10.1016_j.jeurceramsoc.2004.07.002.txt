Low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) materials with a sintering temperature of <900°C were developed using rare earth derived borate glass (La2O3–B2O3–TiO2) and a conventional BNT (BaO–Nd2O3–TiO2) ceramic. The sintering behavior, phase evaluation, sintered morphology, and microwave dielectric properties were investigated. It was found that increasing the sintering temperature from 750 to 850°C led to increases in shrinkage and microwave dielectric properties (≈20 for ɛ

The final crystal phases of the sintered samples were identified as HT-LaBO3 and TiO2.Due to the limited sintering temperature capability of metal electrodes such as Ag or Cu, low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCCs) with sintering temperature below 900 Compared with liquid phase sintering and low-melting glass frits in which the glass phase remains, another approach using a ‘glass-ceramic’ produces different results since glass frits crystallize during the sintering stage. The advantages offered by this glass-ceramic approach include shape stability after sintering, improved dielectric properties, mechanical strength and controlled thermal expansivity. Given this background with glass-ceramics, in this study the glass composition La The starting ceramic material used was a commercial BNT (BaO–Nd The bulk density of the sintered samples was determined by the Archimedes method. The glass transition temperature ( The formation of all glasses studied, based on La To confirm whether the glass frits could properly fuse with the ceramic materials while keeping the temperature below 900 The overall conclusion regarding this LBT glass composition is that the glass showed a low viscosity characteristic, as shown by low As shown in According to the DTA result in To study the interaction between LBT glass materials and BNT ceramics (60:40 As shown in the thermally etched microstructure images ( In the magnified backscattered images ( Regarding porosity and pore size distribution, as the sintering temperature increased the intrusion of Hg gradually decreased, which meant the rapid reduction of porosity in the sintered samples ( The density of the composites (sintered samples) ranged from 4.0 to 4.2 The XRD results, in  The change of dielectric constant is attributed to the crystal phases occurrence particularly the HT-LaBO This study is a preliminary investigation of the LBT glass and BNT ceramic composite material and will be continued by bringing in different ceramic materials, in order to achieve more applicable microwave dielectric properties.
