Copper selenide (Cu2Se) is a simple binary compound which exhibits very fascinating thermoelectric properties, due to which it has been widely studied till very recently. This work highlights that the doping in Cu2Se only affect the electronic transport while the thermal transport is not significantly influenced due to the liquid like dynamics of the Cu ions in the lattice that results in significant thermal instabilities to an extent that the effect of doping is negligible. Our experiments show that an enhanced ZT ~1.6  at 860 K was achieved in Mg-doped Cu2Se, synthesized employing a facile single-step reactive spark plasma sintering technique, which is both fast and scalable. The experimental results indicate that Mg-doping in Cu2Se leads to a significant enhancement in its electrical conductivity, which is primarily responsible for the significant improvement in the ZT. However, the lattice thermal conductivity was found to remain relatively unchanged, irrespective of the Mg-doping concentration, which is also in agreement with our DFT calculations.The deployment of thermoelectric generators (TEG) [ Binary Cu This work highlights the enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of Cu Cu The DFT calculations [ Our electronic band structure calculation based on GGA shows a semi-metallic band structure of β-Cu  Temperature dependent electronic transport properties of the pristine and Mg-doped Cu   The plot of thermal conductivity with respect to temperature for the synthesized pristine as well as different Mg-doped Cu Finally, the calculated temperature dependent figure-of-merit (ZT) for the pristine and Mg-doped compositions of Cu In summary, we have explored the possibility of enhancement of the thermoelectric performance of Cu None.
