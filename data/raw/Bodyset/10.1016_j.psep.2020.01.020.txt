The authors regret In Section 3.1 on page 106, it was stated that: “The model obtained from this method is presented in Eq. (5) shows that initial concentration, pH This sentence should be replaced by: “The model obtained from this method is presented in Eq. (6). It shows that initial concentration, pH In Section 3.2 on pages 107 and 108, it was stated that: “According to Fig. 3a and b, the optimal values for response optimization were determined as 50 This sentence should be replaced by: “According to Fig. 3a and b, the optimal values for response optimization were determined as 50 In Section 3.3.1 on page 108, it was stated that: “According to Fig. 1, the removal of HA occurred mostly in the first 10 This sentence should be replaced by: “According to Fig. 2, the removal of HA occurred mostly in the first 10 In Section 2.3 on page 105, it was stated that: “Two L-shaped aluminium electrodes were embedded in the reactor in unipolar mode with an effective surface area of 100 This sentence should be replaced by: “Two L-shaped aluminium electrodes were embedded in the reactor in In Section 3.3.2 on page 109, it was stated that: “At the beginning of the process, the removal efficiency of HA versus time is increased with a steep slope, so that the highest HA removal rate in experiments shown in Fig. 1 occurs at 10 This sentence should be replaced by: “At the beginning of the process, the removal efficiency of HA versus time is increased with a steep slope, so that the highest HA removal rate in experiments shown in Fig. 2 occurs at 10 In Section 3.3.3 on page 109, it was stated: “Moreover, the increase in the removal of HA by increasing the initial pH (pH This sentence should be replaced by: “Moreover, the increase in the removal of HA by increasing the initial pH (pH The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused.
