The present study concerns improving the corrosion resistance of a low alloy–high carbon steel by plasma nitriding in pulsed direct current glow discharge mode at an applied voltage of 540–710 V with 3–6 A current in the temperature range 450–560 °C for a time period of 1–5 h. The phases formed after nitriding is mostly γ′-Fe4N with a small volume fraction of ε-Fe3N/Fe2N. Nitride volume fraction increases with nitriding time and temperature. Corrosion study reveals that plasma nitriding significantly improves the corrosion resistance in terms of corrosion potential, corrosion current density and resistance to polarization. This improvement is attributed to both formation of solid solution and nitrides on the surface.Plasma nitriding is a plasma assisted thermo-chemical surface treatment that involves diffusion of nitrogen in the target-surface leading to formation of nitrogen rich solid solution and nitrides Discs of 20 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness were cut from spheroidized annealed SAE 52100 steel bar with composition: 1.05% C; 0.15% Si; 0.3% Mn; 1.65% Cr; and balance Fe (in wt.%). The surface of the samples was ground and polished using 0.25 μm diamond paste and then thoroughly rinsed with acetone before plasma nitriding. Subsequently, the samples were sputter cleaned at around 250 °C in 65%H Plasma nitriding was carried out in a pulsed d.c. glow discharge mode for 1, 3 and 5 h at 450, 500 and 560 °C. For achieving these parameters, 540–710 V d.c. bias, 10 kHz pulse frequency, 66% duty cycle, 0.50–0.65 l/s flow rate (of 65%H After plasma nitriding, samples were subjected to a detailed microstructural investigation on the top surface by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To confirm the microstructural evolution in terms of identification of the phases, samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using Co Phase evolution in plasma nitriding was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.  The nitrided samples were exposed to potentiodynamic polarization tests in a 3.56 wt.% NaCl solution to study the mechanism and kinetics of anodic dissolution. The corresponding polarization diagrams are presented in Similar trend was also observed when nitriding was carried out for 1 and 5 h. The corrosion improvement phenomena can be attributed to the presence of a dense nitride layer on the surface. As nitride is a noble phase, formation of more nitride helps to cover the surface from corrosion attack and for this reason with increase in nitriding time or temperature corrosion resistance improve. As the amount of nitride increases, from nitride dispersion the surface layer slowly turns toward monolithic nature. After 5 h of nitriding at 560 °C the improvement is manifold as the coverage by nitrides is maximum at that parameter.
