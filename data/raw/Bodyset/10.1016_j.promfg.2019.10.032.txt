Performance, energy efficiency and moderate use of natural resources play a very important role in the development of modern systems. This can be applied to any type of vehicle, industrial machinery and buildings, among others. Often, innovative materials act as pioneers for the implementation of new technologies. In many cases, high-performance components can no longer be designed using a single material or a certain class of material. Currently, in order to take full advantage of the specific properties of the materials, different materials are usually used in the manufacture of a component, especially in the field of design using light materials. If these combinations of materials are insoluble compounds, they are called multi-material design products or hybrid structures and they have their own design and manufacturing methods. If the discussion is specifically focused on the field of hybrid components design by means of the use of lightweight materials, the lightweight materials used today are very diverse, including all plastics and metals. Therefore, the number of potential hybrid components is very large and, in recent years, the number of studies dedicated to them has continuously increased. The objective of this article is to analyze their trends, including types of hybrid combinations, materials used to form multi-material components, technologies applied, most studied topics and main tests carried out to characterize them. In addition, another goal is to serve as a useful tool to other researchers in their search for works and data related to lightweight hybrid materials.
