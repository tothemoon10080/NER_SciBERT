The outcomes of pediatric talus fractures have been minimally reported in published studies. The purpose of the present retrospective study was to determine the clinical and radiographic outcomes after talus fractures in pediatric and adolescent patients and to define the differences among the different age groups in this population. A total of 52 children and adolescents (54 fractures) with 24 type 1 (44.44%), 13 type 2 (24.07%), 8 type 3 (14.81%), and 9 type 4 (16.67%) Marti-Weber fractures were considered. Of the 52 patients, 19 (35.19%; 21 talus fractures) with follow-up data available for >12 months were included in the final study population. Of the 21 fractures, 9 (42.86 %) were type 1, 4 (19.05%) were type 2, 1 (4.76%) was type 3, and 7 (33.33%) were type 4. The mean patient age was 14.7 (range 4 to 18) years. The patients were divided into 3 age groups: group 1, age ≤11.9 years; group 2, age 12.0 to 15.8 years; and group 3, age 16.1 to 18.0 years. Of the 21 fractures, 3 (14.29%) were treated nonoperatively and 18 (85.71%) operatively. The overall mean follow-up duration was 40.3 (range 14 to 95) months. The outcomes of interest included fracture nonunion, talar avascular necrosis, ankle range of motion, pain, arthrosis, and arthrodesis. After treatment, the mean ankle range of motion was 20° (range 0° to 35°) of dorsiflexion and 40° (range 0° to 45°) of plantarflexion. Complications included persistent pain in 10 fractures (47.62%), 3 cases of nonunion (14.29%), 3 cases of avascular necrosis (14.29%; of which, 1 [4.76%] required ankle and subtalar fusion), and arthrosis developing in ≥1 surrounding joint in 12 fractures (57.14%). Of the 12 fractures in group 3, 9 (75.00%) developed arthrosis and 2 (16.67%) subsequently required arthrodesis. Our observations suggest that the incidence of displaced talus fractures, as well as complications, increases with patient age.With an incidence of 0.08%, fractures of the talus are rarely seen in the pediatric population The purpose of our study was to evaluate the talus fracture patterns and treatments in children and adolescents and to determine the incidence of infection, nonunion, AVN, OD, arthrosis, and arthrodesis in young patients. The present study was a retrospective, exploratory medical record review at a single large private orthopedic practice associated with a level 1 academic trauma center. The institutional review board approved the study. We searched our institution's electronic medical records for Current Procedural Terminology codes 28430, 28445, 28400 for a study period from March 2002 to June 2011 (9 years, 4 months). We identified 52 children with 54 fractures of the talus. The inclusion criteria were fractures of the os talus, patient age ≤18 years, and follow-up data available for ≥1 year. Patients with follow-up data for <1 year were excluded. The patients were subdivided into 3 different age groups to distinguish the adolescents from the children: group 1, age ≤11.9 years; group 2, age 12.0 to 15.8 years; and group 3, age 16.1 to 18.0 years. Group 1 included children in whom the growth of the foot skeleton was ongoing. At the age of 12 years, this growth will have been completed in 88% to 96% of children All the patients were treated and followed up by experienced specialist-trained trauma surgeons. A combination of nonoperative and operative approaches was used to treat this group of young patients, and the surgeon determined the choice of treatment. Treatment indications were decided in accordance with the surgeon's best knowledge and experience. The decision to allow the patients to begin weightbearing depended on the fracture pattern, articular extension, comminution, open fracture, operative or conservative treatment, and the presence of associated injuries and was determined at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Data abstraction was performed from all available medical records and radiographs by 3 of us (C.K., T.S., C.B.J.). The patient demographic data, mechanism of injury, and associated injuries were recorded. The fracture types, healing, alignment, and articular congruity were evaluated with radiographic imaging using plain films or digitally using the picture archiving and communication system (Kodak Carestream PACS 2006; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). All available radiographs and progress reports were analyzed. Fractures were classified according to the Marti-Weber system Descriptive statistics were completed by 2 of us (D.L.S., C.K.). Nominal variables were evaluated using the χ A total of 19 children and adolescents with 21 fractures had follow-up data available for >12 months and were included in the study. The mean follow-up duration was 40.3 (range 14 to 95) months. The demographic data, patient age, and mechanism of injury are presented in Three fractures (14.29%), including 2 Marti-Weber type 1 fractures (patients aged 12 and 16 years) and 1 type 2 fracture (6-year-old child), were treated nonoperatively with cast or walker immobilization. The remaining 18 fractures (85.71%) underwent operative treatment. Of these 18 fractures, 15 (71.43%) underwent open reduction and internal plate (8 [38.10%]) and/or screw (7 [33.33%]) fixation. External fixation was performed in 1 fracture (4.76%), Kirschner wire fixation in 1 (4.76%), and subchondral drilling in 1 (4.76%). Irrigation and wound and fracture debridement were performed in both open fractures (9.52%). One of the open fractures, caused by a lawnmower, required repeat irrigation and debridement with vacuum-assisted closure until final wound healing. The patients with 15 of the 18 operatively treated fractures (83.33%) started weightbearing as tolerated after a mean average of 14.4 (range 6 to 30) weeks. These fractures were deemed radiographically and clinically united after a mean duration of 15.2 (range 6 to 26) weeks. The 3 patients with the nonoperatively treated fractures started weightbearing as tolerated after a mean duration of 6 (range 5 to 8) weeks. These fractures were deemed radiographically and clinically healed after a mean duration of 11 (range 10 to 12) weeks. Most of the fractures (14 [66.67%]) had been caused by high-energy trauma ( Patient 1 was a 12-year-old female with an osteochondral talar dome fracture treated using open reduction and internal screw fixation, which healed primarily. It was not until the patient had twisted her ankle 2 years after the first injury that she experienced the second osteochondral talar dome fracture. The second injury was treated nonoperatively and progressed to symptomatic nonunion, for which osteochondral allograft transplantation was required 1.5 years after the second injury. At 1 year after transplantation of the allograft, the child was asymptomatic with a full ankle ROM ( Patient 2 was a 12-year-old male with an osteochondral talar dome fracture that was treated nonoperatively with non-weightbearing and cast immobilization for 8 weeks. The fracture appeared to have healed; however, 1 year after the injury, the patient became symptomatic without additional trauma, and nonunion was diagnosed on a plain film. Subsequently, subchondral drilling was performed, which resulted in resolution of symptoms and a return to all activities at 4 months after the procedure. At 1.5 years postoperatively, the patient's radiographs showed that the fracture had healed, although the patient complained of mild ankle discomfort. Patient 3 was an 18-year-old male with a Hawkins type 3 talar neck fracture, which was primarily treated with open reduction and plate fixation. The patient subsequently required hardware removal, revision open reduction and plate fixation, and bone grafting for nonunion 10 months after the first surgery. The patient started weightbearing as tolerated 3 months after the second operation and voiced complaints of mild pain. Two years after the second surgery, the patient was still experiencing ankle pain, and a talar neck nonunion with radiographic evidence of AVN and tibiotalar and subtalar arthrosis was diagnosed. The painful ankle was stabilized with a brace, and further operative intervention was considered. Of the 4 osteochondral talar dome fractures, 2 (50.00%) developed nonunion ( In 12 fractures (57.14%), 5 tibiotalar (23.81%), 8 subtalar (38.10%), and 5 talonavicular (23.81%) joints demonstrated mild to severe signs of arthrosis. One ankle fusion (4.76%) and one subtalar plus ankle fusion (4.76%) were present ( The mean ankle ROM averaged 18.6° (range 0° to 35°) of dorsiflexion and 36.2° (range 0° to 45°) of plantarflexion. Eight subtalar joints (38.10%) had <50% ROM. The occurrence of pain was reported for 10 fractures (47.62%; permanent 2 [9.52%]; startup, 2 [9.52%]; or activity related, 6 [28.57%]) at the final follow-up examination. Pain medication was used by 4 patients (19.05%) on a regular basis; 3 (14.29%) used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and 1 (4.76%) required narcotic medication. Because of the central role of the talus within the 3 major joints of the hindfoot, a fracture of the talus is a severe and complex injury. Complications such as AVN, posttraumatic arthrosis, and residual pain have been well described in studies of adult patients The purpose of our study was to evaluate the talar fracture patterns and treatment as they relate to resultant infection, nonunion, AVN, arthrosis, and arthrodesis and the clinical outcomes in pediatric and adolescent patients, stratified by age. Three age groups were constructed to distinguish the children from the adolescents. Because growth is slightly different for every child, we included a transition group. In a study by Eberl et al Overall, most (18 [85.71%]) of the fractures were treated operatively, including 3 in group 1 (75.00%), 3 in group 2 (60.00%), and 12 in group 3 (100.00%). Also, most nondisplaced (Marti-Weber 1 and 2) fractures (10 [76.92%]) had undergone operative treatment, a much greater rate than previously reported. In a long-term follow-up study by Jensen et al Nonunion seems to be less common in pediatric talus fractures. One nonunion, 3% of their study population, was described by Smith et al In studies of adult patients, increasing talus neck fracture displacement correlates with increasing rates of talar dome blood supply disruption or devastating ANV The final follow-up ROM was acceptable with 20° of dorsiflexion and 40° of plantarflexion in our study population. However, because of the patients' youth, the long-term outcomes with possible reductions in mobility, increasing pain, the development arthrosis, and requirements for arthrodesis are likely but not predicable at this point. Further reevaluation 15 to 2o years after trauma would be necessary. The limitations of our study population relate to the inherent problems of retrospective evaluations. Furthermore, clinical outcome surveys such as the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score and long-term evaluations would be beneficial. The high rates of AVN, arthrosis, and arthrodesis could have produced bias because the patients with a symptomatic foot might be more likely to return for follow-up examinations than asymptomatic patients. In conclusion, our study results suggest that pediatric and adolescent talus fractures are severe injuries with high rates of nonunion, AVN, osteoarthritis, and arthrodesis. In general, older children and adolescents were more likely to sustain displaced talus fractures caused by high-energy trauma. They, therefore, had greater rates of posttraumatic changes and disabilities compared with the younger children, who were more likely to present with nondisplaced talus fractures.
