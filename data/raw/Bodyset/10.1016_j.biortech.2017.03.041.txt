The aim of this work was to study the ability of using Hydrocabonoclastic native microbial and Spongiochloris sp microalgae in airlift bioreactors couples in order to restore hydrocarbons wastewater and develop the capacity of natural systems to reduce greenhouse effect through maximal control of CO2 gas emission in atmosphere. The kinetic parameters of CO2 gas fixation level and conversion it into biological material by microalgae as the biodegradation process effect in hydrocarbon have been evaluated.
                  The result present that maximum specific growth rate μmax of Spongiochloris sp was (0.87±0.04day−1) and the biomass productivity Pmax was attended (1.5±0.3gL−1
                     day−1) with maximal CO2 biofixation rate RCO2 (2.9205gL−1
                     day−1). At 30°C and pH (7.6–7.4) the bioreactor showed a good wastewater removal efficiency (99.18%) in total hydrocarbons with COD stabilized within (1.30g/L), this result obtained suggesting that, the bioreactor applied system represented a useful strategy for maximizing CO2 bio-mitigation.In the world, the continuously control of carbon dioxide emission gas is very important due to environmental, economic and social demands. Total Emissions in 2014 around 6870 Million Metric Tons of CO Serval techniques were regarded and approved by deferent countries to limit dioxide carbon amount gas emissions ( There were many reports which confirmed that aerobic heterotrophic bacteria with cyanobacteria consortia effaces for mineralize petroleum contaminated sites ( Under optimized conditions the current CO This study focused on the adoptive and application of sustainable, environmentally microcosm design technologies that demonstrate a perspective ecosystem. It was implicating to develop the capacity of natural systems to restore organic hydrocarbons contaminant, reduce greenhouse effect through maximal control of CO Contaminated wastewater samples used in the experiments were obtained from a petrochemical industry, sampling zone situated in the north of Tunisia, the zone was previously polluted owing to petroleum storage tanks, principally diesel hydrocarbons. All the collected samples were stored at 4 The biodegradation process of petroleum wastewater compounds was established in green microcosm ( A master flex air pump poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene (PTFE) tubing was used to aspirate the CO At the same time, another pump aspirated the O The bioreactor system was evaluated through deferent analytical analysis, all physicochemical, biological and characterization analysis of petroleum wastewater used for experiment to be studied were achieved agreeing to the AFNOR norms ( The hydrocarbon wastewater was characterized by a pH of 8.3 In this experiments a green microalgae The maximum biomass productivity P Cc is the carbon content of microalgae cells at the end of treatment (% Many Factors influenced petroleum compounds mineralization, the hydrocarbon amount evaluated during treatment was regarded to determine the viability of bioremediation system ( In order to determine total hydrocarbon amount, 20 The hydrocarbon amount content of the purified extract was dosed by infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transforms (SIR MAGNA-IR-560 dual beam FTIR (Nicolet)), agreeing to French standard (NF T 90-114). According to the spectra, the removal efficiency R (%) can be determinate by using the following in Eq.    The aerobic heterotrophic bacteria was determined by using plate count method on nutrient agar medium and it was incubated at T The Citizen's Guide to Bioremediation( At the beginning of treatment phase, the pH value showed an increase that exceeded the value of 8.3 and then was stabilized around the value 8.1 ( Moreover, humidity and soil temperature influenced the kinetics of petroleum wastewater compounds mineralization throughout the biodegradation process. Microbial reactions in wastewater comprised enzymatic and biochemical processes correlated to temperature. The optimal temperature depended on the volatility and the hydrocarbons solubility pollutants that been treated. According to ( During treatment the system was stabilized and showed a good biomass production at an optimal level in performance of purification through COD reduction which was obtained. The average of COD residual concentration was stabilized within 1.30 The analyses of total hydrocarbon concentration (HTP) in the experimental bioreactor with contaminated waste water that was performed, was one of the important parameters to confirm the removal efficiency during bioremediation treatment process. In the first 30 The results indicated that the biodegradation rate was increased effectively there was a decreasing in TPH concentration, it was reduced from 110.52 Biomass profile changing within the bioreactor showed that the values of the MVS were improved during a first treatment period, these values ranged to 3.75 The result confirmed that during the treatment of wastewater a reactor which stimulated by oxygen gas that was generated by algal biomass, there was a period of progressive growth and a period of adjustment during which microorganisms could assimilate the co-products of hydrocarbons degradation. This was ensured by using the co-products of biodegradation as new carbon sources. Moreover, the oxygen quantity generated by microalgae in wastewater was absorbed by bacterial population as active factor in ecosystem biodegradation cycling ( The Moreover, this investigation confirmed that the cell growth of green micro-algae involved three competing cellular processes that were photosynthesis, photorespiration and dark respiration. In the experiment, algal photosynthesis afforded oxygen, key electron acceptor to the pollutant degraded by heterotrophic bacteria as well as produced co-metabolism phenomenon ( The elemental composition of This study showed that, the CO The first author would like to acknowledge Ministry of Higher Education (
