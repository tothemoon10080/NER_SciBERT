SUMMARY
               The Bilboquet implant is an intramedullary device designed for osteosynthesis of complex proximal humeral fractures and one of its features is that it can be converted to hemiarthroplasty. Its use by the instigator since the early 90s, has showed mechanical efficiency and almost constant healing of tuberosities. Avascular necrosis was observed in one third of the cases in the worst category of fracture, but those avascular necroses were clinically well tolerated and there was seldom need for conversion to hemiarthroplasty. Although these results were confirmed by other surgical teams, one may wonder why such a useful device has not gained popularity. A simplified surgical technique was developed and used since 2004 and the results of a study of 20 patients operated on by this procedure are presented. Fortified by an age related Constant score of 87%, we present a new design of the Bilboquet implant based on the experience of the modified surgical technique.
