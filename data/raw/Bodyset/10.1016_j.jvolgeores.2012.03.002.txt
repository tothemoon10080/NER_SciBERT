The 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, provided a rare opportunity to compare satellite measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with airborne SO2 measurements by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). Herein we: (1) compare OMI and airborne SO2 column density values for Redoubt's tropospheric plume, (2) calculate daily SO2 masses from Mount Redoubt for the first three months of the eruption, (3) develop simple methods to convert daily measured SO2 masses into emission rates to allow satellite data to be directly integrated with the airborne SO2 emissions dataset, (4) calculate cumulative SO2 emissions from the eruption, and (5) evaluate OMI as a monitoring tool for high-latitude degassing volcanoes. A linear correlation (R2
                     ~0.75) is observed between OMI and airborne SO2 column densities. OMI daily SO2 masses for the sample period ranged from ~60.1kt on 24 March to below detection limit, with an average daily SO2 mass of ~6.7kt. The highest SO2 emissions were observed during the initial part of the explosive phase and the emissions exhibited an overall decreasing trend with time. OMI SO2 emission rates were derived using three methods and compared to airborne measurements. This comparison yields a linear correlation (R2
                     ~0.82) with OMI-derived emission rates consistently lower than airborne measurements. The comparison results suggest that OMI's detection limit for high latitude, springtime conditions varies from ~2000 to 4000t/d. Cumulative SO2 masses calculated from daily OMI data for the sample period are estimated to range from 542 to 615kt, with approximately half of this SO2 produced during the explosive phase of the eruption. These cumulative masses are similar in magnitude to those estimated for the 1989–90 Redoubt eruption. Strong correlations between daily OMI SO2 mass and both tephra mass and acoustic energy during the explosive phase of the eruption suggest that OMI data may be used to infer relative eruption size and explosivity. Further, when used in conjunction with complementary datasets, OMI daily SO2 masses may be used to help distinguish explosive from effusive activity and identify changes in lava extrusion rates. The results of this study suggest that OMI is a useful volcano monitoring tool to complement airborne measurements, capture explosive SO2 emissions, and provide high temporal resolution SO2 emissions data that can be used with interdisciplinary datasets to illuminate volcanic processes.Measurements of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) is responsible for monitoring over 50 historically active volcanoes ( The 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska (60.4852°N, 152.7438°W, 3108 In this manuscript we compare SO The first observations of unrest leading up to the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano occurred late in July 2008 when AVO geologists conducting fieldwork on Mount Redoubt's edifice smelled H Airborne and satellite-based UV remote sensing can be used to retrieve the abundance of SO Since the 1990s COSPEC ( Airborne measurements are not collected during explosive eruptions due to: (1) the hazards associated with flying near a volcano during an explosive eruption ( OMI is a hyperspectral UV and visible satellite sensor aboard NASA's Aura spacecraft that measures atmospheric abundances of several trace gas species, including SO Since mid-2008, OMI measurements have been affected by a dynamic radiance anomaly, known as the ‘row anomaly’ ( Validation of OMI SO Our comparisons between the high spatial resolution airborne measurements of SO This equation attempts to correct for the spatial differences between the airborne and OMI datasets, allowing these different measurements to be directly compared ( Accurate plume altitudes from Redoubt Volcano are constrained via airborne methods. The average plume altitude during the effusive phase of the eruption for days with supporting airborne measurements was 3.8 Measurements of SO OMI images are “snapshots” of SO We developed three simple algorithms to convert the OMI measured SO In In  The OMI-derived emission rates calculated using the three methods were compared to airborne SO The study period for comparison of OMI and airborne SO The data used in the comparison between OMI measured and corrected airborne SO The data used in the comparison between OMI measured and corrected airborne SO No improvement in linear correlation, average percent difference, or standard deviation was observed from using the optimal dataset, with the exception of a small decrease in average percent difference for the The average airborne SO OMI detected SO Daily OMI-derived Airborne SO Airborne SO OMI's emission rate detection limit for high latitude springtime conditions was estimated using observations of the maximum SO Daily OMI SO Several aspects of OMI's temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and sensitivity to SO There are two main challenges in using OMI data for this study that are unique to OMI and/or UV sensors in general. First OMI's row anomaly often truncated plumes within the OMI image, frequently limiting the number of usable daily images of Mount Redoubt's plume to one. Secondly, as a consequence of Redoubt Volcano's high latitude location and resultant high solar zenith angles in winter months, significant UV attenuation contributed to relatively low signal to noise in early spring images ( Throughout this study we compare OMI satellite to airborne COSPEC SO There are several challenges in comparing OMI and airborne CDs that can contribute to deviations from a linear relationship. First, the temporal and spatial differences between OMI and airborne methods along with the variability of Mount Redoubt's emissions make direct comparison between these measurements challenging. OMI acquires an image of Mount Redoubt's plume in less than one minute, while a representative number of airborne plume traverses (5–7) may take over 1 A second concern related to the spatial variability between the OMI and airborne datasets is due to the relatively small plume size compared to the OMI pixel size. Of the 16 pixels analyzed, the highest plume pixel fraction was 0.73, and the average plume pixel fraction was 0.27. The calculation designed to account for the spatial differences between OMI pixels and airborne measurements ( Third, as shown by the CD comparison analysis, OMI CD values are strongly dependent on the selected plume CMA algorithm, indicating that accurate plume altitude and thickness constraints are critical to accurate OMI CD retrieval. Discrepancies between the actual plume CMA and the assumed CMA used in the Finally, spatial variations in and deviations from the assumed atmospheric conditions at Redoubt Volcano, specifically with respect to total ozone column, surface reflectivity, cloud cover, solar zenith angle, presence of ash and/or aerosols, etc. will contribute to uncertainties in OMI CDs. For conditions similar to those observed at Redoubt Volcano (unpolluted atmosphere with CDs less than 100 A comparison between the percent difference between OMI ( The above uncertainties in OMI and corrected airborne SO The above uncertainties in OMI and corrected airborne SO We expect the error in the OMI SO Variable background noise in the acquired OMI SO Another challenge in calculating daily SO These various factors can contribute to uncertainties in the daily OMI SO Each of the emission rate calculation methods has advantages and disadvantages with respect to temporal resolution, processing time required, and measurement uncertainties. The uncertainties in the OMI-derived emission rates will include the uncertainties associated with SO Because all three emission rate methods use plume speed in their calculations, the aforementioned plume speed uncertainties ( While there are clear sources of positive and negative error in the OMI-derived emission rates, the observations suggest that in most cases these values are lower than airborne measurements. Overall differences between OMI-derived and airborne emission rates are on average − While there are clear sources of positive and negative error in the OMI-derived emission rates, the observations suggest that in most cases these values are lower than airborne measurements.
