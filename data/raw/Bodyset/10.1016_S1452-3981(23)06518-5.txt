In this investigation, Al-10 wt. %Fe alloy was produced from metallic powders processed using mechanical alloying (MA) technique. The initial powders were processed in a planetary ball mill for 10, 30, 70, 100 and 150 hours at room temperature in an inert atmosphere. The processed powders were consolidated and sintered using a high frequency induction heat sintering (HFIHS) machine to form bulk samples. The consolidation pressure, heating rate, temperature and time of sintering were 50MPa, 823K/min, 823K, 6minutes, respectively. The crystallize size of the bulk samples were calculated from the peak profile obtained through X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The smallest crystallite size was found to be 30nm in the sample obtained from the 150 hours milled powders. The sintered samples were investigated for their corrosion behavior at room temperature in 3.5% NaCl solution through two well-known techniques, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization resistance. The results show that with increase in milling time, the corrosion potential (E
                     corr) moves to a higher positive value with an increase in corrosion current (jcorr)
                  i.e. corrosion resistance decrease.
