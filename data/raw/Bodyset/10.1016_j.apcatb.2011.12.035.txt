                      systems drive a surface dual-site Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction path enabling higher efficiency, different reaction kinetics and “phenol-total organic carbon” conversion relationships in comparison to homogeneous CWAO catalysts [1]. A simplified reaction scheme based on consecutive adsorption and mineralization steps and the relative kinetic analysis show that the former determines the rate of phenol and TOC removal, while the latter controls the selectivity and rate of catalyst fouling. The MnCeO

                      system ensures a fast and complete phenol conversion and a TOC removal higher than 80% at any R, while improved adsorption and mineralization functionalities explain a higher resistance to deactivation by fouling than Pt/CeO2 system.The extraordinary industrial development of the last decades is at the origin of the constantly rising concern on process-waters recycle and disposal of harmfully polluted wastewaters Therefore, this paper is aimed at providing a comparative assessment of the activity and stability patterns of ceria-supported noble metal (Pt/CeO The MnCeO resulting equal to ca. 16% and corresponding to a metal surface area (MSA) of ca.  is always lower than 0.008 (see The reaction was monitored by withdrawing ca. 1 Volatile organic compounds stripped away from the reactor were trapped by bubbling the outlet gaseous flow in a cold (4 The reproducibility of catalytic data with reference to phenol and TOC conversion, CO Thermogravimetric (TGA-DSC) analysis of the “used” Pt/CeO X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the fresh and used catalysts was performed by a XPS spectrometer (Physical Electronics GMBH PHI 5800-01) using a monochromatized Al Kα radiation with a power beam of 250 Surface reactive oxygen availability (SROA) measurements at 150 The CWAO behavior pattern of the Pt/CeO In particular, at The superior CWAO efficiency of the MnCeO For At least, for Notably, no significant leaching of Pt and MnO The systematic gap between TOC conversion and CO All TGA data give a reliable carbon mass-balance ( Then, the changes in the surface chemical composition brought by the reaction medium were probed by a comparative XPS study of the fresh and used catalysts at Although efficiency, mechanism and kinetics of heterogeneous and homogeneous CWAO are still matter of debate Therefore, the catalytic pattern of the studied catalysts is describable by a dual-site Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) path For the sake of simplicity, the re-adsorption and further oxidation of intermediates to CO the surface oxidation of phenol, leading to CO the CO the effects of the parallel steps leading to intermediates and carbon-deposits on the initial rates of phenol adsorption and CO Although the nature of adsorption sites ( was used to fit the experimental phenol concentration ( Although selectivity data in with the rate of CO showing that the apparent kinetic constant of CO With a theoretic limit of 6 corresponding to the maximum number of CO The systematic trends in The functionality of the two systems is further compared in  The MnCeO The performance of noble-metal (Pt/CeO A simplified Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) reaction network based on consecutive phenol The MnCeO The superior CWAO pattern of the MnCeO Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
