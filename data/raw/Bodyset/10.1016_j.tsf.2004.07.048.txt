                  Reason: This article is part of an extreme case of duplicate publication in which the paper, or nearly identical copies of it, has appeared in at least nine other journals. The authors have acknowledged the abuse, which has also been brought to the attention of the responsible administrators at their institutions. Multiple publication represents a flagrant disregard of international copyright law and scientific ethics, it wastes reviewer's and journal staff time, and is also a very poor use of costly journal space which is explicitly reserved for publishing original work. Thin Solid Films takes a strong view on this matter.
