O-(hydroxy isopropyl) chitosan (HPCHS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were employed as the modulation agents for CaCO3 crystallization. The effects of HPCHS and CTAB concentrations, as well as aging time on CaCO3 crystallization were investigated. The CaCO3 particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). All the crystallized particles are aggregated rhombohedral crystals with rough surfaces. HPCHS and CTAB show different effects on the crystallization and growth of CaCO3 particles. Based on an analysis of the CaCO3 particles and solutions in the HPCHS/CTAB system, a CaCO3 crystallization mechanism in HPCHS/CTAB mixed solutions is proposed. The work provides good insight into the CaCO3 crystallization process in the presence of biomacromolecule/surfactant mixed solutions.Calcium carbonate (CaCO In living organisms, a variety of solid inorganic materials with interesting properties and hierarchical structures are synthesized in the presence of organic additives As one of the most important functional derivatives,  Other reagents, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Reagents Company), anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl The preparation of CaCO In a typical experiment, CaCl The morphology and particle size of the CaCO In order to reveal the crystallization mechanism of CaCO To clarify the influence of HPCHS or CTAB on the crystallization of CaCO   The FTIR spectrum of CaCO The TGA curves of the CaCO During a typical synthesis process, the concentrations of HPCHS (0.2 The XRD patterns (Fig. S1) show that all the CaCO The influence of aging time on the CaCO As shown in In order to explore the CaCO As shown in There are two formation mechanisms for crystal growth in solutions During the growth of the CaCO CaCO At fixed concentrations of Ca The authors acknowledge the financial support from  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
