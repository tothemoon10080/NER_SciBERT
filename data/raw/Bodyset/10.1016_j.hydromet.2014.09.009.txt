Biochemical and biotechnological aspects of aeration conditions in iron- and sulfur-oxidizing Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cultures were studied. The critical values of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, (k

                     crit, were used to define the conditions necessary for minimum aeration and to eliminate potential oxygen limitation during substrate oxidation by the model bioleaching culture. The Michaelis constants for oxygen were 1.07 and 0.61μmol O2 l−1 for the oxidation of ferrous iron and elemental sulfur, respectively. The C
                     crit values, below which oxygen limitation may occur, were 6.250 and 3.125μmol O2 l−1, determined in respirometric experiments for the oxidation of ferrous iron and elemental sulfur, respectively. The rates of iron and sulfur oxidation were also determined at the C
                     crit values by measuring the formation of ferric iron and protons in the corresponding cell suspensions. Neither iron nor sulfur oxidation was limited by oxygen at C

On the contrary, there was a lower oxygen demand in sulfur-oxidizing cultures compared to iron-oxidizing cultures, perhaps related to relatively low number of attached cells in the sulfur-oxidizing culture. Planktonic cells may represent the predominant biomass in the active growth phase ( To validate the Iron- and sulfur-oxidizing activities of bioreactor cell suspensions are shown in The Ferrous iron is a typical soluble substrate for The ( This work was supported by the
