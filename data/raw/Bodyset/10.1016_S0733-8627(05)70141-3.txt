Dentoalveolar injuries are those injuries involving the teeth, the alveolar portion of the maxilla and mandible, and the adjacent soft tissues. They are among the most serious dental conditions. Examples of such injuries include the avulsion of teeth, fractures of the teeth, fractures of the alveolar process, and lacerations of the soft tissue. These injuries are associated most frequently with accidents and violence. Unlike other hard tissue injuries in the body, tooth enamel injuries are unable to heal or repair themselves.
