Ultrasonic speeds, densities and viscosities in binary liquid mixtures of quinoline with methanol at temperatures T=(303.15,308.15,313.15 and 318.15)K have been measured over the entire molefraction range. Ultrasonic velocities theoretically have been determined with the help of Nomoto relation (UNOM), Impedance relation (UIMP), Van-Dael and Vangeel relation (UVDV), Junjie relation (UJUN) and Raoâ€™s specific velocity relation (URAO). Later experimentally measured values of velocities and theoretical evaluated values of velocities are compared with each other and it is found to be in a good agreement with each other. Also U2
