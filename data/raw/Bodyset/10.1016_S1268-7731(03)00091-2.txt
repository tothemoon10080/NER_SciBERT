Ankle fractures in children are a common injury and most heal uneventfully. Nonunion is unusual in children with otherwise normal bone, particularly following ankle fracture. We report the exceptional case of a hypertrophic fibular nonunion in a healthy 13 year old girl.A fit and well 13 year old female injured her ankle when falling from her scooter. Plain radiographs demonstrated a displaced triplane fracture of the distal tibia and a comminuted, angulated fracture of the distal fibula as shown in The patient underwent closed manipulation under general anaesthesia, the tibia was reduced anatomically by internal rotation of the foot, while the fibula had a residual valgus angulation of 4°. This position was maintained for 6 weeks in a nonweightbearing, below-knee cast. The patient was then allowed unprotected weight bearing, but required a further 3 weeks immobilisation due to persistent pain. The tibial fracture healed uneventfully, however, chronic pain over the fibula was still a problem on prolonged weight bearing at 6 months, and plain radiographs confirmed evidence of hypertrophic nonunion as illustrated in Predisposing factors for nonunion of any fracture are high-energy injuries associated with comminution and soft tissue loss Nonunion of the fibula following any ankle injury in children has only previously been reported as a bony avulsion at the tip, successfully treated by fragment excision The case presented is a pronation–eversion (external rotation) stage 3, according to the extended Lauge-Hansen classification of indirect ankle fractures. It is to be noted that the Dias-Tachdjian classification of childrens' ankle fractures has the triplane fracture in a category of its own, although the mechanism of injury was believed to be external rotation In this case there was comminution of the fibula shaft, and it may have been the presence of a butterfly fragment that predisposed the fracture to nonunion. This exceptional case highlights an uncommon problem, however, it demonstrates that if fibular nonunion is recognised in a child with chronic pain following an ankle fracture a highly satisfactory outcome can be achieved surgically.
