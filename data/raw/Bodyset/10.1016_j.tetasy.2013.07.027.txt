A perfect temperature-guided diastereoselectivity switch was observed in the desymmetrization of some meso-bridged tricyclic succinic anhydrides with a lithiated chiral 5,5-disubstituted oxazolidin-2-one called SuperQuat. Experimental conditions required for the optimum diastereoselectivity and to obtain the individual diastereoisomers of the SuperQuat linked meso-anhydride opening products with acceptable purity and yield have been established.

These naturally occurring molecules mostly exist as a single enantiomer thus restricting their general use in the asymmetric synthesis of both enantiomers of desired molecules. Therefore, much attention has been paid to chiral inductions that lead to both enantiomers using a single chiral source by changing the reaction conditions. Asymmetric desymmetrization of symmetric molecules is an attractive method for the synthesis of chiral building blocks with multiple stereocentres. We have introduced However, when this desymmetrization methodology using oxazolidin-2-one Previously, We observed a divergent result from the temperature effect on the diastereoselectivity of the anhydride opening using Seebach’s SuperQuat oxazolidin-2-one In order to study the generality of this temperature dependent switch on the diastereoselectivity, tricyclic anhydrides The absolute configuration of the major product methyl ester In conclusion, oxazolidin-2-ones are a class of molecules, which in stoichiometric amounts could be efficiently employed for the desymmetrization of prochiral anhydrides.
