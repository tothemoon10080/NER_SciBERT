The meeting and exhibition took place at the Cincinnati Convention Center, a spacious and excellent facility connected to the major hotels in the immediate vicinity by a “skywalk”. The meeting actually started with a reception on Sunday evening (February 23). Monday morning was devoted to plenary lectures as well as technical sessions while in the afternoon was the opening of the exhibition which included a reception. There were over 400 technical presentations and about 4000 participants. A directory of participants and their addresses was available during the conference, as well as a CD containing the pre-prints of the presentations (included in the registration fee). Of the 67 sessions held, the following were of particular interest.
