The Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate was obtained through mineral processing and massively disposed at the tailing dams. For efficient extraction of the rare earth elements (REEs) from the rare-earth concentrate, a novel approach was proposed to selectively enrich and separate REEs as rare earth oxide fluoride ([Ce,La,Pr,Nd]OF) phase under super gravity. Firstly, the mineral reconstruction behavior of the rare-earth concentrate revealed that REEs were selectively enriched into the rare earth oxide fluoride phase with the temperature’s rising to 1473 K–1773 K under a reductive atmosphere. Subsequently, selective separation of the rare earth oxide fluoride phase was conducted under super gravity at the enriching temperature range, where the REEs were enriched as the single Re-rich phase while other minerals formed the molten slag. Accordingly, high-purity rare earth oxide fluoride phase with a high ∑ReO content of 90.35 wt.% was efficiently separated from the rare-earth concentrate under super gravity at 1773 K with G = 1000 for 10 min, which was accurately characterized for the first time to supplement some lacking data for the Re-rich phase. In addition, this manuscript provided a novel physical separation method for mineral processing.Rare earth elements (abbreviated as REEs), a group of chemically-similar and physically-similar metallic elements, are used as essential constituents in a wide range of applications, such as catalysts, metallurgical additives and alloys, as well as in glass polishing and ceramics, and their low substitutability implies the need to secure a stable REEs supply ( The Bayan Obo REE-Nb-Fe deposit in China, the largest REEs resource over the world, has been primarily adopted by mineral process to extract iron resource currently ( If REEs could be enriched from various primary minerals into a specific Re-rich phase on the basis of their similar ionic radii (  This manuscript proposed a novel method to selectively enrich REEs as rare earth oxide fluoride phase, and subsequently separate the Re-rich phase from Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate under super gravity. Additionally, the mineralogical constitution, chemical composition, chemical formula, and crystal structure of the separated high-purity rare earth oxide fluoride were characterized accurately for the first time in this paper. Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate that was obtained through mineral processing and massively disposed at the tailing dams, was employed as the raw material in this study. Its chemical composition was deduced from the XRF (X-ray fluorescence) measurements, as given in The key point of this work relies on a high-gravity incorporating with the high-temperature condition, which was created by a centrifugal device as depicted in The mineral reconstruction for selectively enriching REEs from the rare-earth concentrate was investigated through conducting the thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA) and the hot-quenching method while the whole process would be incorporated with various Furthermore, a total of 250 g of the mixed powder was filled evenly into 5 graphite crucibles (I.D. 19 mm and H. 80 mm). Afterwards, the five samples were heated to 1373 K, 1473 K, 1573 K, 1673 K and 1773 K, respectively, under an argon atmosphere in a muffle furnace with a heating rate of 1 K/min. After holding the samples for 30 min at each target temperature, the crucibles were promptly removed from the furnace and water-quenched. Subsequently, the mineral compositions and microstructures of various rare earth phases attained at different temperatures were analyzed by using the XRD and the scanning electron micrograph with energy-dispersive spectrum (SEM-EDS) methods. According to the selective enriching conditions for REEs as rare earth oxide fluoride phase ascertained above, separation of the rare earth oxide fluoride phase from rare-earth concentrate was conducted at the enriching temperature range in a field of super gravity. Twenty grams of the mixed powder was placed on a graphite felt with 0.01 mm pore size embedded in a graphite filter, which was fixed onto a graphite crucible with 19 mm inner diameter as shown in After the selective separation of rare earth oxide fluoride phase from the rare-earth concentrate by super gravity, the samples were split longitudinally along with the center axis to form a macrograph view. Subsequently, the samples which were retained in the filter (rare earth oxide fluoride phase) and passed through the filter (slag phase) were analyzed The TGA curve of the mixed powder of rare-earth concentrate and activated carbon with rising temperature is shown in The first mass loss (stage I) from 1023 K to 1123 K was primarily stemmed from the decomposition of bastnaesite ([Ce,La,Pr,Nd]CO For the second mass loss (stage II) from 1373 K to 1473 K, which was potentially triggered by the mineral reconstruction reactions of various rare earth minerals, it was detected further through the hot-quenching and As the temperature rose further from 1473 K to 1773 K, the REEs were enriched selectively into the single rare earth oxide fluoride phase, which progressively grew and aggregated into the larger equiaxed crystals, whereas other minerals disappeared completely instead of forming into the slag melts, as illustrated in Vertical sections of the samples attained under super gravity with gravity coefficient of Through drawing the comparison of XRD patterns of the separated samples attained by super gravity with Variations in equivalent diameters and volume fractions of the separated rare earth oxide fluoride attained by super gravity as a function of separating temperature are shown in  Due to the lacking of relevant data for rare earth oxide fluoride, the detailed characterizations of the separated high-purity Re-rich phase were given further. Firstly, the chemical formula of the rare earth oxide fluoride was analyzed by using XPS method. For the REEs (Ce, La, Pr, Nd), there is only one stable valence of trivalent for lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), and neodymium (Nd), whereas cerium (Ce) takes on two types of valence. Therefore, it is confirmed firstly for the valence of Ce to determine the chemical formula of rare earth oxide fluoride. Given the XPS Ce 3d spectra of the rare earth oxide fluoride was illustrated in Subsequently, the separated high-purity rare earth oxide fluoride phase was analyzed further through using the TEM to accurately characterize the crystal structure. On the basis of the TEM image of the grated rare earth oxide fluoride as shown in Based on the results obtained above, the process of selectively enriching and separating REEs from rare-earth concentrate under super gravity could be intuitively described by This paper proposed a novel method to selectively enrich and separate REEs as rare earth oxide fluoride ([Ce,La,Pr,Nd]OF) phase under super gravity, for efficient extraction of REEs from the Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate. REEs were selectively enriched into the single rare earth oxide fluoride phase, while other minerals formed the molten slag as reconstructed under a reductive atmosphere between the temperature range from 1473 K to 1773 K. High-purity rare earth oxide fluoride phase was efficiently separated from the rare-earth concentrate at the enriching temperature range of REEs under super gravity, and its chemical formula and crystal structure were accurately characterized for the first time.
