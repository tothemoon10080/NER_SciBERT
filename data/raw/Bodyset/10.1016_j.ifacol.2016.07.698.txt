Structure and parameter identification of the nonlinear systems with positive feedback on the set of continuous block-oriented models with feedback is considered. The method of the structure identification in the steady state based on the observation of the systemâ€™s input and output variables at the input periodic influences is proposed. The solution of the parameter identification problems is carried out in the steady and transient states by the least squares method. The structure and parameter identification algorithms are investigated by means of both the theoretical analysis and the computer modeling. According to the proposed identification method the model of the ball-tube mill of the concentrating factory, working in a closed cycle with the classifier, has been determined.
