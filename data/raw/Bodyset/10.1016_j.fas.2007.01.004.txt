The calcaneus (os calcis) is the largest and the most commonly fractured of the tarsal bones An 86-year-old female was a restrained front seat passenger in a car involved in a moderate impact collision with a wall. Initial evaluation in the emergency department showed an obvious interphalangeal dislocation of the right great toe, which was promptly reduced. Additionally, she was found to have a diffusely swollen, stiff, painful left ankle, with no neurovascular deficit. Plain radiographic examination, confirmed by CT-scan, of the left ankle and foot showed a comminuted intra-articular fracture of the calcaneus (os calcis) with dorsal dislocation of the navicular from the talus ( The patient was initially managed with a below knee backslab and elevation. She underwent open reduction of the talonavicular subluxation and fixation of comminuted calcaneal fracture with two Steinman pins. A decision was made not to perform open reduction and internal fixation of the os calcis due to patient's age and poor skin condition. Post-operative recovery was unremarkable. The patient has been followed up for 18 months after discharge. Her wound has healed without any complications, and a good reduction of talonavicular joint has been maintained radiographically ( Ricci et al. The combination of dorsal dislocation of the navicular from the talus with fracture of the calcaneus (os calcis) is an uncommon and severe injury. Kleiger It has been proposed by Court-Brown et al. We report an 86-year-old female who sustained a closed, type III intra-articular calcaneal fracture in combination with talonavicular subluxation. This is a rare injury. This case is unusual with respect to the advanced age of the patient, the absence of proximal injuries and associated moderate energy impact. This is the only reported case to have achieved a good outcome with the patient completely pain-free and independently mobile in her normal footwear at 18 months follow-up.
