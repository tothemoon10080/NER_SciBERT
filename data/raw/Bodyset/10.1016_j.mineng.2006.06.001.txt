It gives me great pleasure to introduce this volume of collected papers. These form a selection of the presentations made at the This collection of papers has two unusual features; they have neither a strong focus on a particular aspect of minerals processing, nor do they use a single computational technique. In the past I would have been reluctant to see a volume with such disparate ideas forming a collection; in this volume it is its defining strength. The reason is simple; it shows that computational modelling has now advanced to the point where it can be applied to all parts of the mineral processing and extraction process â€“ there are papers on comminution, classification, fluidisation, flotation, filtration, chemical reaction and flow in porous media and pyrometallurgy. Similarly, the spectrum of computation techniques has broadened significantly. Not only are the commonly-used packages applied, but there is a range of new techniques being used, many of which are new to minerals processing. Most interestingly, and showing great promise for the future, is the use of mixed models, in particular combining CFD and DEM. This is certainly the way forward. I am certain that this volume will contain something for everyone, and hopefully will encourage not only wider application of computational modelling methods, but also the application of new and combined methods to old problems. I look forward to the next Computational Modelling Conference, which no doubt will show even wider application, and even more novel computational methods. Finally, I want to acknowledge the help of all the referees in turning around the papers so quickly, and also the authors for gracefully incorporating the improvements recommended.
