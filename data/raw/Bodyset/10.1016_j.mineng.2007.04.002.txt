The beneficial effect of the addition of sodium chloride upon the leaching kinetics of complex iron–nickel–copper sulphides at elevated temperatures and oxygen pressures has been widely reported since the late 1970s, but the role of chloride is still being investigated or debated. Previous researchers have considered chloride as: (i) a complexing agent for cuprous ions; (ii) a surfactant that disperses the molten sulphur and thus removes passivation of the mineral surface by elemental sulphur during pressure leaching; and (iii) a reagent which increases the surface area and the porosity of the insoluble product layer on the surface. A proper understanding of the role of chloride based on the leaching of individual sulphides of known composition in the absence of host minerals at low pulp densities would be useful for the development of chloride assisted sulphate leaching processes for complex sulphide ores, concentrates, and mattes. In the present study evidence for the formation of basic salts of Cu(II) and Fe(III) during leaching are presented. The published rate data are analysed for the leaching of copper from mono-sized chalcocite particles in oxygenated sulphuric acid solutions maintained at 85°C, a temperature lower than the melting point of sulphur. The initial leaching follows a shrinking particle (sphere) model, and the apparent rate constants are first order with respect to the concentration of dissolved oxygen and chloride. The intrinsic rate constant for the surface reaction (0.2ms−1) is two orders of magnitude larger than the calculated mass transfer coefficient of oxygen (3×10−3
                     ms−1). The proposed reaction mechanism considers the formation of an interim Cu(II)(OH)Cl0 species which facilitates the leaching process.The beneficial effect of chloride (0.5–10  The analysis and rationalisation of the effect of chloride on kinetics of copper–iron–nickel mixed sulphide concentrates or mattes is complicated due to a number of reasons. Firstly, the ore/concentrate often contains a number of different sulphides such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcocite, covellite, and pentlandite in which some host minerals can affect the leaching kinetics of a given sulphide due to galvanic effects ( Rate analysis of solid dissolution generally considers either a chemical reaction at the surface, or diffusion or mass transfer of reactants or products. The results from such studies are quantified on the basis of a first order heterogeneous rate constant ( While the results from electrochemical and chemical leaching tests suggest that the formation of elemental sulphur, chalcocite, covellite (or copper rich polysulphides), and precipitation of iron-hydroxy compounds are responsible for the slow kinetics during the leaching of chalcopyrite ( Previous researchers have carried out detailed studies of the effect of oxygen flow rate, agitation, and acid or chloride concentration on copper extraction from synthetic chalcocite and covellite ( Considering the importance of chalcocite as a component of secondary enriched copper deposits, copper/nickel mattes, and white metal ( review the current status of relevant chemical speciation in solution, and reaction mechanism of initial chalcocite leaching by oxygenated sulphuric acid; quantify the effect of particle size, sulphuric acid, oxygen, and chloride concentration on the basis of a shrinking sphere kinetic model and examine whether the initial leaching reaction of chalcocite occurs under mass transfer controlled conditions; and propose a kinetic model for the initial surface chemical reaction based on surface adsorption of reactants and the formation of Cu(OH)Cl It is clear that Cu The dissociation of sulphuric acid can be represented by Eqs. However, in the presence of sodium chloride, the association between sodium and sulphate ions ( In a comprehensive modelling study of chalcocite column and heap bioleaching in a non-chloride system, The CESL copper process which uses a chloride assisted acid-leaching of chalcopyrite also produces a basic copper sulphate precipitate in the autoclave according to Eq. The measured solubility of iron(III) in the autoclave discharge of the CESL process as a function of pH, shown in  The increase in the dissociation constant of water (line i) and the hydrolysis constants of Cu The leaching of chalcocite by oxygen is a two stage reaction ( As covellite is formed on the outer surface it begins to react, leaving a shell of sulphur surrounding the shrinking core of unreacted covellite ( In the case of chalcocite leaching, the chloride ions disrupts the passivating sulphur layer and accelerate the first stage reaction, making the second stage reaction possible, because the growing well defined porous crystalline sulphur layer allows reactants to pass through it in the presence of chloride ( The activation energy for the first and second stage of chloride assisted leaching of chalcocite was 33.5 and 69.0  Differentiation of Eq.   This can be further investigated using Eqs. For example, Based on the values of Following the procedure adopted by previous researchers ( The overall reaction shown in Eq. The beneficial effect of low concentration of chloride ions on the leaching of base metal sulphides has been known since the late 1970s. The role of chloride as a complexing agent for cuprous ions has been ruled out by previous researchers. In the case of pressure oxidation by oxygen, the role of chloride has been treated as similar to the surfactants that disperse the molten sulphur and thus remove passivation of mineral surface by elemental sulphur. The observations during atmospheric oxidation of a chalcopyrite concentrate by oxygenated iron(III) sulphate at 95 The leaching results in the initial 10–15 The proposed surface reaction involves the following steps: (i) rapid adsorption of H
