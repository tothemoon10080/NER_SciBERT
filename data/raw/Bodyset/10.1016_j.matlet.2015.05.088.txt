Multifunctional materials containing calcium phosphate to promote osteogenesis and capable to deliver drugs have gained increasing interest in the field of biomaterials. CMC-g-PAA hydrogel was evaluated to mineralize calcium phosphate during exposure to a solution of simulated body fluid. The formed composite was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of mineralization process onto swelling behavior and drug release capability was evaluated at pH 2.1 and 7.4, similar to that of gastric and intestinal fluids respectively.Recently, new generation of bone-like composite materials with enhanced biocompatibility has been developed as a new alternatives for bone tissue regeneration purposes Charged proteins presented in the extracellular matrix, decorated with acidic groups, are believed to promote the nucleation of hydroxyapatite Using polysaccharides instead synthetic polymers as building blocks for preparing hydrogel have been developed for reducing the risks occurred due to the morbidity between human cells and synthetic polymers The current study aims to design hydrogel composed of CMC decorated with acidic functional groups and evaluating its capability to nucleate calcium phosphate under biomimetic mineralization process. Moreover, the study investigate the pH sensitivity of produced hydrogel composite as well as the release profile of bovine serum albumin, as a model for protein drug, at pH 2.1 and 7.4 similar to that of gastric and intestinal fluids respectively. CMC sodium salt (>99.5%) with high viscosity was purchased from Fluka BioChemika. Comassie brilliant blue (G-250), bovine serum albumin (BSA), Graft copolymerization of acrylic acid onto polysaccharides using MBA as chemically crosslinker, was studied in details by different research groups The The kinetic swelling of CMC- BSA-loaded CMC- Scanning electron microscopy was carried out on Model Quanta 250 FEG (Field Emission Gun) attached with EDX Unit (Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyses), with accelerating voltage 30 Graft copolymerization of acrylic acid onto CMC backbone was studied in detail (data not showed here) to optimize the swelling% of the hydrogel. Calcium phosphate nucleation preferentially enhanced by the graft co-polymer chains which have high density of carboxylic acid groups acting as Ca The maps displayed in The structural changes before and after biomimetic mineralization process was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy as shown in  XRD pattern of CMC shows sharp reflections at 9.4 and 20.1Â° 2 The two samples showed pH responsive properties with lower swelling% for the mineralized hydrogel comparing with the pure hydrogel ( As a result, the existence of calcium phosphate in the hydrogel materials could reduce their permeability for drug CMC- This work was supported by the
