A combined nonlinear model predictive control and nonlinear dynamic inversion design approach is proposed as a new effective control design philosophy for complex milling circuits. Nonlinear interaction between various states in the mill and the sump as well as significant time delays make the milling circuit difficult to control. The proposed innovative approach, which uses a suboptimal nonlinear model predictive control for the overall circuit with a fast acting dynamic inversion control for controlling the sump level, addresses the ambitious objectives of high product quality, high throughput, manageable loads in the mill as well as minimum power consumption.
