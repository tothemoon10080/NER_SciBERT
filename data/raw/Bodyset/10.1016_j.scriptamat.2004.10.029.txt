Different regimes of interaction between tungsten nanopowders, produced by pulsed electric plasma spraying of wires, and air have been studied: passivation (slow-rate oxidation at room temperature), medium-rate oxidation by linear heating (15K/min) and combustion (fast-rate oxidation). A thermochemical oxidation diagram of tungsten nanopowders in air is proposed.In the last decade W nanopowders have attracted great interest as functional materials with advanced characteristics. One of the most common methods for metal nanopowder synthesis is physical vapor deposition (PVD) One method with a substantially higher production rate (∼200 PEPSW metal powders have a high metal content (up to 98 The majority of reports concerning the oxidation of metal nanoparticles provide information on reactive metals such as Al, Ti, Fe Production of the W nanopowder was carried out by using an industrial PEPSW machine named UDP-4G Non-passivated W nanopowder as well as other metal nanopowders immediately self-ignites if exposed to air, making passivation essential. Hence, the powder-collector was placed into a separate hermetic passivation chamber immediately after powder production. Passivation was carried out at room temperature in the medium of argon gas (pressure of 1.1 DTA–TGA analyses of samples were performed using a STA-409 apparatus (Netzsch Gersebau GmbH Thermal Analysis, Germany) at temperatures up to 1300 For combustion one gram from each of the powder samples was put onto a BN plate (see XRD, TGA and chemical analysis showed that the final combustion product of both samples consisted of two phases: unreacted tungsten and WO W nanopowders studied in this work were produced under identical electric conditions in Ar (1.5 According to XRD data (see W Particle size analyses revealed that the “WNP-air” sample has a relatively narrow size distribution in the range of 20–200  After the desorption of the passivation coating (2.7 It can be assumed that neither of the studied W nanopowders even partially react with nitrogen from the air, since no nitrides were found in the final combustion products. This is the main difference between the burning scenarios of Al and W nanopowders in air Metal particles of tungsten nanopowder, produced by PEPSW, are spherical with a smooth surface and a diameter less than 1 This work has been supported by the Research Center for Machine Parts and Materials Processing (ReMM) at the University of Ulsan.
