In this paper, bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions are defined. Also, some algebraic properties of bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions which are connected with bicomplex numbers and Fibonacci numbers are investigated. Furthermore, Binet’s formula, Cassini’s identity, Catalan’s identity for these quaternions and real representation of these quaternions are given.Quaternions were first described by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. Hamilton The quaternions constitute an extension of complex numbers into a four-dimensional space and can be considered as four-dimensional vectors, in the same way that complex numbers are considered as two-dimensional vectors. Horadam Quaternions can also be conceptualized as ordered pairs of complex numbers called bicomplex numbers. Price (1991) presented bicomplex numbers based on multi-complex spaces and functions in his book In recent years, quantum mechanics on quaternions have been studied The Lie group of structures of some spaces in Bicomplex numbers, just like quaternions, are a generalization of complex numbers by means of entities specified by four real numbers. But quaternions are non commutative, whereas, bicomplex numbers and bicomplex quaternions are commutative. Another difference is that: quaternions form a division algebra, but bicomplex quaternions do not form a division algebra. The bicomplex numbers are defined by the basis 1, The bicomplex numbers have been introduced as pairs of usual complex numbers with the additional structure of commutative multiplication ( With the addition and multiplication by real scalars of two bicomplex quaternions, the bicomplex quaternion can be obtained again. Then, the addition and subtraction of the bicomplex quaternions are defined by The multiplication of a bicomplex quaternion by the real scalar The multiplication of two bicomplex quaternions is defined by Also, the bicomplex quaternions provide the properties of In this paper, the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions will be defined. The aim of this work is to present in a unified manner a variety of algebraic properties of both the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions as well as the bicomplex quaternions. In particular, using three types of conjugations, all the properties established for bicomplex numbers are also given for the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions. In addition, Binet’s Formula, Cassini’s identity, Catalan’s identity for these quaternions and real representations of these quaternions are given. In this section, firstly the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions will be defined. The bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions are defined by using the bicomplex numbers as follows Let Then, the addition and subtraction of two bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions are defined in the obvious way, Multiplication of two bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions is defined by The scaler and the vector parts of the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternion ( Thus, the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternion Three kinds of conjugation can be defined for bicomplex numbers  It can be proved easily by using In the following theorem, some properties related to the conjugations of the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions are given.   Therefore, the norm of the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternion In the following theorem, some properties related to the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions are given.          Binet’s formula of the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternion is the same as Binet’s formula of the Fibonacci quaternion     The multiplication in This transformation is one-to-one and onto. Moreover, for any In this study, a number of new results on bicomplex Fibonacci quaternions were derived. Quaternions have great importance as they are used in quantum physics, applied mathematics, quantum mechanics, Lie groups, kinematics and differential equations. This study fills the gap in the literature by providing the bicomplex Fibonacci quaternion using definitions of the bicomplex number and Fibonacci quaternion
