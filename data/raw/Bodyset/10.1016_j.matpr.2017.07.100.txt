This paper deals with the experimental study of friction and wear behavior of D2 tool steel. In the present work, the role of multiple tempering before and after deep cryogenic treatment on tribological behavior like friction and wear of D2 tool steel is focused. The heat treatments like hardening (1020°C) for one hour, tempering (210°C) for two hours and deep cryogenic treatment (-185°C) for 36 hours were done on D2 tool steel. Wear tests were performed using pin-on-disc wear tester to which normal load of 50 N and velocity of 1.5 m/s is applied. The hardness of specimens was measured by using Rockwell Hardness tester. The execution of deep cryogenic treatment increases the hardness; reduces the wear volume, wear rate and coefficient of friction of D2 tool steel. In this experimentation, various combinations of heat treatment are used. The optimum combination of heat treatment obtained was Hardening, Cryotreatment and Single Tempering (HCT). In HCT specimens there was a large reduction in the wear volume, wear rate (WR) and coefficient of friction; significant enhancement in hardness of the D2 tool steel.
