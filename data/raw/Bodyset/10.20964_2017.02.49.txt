The cathodic behavior of Cr (II) ions on Pt electrode in molten NaCl-KCl mixture at a temperature of 710 °C (983K) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, square wave voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and chronoamperometry. The results indicate the reduction process of Cr (II) to Cr on Pt electrode was one step: Cr2++2e-=Cr. Reduction of Cr (II) ions is a quasi-reversible process controlled by diffusion mass transfer, and the reduction product is insoluble. The diffusion coefficient for chromium (II) ions in NaCl-KCl melt calculated by the data of cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry, is 1.31×10-5 cm2·s-1 and 1.15×10-5 cm2·s-1, respectively. The growth process of Cr (II) ions on Pt electrode was instantaneous three-dimensional nucleation. Potentiostatic electrolysis performed on the Pt electrode confirmed the feasibility of electrodepositing metallic chromium in the molten NaCl-KCl-CrCl2 system.
