Nanoparticles and amorphous materials are common constituents of the shallow sections of active faults. Understanding the conditions at which nanoparticles are produced and their effects on friction can further improve our understanding of fault mechanics and earthquake energy budgets. Here we present the results of 59 rotary shear experiments conducted at room humidity conditions on gouge consisting of mixtures of smectite (Ca-montmorillonite) and quartz. Experiments with 60, 50, 25, 0 wt.% Ca-montmorillonite, were performed to investigate the influence of variable clay content on nanoparticle production and their influence on frictional processes. All experiments were performed at a normal stress of 5 MPa, slip rate of

                     , and at a displacement of 3 m. To monitor the development of fabric and the mineralogical changes during the experiments, we investigated the deformed gouges using scanning and transmission electron microscopy combined with X-ray powder diffraction quantitative phase analysis. This integrated analytical approach reveals that, at all slip rates and compositions, the nanoparticles (grain size of 10–50 nm) are partly amorphous and result from cataclasis, wear and mechanical solid-state amorphization of smectite. The maximum production of amorphous nanoparticle occurs in the intermediate slip rate range (

                     ), at the highest frictional work, and is associated to diffuse deformation and slip strengthening behavior. Instead, the lowest production of amorphous nanoparticles occurs at co-seismic slip rates (

                     ), at the highest frictional power and is associated with strain and heat localization and slip weakening behavior. Our findings suggest that, independently of the amount of smectite nanoparticles, they produce fault weakening only when typical co-seismic slip rates (>0.1 ms−1) are achieved. This implies that estimates of the fracture surface energy dissipated during earthquakes in natural faults might be extremely difficult to constrain.Amorphous and crystalline nanoparticles are common constituents of the shallow sections of natural faults ( Smectite minerals, i.e. hydrous aluminum phyllosilicates, are common gouge constituents in shallow fault zones, and are among the major components of fault cores sampled during the scientific drilling of several seismogenic faults (e.g., The production of nanoparticles can occur by cataclasis, wear, and mechanical solid state amorphization, which can reduce initial grain size down to less than 100 nm and introduce lattice defects in the crystalline solids (e.g., The effect of nanoparticles on bulk friction has been explored mainly for granitoid and carbonatic rocks and gouges ( Here we quantify the production of nanoparticles in smectite-bearing gouges and their effect on friction by combining rotary shear experiments with a systematic mineralogical and microstructural characterization of the experimental products. Using this information, we discuss the processes leading to the production of nanoparticles and how they influence energy partitioning and dynamic weakening during seismic slip (0.0003–1.5 ms Since variable proportions of smectite and quartz occur in fault cores of plate boundary faults (e.g. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations conducted on 60 wt.% Ca-mnt revealed that the gouge had a granular appearance (grain size <100 μm, Supplementary Fig. 1). The individual grains consisted of micrometer-sized Ca-mnt with a fibrous-like appearance, encompassing opal grains (grain size <5 μm). Because of their intimate association, we could not separate Ca-mnt grains from opal grains. The micronized quartz powder was made of angular quartz grains (grain size <100 μm). Rotary shear apparatuses are currently the only experimental equipment imposing deformation conditions at seismic slip rates ( The gouges were sheared for 3 m of equivalent displacement under a normal stress of 5 MPa (for definition of equivalent displacement, velocity, etc. see X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) with internal standard measurement and subsequent Rietveld refinement of the diffractograms allowed us to quantify the effect of shear deformation on the mineral assemblage and on the amount of amorphous material. XRPD data were collected for 25, 50, 60 wt.% Ca-mnt, on both the starting and deformed materials retrieved from the experiments performed with ROSA ( Data were collected with a Quantitative phase analysis (i.e., determination of both crystalline and amorphous weight content) was performed using the combined Rietveld and refined intensity ratio methods ( Techniques as scanning electron (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were necessary to observe deformed materials microstructures in a wide range of magnifications, down to the nanometer scale. Starting material and deformed gouge layers were (i) embedded within epoxy resin (Araldite2020 To perform high magnification imaging, assess crystalline or amorphous nature by electron diffraction and measure composition of deformed materials, four additional samples were prepared for TEM analysis. Samples with 60 wt.% Ca-mnt (starting and sheared materials at We obtained reproducible mechanical data using ROSA and SHIVA at identical imposed deformation conditions (see Supplementary Material 2). Experiments performed at slip rates of 0.0003–0.01 ms Experiments performed at slip rates of 0.1–0.3 ms Experiments performed at slip rates of 1.3–1.5 ms Pure quartz gouges compacted at all imposed slip rates. In particular, large compaction at the onset of displacement was concomitant with slip-strengthening and followed by reduced to negligible compaction associated to monotonic slip-weakening until the end of the experiment ( To compare the friction coefficient values of all experiments, we calculated The accuracy of the estimation of amorphous material content depended on: (i) the actual amount of amorphous material, (ii) the amount of internal standard added prior to the XRPD measurements, and (iii) the error of Rietveld refinement model ( The weight fraction of the amorphous material (Section Following previous investigations conducted on clay-rich gouges deformed with rotary shear machines (     In general, independently of the initial gouge composition and of the imposed slip rate, high strain domains (HSf, HS) sharply crosscut the low strain (LS) or undeformed (U) domains ( The XRPD quantitative phase analysis of the sheared gouges shows that, comparing deformed gouges (independently of the imposed slip rate) with the starting material, the amorphous material content increases and Ca-mnt content decreases, while the quantities of all the other phases remain constant ( SEM imaging revealed that high strain domains (HS and HSf) had an average grain size below 1 μm ( In gouges with 50 and 60 wt.% Ca-mnt, the thickness of the domain HSf and thus the content of amorphous nanoparticles varies with slip rate ( The slip strengthening behavior results in work hardening, which induces cataclasis, wear, and mechanical amorphization. Nanoparticles have a high strength as their grain size is close to the minimal size attainable by fracturing and wear processes ( Frictional behavior evolves from slip-neutral (for In gouges with 25 wt.% Ca-mnt, the production of amorphous nanoparticles is limited, concomitant to slip strengthening ( To generalize the experimental conditions at which amorphous nanoparticles are produced we introduce the frictional work density ( In the experiments discussed here, the production of amorphous nanoparticles increased with frictional work density ( Nanoparticles in smectite-rich fault gouges have been found in all cores of shallow fault sections when systematic nano-analysis were performed ( The observed microstructure, amorphous quantification and mechanical data suggest that the production of nanoparticles is larger at high frictional work densities rather than at high frictional power densities ( The clast size distribution in natural slipping zones has been used to estimate the breakdown work component of an earthquake energy budget ( Our results also indicate that the abundance of nano-particles is not as important as the slip rate in controlling the frictional behavior of the sheared smectite-rich gouges ( We conducted a series of rotary shear experiments on 60–40 wt.%, 50–50 wt.%, 25–75 wt.% smectite (Ca-montmorillonite, Ca-mnt) – quartz + opal mixtures and on pure quartz gouges. All experiments were performed under room humidity conditions (20–45% relative humidity) on a 2-mm thick gouge layer by imposing the same normal stress (5 MPa) and displacement (3 m), whereas slip rates ranged from 0.0003 to 1.5 ms Nanoparticles ( Nanoparticles production and degree of amorphization vary with slip rate and composition depending on the degree of strain localization. The maximum production of amorphous nanoparticles (20 wt.%) occurs at intermediate slip rates ( Amorphous nanoparticle production changes with slip rate depending on dissipation of mechanical energy. Maximum production of amorphous nanoparticles occurs with large frictional work (10 MJ m On the basis of the experimental evidence presented here, in smectite-rich natural faults, nanoparticles are produced by cataclasis, wear and mechanical solid-state amorphization. Several implications for natural smectite-rich faults can be made. First, fault weakening occurs only when typical seismic slip rates (>0.1 ms Two anonymous reviewers and the Editor are acknowledged for their very constructive comments.
