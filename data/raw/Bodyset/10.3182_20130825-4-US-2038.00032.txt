The processes of grinding and flotation of copper-molybdenum ores are characterised by significant fluctuations of all input, output and intermediate parameters. Instability and non-optimal parameters of grinding and flotation cause between 3% to 6% losses of the valuable component. Under these conditions, it is difficult to apply deterministic mathematical models of processes. However, the use of multi-level adaptive models allows considerable optimisation of the technological processes. Automatic process control grinding uses the principle of maintaining a rational level of loading of the drum mill ore and balls. While the system is operating, energy and acoustic signals are used as input parameters and the results the measurements of the size of the grains of the grinded ore are used as input and output parameters. When managing the flotation, the principle of forward-looking estimation of the grade of ore is used. Additionally, while the system is operating, analyses of the ore in the x-ray and visible spectrum are used as input data. The application of modern systems of automatic control at the “Erdenet” concentrator (Mongolia) helped increase the recovery of copper and molybdenum.
