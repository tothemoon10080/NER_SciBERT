We have investigated the decomposition of excess sludge generated in a membrane bioreactor using a turbulent jet flow ozone contactor (TJC), which induced both hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation reactions. We monitored the effects of various TJC operating parameters on the properties of the sludge, including the particle sizes, the particle size distribution, and the levels of soluble COD, total COD, and mixed liquor suspended solids. The TJC enhanced the degree of sludge reduction while consuming less energy, relative to conventional ozonation treatment systems, because of the synergic effects of hydrodynamic cavitation and ozonation. The hydrodynamic cavitation generated in the TJC increased the ozone mass transfer efficiency, which in turn promoted the rate of disintegration and solubilization of the sludge particles.The membrane bioreactor (MBR) process is one of the most economical and promising technologies for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment One solution to the problem of excess sludge would be installing a pretreatment system prior to the MBR. Among the various reported pretreatment methods – including thermal, ultrasonic, mechanical, alkaline, and oxidative technologies In this study, we employed a novel technology – using a turbulent jet flow ozone contactor (TJC) – to effectively decompose excess sludge generated during the MBR process. We expected that the TJC system would perform two major synergistic functions: enhance the mechanical disintegration and ozonation of the sludge through hydrodynamic cavitation. Although hydrodynamic cavitation through a venturi unit has been applied previously to the sludge decomposition  The laboratory-scale TJC (OXEN Tech Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) comprised five major compartments ( Hydrodynamic cavitation is the sequential generation, growth, and collapse of cavitation bubbles, releasing high-energy waves at the surface of the bubbles for a very short period of time. The cavitation bubbles implode within milliseconds under the high pressure surrounding them, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of shock waves A dimensionless cavitation number is used to characterize the process; under ideal conditions, hydrodynamic cavitation is generated when its value is less than 1  A membrane module (area: 0.38 Once a day, 2.5 The MLSS and the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSSs) were measured using standard methods   To compare the efficiency of our sludge reduction method using the TJC with those performed previously using other ozone treatment processes Although the generation of hydrodynamic cavitation is one advantage of the TJC system, it requires an additional power source for the recirculation pump, one that is not necessary in the other ozone treatment systems. Therefore, it was important for us to compare the degrees of sludge reduction of the various ozone treatment systems in terms of their specific energy inputs. The specific energy ( All the energies consumed for the TJC were summed and compared with those for the other ozonation systems reported in the literature ( The ultimate goal of the TJC system for the pretreatment of excess sludge is to establish a zero-discharge MBR system by completely recycling the decomposed sludge to the MBR. The SCOD in the treated sludge contains a certain fraction of biodegradable organic matter, which contributes to the ratio of food to microorganisms ( In this context, On the other hand, little change in the TCOD occurred in the CAV-TJC system ( To investigate the ability of the TJC to disintegrate and/or solubilize sludge particles (e.g., microbial flocs), we monitored the mean particle sizes of sludge particles with respect to the contact time under the CAV-TJC and CAV/OZO-TJC conditions ( To acquire more information on the change in the particle size distribution during TJC operation, we classified the sizes of the particles into three levels, based on the approach used in a previous report  On the other hand, the fractional volume percentage change for the microparticles (d1) was barely noticeable in either case (  The rate of TMP build-up is an important factor when evaluating membrane filterability in a submerged MBR because it is directly related to the extent of membrane fouling In this study, we investigated the decomposition of excess sludge generated in an MBR incorporating a TJC, which performed the combined functions of mechanical disintegration (hydrodynamic cavitation) and chemical oxidation (ozonation). The following conclusions are drawn: The TJC system provided 10–20% higher degrees of sludge reduction at a given ozone dose relative to those of other reported ozone treatment systems. Furthermore, even with its requirement of an additional power source (e.g., circulation pump), the TJC resulted in 5–25% higher degrees of sludge reductions at a given specific energy. The greater the specific energy input, the greater the difference in the degrees of sludge reduction between those of the TJC and other systems. Hydrodynamic cavitation played a major role in the disintegration of the sludge particles because it gave rise to a higher ozone mass transfer efficiency, which in turn promoted the disintegration of the sludge particles in the TJC. Recycling of the disintegrated sludge to the MBR after treatment with the TJC reduced the rate of membrane fouling substantially. This study was supported by a grant (
