The flotation behaviors of decyltrimethylammonium (103C), dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), tetradecyltrimethylammonium chloride (TTAC) and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) on kaolinite of different particle size fraction were studied. The adsorbed amount and adsorption isotherms of collectors on kaolinite were determined for painstaking investigation into the adsorption of quaternary amines at kaoliniteâ€“water interface by ultraviolet spectrophotometer methods. The flotation results show that the flotation recovery of kaolinite of different particle fraction increases with an increase in pH when 103C, DTAC, TTAC and CTAC are used as collectors. As the concentration of collectors increases, the flotation recovery increases. Particle size of kaolinite has a strong effect on flotation. The flotation recovery of fine kaolinite decreases with the carbon chain of quaternary ammonium salts collectors increasing, while coarse kaolinite is on the contrary. The adsorbed amount tests and adsorption isotherms show that adsorbed amount increases when the particle size of kaolinite increases or when the carbon chain length of quaternary ammonium salts increases. Within the range of flotation collector concentration, the longer the hydrocarbon chain, the more probable to be absolutely adsorbed by fine kaolinite particles and then the lower the collector concentration in the bulk, which leds to lower flotation recovery.
