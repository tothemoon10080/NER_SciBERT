A facile electrochemical technique has been employed to fabricate titania nanotube (T-NT)/cobalt sulfide (CoS) composite electrode for high performance supercapacitor application. The morphology and phase evaluation of the electrode were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The pseudocapacitance behavior of the T-NT/CoS composite electrode has been evaluated in four different aqueous electrolytes: KOH, KCl, Na2SO4 and Na2SO3. Cyclic voltammetric studies in aqueous KOH electrolyte indicated that a very high specific capacitance (370Fg−1) can be achieved in this electrolyte together with excellent cycle stability even after 300 consecutive CV cycles. Further, the capacitance behavior of the T-NT/CoS electrode in KCl, Na2SO4, and Na2SO3 electrolytes exhibited a mixture of electric double layer (EDL) and redox-induced supercapacitance as displayed in the cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) experiments. It was also observed that the capacitance behavior of the composite material is not greatly dependent on the electrolyte used except for Na2SO3 electrolyte where the capacitance value attained is relatively higher than the other electrolytes i.e. 400Fg−1 at a fairly high charge–discharge current density of 5mAcm−2. Galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments conducted on the composite electrode suggested stable capacitance behavior with excellent capacitance retention (∼80%) even after 1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles in KCl, Na2SO4, and Na2SO3 electrolytes.Electronic advancements continue to press the need for energy storing devices with high power and high specific energy density Transition metal sulfide based ECs, specifically cobalt and nickel sulfide supercapacitors In line with the above discussions, the focus of the present study is to evaluate the supercapacitance behavior of titanium nanotube (T-NT)/CoS composite electrode fabricated by electrodeposition method. T-NT substrate demonstrates several advantages – easy fabrication, high and uniform surface area coupled with excellent chemical stability, and non-toxic in nature Titanium foil (99.9% purity) of 0.1 Annealing was performed in a muffle furnace in air at 500 Electrochemical deposition of cobalt sulfide on T-NT surface was carried out in an aqueous solution of 10 Examination of the surface and cross sectional morphology of T-NT and T-NT/CoS samples was performed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The XRD analysis of the samples was carried out using SIEMENS D5000 diffractometer with copper K-α radiation. The diffraction tests were done by The electrochemical properties of the T-NT/CoS samples were evaluated by conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments using a potentiostat (Gamry Reference 600), connected to a 3-electrode setup consisting of the T-NT/CoS sample as the working electrode, platinum coil as the counter electrode, and saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as a reference electrode. CV tests were performed in 2  Prior to deposition, CV analysis was carried out in an aqueous solution of 10 The following reactions could be attributed for the deposition process Based on the CV analysis, we have carried out both potentiostatic and cyclic voltammetric deposition to see the effect of the deposition parameters on the morphology of the CoS phase. Generally, it has been emphasized that relatively more porous structure can be achieved through CV deposition compared to the potentiostatic and potentiodynamic deposition processes  The XRD profile obtained for the T-NT/CoS electrode is shown in The supercapacitance behavior of the T-NT/CoS electrode was first evaluated using cyclic voltammetric studies in 2 The anodic–cathodic reverse processes are the characteristic signatures of the pseudo capacitance behavior of CoS electrode as observed in many other research work Usually, reduction in specific capacitance is observed at higher scan rates Repetitive CV experiments were conducted on the composite electrode a scan rate of 300 The surface morphology of the T-NT/CoS electrode was analyzed after undergoing 300 cycles of CV in the KOH electrolyte.
