The large quantities of wood chips produced at mines from damaged underground timber contain gold that cannot be completely recovered by cyanidation. A fungus that can degrade a portion of the wood matrix will allow the gold that was previously locked up, to come into contact with the cyanide solution, thereby improving recoveries. The fungus Phanerochaete Chrysosporium produces enzymes that use the organic compounds found in lignin as substrate. Consequently, the fungus is able to selectively break down lignin, which is one of the major components of wood.
                  The average gold grade of chips sampled from Vaal Reefs Mine in South Africa is 2 รท 5 mg/kg. The main sources of gold was identified as discrete gold particles and gold-bearing ore. Only 60% of the gold value were recovered by cyanidation. Comparable weight losses induced by treatment with two different strains designated ME-446 and BKMF-1767 identified the latter as the more aggressive, and this strain was used in all remaining investigations. Transmission electron micrographs show hyphal penetration into cells, removal of the middle lamella between adjacent cells resulting in cell separation and in some instances degradation of entire cells.
