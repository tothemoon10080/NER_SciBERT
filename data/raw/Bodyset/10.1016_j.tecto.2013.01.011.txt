The field of dislocation creep and rheological parameters for coarse-grained (d=240μm) natural dolomite has been determined through experiments performed at temperatures of 700–1000°C, effective pressures of 300–900MPa and strain rates of 10−4/s to 10−7/s. At low strain (<7%), dolomite aggregates deform homogeneously and define a power law between strain rate and differential stress with a stress exponent of 3.0+/−0.1, but at higher strains, through-going, fine-grained (<10μm) shear zones develop in the dolomite aggregates concomitant with strain weakening. Recrystallization is limited at low strain and microstructures observed in the low strain samples include undulatory extinction, twins, grain boundary bulging, limited recrystallization along twins and fluid inclusion trails. These same microstructures are present outside of the narrow, through-going shear zones in high strain samples; however, within the shear zones the grain size is small (<10μm) with some larger porphyroclasts (20–50μm). Shear zones nucleate at fine-grained zones formed at twin boundaries, twin–twin intersections and fluid inclusion trails and is likely due to a switch in deformation mechanism due to the large strength contrast between the fine-grained zones deforming by diffusion creep and the coarse-grained protolith. The activation energy (Q) for creep of coarse-grained dolomite at low strain is 145kJ/mol. In contrast to other activation energies for dislocation and diffusion creep of minerals, Q for dislocation creep of dolomite is considerably less than that for diffusion creep (248kJ/mol). The results of this study indicate that coarse-grained dolomite will initially deform by dislocation creep at natural strain rates and temperatures between 200 and 550°C, but due to limited recovery mechanisms, fine-grained shear zones will nucleate and diffusion creep may control the rheology of these fine-grained shear zones in nature at temperatures above ~300°C.Carbonates, primarily calcite and dolomite, are commonly found in shear zones in the middle and upper crust and likely control the rheology of these zones. The deformation mechanisms and rheology of calcite aggregates have been explored extensively (  We performed a series of experiments to characterize the strain rate ( The Madoc dolomite is a coarse- and equant-grained (d All experiments were performed using a Griggs-type triaxial piston cylinder rock deformation apparatus ( In order to demonstrate that this modification of the MSC technique does not affect the accuracy of the force measurements collected in experiments performed without the pre-hit deformation stage, we performed an experiment on a nickel cylinder at 600  The multiplication factor (0.73) in both equations is due to increased friction between the load column and confining pressure piston and apparatus components and elastic strain of the load column. The subtraction of 48 The The experiments to determine the rheology of dolomite deforming by dislocation creep were performed over a broad range of temperatures (700–1000 All experiments were performed using the molten salt cell (MSC) or solid salt assembly (SSA) in a Griggs apparatus according to the methods described in Temperature and pressure were increased from room conditions to the final experimental conditions over a period of approximately 4 After reaching room temperature and pressure, the sample was removed from the assembly and impregnated with epoxy. Each sample was then cut along a plane parallel to the direction of maximum compressive stress and perpendicular to any planar shear zone that may have developed at high strain. Thin sections for optical and TEM analyses were prepared from these sample halves. Differential stresses were calculated from force measurements collected during the experiments and corrected according to the methods of Two types of experiments were performed on Madoc dolomite cylinders to determine the rheology of coarse-grained polycrystalline dolomite: single-deformation-step experiments and multi-deformation-step experiments ( Single-deformation-step experiments were performed at T Strain rate- and temperature-stepping experiments were performed to determine the strain rate and temperature sensitivities, respectively, of dolomite flow strength using the MSC. Two strain rate-stepping experiments were performed: one at 900 Each deformation step of the temperature-stepping experiment (D-9) was performed at We outline the deformation microstructures at the optical and TEM scales as they relate to intracrystalline creep mechanisms, which predominate at low strains, in this paper, leaving detailed optical and TEM analyses of microstructures and strain localization to a separate study ( All Madoc dolomite samples deformed homogeneously by dislocation creep at low (< The most precise method to determine differential stresses in high pressure experiments is the MSC ( We observed the development of shear zones in dolomite sample deformed strains above 8% during single deformation stage experiments over a wide range of peak differential stresses (85–525 In order to determine the strain rate sensitivity of the strength of coarse-grained dolomite, we have compared the mechanical data from all experiments performed on Madoc dolomite at 900 Therefore, the stress exponent is the slope of the relationship between ln The slope of this relationship for experiments performed at 900 The temperature sensitivity of the rheology of the coarse-grained dolomite aggregates deformed by dislocation creep was determined using multiple experiments performed at a single set of conditions and determining differential stresses at low strains. If the mechanical data from a series of experiments performed at the same strain rate but different temperatures are compared, then the activation energy can be determined from the following relationship based on Eq. The slope of the relationship between ln The activation energy (145 The relative magnitudes of activation energies of dislocation and diffusion creep for dolomite deformation are unusual. Further research is necessary to understand the rate-controlling mechanisms of dislocation and diffusion creep of dolomite, before we can explain the relative magnitudes of their activation energies. A number of complicating factors may be involved. Dislocation glide and twinning appear to require higher stresses at higher temperatures ( The temperature dependence we report for dislocation creep of dolomite ( We had anticipated a non-linear temperature dependence due to the combined temperature effects on dislocation creep mechanisms and changing cation order–disorder. However, the data set is well fit by a linear relationship in ln Cation order/disorder reactions are likely to be less important during natural deformation of dolomite at lower temperatures and strain rates than in the high temperature and strain rate experiments reported here. The apparent activation energy ( The mechanical data of coarse-grained polycrystalline dolomite deforming by dislocation creep is well fit by Eq. Construction of the The positive-sloped, convex-down boundary between dislocation creep and diffusion creep of dolomite aggregates in Dolomite and calcite are observed in naturally deformed rocks as different stratigraphic layers or mixed within single formations ( At 200 Coarse-grained dolomite deforms by dislocation creep at high temperatures (700–1000 Deformation of dolomite by dislocation creep appears to be limited to small strain deformations, while fine-grained dynamically recrystallized dolomite that develops at the edges of porphyroclasts leads to strain localization if the temperatures are high enough for diffusion creep to become the dominant deformation mechanism within these fine-grained zones. The activation energy ( Extrapolating our results to geologic strain rates, dislocation creep is likely the dominant deformation mechanism in coarse-grained dolomite deformed at temperatures up to ~ Extrapolating our results to geologic strain rates, diffusion creep may be the dominant deformation mechanism in fine-grained dolomite at temperatures greater than 300 This study was funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act via a grant to JN, AK and CH from the
