In the continuous lime neutralization treatment of iron-laden wastewaters, such as acid mine drainage (AMD), the solid-liquid separation of iron solids formed is difficult to effect. The particle formation mechanisms, the ensuing particle size and size distribution – which in turn shape the dewatering process – are strongly influenced by the OH/Fe molar feed ratios since they dictate the supersaturation level. This work describes tests using a stoichiometric and sub- stoichiometric OH/Fe molar ratio (R = 3 and 2.5 respectively) to establish settleability and filterability variations of a slurry precipitated at steady state in a mixed-suspension-mixed-product-removal (MSMPR) reactor at 15 min residence time. Three initial ferric concentrations ([Fe(III)]) of 100, 300 and 800 mg/L were used. The results revealed that particle-particle repulsion and product dewatering characteristics were dependent on the relationship between supersaturation, pH and ionic strength. The best product performance, as seen in fastest settling rate of 3.3 ± 0.2 mm/min, an increase in the filtration rate from 3.7 ± 0.4 to 5.1 ± 0.5 cm3/cm2 min and a decrease in the specific resistance to filtration (SRF) from 1.42 × 1012 to 6.71 × 1011 m/ kg, was observed for particles formed at R = 2.5 and a [Fe(III)] of 300 mg/L. The product performance was attributed to reduced supersaturation and minimal particle-particle repulsion due to the proximity of the steady state pH and point of zero charge. This favoured a neutral surface charge resulting in the dominance of large (D4,3 of 48.3 ± 0.05 μm and D3,2 of 30.8 ± 0.05 μm), regular shaped agglomerates which had a narrow, unimodal distribution and a notable decrease in the peak number of fine particles from 3.5 × 1013 to 1.7 × 1012 / m3. Sub- stoichiometric molar ratios produced insignificant filterability changes at [Fe(III)] of 100 and 800 mg/L but the latter showed significant settling rate changes (the largest change of threefold - from 0.8 to 2.4 ± 0.2 mm/min). These results suggest that AMD treatment plants that employ lime neutralization should be operated at lower OH concentrations than is the current practice, as this ensures improved iron removal as well as settling and filtration properties of the sludge. This may have the added benefit of decreased neutralization costs as less lime will be required.The activities involved in the mining of sulphide ores and their subsequent upgrading through flotation lead to the production of pyritic tailings and waste rock material which, upon contact with flowing groundwater and air, result in the release of sulphates, hydrogen ions and heavy metals (rich in iron) into a wastewater stream commonly referred to as acid mine drainage (AMD). The negative impact of AMD coupled with increased water scarcity ( Lime, which is relatively economical due to the reasonably low associated chemical costs, has been used in the high density sludge (HDS) process to neutralize the acidity, remove heavy metals (by precipitation of metal hydroxides) and SO Supersaturation, whose degree has a bearing on the resultant precipitate characteristics, in particular particle size and size distribution (PSD), morphology and structure, drives precipitation. Supersaturation is usually quantified by the activity-based supersaturation ratio (S A high supersaturation, during metal hydrolysis, stimulates rapid nucleation which often results in the undesirable formation of many, small, amorphous particles ( The relationship of the OH/Fe molar ratio to pH, surface charge and ionic strength is significant in iron systems. Changes in OH/Fe molar ratio bring about pH variations which enhance or depress the surface charge (inferred from zeta potential measurements) of iron solids ( The ions and minerals present in the slurry also influence the surface charge ( The dewatering behaviour of a sludge is more accurately described by the exhaustive but cumbersome specific resistance to filtration (SRF- shown as α in the Hagen-Poiseuille equation in Eq. Iron oxyhydroxide precipitation is convoluted, and whilst studies have focused on individual aspects like hydrolysis, phase mineral identification and enhancing densification, there is insufficient clarity on conditions that yield improved solid-liquid separation in industrial setups, such as the HDS process. This process generally uses high OH/Fe molar ratios ( Solutions of ferric sulphate to mimic conditions in acid mine drainage were prepared from weighed amounts (358 to 2856 mg/L) of a Sigma Aldrich analytical grade Fe The reference to Fe(OH) The supersaturation was measured as a response to changing the hydroxyl to ferric molar ratio (OH/Fe; referred to as R) from stoichiometric ( A Merck Spectroquant NOVA 60 spectrophotometer was used to measure the [Fe(III)] in the feed and supernatant based on the 1–10 phenanthroline method, with the results being used for mass balance computations. The pH of the solution in the reactor was measured by a Hanna PH212 pH electrode (accuracy of 0.1 pH units) but the pH was not externally controlled; hence the final steady state pH was read off the pH meter. Laser diffraction was used for PSD measurements (only the average results of three runs with a weighted residual of <1% were considered) and electrophoresis for zeta potential measurements using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 and Zetasizer Nano-ZS unit respectively. The crystal habit was analysed using the FEI Nova NanoSEM230 high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a field emission gun (FEG) operating at 5 keV. The FEI Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) fitted with a LaB The method of moments, which is based on the transformation of the population balance equation (PBE), is a technique that has been previously used to make inferences about particle rate processes during precipitation by plotting the various moments against time ( Changing the OH/Fe molar feed ratio (R value) was investigated in order to understand how supersaturation impacts precipitation product characteristics and performance and thus map potential relationships. The settling and filtration rates, specific resistance to filtration (SRF), PSD, morphology and zeta potential of the iron solids were measured directly whilst further insights into the system, such as the number of particles (N) and their evolution (m The response of the settling rate to variations in the OH/Fe molar feed ratio R was evaluated as shown in The filtration rates of iron solids investigated in this study are shown in A decrease in the molar ratio of OH/Fe from R = 3 to R = 2.5 led to a small, but statistically marginal increase in the filtration rate at all [Fe(III)] except at 300 mg/L, were increased sensitivity to OH/Fe molar ratio changes were observed. This sensitivity resulted in the filtration rate increasing from 3.7 ± 0.4 to 5.1 ± 0.5 cm The specific resistance to filtration (SRF) results shown in The SRF was marginally unchanged at both OH/Fe molar ratio values at the lower end of the [Fe(III)] range investigated. At a [Fe(III)] of 300 mg/L, the SRF decreased from 1.42 × 10 The relationship between product performance and supersaturation was traced through the influence of molar feed ratios on product characteristics. The supersaturation within the system, under varying R, was inferred from supersaturation ratio (S) (shown in The calculated supersaturation ratio, S A decrease in the supersaturation required for nucleation is conventionally achieved in the high density sludge (HDS) process by sludge recirculation. This recirculation slows down the neutralization rate and improves the solids density and growth of precipitates ( The supersaturation level impacts PSD ( At [Fe(III)] of 100 mg/L, the number distribution was unimodal at both R values (3 and 2.5), with peaks at 0.63 μm and 0.56 μm respectively. These submicron peak particle sizes are evidence of the effects of high supersaturation and tend to be impacted more by K At [Fe(III)] = 300 mg/L and sub-stoichiometric OH ( The 800 mg/L case was marked by a bimodal distribution with the major peaks at 0.63 μm and 0.89 μm (shown in The particle morphology and crystal habit of the iron solids, though poorly defined for the metastable phases, is known to influence product performance. The crystal habit of particles formed at the different molar ratios are shown in The SEM images show that the crystal habit, which was more regular at R = 2.5 (in line with the decrease in supersaturation), was made up of clusters of smaller particles resulting in sizes beyond the 3–10 nm of primary nucleation particles ( The crystal habit at both R values and [Fe(III)] = 100 mg/L ( The smooth, unequal layered edges were also present at 300 mg/L and indicate the presence of some layered agglomeration occurring at different rates hence the differences in particle size and crystal habit. This layered agglomeration gave rise to a “jungle gym” structure with interlocking and interconnected bridges that have the capacity to trap water at As R was decreased to 2.5 at a [Fe(III)] of 800 mg/L, a more porous surface with regular shaped particles ( The information on the nature of the surface of the iron solids can be further augmented by analysing the structure of the precipitates so as to better understand product performance. The structure, size, morphology and homogeneity of the iron solids were deduced from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images shown in Short sonication over 3 min had a more significant effect on particles formed at The images show that the particle morphology was made up of inhomogeneous clusters (as shown by the SEM images) whose “jungle gym” structure was more distinct at a [Fe(III)] = 800 mg/L. The TEM images shown in A decrease in R resulted in more homogeneous particles with a regular lath-like morphology whose size decreased with increasing [Fe(III)] ( The sphere-like morphology seen at both R values and [Fe(III)] = 100 mg/L in the SEM images was only confirmed in the TEM images for the R = 3 case with distinct branched spicules (small needle-like structures) appearing ( With sub-stoichiometric OH and at [Fe(III)] = 300 mg/L, there was increasing crystal order and regular morphology ( The morphology of particles formed under sub-stoichiometric OH ( Further insights into the particle formation mechanisms at play were inferred from the total number of particles (m There was a decrease in the total number of particles (m A sharp decline in the total number of particles at R = 2.5 was observed with an increase in [Fe(III)] from 100 to 300 mg/L after which the m With sub-stoichiometric OH at the highest tested initial [Fe(III)] = 800 mg/L, the magnitude of the decrease in m The broadness of the PSD, which indicated the extent of homogeneity of the particles in the slurry, was qualitatively evaluated from the span as seen in The span is the ratio of the difference between the D The span provides an indication of how far the volume based D The dependence of the mean particle sizes on molar ratios is shown in As the OH was decreased to sub-stoichiometric levels, the variations in D The PSD and image analysis results show that the high supersaturation yielded submicron (nano) particles, which tend to carry a higher surface charge and are thus prone to particle-particle repulsions or attractions. The surface charge was deduced from the magnitude of the zeta potential (shown in Iron oxide/hydroxides develop a surface charge depending on acid-base equilibria, hence the surface charge is influenced by the steady-state pH (pH The zeta potential trend with [Fe(III)] was similar for both R values although the exact absolute values were higher for the The lower ionic strength caused a decrease in electric double layer compression which led to higher zeta potentials ( With sub-stoichiometric OH (R = 2.5), the pH of the points of zero charge (PZC) were 8.22, 7.80 and 8.20 for the 100, 300 and 800 mg/L [Fe(III)] respectively ( The zeta potential, at Increasing OH to stoichiometric levels ( These results show the interconnected nature of ionic strength and pH in ferric systems and how they influence, to varying extents, the zeta potential and the subsequent inference of surface charge. The amount of OH added to a fixed initial [Fe(III)] in a ferric sulphate stream mimicking AMD affects the precipitation product characteristics and the product performance that ensues as summarized in With sub-stoichiometric OH (R = 2.5) and [Fe(III)] (≥ 300 mg/L), better product performance and dewatering behaviour of the iron solids was realized with the best settleability and most improved filterability being at [Fe(III)] = 300 mg/L. This overall improvement in product performance was attributed to a narrow unimodal distribution, a decrease in the number of fine particles due to decreased particle-particle repulsion that supported more agglomeration, and the presence of larger particles which had a more regular morphology. With sub-stoichiometric OH (R = 2.5) and at [Fe(III)] = 800 mg/L, the largest increase in settling rate (threefold - from 0.8 to 2.4 ± 0.2 mm/min), negligible changes in filtration rates and a shift from the “jungle gym” structure to small lath like particles were observed. This is due to the increase in both major (from 0.63 μm to 0.89 μm) and minor (from 5.02 μm to 8.93 μm) peak particle sizes of the bimodal distribution. Although the major peak sizes were close, implying that the fine particles had similar impacts on filterability, the bimodal nature of the distribution may have enabled higher capture efficiencies and hence the improved settleability. The sub-stoichiometric (R = 2.5) system attained a steady state pH of 7.5–8.5 which was close to the PZC of the iron solids formed at steady state, hence it favoured the agglomeration of particles that nucleated under these conditions. The mean particle sizes were orders of magnitude greater than the primary particle size of iron oxyhydroxides, further reinforcing that agglomeration was the main size enlargement mechanism. Operating at the sub-stoichiometric OH/Fe molar ratio (R = 2.5), under otherwise similar operating conditions as those investigated in this work ([Fe(III)] = 300 mg/L), results in improved settleability and filterability because of the formation of small particles that rapidly agglomerate into bigger, fewer and more dense particles. The results suggest that the HDS process should be operated at lower OH/Fe molar ratio, R = 2.5 (once Fe None. The authors wish to acknowledge support by the
