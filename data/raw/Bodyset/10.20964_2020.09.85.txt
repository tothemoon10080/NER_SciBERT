Electrolytic refining copper production is a high-energy hydrometallurgical industry. The key to develop a new method for energy-saving electrolysis of high-purity cathode copper is to reduce the electrical-energy consumption of electrochemical oscillations (EOs) at the anode. This phenomenon cannot be explained based on traditional equilibrium thermodynamics theory. In this paper, a simplified electrolytic copper system was used with H2SO4â€“CuSO4 solution to research the behaviour and characteristic of EOs at the anode, as well as to analyse the mechanism of EOs and the effect of potential on EOs. The electrochemical oscillation was regulated by improving the anode (such as copper anode and lead dioxide anode) and introducing additives (such as hydrochloric acid, thiourea and bone glue). The obvious inhibition effect of thiourea and lead dioxide anode on electrochemical oscillation was found, so as to improve the electrolysis process. It is possible to find a new energy-saving and environmental protection electrolysis working area in the equilibrium zone.
