Alloying process of vanadium–yttrium powders using mechanical alloying (MA) method was studied. Vanadium powder was compressed after 10h MA, while yttrium powder was comminuted into small particles. Although yttrium powder was broken into small particles, yttrium scarcely dissolves into vanadium powder. Alloying of yttrium started after 20h MA and finished after 40h MA. Molybdenum particle, which came from milling vessels and balls, mixed into vanadium powder after 40h MA and molybdenum started to dissolve into vanadium powder after 60h MA. After 80h MA, Y2O3 particles formed in vanadium powder. Oxygen required for the formation of Y2O3 particles was probably discharged from the vessel wall and balls after flaking of those surface layers. Since prolonged MA caused powder contamination, optimum MA time for making V–1.7Y alloy was 40h.Mechanical alloying (MA) is one of promising method to produce materials far from equilibrium with supersaturated solid solution. For example, although solubility of copper in iron is extremely small at room temperature Pure vanadium and yttrium powders, whose chemical compositions are listed in  XRD profile for mixture of vanadium and yttrium powders before MA is shown in Change in lattice parameter of vanadium powder after MA for 0 to 80  After 10 Y Alloying of yttrium in vanadium powder occurred after 20 The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to INCS, Ehime University for using transmission electron microscope, JEM2000EX.
