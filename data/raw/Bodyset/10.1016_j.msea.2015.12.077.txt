In the current investigation, a nanocrystalline alloy Al-10wt.% Fe was synthesized from metallic powders using the mechanical alloying (MA) technique, for various milling hours. The consolidation and sintering of the alloyed powders was performed in a high frequency induction heat sintering (HFIHS) machine. The minimum crystallite size and the maximum hardness of the sintered sample was found to be 30nm and 2.05GPa, respectively. The maximum compressive yield strength of the alloy was observed to be 660MPa at room temperature. The bulk nanocrystalline alloy produced from 150h milled powder showed significant enhancement in the thermal stability, this specific alloy displayed a compressive yield strength of 570MPa at 573K. The compression experimental results of sintered samples revealed high strength coupled with large deformation to failure.The demand for aluminum and its alloys has been ever increasing due to their high strength to weight ratio. It is well known that through precipitation hardening mechanisms the strength of certain aluminum alloys at room temperature varies between 550–600 Based on this observation, few investigations have been performed wherein; aluminum was alloyed with TMs for various applications The current study was performed to investigate two aspects. Firstly, to increase the solid solubility limit of TM (Fe) in Al matrix and secondly, to investigate the mechanical properties of the processed alloy at elevated temperatures. The current investigation further explores the synergistic effect of increasing the alloying time and the reduction in the crystallite size of the processed alloy, on the thermo-mechanical properties of the sintered alloy which has not been fully explored in earlier investigations. The initial powders used in this investigation include; 99.95% pure Al powders (average particle size equal to 2 The Vickers microhardness measurements were performed on the sintered Al-10 The quasi-static uniaxial room temperature compression experiments were performed on the sintered Al-10 To investigate the effect of temperature on the mechanical responses of sintered Al-10 The surfaces of newly fabricated nanocrystalline Al-10 JEOL model JSM-6610LV FESEM with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer and JEM-2100F HRTEM were used for characterizing the microstructural constituents and features of the as-mixed, milled and sintered samples. The powder samples for TEM analysis were prepared by dissolving small quantity of the powder in an ethanol solution.

Several studies The results presented in  The XRD spectrum of the sintered Al-10 It is observed that during sintering, the Fe is precipitated from the supersaturated Al–Fe solid solution to form a metastable intermetallic Al  It is well known that the crystallite size of the powders increase during sintering process because of the involvement of high temperature which support the grain growth mechanism. However, the change in crystallite size was observed to be minimal in this investigation as shown in  The maximum difference in lattice parameter (DLP) after sintering is observed in samples obtained from 150   The        Thus, it is evident that samples obtained from 150 Nanocrystalline Al-10 This project was funded by the
