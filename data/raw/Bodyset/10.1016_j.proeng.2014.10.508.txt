In order to analyze attenuation law of the open-pit mine blasting vibration, the FEM program LS-DYNA is used to establish model of double millisecond holes in bench blasting, through the analysis of numerical simulation results, it can be obtained that peak particle velocity (PPV) and energy attenuation are occurred near the blasting source, which provided basic theory for protection of buildings near blasting source.
