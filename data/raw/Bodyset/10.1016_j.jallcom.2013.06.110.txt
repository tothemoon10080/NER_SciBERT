Fast scanning calorimetry (FSC) based on nanocalorimetry and thin film technique is a newly developed attractive tool to investigate the solidification behavior of single droplet by in situ controllable ultrafast cooling. In this paper, we introduced this novel technique to in situ control the quenching of single Sn3.5Ag metallic droplet at cooling rate up to 15,000K/s with corresponding undercooling of 110.9K. In particular, the solidification structure of this real time quenched single droplet was observed and analyzed with focused ion beam (FIB), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). This research proposed a new approach to research the solidification structure of single droplet with precisely controlled size and extreme cooling rate.Rapid solidification has been extensively utilized to produce phase and structure modification in alloys since 1960 Compared with bulk materials, thermal analysis on single droplet was significant to reveal the nucleation mechanism starting from Turnbull Sn3.5Ag Master alloys were prepared by arc melting of bulk metals of pure tin (5 The fast scanning calorimetry (Spark III) with Xen 39395 nanocalorimetric sensor was used for nanocalorimetric measurement and the instrument was calibrated by pure indium and tin. After the scanning of FSC, the sample was imaged and sputtered using a FEI 600i dual-beam system. Before fabrication, the sample was coated with platinum to prevent charging and reduce ion beam damage  After FSC test, the single droplet was thinned by focused ion beam, as shown in  It can also be found in  To shed much more light on the phase details of the FSC-measured single Ag With FSC based on nanocalorimetric and thin film technique, it is accessible to quench the micro-sized Sn3.5Ag single droplet with controllable cooling rate as large as 15,000 This work was supported by the
