This article reports the processing of fully dense Y-stabilied tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP)-based 30 vol.% TiB2 composites via hot pressing route using both the commercial co-precipitated and the yttria coated ZrO2 powders with nominal dopant content of 3 mol% yttria. The indentation toughness of the sintered composites is found to be strongly sensitive to the use of ZrO2 starting powders. Both the residual stress and the yttria distribution in the ZrO2 matrix are found to have a significant influence on the achievable toughness.The major driving force for the development of ceramic matrix composites is the enhancement of fracture toughness and thus reliability for structural applications Since the discovery of transformation toughening in zirconia ceramics The commercial powders used in this work are listed in The dry powder mixture was inserted into a cylindrical graphite die with a diameter of 30 mm, coated with boron nitride. After cold precompression at 30 MPa, the samples were hot pressed in a KCE hot press (KCE Sondermaschinen, Germany) under vacuum (â‰ˆ0.1 Pa), for 1 h under a mechanical load of 28 MPa at 1450 Polished specimens of the Y-TZP monoliths were thermally etched at 1400 The Vickers hardness (HV A representative microstructure of the hot pressed and polished ZrO The hardness and The fracture toughness and tetragonal ZrO The above-mentioned experimental observation is now explained in terms of the residual stress and the microstructure. Due to the lower coefficient of thermal expansion of TiB SEM observations of the radial crack pattern generated at the edges of Vickers indentations, clearly revealed the presence of a crack deflection toughening mechanism in all composites (see An increase in toughness of 14% was observed for the Tioxide powder based ZrO In order to explain the observed differences in toughness improvement in the 30 vol.% TiB SEM micrographs of fractured Tosoh composite surfaces along with the thermally etched surfaces of the corresponding ZrO Neglecting the small difference in the overall yttria content in the zirconia starting powders and considering the fact that all the composites are hot pressed under identical sintering conditions, it is clear that the only factors that could influence the transformability of the t-ZrO It is well known (a) Fully dense tetragonal ZrO (b) The residual tensile stress in the ZrO (c) Crack deflection by the TiB (d) While the tetragonal grain size does not seem to have any influence on the obtained toughness, the yttria distribution in the ZrO This work was supported by the Brite-Euram programme of the Commission of the European Communities under project contract No. BRPR-CT96-0304.
