A new method of primary aluminum extraction from alumina was proposed. The method is based on the new reaction AlI3+(3/2)Zn=Al+(3/2)ZnI2. In its turn, the exchange reaction AlCl3+CaI2→AlI3+CaCl2 is used to get aluminum iodide from aluminum chloride—the product of alumina carbochlorination. These reactions were studied in laboratory experiments as well as additional reactions, which were needed for the main chemicals recycling: Cl2, ZnI2→Zn, CaCl2→CaI2. XRD and SEM methods were used to investigate the phases and morphology of the reaction's solid products. The global free energy minimization method was used for the chemical equation's calculations. It was shown that aluminum can be effectively extracted from alumina without electrolysis, extreme high temperature and expended chemicals. The estimated specific carbon consumption and CO2 atmospheric pollution rate have to be halves of such values for the contemporary aluminum plant powered by the coal power station.
