The flotation separation of mineral products of a composite structure is a multiple-factor process. The increase of flotation efficiency requires a parallel optimization of many factors connected with mineral particles surface characteristics, chemical reactions in the liquid phase of the pulp, and also with hydrodynamic conditions in the flotation cell. The increase of efficiency of flotation of complex ores is possible under simultaneous improvement of three major components of flotation process: operation components, chemistry components and equipment components. Ways to increase the efficiency of flotation of the minerals of apatite and baddeleyite were developed and implemented into practice of beneficiation of complex ore of Kovdorsky deposit. The authors have proposed to increase flotation efficiency at the expense of application of acoustic effects on a flotation system. The method is based on the adoption of high intensity oscillations in the sound frequency range.
