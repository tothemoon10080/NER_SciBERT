Pulsed current electrolysis was applied in NaCl-KCl-MnCl2 melt at 983 K to enhance morphology of cathode product. A tungsten wire was used as the working electrode, a carbon rod was employed as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The electrochemical reduction of Mn2+ was investigated in this three-electrode cell. Then tungsten wire and carbon rod were used as the cathode and anode to establish a two-electrode cell. Under pulsed current electrolysis, the influence of various pulsed parameters (e.g., periodic time (t) and the ratio of ton to toff (n)) on the morphology of cathode product was explored. It was found that comparing with that of direct current electrolysis, when t=10 min, n=1, the produced manganese with coarser grain was obtained. In addition, high carbon ferromanganese was used as the anode, with a tungsten plate as the cathode to perform pulsed current electrorefining. It was also concluded that when t=10 min, n=1, the morphology of produced manganese and iron was obviously improved, with large grain obtained.
