Carbonization of pure MnO2 by CH4-H2 gas mixture with various CH4/(CH4
                     +H2) molar ratios in the temperature range of 900–1250°C had been performed in our previous work. This study further investigated the carbonization and alloying process of MnO2 by CH4-H2 gas mixture in the presence of Fe2O3 at 900–1300°C using XRD, optical microstructure, SEM-EDS and phase diagram analyses. Carbonization test of pure Fe2O3 was also conducted to understand the effect of Fe2O3 on the carbonization of MnO2 more explicitly. It was found that Fe2O3 could be carbonized to Fe3C at 900–1150°C. The Fe2O3 briquettes began to melt at 1100°C and a large amount of Fe-C melts appeared as the temperature went up to 1150°C. When the MnO2
                     +25 wt%Fe2O3 briquettes were reduced at 900–1000°C in CH4-H2 gas mixture, the Fe2O3 was preferentially carbonized to Fe-C phase while the MnO2 was only reduced to MnO. The formation of Fe-C phase was beneficial to the carbonization of MnO since the carbonization temperature of MnO can decrease from 1100°C to 1000°C. The carbonization degree of MnO was dramatically accelerated over 1100°C due to the transformation of Fe-C phase from solid state to melts. Morphology analysis indicated that the MnO core was wrapped by the shell of Fe-C melts. The alloying process of Mn-Fe-C was conducted through the elements migration of Fe and Mn between the core and shell. At 1300°C, the Mn-Fe-C alloy turned to melt and aggregated since the highest melting temperature of the Mn-C-25 wt% Fe system was only 1274°C. Finally, a ferromanganese crude alloy with 68–72wt% Mn, 20–25wt% Fe and 6.0–8.0wt% C was obtained when the MnO2
                     +25wt% Fe2O3 briquettes were carbonized by CH4-H2 gas mixture at 1300°C for 60min.Minimizing carbon dioxide emissions is considered to be an important subject in the Iron & Steel industry from the viewpoint of green-house gas problem due to the present large consumption of solid carbonaceous materials Currently, ferromanganese alloys are predominantly produced from the manganese oxide ores reduced by solid carbonaceous materials In China, the main valuable oxides in the manganese oxide ores are MnO Investigation on the carbonization of pure MnO This current study investigated the carbonization and alloying process of MnO MnO The cooled briquettes were pre-ground in an agate mortar to a particle size passing through a 200 mesh screen (< Summarizing the carbonization of Fe  The corresponding optical microstructure images of Fe The effect of temperature on the phase transformation of MnO Our previous work reported the carbonization of pure MnO Three selected samples carbonized at 1000 Line scanning images of Fe, Mn, C and O elements of sample 2# are shown in Further elemental composition analyses of sample 1# and sample 2# are shown in As shown in As drawn in According to the descriptions mentioned above, the possible carbonization and alloying process of MnO In this study, the carbonization and alloying process of MnO Carbonization test of Fe Morphology analyses indicated that the MnO core was wrapped by the shell of Fe-C melts over 1100 A ferromanganese crude alloy with 68–72 The authors wish to express their thanks to the
