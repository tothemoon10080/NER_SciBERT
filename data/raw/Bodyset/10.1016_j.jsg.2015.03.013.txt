Improving the prediction of sub-seismic structures and their petrophysical properties is essential for realistic characterization of deformed sandstone reservoirs. In the present paper, we describe permeability contrasts induced by cataclastic deformation bands and faults in porous sandstones (766 data synthesized from field examples and the literature). We also discuss the influence of several factors, including tectonic regime, presence of a fault, burial depth, host sandstone porosity, and grain size and sorting for their initiation and permeability. This analysis confirms that permeability decrease is as a function of grain-crushing intensity in bands. Permeability reduction ranges from very limited in crush-microbreccia of compaction bands to high permeability reduction in cataclasites and ultracataclasites of shear-dominated bands, band clusters and faults. Tectonic regime, and especially normal-fault regime, with its tendency to localize strain and generate faults, is identified as the most important factor, leading to the formation of cataclastic bands with high permeability contrasts. Moreover, moderate burial depth (1–3 km) favors cataclastic bands with high permeability contrasts with respect to the host sandstone. High porosity, coarse-grain size and good grain sorting can slightly amplify the permeability reductions recorded in bands.Deformation bands are common features of sub-seismic scale structures developed in reservoirs composed of porous granular material such as sand and sandstone ( Cataclastic deformation bands can also be organized in pervasively distributed networks that appear not directly related to outcrop-scale faults ( Several factors influence the spatial distribution and petrophysical properties of cataclastic bands in porous sandstones ( Hence, several factors influence cataclastic band initiation and characteristics. However, influence on the permeability can be directly estimated for only few of them. A better knowledge of the relationships between the cataclastic band characteristics and factors influencing them is therefore necessary for understanding the influence of such sub-seismic structures on reservoir behavior. In the present paper, we analyze permeability contrasts induced by deformation bands and faults as a function of cataclasis intensity and discuss their potential control on fluid flow in porous sandstone reservoirs. To this end, we synthesized 766 permeability data of cataclastic bands and faults from literature (see The present paper is based on a synthesis of permeability data (766 data) from cataclastic deformation bands and faults formed in porous sandstone ( Because the different methods of measurement introduce some variation in absolute permeability value (the TinyPerm permeameter, pressure-decay profile permeametry, air and nitrogen permeametry, numerical image analysis from thin-section or tomography, probe permeameter, Kozeny-Carman laws and more), we only considered the permeability contrast between the bands and faults vs. the host sandstones. The choice of methods for permeability quantification may also influence the permeability contrast value, but to a smaller extent. The All permeability data are plotted in Cataclastic deformation bands are characterized by grain cracking and comminution, a deterioration of grain sorting, an increase of grain angularity, and a reduction of host sandstone porosity by grain rearrangement and compaction ( Pure Compaction Bands (PCBs) and Shear-Enhanced Compaction Bands (SECBs) show an average permeability contrast of −1.29 ± 1.01 ( Cataclastic bands show an average permeability contrast of −1.67 ± 0.79 ( Cataclastic band clusters show an average permeability contrast of −2.65 ± 1.30 ( Slipped cataclastic shear bands show an average permeability contrast of −2.70 ± 0.97 ( Cataclastic fault cores show an average permeability contrast of −2.77 ± 1.29 ( A wide range in permeability contrast is observed for deformation band structures, and we see a progressive increase in permeability reduction from crush microbreccia of PCBs and SECBs to cataclasites/ultracataclasites of band clusters, slipped bands and fault cores ( Permeability data of cataclastic deformation bands and faults were classified according to their kinematic behavior during formation: (1) in the normal-fault regime, (2) in the thrust-fault regime, and (3) in areas related to the presence of large-scale fault, i.e. bands located within fault damage zones above propagation of a basement fault, or in any band sets regionally linked to a fault, or (4) in areas devoid of fault ( Cataclastic structures formed in the normal-fault regime show an average permeability contrast of −2.30 ± 1.34 ( Cataclastic deformation bands formed in the thrust-fault regime show an average permeability contrast of −1.65 ± 1.14 ( Cataclastic structures formed in sets related to the presence of a fault show an average permeability contrast of −2.58 ± 1.38 ( Cataclastic bands formed in area devoid of large-scale fault show an average permeability contrast of −1.28 ± 0.85 ( Statistically, cataclastic bands formed for the normal-fault regime involve more permeability reduction than bands formed for the thrust-fault regime ( Cataclastic bands formed in sets related to the presence of a fault generally involve more permeability reduction than bands initiated in areas without fault ( Permeability data of cataclastic deformation structures were categorized according to burial conditions ( Cataclastic structures formed at shallow burial depths show an average permeability contrast of −1.74 ± 1.42 ( Cataclastic structures formed at moderate-burial depths show an average permeability contrast of −2.51 ± 0.99 ( Cataclastic structures found at deep burial depths show an average permeability contrast of −1.89 ± 1.13 ( Cataclastic bands formed at moderate burial depths involve greater permeability reduction than bands initiated at shallow burial depths ( Permeability data of cataclastic deformation structures were classified as a function of the current host sandstone porosity for bands found in: (1) low-porosity (<15%), (2) intermediate-porosity (15%–25%), and (3) high-porosity sandstones (>25%) ( Cataclastic structures found in low-porosity sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.83 ± 1.30 ( Cataclastic structures found in intermediate-porosity sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.66 ± 1.22 ( Cataclastic structures found in high-porosity sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −2.05 ± 0.98 ( Cataclastic bands found in host sandstones of low-porosity involve greater average permeability reduction but slightly less maximum permeability contrast than bands from intermediate and high-porosity sandstones ( Less average permeability reduction is observed in bands formed in intermediate-porosity sandstones than for bands formed in high-porosity ones ( Permeability data were classified as a function of the host-sandstone grain size and grain sorting in bands formed in: (1) coarse-grained sandstones where the mean grain diameter > 0.375 mm, (2) fine-grained sandstones where the grain diameter < 0.375 mm; (3) well-sorted sandstones, and (4) poorly-sorted sandstones ( Cataclastic structures formed in coarse-grained sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.76 ± 1.26 ( Cataclastic structures formed in fine-grained sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.65 ± 0.99 ( Cataclastic structures formed in well-sorted sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.8 ± 0.98 ( Cataclastic structures formed in poorly-sorted sandstones show an average permeability contrast of −1.62 ± 1.24 ( No clear difference in permeability value is observed for bands formed in coarse- and fine-grained sandstones ( Cataclastic bands formed in well-sorted sandstones involve slightly greater average permeability contrasts and a greater proportion of bands showing permeability reductions >2 orders of magnitude than bands from poorly-sorted sandstones ( The normal-fault regime and the presence of fault zones favor the formation of deformation bands and fault cores showing intense cataclasis and large permeability decrease, whereas moderate cataclasis and permeability are recorded in bands formed in the thrust-fault regime and in areas devoid of a fault ( The influence of burial depth on band permeability in porous sandstone reservoirs can be explained by the related progressive increase in confining pressure, temperature, and thus host sandstone lithification (mechanical compaction and cementation), although the influence of these parameters can be opposed ( Lesser confining pressures favor grain rearrangement and particulate flow, whereas greater confining pressure, generating higher stress concentrations at grain contact points, leads to cataclastic flow ( Poor lithification of host material, i.e. no cementation and low-packing density generally associated with high porosity, favors grain rearrangement ( The high permeability contrasts observed at moderate burial depth, as compared to shallow conditions, can be explained by both higher confining pressure and degree of host sandstone lithification ( Only limited influences of host sandstone porosity, grain size and grain sorting are revealed by this analysis on cataclastic band type and related permeability reduction ( No significant influence of grain size was identified on the permeability contrasts between cataclastic bands and host sandstones ( Poor sorting is considered a favorable condition for grain rearrangement ( This analysis confirms that permeability decrease is as a function of cataclasis intensity in bands, from low-permeability reduction in crush microbreccia of PCBs and SECBs to high-permeability reduction in cataclasites/ultracataclasites of shear bands (band clusters, slipped bands and fault cores). This analysis emphasizes that cataclasis and permeability reductions are controlled by: Tectonic regime and presence of a fault: Burial depth: The host-sandstone characteristics constitute second-order factors that can influence the permeability of cataclastic bands in specific cases, depending on the external factors.
