Structural mortars constitute one of the most diffuse geomaterials, with stones and bricks, in ancient monuments and architectural complexes, especially related to the Roman civilization, which pushed the binder technology to technical levels unsurpassed until post-industrial revolution times. The archaeometric study of mortars is an essential tool to extrapolate great amounts of information concerning supply of raw materials, technological skills of the ancient civilizations and, finally, relative and absolute chronologies of diachronic construction phases, both related to ancient and modern architectural modifications of the buildings. In this contribution, a novel approach for the quantitative mineralogical analysis of ancient mortars is proposed. The analytical process is based on the integrated application of quantitative phase analysis (QPA) of mineral components by means of the Rietveld method applied to X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data and multivariate statistical treatment of the obtained results by means of the principal component analysis. The methodology has been applied on a wide set of binding materials sampled from different structural elements of the Sarno Baths, a five-storey building located in the Pompeii archaeological site. The building is characterized by a marked complexity both in terms of structural layout and constructive techniques, being the result of several modifications in ancient times from the Late Republican age up to the Vesuvius eruption in 79 AD. Furthermore, several poorly documented restorations have been performed between the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century AD. In this perspective, a quantitative characterization of the employed mortars resulted useful not only to define ancient constructive technologies and relative chronologies, but also to discriminate between the original and restored parts of the building for the execution of adequate restoration procedures. The statistical clustering of the quantitative XRPD data clearly defined two ancient constructive phases and allowed a precise definition of the structural elements rebuilt in recent times. Furthermore, the obtained results have been cross-checked with additional analyses, namely XRD analyses on the separated binder fractions, petrographic analyses and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive microanalyses. Such multi-analytical approach allowed the detailed characterization of the employed raw materials, of the pozzolanic reactions between binder and aggregate and of the textural and microstructural characteristics of the mortars. The data interpretation yielded interesting insights both on the advanced optimization of mix designs of binding materials in Roman times, to improve the structural properties of the architectural elements according to their functions, and on the formulation of the restoration products during the historic excavations in Pompeii.Decodifying mural stratigraphic sequences of ancient architectural structures has always been one of the crucial aims in archaeological research, owing its enormous potentialities in defining not only the constructive phases of complex buildings, but also the technological evolution of the construction practices over the entire service life of the structures and beyond. In this perspective, the contribution of modern archaeometrical research on the analysis of structural binding materials like bedding mortars and concretes proved to be a fundamental weapon for the definition of construction techniques and relative chronologies of ancient architecture. This is mainly due to their widespread utilization in the past, and owing the fact that they generally constitute a univocal compositional proxy for each single construction phase The potentialities of heritage science in interpreting synchronic and diachronic evolutions of archaeological contexts is proved by several recent studies, employing mainly a mix of petrographic, geochemical and microstructural approaches The Sarno Bath complex in Pompeii (Naples, southern Italy) is a clear example of intricated structural palimpsest generated after numerous and not well-defined architectural modifications both in ancient and modern times. Situated in the south-western part of Pompeii ( According to most of the scholars The Sarno Baths remained buried under the pumices until the end of the 19th century, when in few years (1887–1893) the majority of the complex, starting from the upper level, was dug up under the supervision of Antonio Sogliano and August Mau New restoration works were performed starting from the 1930s under the supervision of Amedeo Maiuri Each of the building phases and activities (ancient and modern) here briefly presented (see Starting from the positive outputs obtained in a recent study of evolution of the flooring Vitruvian recipes in the city of Aquileia The sampling of the structural mortars was preceded by an accurate on-site survey to define the most suitable samples to collect in terms of archaeological and architectural significance. A total number of 47 samples was taken, limiting the area of investigation to the fully preserved levels of the building (level −3 and level −4) and to the external façade and taking into account only structural mortars (bedding mortars and concretes). Samples were removed mechanically with hammers and chisels, paying attention in avoiding external and clearly altered portions, in order to study materials as close as possible to the original conservation state. The full list of analyzed materials is reported in Table S1, together with their position and structural element of pertinence (either perimeter walls, internal walls or vaults). A detailed map with the sample positions is reported in Mineralogical analyses were performed both on the bulk fragments of mortar (both binder and aggregate) and on selected binder-concentrated samples through X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). As for the bulk samples, the analyses were carried out after micronization of the materials through a McCrone micronizing mill, using a plastic jar with agate grinding elements and ethanol 99% as micronizing fluid, while the binder-concentrated samples were obtained through the Cryo2Sonic 2.0 separation procedure The mineralogical data were crosschecked through petrographic analyses, following macroscopic and microstratigraphic analytical procedures for the study of mortar-based building materials described in UNI Norm 11176:2006 “Cultural heritage - Petrographic description of a mortar". The study was performed both on massive portions, through macroscopic and stereomicroscope observations, and by transmitted polarized light optical microscopy (TL-OM) on 30 μm thin sections. Finally, the thin section samples were microstructurally and microchemically characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDS). A CamScan MX2500 scanning electron microscope has been used, equipped with a LaB The quantitative mineralogical profiles of the analyzed mortars (Table S1) highlighted a dominant occurrence of silicate phases for all the samples, namely labradoritic plagioclase, sanidine (both pure and Na-substituted, but never simultaneously present in the same sample), leucite, augite, biotite and analcime, with a sporadic occurrence of amphibole. The clear volcanic origin of such phases indicates the utilization of locally available materials as aggregate fraction The multivariate statistical treatment of the mineralogical dataset by principal component analysis, performed excluding sample M150 of clear modern origin and recalculating the quantitative profiles excluding the alteration phases, allowed to evaluate the correlations between the primary phases, leading to a clear clustering of the analyzed mortars into four groups ( Group 1 is strongly correlated with the abundance of augite, leucite and sanidine, while the correlation with calcite suggests the occurrence of high amounts of carbonated binder. The analyses by TL-OM and SEM-EDS fully confirmed the mineralogical observations: the aggregate fraction of the materials is entirely constituted by euhedral subangular crystals of clinopyroxene ( Group 2 is strongly correlated with the abundance of Na-sanidine, analcime and amorphous fraction. While the cross-correlation between analcime and amorphous phase may suggest a high amount of glassy volcanic aggregate, being zeolites widely attested as secondary alteration products of hypohyaline volcanic rocks Group 3, constituted by two samples (M206 A, M212), shows strong correlation of with hematite and labradorite: these phases are related to the aggregate fraction, entirely constituted of reddish vesicular phonolitic tephrite grains with hypohyaline texture ( Group 4 is constituted by two isolated samples (M136, M153) characterized by an aggregate fraction rich in labradorite and Na-sanidine crystals. A first compositional insight on the binding matrices of group 1 mortars is given by the ratios of carbonate vs. amorphous and hydrated phases extrapolated from the bulk mineralogical profiles ( The principal component analysis on the bulk mineralogical profiles of group 2 mortars highlighted a clustering to positive PC1 values of the samples taken from the −4 level ( Finally, the samples of group 3 are characterized by a relevant occurrence of crystalline carbonate-AFm phase in the binding matrices, associated with calcite formed after partial carbonation of the lime binder ( The definition of chronological constraints on representative samples of each mineralogical group allowed to interpret the heterogeneous distribution of the binding materials in terms of architectural development of the building over time. More in detail, sample M159 from group 1 has been taken from a partition wall of the Reinterpreting the spatial distribution of the samples in this perspective ( Concerning the cement-containing sample (M150) and the materials of group 4, their relation to more recent restoration interventions is corroborated by the position in relation to group 1 samples and by the nature of the structural element of pertinence (e.g. internal walls and vaults). Finally, group 3 materials can be considered as reference mortars for the first construction phase of the complex, owing their location in proximity to the NW perimeter wall, recognized by Ioppolo as a remnant of the foundational wall sustaining the upper Republican Apart from the recognition of the different construction phases, crucial technological details on the construction materials employed over time can be determined through the analyses of the binding matrices. Concerning the restoration materials, the utilization of local volcanic sand with high crystalline fraction and low pozzolanic activity indicates the intentional formulation of mix designs aimed at promoting pure aerial reaction processes by lime carbonation. The only exception is related to the structural mortars used for the restoration of the vaults sustaining the On the other hand, the original binding materials are characterized by the utilization of poorly crystalline aggregate fractions rich in fine volcanic ashes and characterized by relevant pozzolanic reactivity, which allowed to shift the reaction path of the binding matrices towards the formation of insoluble Ca-based hydrous compounds characterized by higher mechanical performances and durability with respect to standard aerial binders Furthermore, the mineralogical characteristics of the early Imperial binding materials gave information on the architectural optimization of the mix designs and on the crucial role of the constituents proportions in the triggering of the binder reaction processes. Firstly, the statistical analysis of the quantitative mineralogical profiles indicated the adoption of higher binder to aggregate ratios for the mortars of the lower −4 level. This can be interpreted as a structural solution employed by Roman masons to increase the load-bearing capacity of complex multi-story buildings like the one analyzed, in accordance with the widely attested Roman tendency to variate the composition of masonry along the height of buildings (as regards Pompeii, see On the other hand, the heterogeneous reaction paths observed in the analyzed mortars can be interpreted in the framework of the competition between carbonation and hydration in lime-pozzolan binding systems. The reaction kinetics is strongly influenced by the solubility properties of reactants, especially pozzolan, by environmental factors, mainly CO MS, CP and AA designed research; GA and JB supervised the research project; MS, CP, AA, SD and CC performed the samplings; GZ and AK performed the samples preparation; MS, AA and AK analyzed the samples; MS and AA performed the data processing and interpretation; CP performed the architectural analysis and definition of the building phases; all the authors contributed in the writing of the manuscript.
