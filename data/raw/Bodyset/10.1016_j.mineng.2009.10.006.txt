Mineralogical analyses of the saprolitic laterite material have been characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). Results showed that the saprolitic laterite material consists mainly of nickel-substituted lizardite showing the pebble-like morphology and traces of magnetite and phlogopite. Leaching results showed that as much as 84.8% nickel could be leached under the experimental conditions of 10% (v/v) H2SO4, 90°C reaction temperature, leached within 5min, particle size d

The kinetics of nickel and magnesium leaching from the saprolitic laterite material have been investigated in a mechanically stirred reactor and the activation energies were determined to be 53.9kJmol−1 for nickel and 59.4kJmol−1 for magnesium respectively, which are characteristic for a chemical reaction controlled process. The similarity of the activation energies of nickel and magnesium leaching from the saprolitic laterite material by sulphuric acid means that nickel in lizardite is loosely bound within the octahedral layer and almost all of the nickel could be leached simultaneously with magnesium but without complete decomposition of the silicate structure.Due to continuous depletion of high grade nickel sulfides, there is an increasing focus on the processing of the huge reserves of nickel-rich laterite as it hosts most of the world land-based nickel resources, comprising about 60% of the total 130 million tons of nickel reserves ( Nickel-rich laterite ores are difficult to dissolve in ordinary mineral acid solution at atmospheric pressure, as laterite ores are residual products derived from a wide variety of rocks by intensive chemical weathering under strongly oxidizing and leaching conditions which leads to the incorporation of nickel into the crystal structure of laterite ores ( The development of new technologies may make the processing of such ores economically feasible ( The aims of the present work were firstly to investigate the effects of reaction time and temperature on nickel and magnesium dissolution from a typical saprolitic laterite material. Secondly, the kinetics and mechanism of nickel and magnesium dissolution from a lizardite-rich saprolitic laterite material, especially the relationship and interaction of their dissolution behavior, were studied. Mineralogical analyses of the raw saprolitic laterite material, which were an essential step to interpret the leaching mechanism, were used to support the observed metal dissolution behavior. Saprolitic laterites material from Yuanjiang nickel deposit located in Southwestern China were used during the experiments. After drying at 105 Chemical leaching tests were performed in a 500 Chemical analyses and the spot EDAX of the saprolitic laterite material are shown in Mineralogical analyses revealed that the complex ore is mainly made up of oxide minerals typically consisting of nickel-substituted lizardite revealing the pebble-like morphology ( In order to investigate the effect of reaction time and temperature on metal extraction from saprolitic laterite material, a series of leaching experiments were performed under the experimental condition of particle size The effect of reaction time and temperature on magnesium extraction from saprolitic laterite material has the similar trend with that of nickel ( Kinetics analysis was performed based on experimental data for dissolution of nickel and magnesium from saprolitic laterite material ( In a fluid–solid reaction system, the reaction rate is generally controlled by one of the following steps: diffusion through the fluid film, diffusion through the ash (or solid product) layer on the particle surface or the chemical reaction at the surface of the core of reacted particles ( The apparent rate constant can be used for determining the temperature dependency by Arrhenius’ law By plotting the apparent rate constants for each experiment in an Arrhenius plot, the activation energy was determined. Saprolitic laterite ores were leached at different temperatures under the experimental conditions of particle size The activation energy of a chemically controlled process is usually greater than 41.8 The activation energy of nickel and magnesium dissolution from saprolitic laterite material are consistent with the value of the activation energy of 46 Literature on the acid extraction of saprolitic laterite ores under atmospheric leaching conditions implies that serpentine minerals are leached relatively easily while other minerals present in saprolitic laterite ores such as magnetite/maghemite and chromite, remain relatively untouched in acidic solution, even after long periods of extraction ( XRD of the solid residues leached with sulphuric acid for 5 From the above leaching results, the kinetics analysis of nickel and magnesium extraction from saprolitic laterite material and the leaching residues characterization, it indeed indicated that nickel is loosely bound within the octahedral layer and the conditions are sufficiently corrosive enough to change the structure of the lizardite markedly and cause decomposition to silica. Leaching of the saprolitic laterite material by sulphuric acid at atmospheric pressure shows that nickel in lizardite is loosely bound within the octahedral layer and as much as 84.8% nickel could be leached under the experimental conditions of 10% (v/v) H Reaction temperature was found to have a large effect on the dissolution of lizardite in sulphuric acid. The extraction of nickel and magnesium increases with increasing reaction temperature and time. The activation energies determined for nickel and magnesium extraction from saprolitic laterite material with sulphuric acid were approximately the same thus suggesting that the same mechanism was at work. The dissolution kinetics was found to fit well to the shrinking core model with chemical reaction as the rate controlling step.
