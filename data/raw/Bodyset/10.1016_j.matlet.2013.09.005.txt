Formation of metastable precipitates in the binary Mg–Sn alloy has been investigated in the present study. The Mg–1.5at%Sn solid solution alloy exhibits two exothermic reactions during heating up to 673K, where lower temperature reaction with onset temperature of 364K corresponds to the formation of metastable DO19 type precipitates, while higher temperature reaction with onset temperature of 466K to the formation of stable Mg2Sn precipitates. The comparison of aging behavior at 423K and 473K indicates that lower temperature aging at 423K results in retardation of peak aging time, but higher peak hardness due to the precipitation of DO19 type phase.Recently, development of new Mg based alloys attracts large attention since there is a strong demand of light-weight casting or wrought alloys for weight reduction of transportation vehicles So far, only stable Mg The alloy ingot with a nominal composition of Mg–1.5  Since there are no previous reports which can explain the 1st exothermic reaction, the activation energy for the 1st exothermic reaction has been measured from the heating rate dependence of peak temperature by means of the analysis devised by Kissinger It has been shown that the peak aged microstructure consists of relatively coarse Mg We have investigated on the formation of DO This study was supported by the World Premier Materials (WPM) Project funded by the
