In order to investigate the effect of butanol on quartz flotation when N-dodecyl ethylenediamine (ND) was used as collector, single mineral flotation and artificial mixed mineral (hematite and quartz were mixed at a mass ratio of 3:2) separation were conducted in the laboratory. Experimental results indicated that addition of butanol could improve the collecting performance of ND on quartz and enhance the floatability of quartz. Best flotation recovery of quartz was obtained when butanol was mixed with ND at a mass ratio of 1:1. Moreover, the molecular structure of alcohols had a significant effect on mineral recovery. Best separation efficiency could be obtained when tert-butanol was added as it had the largest cross-sectional area. Zeta potential measurements indicated that alcohols could strengthen electrostatic adsorption between quartz and collector. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that co-adsorption of alcohols along with ND had taken place on the quartz surface, and ND/tert-butyl combinations were more easily absorbed on the quartz surface.
