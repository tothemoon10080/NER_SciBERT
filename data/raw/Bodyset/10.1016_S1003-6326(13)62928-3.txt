Surface morphology and inner structure of the dust were observed by ICP-AES, SEM-EDS and XRD to examine the strengthening measures of leaching potassium salt from the sintering dust by water. The results showed that the main component of the sintering dust was iron–oxygen compound, with KCl adsorbed on its surface. Leaching experiments showed that the KCl in the ESP dust could be separated and recovered by water leaching and fractional crystallization. The yield of K–Na vaporized crystalline salt was 18.56%, in which the mass fractions of KCl, NaCl, CaSO4 and K2SO4 were about 61.21%, 13.40%, 14.62% and 10.86%, respectively. The leaching kinetics of potassium salt from the sintering dust fits the external diffusion model well. The leaching speed and the leaching rate of the potassium salt can be increased by increasing the leaching temperature, strengthening the stirring speed and increasing the liquid–solid ratio.
