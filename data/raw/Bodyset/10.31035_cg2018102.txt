The porphyry copper deposits (PCD) are usually hosted in a multistage intrusive complex but only causallyrelated tospecific magma of high oxidation state and water content. The copper enrichment of the porphyry system is caused by accumulation during magmatic differentiation ( The Sungun deposit in NW Iran, contains 850 Mt of ore reserves at an average grade of 0.62% Cu and 0.01% Mo, is one of the largest PCD in the Tethyan Orogen ( Detailed field mappinghad identified the main rock types of the Sungun deposit, including Cretaceous limestone, Oligocene monzonite and quartz monzonite, Miocene Sungun stock, and overlying and esite lava. The Sungun stock consists of three successive intrusions: (1) granodioritic porphyry with intense mineralization, (2) biotite dioritic dyke with minor mineralization, and (3) barren andesitic dyke. To determine the exact emplacement age of the three intrusions, we collect three samples for separating zircons for U–Pb dating. The GPS locations are 38°42'09″ N, 46°42'22″ E for granodioritic porphyry (sample No. I13-99), 38°39'57″ N, 46°40'40″ E for biotite dioritic dyke (sample No. I13-124), and 38°39'30″ N, 46°40'18 ″ E for andesitic dyke (sample No. I13-126), respectively. Zircon grains were separated using conventional heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques. U–Pb dating was performed using the SHRIMP II instrument at the Beijing SHRIMP Center, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing, China. Zircons from granodioritic porphyry are long prismatic crystals with clear oscillatory zoning during CL imaging. All of the 19 analyses yielded a weighted mean (i) Multiphase intrusions of the Sungun stock emplaced at 21.39 ± 0.16 Ma, 20.39 ± 0.33 Ma, and 19.34 ± 0.32 Ma, respectively. (ii) The ore causative porphyry crystallized earlier than other intrusions in the Sungun deposit.
