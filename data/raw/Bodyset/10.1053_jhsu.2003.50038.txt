Purpose: To review the functional outcome of AO type C distal humeral fractures (bicondylar fractures) managed with dual orthogonal plate fixation. Method: Twenty-three patients were reviewed retrospectively at a mean of 45.1 months. Patient-rated outcomes (Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand [DASH], Patient Rated Ulnar Nerve Evaluation [PRUNE], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow form [ASES-e], and Short Form-36 [SF-36]), clinical, radiographic, and objective evaluations were used to assess outcomes. Results: Almost 40% of patients required a third plate for adequate fixation. Patients identified minimal subjective deficits (10%) with a mean satisfaction of 93%. The arc of motion was decreased in the flexion-extension plane (122° relative to 138°, p < .01), whereas strength was lower for both elbow flexion-extension and forearm rotation (p < .05). The overall complication rate was 48%, however, most were minor and resolved without further surgery. No ulnar neuropathies were identified at follow-up after routine ulnar nerve transposition. Conclusions: Outcomes of AO type C distal humeral fractures were good with dual orthogonal plating, ulnar nerve transposition, and early motion. Additional plating may be required with distal fracture patterns or osteopenic bone. (J Hand Surg 2003;28A:294-308. Copyright © 2003 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.)
