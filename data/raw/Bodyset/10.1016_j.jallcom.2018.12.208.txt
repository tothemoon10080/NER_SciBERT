A specimen with a newly designed composition was produced using shielded metal arc welding by changing the Nb content. To evaluate the susceptibility of ductility-dip cracking (DDC), tensile test and hardness measurement were performed, and to examine the behaviors of precipitates during heat treatment, the microstructures were observed using an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. As the Nb content increased, the hardness of the specimen improved through solution hardening, and as the hardness increased, the yield strength in the tensile test results increased. Furthermore, as the Nb content increased, the amount of Cr-rich carbide precipitated at the grain boundary decreased and the amount of transgranular Nb-rich carbides increased. This increased the susceptibility of DDC and the critical strain at which the DDC begins to appear at tension increased. The microstructure analysis of a specimen heat-treated at 715 °C revealed that the intergranular Cr-rich carbides became continuous and coarse through the diffusion of Cr, and the tensile test results showed that DDC occurred at a strain lower than that of the as-weld specimen. In the specimen heat-treated at 1100 °C, the intergranular Cr-rich carbides were melted and the intergranular precipitates were removed.Inconel 690 is a nickel alloy used as a major material in nuclear power pressure equipment owing to its excellent corrosion resistance and high-temperature characteristics. The welding methods generally used when this alloy is applied to nuclear power plants are gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW). The demand for Inconel 690 is increasing in the space industry as well owing to its excellent high-temperature properties. As a filler metal, AWS A5.14 ER NiCrFe-7, also known as FM-52, is used mainly in the welding of Ni-Cr alloys such as Inconel 600 and 690, and dissimilar metal bonding of Ni alloy, carbon steel, and stainless steel. Initially, Inconel 600 was used in overlay welding in nuclear power plants, but as it was susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking, it was replaced with Inconel 690, which has a higher Cr content. However, Inconel 690 welding metals are susceptible to high-temperature cracking and defects such as pores and penetration failures. In particular, they are susceptible to ductility-dip cracking (DDC), which is caused by a sudden decrease in ductility at 0.5–0.8 Cracks in welding part can be classified into high-temperature cracks and low-temperature cracks. Low-temperature cracks are also called delayed cracks or hydrogen cracks. They are generated by diffusible hydrogen at a temperature below 200 °C at some time after welding, rather than immediately after welding. On the contrary, high-temperature cracks are typically generated at a high temperature during cooling after welding or during reheating via subsequent welding. They are subcategorized into solidification cracking, liquation cracking, and DDC. The generation of these cracks can be observed immediately after welding. DDC is caused not by the generation of a liquid film owing to constitutional liquation at a high temperature, but by the reduction of intergranular ductility. Similar to most high-temperature cracks, the susceptibility of DDC increases and the ductility-dip temperature zone also expands as the content of impurities such as P and S increases. Furthermore, an appropriate welding method and a filler metal with an appropriate composition must be selected because impurities may precipitate at the grain boundary, which increases the susceptibility to cracking, depending on the welding method, cooling speed, etc. [ The grain boundary generated in the solidification process after welding of Inconel 690 is called solidification grain boundary (SGB). After completion of solidification, the grain boundary is moved by the welding heat while the weld is cooled to room temperature. This moved grain boundary is called migrated grain boundary (MGB). According to previous studies, applying filler metals such as FM-52M and FM-52MSS, which were produced by adding Nb, Mo, etc. to FM-52, decreased the susceptibility of DDC by changing the intergranular shape of Inconel 690. If Nb, Mo, etc. are added, coarse MC carbides are formed in the matrix, which interfere with the movement of grain boundary through pinning. Thus, the MGB generated by the movement of SBG is formed in a tortuous shape. Tortuous MGB has been known to improve the DDC resistance in the ductility dip zone by preventing the sliding of grain boundary [ Many recent studies have investigated the grain boundary, which is the starting point of cracks. In general, carbides of Therefore, in this study, a SMAW welding rod is designed with varying Nb contents in a welding wire based on the composition of FM-52. Subsequently, the change in DDC resistance according to the Nb content was observed by adjusting the formation of Welding was performed using a base metal produced through two-layer buttering welding on the KS SM490 carbon steel, and four types of welding rods were designed by adjusting the Nb(+Ta) content to 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 wt% based on the composition of FM-52. The chemical composition of each specimen is shown in The main welding of the specimen was performed after two-layer buttering welding on SM490 after V-groove of 60°. SMAW was performed by 23 passes in nine layers by using SM490, which is the same material as the base metal, for the back plate. The root gap was 13 mm, and the current was DCRP(+). A schematic of the specimen is shown in The specimen in a quartz tube was heat-treated at 715 °C for 5 h and at 1100 °C for 1 h while it was sealed in Ar atmosphere using a vacuum pumping system (Korea Vacuum Co., Korea). For the tensile test specimen, a subsize specimen with a gauge length of 25 mm was produced in accordance with the ASTM standard. The specimen was collected by mixing weld metal and base metal perpendicularly to the welding direction. Tensile tests were performed at room temperature, at 5% strain, at 10% strain, and at 15% strain with the welded specimen and the specimen heat-treated at 715 °C for 5 h in Ar atmosphere. The specimens were polished to #400–#1200 using an auto polisher (MetPrep 3™, Allied, USA) and precision-polished with 3 μm and 1 μm diamond pastes. Subsequently, the hardness of the specimens was measured using a micro Vickers hardness tester (Matuzawa MXT 70) with a load of 300 gf and a load time of 5 s. After it was measured 10 times in 0.5 mm intervals from 5 cm from the face, the mean value was determined. To observe the microstructure of the specimens, they were polished to #400∼#1200 and thereafter precision-polished with 3 μm and 1 μm diamond pastes. Marble reagent (         The present study examined the resistance of Inconel 690 to DDC according to Nb content. The study results on the resistance to DDC of the specimen welded via SMAW with a newly developed welding material with different Nb contents are as follows. As the Nb content increased, because of solution hardening the hardness and tensile strength increased, but the elongation decreased. Compared with specimen No.1, specimens No. 2 to 4 showed higher elongations. The tensile test under 5% and 10% strains resulted in DDC only in specimens No.1 and 2, and the tensile test under 15% strain generated DDC in all the specimens. When the microstructures were observed, specimens No.1 and 2 with low Nb contents generated long When the initiation point of cracks was analyzed, the crack started at the boundary between the When the microstructure of the specimen heat-treated for 5 h at 715 °C was analyzed, the intergranular When the microstructure of the specimen heat-treated for 1 h at 1100 °C was analyzed, the intergranular The raw/processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time due to legal or ethical reasons.
