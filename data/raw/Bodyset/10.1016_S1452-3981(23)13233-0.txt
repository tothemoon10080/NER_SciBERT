The mass transport and potential characterization were carried out in a flow-through porous electrode reactor. Carbon particles of three different sizes were used as porous electrode. Silver electrodeposition from an alkaline ammonia electrolyte is used as a test system. The experimental mass transport characterization (k

The experimental potential drop in the flow-through porous electrode is also reported. The mass transport and potential characterization have been conducted to identify suitable operating conditions.
