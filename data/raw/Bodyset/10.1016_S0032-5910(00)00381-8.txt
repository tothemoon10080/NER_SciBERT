Positive effects of milling Al(OH)3 prior to mix with Ca(OH)2 are elucidated to develop a rapid hardener for portland cement. With the hardener thus obtained, compressive strength of portland cement exceeds 5 MPa within 2 h. Rapid formation of calcium aluminate hydrate (CAH) in cement paste is found to be a key issue. Milling a mixture of Al(OH)3 and Ca(OH)2 in contrast, results in an in situ formation of CAH to decrease considerably the effect of rapid hardening.Calcium aluminate, a minor component in conventional portland cement, plays a unique role in rapid hardening In this paper, we try to synthesize calcium aluminate without heating. Syntheses of complex oxides via a mechanochemical route have been systematically studied by Senna et al. We have reported fabrication of Al(OH) Thermal transformation processes of Al(OH) Al(OH) Two schemes of preparation are displayed in An agitation mill Specific surface area was obtained by a conventional BET method with N Compressive strength of the cement at the early stage of hydration was used as a main tool to evaluate the effect of the activated mixture serving as a hardener. After admixing the hardener by 13 wt.% to an ordinary portland cement (Taiheyo Cement, Tokyo, Japan), water was added to give the water/solid weight ratio 0.3. We chose 13 wt.%, since it is the maximum concentration to keep the fluidity of cement paste for casting a test piece. Compressive strength of the hardened body was measured by the standard method (ASTM C39-86) 1.5â€“6 h after adding water. Using a conduction calorimeter  From these results, we conclude that milling Al(OH)   When CPA is added to water, the pH of the solution is increased by dissolution of the Ca(OH) By milling an Al(OH) As shown in  For a rapid hardener, we found it decisive to activate Al(OH)
