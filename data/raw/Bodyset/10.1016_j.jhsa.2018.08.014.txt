Bridge plate fixation has traditionally been described for the treatment of high-energy distal radius fractures with extensive comminution, associated instability, and polytrauma with the need for immediate upper extremity assisted weight bearing. Certain patient populations who may similarly benefit from such effective and expedient stabilization include patients with multiple comorbidities who may have lower-energy fractures, poor bone quality, and a baseline reliance on ambulatory assist devices. This article reviews treatment considerations for distal radius fractures in low-demand patients and explores the rationale and technique of bridge plate fixation in this population.
