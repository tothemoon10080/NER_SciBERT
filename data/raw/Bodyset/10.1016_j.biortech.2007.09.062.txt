Biosorption of cadmium (II) ions from aqueous solution onto immobilized cells of Pycnoporus sanguineus (P. sanguineus) was investigated in a batch system. Equilibrium and kinetic studies were conducted by considering the effect of pH, initial cadmium (II) concentration, biomass loading and temperature. Results showed that the uptake of cadmium (II) ions increased with the increase of initial cadmium (II) concentration, pH and temperature. Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models were used to analyze the equilibrium data at different temperatures. Langmuir isotherm model described the experimental data well followed by Redlich–Peterson and Freundlich isotherm models. Biosorption kinetics data were fitted using pseudo-first, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion. It was found that the kinetics data fitted well the pseudo-second-order followed by intraparticle diffusion. Thermodynamic parameters such as standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG
                     0), standard enthalpy (ΔH
                     0) and standard entropy (ΔS
                     0) were evaluated. The result showed that biosorption of cadmium (II) ions onto immobilized cells of P. sanguineus was spontaneous and endothermic nature.Redlich–Peterson isotherm constant (L/mg) intraparticle diffusion constant Redlich–Peterson isotherm constant equilibrium concentration (mg/L) initial concentration (mg/L) final or equilibrium concentration (mg/L) activation energy (kJ/mol) free energy change (J/mol) standard enthalpy (kJ/mol) rate constant of first-order biosorption (min rate constant of second-order biosorption (g/mg/min) equilibrium constant (L/mg) equilibrium constant (L/mg) Freundlich constant Redlich–Peterson isotherm constant (L/mg) intraparticle diffusion constant (mg/(g/min Freundlich constant metal ions biosorbed per g of biomass (mg/g) maximum specific uptake corresponding (mg/g) to the sites saturation amount of metal ions uptake at equilibrium (mg/g) amounts of adsorbed Cd (II) ions on the (mg/g) biosorbent at time t percent metal adsorbed (%) standard entropy (J/mol/K) volume of metal solution in the flask (L) weight of biosorbent (g) The presence of industrial effluent containing heavy metals into freshwater poses serious problems to the ecological system including humans as they are toxic even at low concentration ( For the past few decades, the metal biosorption by various biological materials including fungi, algae, bacteria and yeast have received great attention as it offer a low cost biosorbent, high efficiency and can be regenerated ( Cell immobilization is one of the methods used to overcome the incorporating free suspended cell in industrial operations.
