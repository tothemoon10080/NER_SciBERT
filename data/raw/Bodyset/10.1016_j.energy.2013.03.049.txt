The effect of the relative hot-to-cold side volume-ratios on dynamic characteristics of a CBC (closed Brayton cycle) with sCO2 (supercritical carbon-dioxide) as the working-fluid is investigated in this study. The analysis of the CBC is conducted in the context of power generation in a direct-heated (no thermal-oil loop) and dry-cooled parabolic-trough solar thermal power plant, using a control-oriented model of the CBC. Dynamic performance of the sCO2 CBC with different relative volume-ratios between the hot and cold sides of the sCO2 CBC is compared using simulations for conditions on a representative summer day. The CBC hot-to-cold side volume-ratio influences CO2 mass movement and hence power output. Increasing the hot-to-cold side volume-ratio in the CBC results in a slower, more gradual dynamic response when there are fluctuations in solar heat input and ambient air temperatures. The dynamic response characteristics of a CBC with a hot-to-cold side volume-ratio less than one are shown to differ significantly from a CBC with a volume-ratio greater than or equal to one.Increasing the attractiveness and uptake of new solar thermal generation capacity will require making solar thermal electricity cost-competitive with conventional fossil-fuel based electricity. A reduction in power plant capital cost and increased thermal efficiencies delivered by the use of sCO Here we utilise heat input from parabolic-troughs as this proven technology has previously been used in medium- and large-scale solar power generation applications Significant changes in fluid properties, such as density and specific heat, of CO Employment of a direct-heated sCO The purpose of this analysis is to gain an understanding of the influence of sCO CO Investigations into the effects of different relative volume-ratios across the hot- and cold-sides of a 1-MWe sCO The objective of the analysis is to gain an understanding of the impact of the volume-ratios across the hot- and cold-sides of the sCO The simulated sCO Thermal-hydraulic behaviour of control-volumes within individual components in the model is determined using conservation laws of mass and energy. Pressure drops are considered negligible in the model based on the assumptions that the plant is well designed for minimal pressure losses and there are high pressures involved. Pre-existing basic pipe models in the Dymola The compressor and turbine are modelled as single-stage radial or centrifugal type turbomachines using a zero-dimensional model. A quasi-steady behaviour assumption has been utilised in turbomachinery modelling as these devices are relatively small (with negligible volumes) and have associated dynamics which are known to have much smaller time-constants compared to transient effects observed in heat-exchangers due to mass and energy storage The solar field thermal energy output for the representative summer day (21-Dec) at Longreach in Queensland, Australia used in this study, was previously presented in Ref.

Only slight deviations in CBC variables and net power generation result with a sCO Although an excessive turbine inlet temperature ( In the absence of control, excessive turbine inlet temperatures are attained much faster in a CBC with a smaller volume-ratio, especially when the volume-ratio is less than one. This can be attributed to the ability of the sCO The thermal efficiency of the sCO Similarly, non-condensing cooler heat rejection characteristics remain almost identical for the investigated CBC hot-to-cold side volume-ratios throughout the nominal solar insolation period (between 08:00 and 18:00) as shown in The difference in the resulting dynamic response between CBCs with different hot-to-cold side volume-ratios is dependent upon the movement of CO Although control of CO This study was supported by the  National Renewable Energy Laboratory closed Brayton cycle parabolic-trough collector supercritical carbon-dioxide National Institute of Standards and Technology reference fluid thermodynamic and transport properties
