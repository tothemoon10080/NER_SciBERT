Electron microscopy and diffraction experiments were carried out to analyze diffraction features and correlate with the striation contrast observed in the images of Al–Cu–Co–Si decagonal phase. There are two important diffraction features identified which include the diffuse streak and the extra satellite spots. The extra satellite spots can indicate some sort of superlattice chemical ordering among the clusters while the diffuse streaks indicate presence of some kind of phason disorder leading to the observation of striation contrast in the imaging modes.The basic structure of decagonal quasicrystal (DQC) was proposed by Steurer and Kuo An Al–Cu–Co–Si alloy, prepared by melting the constituent elements (close to the Al  Zhang et al. The diffuse streaks observed in the selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) are attributed to the presence of phason boundaries evolving from phason disorder. The structural rearrangement in the DQC phase leads to an unusual striation contrast in the images, giving rise to features with phason disorder which causes anisotropic diffuse streaks. The existence of weak superlattice sattelite spots indicates onset of ordering in decagonal structures. In the present study we have obtained a DQC phase which exhibits partially ordered superlattice structure along with certain amount of phason disorder. The authors would like to thank Dr. S.
