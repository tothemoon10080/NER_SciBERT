We read with pleasure the article written by Mohamed et al In the technique we described, The aim of this technique is to be readily accessible with a limited amount of surgical material, which they demonstrated well. It can be performed in any trauma centre or even in war zones or humanitarian settings, as the system works with various self-curing resins. However, when performed in specialised centres, we advocate the use of Ostron 100® (GC), as even if there is an exothermic reaction during curing, it is not sufficient to cause any cutaneous injury. We therefore never protect the skin during the setting reaction. We thank the authors, as we similarly think that this technique should be better known since it can be very helpful in complex situations. We have no conflicts of interest. No ethics approval required. No patients’ permission was necessary.
