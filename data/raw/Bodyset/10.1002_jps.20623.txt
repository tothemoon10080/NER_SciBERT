The penetration of crystalline ibuprofen particles into excised human skin membranes and model target gels on actuation with the PowderJect ND1 ballistic needle-free injector has been examined. The deliverable dose of powder exiting the device is approximately 50% of the total cassette loading; the rest is lost via a gap forced open between the injector base and the surface of the target gel. It could be shown that substantial comminution of two different ibuprofen particle size fraction (38–53 µm, 53–75 µm) occurs within the injector on actuation. This resulted in an equiparation of the two initially different size fractions. Reduced comminution occurs with an ibuprofen/PVP (95:5) particulate formed by spray-drying/compaction/milling. On actuation into excised human skin membranes approximately 37% of cassette dose is recovered from the stratum corneum by stripping, and only 3% from the epidermis. It is concluded that powder delivery is mainly intra-epidermal with few particles fully breaching the stratum corneum. This is a consequence of the relative magnitude of the particle diameter (approximately 48 µm) and the stratum corneum thickness (approximately 10 µm). A ‘soft’ polyethylene glycol monolayer target gel gives the closest total percentage recovery of powder to that seen with the excised human skin membranes. Bilayer gels differentiated between surface impact/retention and penetration, but were difficult to handle. Powder penetration studies should therefore preferentially to be performed with human skin-membranes. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.
