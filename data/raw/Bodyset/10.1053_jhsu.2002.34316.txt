A case of a young patient with a severely comminuted intra-articular distal radius fracture dislocation and severe injury of the distal radioulnar joint is presented. Early reconstruction of the sigmoid notch and radioulnar ligaments was performed using the remaining scaphoid facet of the distal radius articular surface, an autogenous tendon graft for ligament reconstruction, and radioscapholunate arthrodesis. The patient was able to return to his manual work without limitations. We present additional information on the comparative anatomy of the sigmoid notch and scaphoid facet that may guide surgeons in treating this severe injury. (J Hand Surg 2002;27A:729–734.
