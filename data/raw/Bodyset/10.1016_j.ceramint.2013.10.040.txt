The crystalline phase evolution during firing of glass-ceramic materials from residual E-glass fibres was investigated as a function of temperature and time. The thermal stability and the mechanism of crystallisation were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The mineralogical and microstructural characterisation of the sintered glass-ceramics was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The crystallisation behaviour was depicted by the TTT (Time–Temperature–Transformation) curve. The activation energies for crystallisation were calculated by the Friedman differential isoconversional, ASTM and Kissinger methods. The results show that devitrification of the glass leads to a series of glass-ceramic materials composed of wollastonite and plagioclase s.s. Their microstructure is composed of a dense network of crystals, which is responsible for the high mechanical properties exhibited by these materials.Glass-ceramics are ceramic materials produced from parent glasses by sequential thermal processes involving controlled crystallisation, which consists of the growth of one or more crystalline phases within the vitreous mass Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) is a composite material made of a polymer matrix (usually an epoxy, vinylester or polyester thermosetting plastic) reinforced with fibres (usually glass, carbon, basalt or aramid). The global production of FRPs increases every year, and output is expected to reach 10.3 A number of technologies have been proposed for recycling thermoset composites: mechanical comminution-based processes In recent studies It is known that the most important factors that affect the technical properties of glass-ceramics are the nature of the devitrified crystalline phases, their shape, size and spatial arrangement. Hence, this work analyses the evolution of the crystalline phases and microstructures during the crystallisation process of a glass derived from FGRP wastes. To a first valuation of the technological properties, the glass-ceramic crystallised for 20 The material used in the present work was a glass (hereafter referred to as PGF glass), pyrolytically generated from glass fibres recovered from waste composite materials. This composite was a fibreglass-reinforced polyester (FGRP) produced by POLIFIBRA, S.A. (Guadalajara, Spain), composed of unsaturated polyester resin (32.8 Prior to use, the recovered fibres (97 The chemical composition of the recovered glass fibre and the synthesised PFG glass was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) (Brucker model S8 Tiger with a tungsten tube, LiF crystal analyser and generator of 4 The PGF glass frits were was ground using a BIOMETAL RETSCH PM 100 ball mill at 400 The activation energy for crystallisation was calculated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on powder samples (80–100 The activation energy for the crystallisation process was calculated using the Friedman method (FR) For solid-state reactions, it is generally assumed that the rates of conversion are proportional to the concentration of the reacted material. The rate of conversion can be expressed by the following basic rate equation (Eq. By combining Eqs. By combining Eqs. Friedman analysis (FR), based on the Arrhenius equation, applies the logarithm of the conversion rate The analysis according to ASTM E698 The data were also analysed using the Kissinger method In a previous paper The development of the crystalline phases after thermal treatment of the PGF glass was studied on compacted glass samples. Powdered glass (80–100 The evaluation of the amorphous nature of the synthesised PFG glass and the mineralogical study of the crystalline phases devitrified after thermal treatment were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips model X’PERT MPD) with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation operating at 30 The microstructural analysis of the glass-ceramics was performed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (HITACHI model S-4800) operating at 20         Taking into consideration the intensity of both crystalline phases,  After the thermal treatment at 1000 For a previous knowledge of technological features of these materials, the glass-ceramic obtained after thermal treatment at 1030 The results of this work demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining wollastonite–plagioclase glass-ceramics by a sinter-crystallisation process derived from glass fibres recovered by pyrolysis of waste composite materials. The DSC curve shows two exothermic effects centred at 819–860 PGF glass begins to crystallise after 60 After firing, sintered glass-ceramics from PGF glass show a microstructure composed of a dense network of tightly interlocked wollastonite and plagioclase crystals.
