Contrary to general belief, arthroscopic assisted reduction in distal radius fractures can be done in an expeditious manner and with minimal consumption of operating room resources. This article presents the steps for a pleasant arthroscopic experience in detail. The technique proposed combines the benefits of rigid fixation with volar locking plates (for the extra-articular component) and arthroscopic control of the reduction (for the articular component). It is important that the operation be carried out using the dry arthroscopic technique. However, arthroscopy is just an addition to conventional methods. Thorough knowledge of and facility with classic techniques of distal radius fracture treatment is essential for a good result.
