The results of research of the volume ultrasonic waves propagation in the gas-containing iron ore slurry using ultrasonic phased array technology is presented.Ore crushing department is an intermediate link in the process line of mineral processing, however, despite this, it has a decisive influence on the course of subsequent operations, and the final performance of the whole beneficiating plant. Process optimization of mineral processing requires a rigorous mathematical and economic-mathematical methods for calculating the optimal separation limits The solution of this task allows to define both the best beneficiation technological line structure, and the technological units parameters providing its maximum productivity at set quality of the final product and the minimum costs for process. Various methods and devices of ultrasonic testing, which found application in process automation in The ultrasonic measurement methods in the practice of minerals beneficiation have been used primarily for determining the parameters of the pulp, as well as for liquid and lumpy materials level monitoring in process vessels. The known ultrasonic testing methods of the pulp parameters allow to identify two of its main characteristics – density and particle size distribution The purpose is to investigate the features of volume ultrasonic vibrations propagation in a randomly heterogeneous medium (gas containing iron ore pulp) in the process of natural and specially organized movement. The theoretical analysis results of the volume ultrasonic vibrations propagation in the gas containing suspensions is presented in The main characteristic of the ultrasonic radiation field Kinetic equation which is solved by function Under the phase coordinates means a series of variables The meaning of this equation is as follows: change in the intensity of the ultrasonic beam, which has a direction As the frequency increases sharply the ultrasonic waves scattering cross section on the solid particles increases. In this case, the radiation field is formed both with unscattered and scattered waves. The intensity of singly scattered waves can be found from the Eq. We are interested in the integrated intensity of singly scattered waves, ie value The expression for determining of this value at the point on the ultrasonic beam axis in a cylindrical coordinate system is given by Taking into account the approximations and conducting the integration in Let’s determine the value The value  Let the number of In this case, the attenuation of the ultrasonic wave passing the distance in the medium will be described by the expression The cross section of the ultrasound attenuation on solid phase particles defined above. The intensity of the wave In order to eliminate the effect of these fluctuations, it is necessary to measure the average value of If in the volume of In this case, the average value The final expression for 〈 The suspensions solid phase particles size distribution function typically described with lognormal distribution which can be represented as The plots of the particle size distribution function with a fixed value of the parameter The gas bubble size distribution function is experimentally determined, the form of which, for a typical case of the gas phase content in water is shown in If on the basis of experimental measurements determine the value of which, according to Eq. then it can be used to determine the fraction control class concentration of the slurry solid phase particles.  As we can see from The multifrequency measurements of ultrasound attenuation in real pulp were carried out using ultrasonic phased array technology, the main feature of which is a computer-controlled amplitude and phase of the excitation pulses in the multivariate individual piezoelectric transducer. Excitation of piezoelectric elements provided such way that to control the parameters of the ultrasound beam, e.g., an angle, focal length, focal spot size by the computer program The ultrasonic transducer which had the following characteristics defined by its material and geometry used in the simulation with software and hardware tools package TAC (Transducer Array Calculation) is presented on The acoustic pressure field of 25 – element transducer in the focal plane The dependence of the frequency from the amplitude and the angle calculated for the array directional diagram shown in The processes of volume ultrasonic waves propagation in the gas-containing iron ore pulp based on ultrasonic phased array are investigated. The gas bubble size distribution function in the range of radii of 10 It was found that the amount of high frequency ( In order to eliminate the influence of a randomly heterogeneous nature of the solid and gas pulp phases components on its characteristics measurement results, it is necessary to determine the intensity average value of the ultrasonic oscillations passed through investigated medium. For more effective control of the ultrasonic beam parameters, the studies were conducted using ultrasonic phased array technology.
