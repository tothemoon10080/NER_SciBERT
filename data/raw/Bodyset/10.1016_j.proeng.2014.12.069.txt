The realization of the earthwork represents a large part of the cost of construction works. Therefore, it is very important to determine the volume of the earthwork as accurately as possible. There are many ways how to determine its value. However, comparing the reasons of different methods we have discovered that results of quantification are often varying. In this paper, we will discuss the results of calculation of the volume by different methods. We will compare the conventional methods of the calculation with the differential exact calculation of using the digital terrain model derived by geodetic and photogrammetric methods.
