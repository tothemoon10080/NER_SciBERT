Fault diagnosis systems have attracted growing interest in a number of engineering fields. The number of applications has increased and successful results have been widely reported. This paper presents and outlines a fault diagnosis system for flash smelting. The system monitors the states of the process by means of Kohonen Self-Organising Maps and performs the fault diagnosis of the process equipment by analysing the operation of the process equipment. Finally the results of the off-line testing of the system are reported and discussed.
