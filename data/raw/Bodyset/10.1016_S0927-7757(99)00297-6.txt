Mechanochemical degradation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) adsorbed on synthetic birnessite (δ-MnO2) was investigated using heat conduction calorimetry. The overall transformation kinetics of 2,4-D on birnessite after light grinding were approximately first-order, with an apparent activation energy of approximately 37 kJ mol−1 for the range of temperatures 10–50°C. The two decomposition products detected under mechanochemical degradation and incubation were 2,4-dichlorophenol and CO2, but no consumption of gaseous oxygen was detected. A positive correlation was found between Mn(II) produced and CO2 evolved, suggesting that the decomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol involves the oxide substrate as a source of oxygen and yields Mn(II).The role of manganese oxides in promoting the non-photochemical oxidation of natural and xenobiotic organic compounds is well documented Cheney et al. In this paper, we describe the mechanochemical reaction that results from light grinding of 2,4-D with synthetic birnessite (δ-MnO Synthetic birnessite (δ-MnO Birnessite and 2,4-D were ground manually in air using an agate mortar (O.D 100 mm) and pestle. In one experiment, 300 mg birnessite were ground continuously for 5 min with 6 or 23 mg of 2,4-D, respectively. Thus the mass ratio of 2,4-D to birnessite in our samples was 0.33 or 9.00 mmol g Calorimetric measurements of the heat evolved from the transformation of 2,4-D ground with birnessite were performed using a differential-scanning heat-conduction calorimeter (Hart Scientific model 4100). This type of heat-conduction calorimeter measures power directly in μW. Duplicate samples of the ground 2,4-D and birnessite mixtures were measured isothermally at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50°C. The heat evolved was then normalized by dividing the net heat evolved ( Ground mixtures of 2,4-D and birnessite were incubated at 30°C to mimic a standard calorimetric run. At 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h, triplicate samples of these mixtures (100 mg each) were extracted by shaking overnight with 10 ml of 0.03 M HCl/0.03 M H Duplicate samples (70 mg) of the ground 2,4-D-birnessite mixtures were placed in 2-ml screw-cap septum vials and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. Carbon dioxide, N Ground mixtures of 2,4-D and birnessite were incubated for 48 h at 30°C. Duplicate samples (100 mg) from each mixture were extracted with 10 ml methanol. For these extracts, silica gel TLC plates (60F-254, 0.2 mm; Selecto Scientific, GA, USA) were developed to a height of 10 cm above the origin using benzene as an elution solvent. Standards for 2,4-D ( These analyses were performed using a 25 cm, 5 μm C-18 column (Spherisorb ODS2) maintained at room temperature on a Varian HPLC system (solvent delivery system model 9012, model 9100 autosampler with a variable wavelength UV-vis detector, model 9050). The HPLC unit was connected to a Spectra-Physics integrator (model 4290). Triplicate samples (50 μl each) of the methanol extracts, obtained as described in    The reaction products on birnessite identified by TLC were 2,4-D, the major component in the methanol extracts, and a trace of 2,4-dichlorophenol. The disappearance of 2,4-D and the formation of 2,4-dichlorophenol were quantified by HPLC. Head space gas analysis of the ground 2,4-  Our heat-evolution data suggesting first-order overall kinetics of transformation of 2,4-D on birnessite are in agreement with a study of the microbial degradation of 2,4-D in soil reported by Parker and Doxtader Analysis of the transformation products of the reaction of 2,4-D with birnessite by TLC and HPLC indicated that 2,4-D was transformed by the light grinding procedure to 2,4-dichlorophenol. This pathway is in agreement with the literature on the transformation of 2,4-D in moist non-sterile soils Analysis of the 2,4-D recovered by HPLC shows that about 20% of the ground 2,4-D was decomposed after 5 min of grinding. The degradation process continued at a lower rate in the ground mixtures for the duration of the experiment. Therefore, from our data, we suggest that there is potential for application of this procedure in remediation scenarios, particularly in soils and/or designed waste sites. Head space gas analysis did not detect any change in the concentration of oxygen during the incubation of ground mixtures of 2,4-D-birnessite at 30°C. The same analysis showed production of CO Analysis of extractable manganese formed as a product during 2,4-D breakdown indicated an increase in its concentration with increased incubation time, suggesting reduction of Mn(IV) in the oxide mineral to Mn(II) may be involved in the removal of chlorine from 2,4-D. There is an evident positive correlation between the number of moles of CO In summary, a mechanochemical approach to degrading 2,4-D by light grinding with birnessite (δ-MnO This research was supported in part by Postdoctoral Award FI-246-96 from BARD, The United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund, and in part by grants DE-FG02-97ER14755 and DE-AC03-76SF00098 from the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Geosciences Program, US Department of Energy.
