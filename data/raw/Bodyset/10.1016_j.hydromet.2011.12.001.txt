Based on the thermodynamic calculation for the precipitation of vanadium from Bayer liquor by lime, experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of temperature and CaO dosage on the vanadium precipitation rate when lime was added into Bayer liquor to precipitate vanadium directly. The results indicate that more than 80% of the vanadium can be precipitated directly from Bayer liquor by lime. Unfortunately, the obtained precipitation residues mainly consist of 3CaO•Al2O3•6H2O with very little vanadium content (V2O5, about 0.45%). An improved process, during which precipitation residues were used cyclically as precipitants for vanadium at high temperature (>150°C), was proposed after careful analysis on thermodynamic calculation and former experimental results. The improved process was proven completely feasible by experiments for the precipitation of vanadium from Bayer liquor to prepare vanadium-bearing residues with high vanadium content. With precipitation residues recycled, the V2O5 content increased to almost 3%. The appropriate conditions for the cyclical precipitation of vanadium include the C/A rate 0.4 for the first vanadium precipitation, cycle numbers 4–5, temperature 180°C–220°C, reaction time 1h and stirring speed 200rpm.Vanadium is an important alloying element used in steel and non-ferrous alloys due to its high tensile strength, hardness, and fatigue resistance ( Significant amount of vanadium is present in bauxite ( Three well known processes are used for the extraction of vanadium from the Bayer liquor. In the industrial process this is accomplished by fractional crystallization and the vanadium is obtained in the form of a complex sodium salt, and the salt is then treated to recover vanadium. An alternative method is to precipitate vanadium from the Bayer liquor, firstly obtaining vanadium-bearing residues. The residues are then treated to recover vanadium. Lime is a good precipitant for vanadium extraction because of the low solubility product (10 Bayer liquor is a complex solution, containing Al(OH) There are mainly three kinds of reactions when lime is added into the Bayer liquor: Reactions forming calcium aluminate hydrate: Reactions forming calcium aluminosilicate hydrate: Reactions forming calcium vanadate: Since the ionic reactions are involved, the thermodynamic calculation for above reactions employs the following formula ( The thermodynamic data of the compounds and ionic species used for calculation are obtained from the literatures or by calculating ( The Bayer liquor was taken from the pilot plant of Zhengzhou Research Institute of Chalco. The composition is shown in All the experiments were performed in a 0.5 Thermodynamic calculation results for three groups of reactions at standard conditions are shown in Conclusion can be made from Firstly, the effect of temperature on the precipitation of vanadium from the Bayer liquor with lime was studied by performing experiments at different temperatures with C/A of 0.4, reaction time of 1  Based on the above results and analysis, an idea to increase the V The effect of CaO dosage on the precipitation process was investigated by experiments at different C/A ratio at temperature of 180 According to reaction enough lime was added to the Bayer liquor to react with Al(OH) lime was replaced by the above residues as precipitants to react with fresh Bayer liquor at high temperature (> repeat step (2) cyclically until satisfactory vanadium content is obtained. Firstly, according to The effect of cycle number on cyclical precipitation of vanadium was investigated firstly, with the temperature 180  The influence of temperature on cyclical precipitation of vanadium is shown in  When lime is added to Bayer liquor, three types of reactions can take place to form calcium aluminate hydrate, calcium aluminosilicate hydrate and calcium vanadate respectively. According to thermodynamic calculation results, higher temperature is in favor of the precipitation of vanadium because the Δ Most of the vanadium in the Bayer liquor can be precipitated with lime directly under appropriate conditions. However due to the low concentration of VO Based on careful analysis for the thermodynamic calculation, improved process, during which the precipitation residues were used cyclically as precipitants for vanadium at high temperature (> This work was supported by the
