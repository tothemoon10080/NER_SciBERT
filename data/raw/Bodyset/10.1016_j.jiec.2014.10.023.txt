Reactivity of mechanically activated natural pyrite in the adsorption of Pb2+ was investigated. The results proved that the exothermic adsorption of Pb2+ onto pyrite changed to an endothermic adsorption onto mechanically activated pyrite. The thermodynamic studies revealed that pyrite reactivity has improved by mechanical activation. Entropy variations verified that the adsorption affinity of Pb2+ onto the mechanically activated pyrite was more than the pyrite. The adsorption isotherm modeling revealed that the Langmuir isotherm fitted well with Pb2+ adsorption onto 20min mechanically activated pyrite, while the Freundlich isotherm matched Pb2+ adsorption onto natural and mechanically activated pyrite for 100min.Mechanical activation is a branch of mechanochemistry science with a wide range of potential applications. It has been proved that structural changes and new surface formation in mechanically activated minerals can accelerate reaction rate and reactivity in following processes in which the minerals are involved Various adsorbents, including industrial wastes, natural substances and minerals such as pyrite, have been used to remove heavy metals from their solutions. A systematic investigation reported by Ozverdi and Erdem indicates that pyrite is a suitable adsorbent for lead ions It should be noted that pyrite (FeS The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of mechanical activation on the reactivity of natural pyrite in lead (II) removal from an aqueous solution. Thermodynamic studies and the adsorption isotherms of Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Kaganer–Radushkevich (DKR) were employed to elucidate the mechanisms of lead (II) adsorption from an aqueous solution using natural pyrite and mechanically activated pyrite powders. A high-purity pyrite concentrate was obtained using conventional beneficiation methods. Large quantities of ore-bearing pyrite were crushed and milled manually to −100 The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected with Bruker Axs D8 advanced instrument (Germany), applying Cu Kα radiation ( The BET surface area was also measured with a standard BET surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments CHEMBET- 3000, USA). Mechanical activation of pyrite was conducted in a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 6, FRITSCH, Germany) for 20 and 100 The stock aqueous solutions of Pb In keeping with the previous tests, adsorption tests for thermodynamic studies and adsorption isotherms modeling were performed using natural pyrite and mechanically activated pyrites for 20 and 100 The BET surface areas ( The XRD patterns of the samples are displayed in Analysis of the XRD patterns revealed that mechanical activation had led to substantial structural changes in the pyrite structure. However, the existence of reflection peaks after 100 The effects of pollutant concentration on the removal of Pb The results confirmed that the removal of Pb To study the effects of adsorbent dosage on removal of Pb The equilibrium removal of Pb The inconsistency in the adsorption behaviors of natural pyrite and mechanically activated pyrite can probably be ascribed to their different dominant adsorption mechanisms and consequently different adsorptive forces acting between the existing adsorbent sites and Pb Thermodynamic parameters can be estimated using changes in the equilibrium constants with temperature. The thermodynamic parameters such as standard Gibbs free energy (Δ The negative value of enthalpy confirms that Pb A brief kinetic study has provided more evidence for the claim that the predominant mechanism of reactivity enhancement during pyrite mechanical activation is the structural changes and not the creation of new surfaces. To prove this point, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models were used to determine the kinetic parameters for the adsorption process of Pb The sorption rate of selected adsorption experiments (initial concentration: 50, temperature: 26 Several isotherms such as Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin–Kaganer–Radushkevich (DKR) are used to model the adsorption tests at equilibrium. The adsorption isotherm studies were conducted under following adsorption conditions: absorbent dosage of 1 In conclusion, the DRK isotherm was employed, which is usually used to determine the apparent adsorption energy in various adsorption tests  According to the magnitude of the apparent adsorption energy, it is concluded that adsorption mechanism is physical if The principal achievement of this study is that in a mechanical activation process the reactivity enhancement of natural pyrite is mainly attributable to structural changes. Besides, the adsorption capability of mechanically activated pyrite for removal of Pb No phase transformation occurred during the mechanical activation of pyrite. The BET surface area of pyrite increased from 0.32 The results further confirmed that the adsorption capability of natural pyrite increased due to mechanical activation pretreatment. It was also realized that the adsorption process of Pb It was also discovered that adsorption performance of mechanically activated pyrite excelled that of natural pyrite in solutions with lower Pb The thermodynamic studies revealed that Δ The Langmuir isotherm fitted suitably with the experimental data obtained from Pb From DKR isotherm approach, it is understood that physical adsorption governs the adsorption mechanism of Pb
