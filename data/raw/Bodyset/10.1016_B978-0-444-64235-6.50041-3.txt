In this paper, the objective was to develop surrogate models for a flotation process. A CFD model taking into account several complex phenomena involved in the flotation was first developed and simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The approach of high dimension adaptive hierarchical polynomial interpolation was then used to develop simple surrogate models. The results show that the resulting models are accurate and fast to integrate compared to the original CFD ones. Their incorporation within an optimization algorithm to improve the flotation performances will be straightforward.Flotation is a separation technique based on differences in the hydrophobicity of the surfaces of the particles to be separated. It is a kinetic process involving three phases, i.e. solid (fine particles), liquid (water) and gas (air). Its principle is based on the capture of particles (e.g. gangue minerals) suspended in a pulp to be treated, by means of floating collectors (air bubbles). If the particles brought into contact with the bubbles are captured by the latter, they rise to the surface of the flotation cell where these agglomerates are retained in foam which is then evacuated from the cell ( Many research contributions have been recently devoted to CFD simulation of flotation processes with an emphasis on specific phenomena ( - Mass balance equations: - Momentum balance equations: - The volume fractions should sum up to 1 as: where It is noteworthy that the resulting process model is quite complex and computationally intensive. Simple and accurate surrogate models will therefore be developed in §4. The next section will focus on the definition of the surrogate model problem. One of the most relevant phenomena that influence the forces involved in equations ( The problem considered in this work dealt with the analysis of the bubble-particle collision phenomenon through the determination of the collision probabilities. More specifically, the influence of three parameters, i.e. bubble diameter, particle diameter and particle density, on the probabilities was investigated.  The surrogate models developed are based on the approach of high dimension hierarchical polynomial interpolation ( The polynomials where the coefficients This hierarchical procedure can be generalized to high dimensions using a technical tensor construction. We let and introduce the tensor product operator notation Δ  We note however that we will not rely on The This notion is central in the present framework. It implies in particular that if In fact, in this case it is easy to verify, see ( We observe that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between downward closed sets Λ, the polynomial spaces where now ( For example, we consider the following algorithm :           The stability and numerical behavior of this algorithm is studied in ( In the case study considered here, the parameters The algorithm described above was implemented using Python and allowed to compute the polynomials of the surrogate models. The main results are presented in It can be seen that as expected the probability decreases with the bubble diameter ( The method of high dimension adaptive hierarchical polynomial interpolation developed in this work has proven to be a powerful approach in surrogate models building for complex processes and/or computationally intensive CFD models. The approach favors a sparsity based reconstruction which is particularly emphasized since this explains the sparsity of effects observed for the mechanisms pertaining the bubble-particle collision phenomenon. The results obtained are very interesting and encouraging; they show that the surrogate models developed are very accurate with negligible CPU time. Further works will focus on the use of the resulting surrogate models in optimal design and operation of the whole flotation process.
