In this paper, we present a method for the synthesis of solvent extraction separation schemes in hydrometallurgy. Using equilibrium data the potential number of extraction and stripping stages are determined, then a superstructure for each stream is postulated. The superstructure contains those stream interconnections among the unit that can potentially define all configurations with no stream splitting, with stream splitting, with stream mixing, and with bypass streams. The result can include reduction in the number of stages, cross-flow, countercurrent, and bypass systems. Then a general mathematical model is formulated to solve the problem. Solution of the mathematical model shows the optimal stream pattern between the candidate extraction and stripping stages. The technique is illustrated with one example.
