Metals are an essential component of today’s society: a moment’s reflection on their ubiquitous presence in virtually all energy and material production processes is enough to confirm this. We also, of course, consider an abundant supply of clean water a routine essential, and the constant need for energy is a given all over the world. However, the resources of our planet are limited, as is the strain to which we can subject it in terms of emissions, pollution, and disposal of waste. For these reasons, finding ways to lower the environmental footprint of our collective existence and therefore lowering greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change ( The conference series “Sustainability through Resource Conservation and Recycling – SRCR” has as a principal theme the maximization of Resource Efficiency ( The various aspects that have been covered in this series of conferences have been summarized in The focus of the conference lies especially on the use of the unique theoretical aspects that have been developed to describe minerals processing technology and systems and applying and adapting these to understand theoretically, technologically and economically how to maximize the recycling of end-of-life consumer goods, optimize recycling and production systems, minimize losses through among others residue and sludges creation from primary ore extraction as well as “urban” mining activities, maximization of water quality and its recycling. Of interest, therefore, is also applying these unique principles to Design for Recycling and Sustainability ( A selection of peer reviewed and accepted papers (from a total number of 42) presented at the 3rd conference in this series, covered the following main themes:    These topics are all part of a United Nations Environmental Programme report that discusses recycling (
