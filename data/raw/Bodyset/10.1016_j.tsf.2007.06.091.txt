Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbon (a-SiC:H) ultra thin films obtained by Hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) have been shown to act as efficient diffusion barriers for copper on inter metal dielectric (IMD) layers which are of great significance for ultra-large scale integration (ULSI) circuits. In this work, we have studied the influence of the a-SiC:H barrier layer obtained by HWCVD which has implications towards issues related to the resistance to electromigration of Cu in the low dielectric (low-k) hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) film. The presence of the ultra thin a-SiC:H film maintains the integrity of the Cu metal not only by suppressing Cu diffusion but also by increasing its crystallinity, which would have implications with respect to the mean time to failure (MTF) arising from metal electromigration. Though, we demonstrate this aspect on the low-k (HSQ)/Cu system, this should yield similar benefits for other low-k dielectric materials too.To solve the problems arising from the increase in propagation delay, cross-talk noise, and power dissipation, we must reduce the parasitic capacitance by using a low- In an earlier report HSQ films were spin coated on to p-type silicon wafers, baked on a hot plate at 100 °C and then in a furnace at 250 °C and 350 °C for 1 min each followed by furnace curing at 400 °C for 1 h in nitrogen ambient. Two types of structures viz. Cu/HSQ/<Si> and Cu/a-SiC:H/HSQ/<Si> were fabricated. The a-SiC:H barrier layer was 20 nm thick and was deposited by HWCVD technique using silane and acetylene gases. Cu was thermally evaporated and the entire structures were annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in N   The (AFM) images of the HSQ and the a-SiC:H/HSQ films are shown in To study the phases of Cu film present in the samples before and after thermal treatment, we have analyzed the samples by XRD. The XRD spectra of as-deposited Cu/HSQ/<Si> (A) and Cu/a-SiC:H/HSQ/<Si> (C) structures show the preferred (111) orientation as has been shown in In this study, we show that the a-SiC:H thin film deposited by HWCVD not only acts as an efficient barrier layer against Cu diffusion in a low- This work was carried out under the project supported by DST, Government of India, (SR/FTP/PS-41/2000).
