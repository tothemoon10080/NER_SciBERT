In recent years, the accidents of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation from coal seam floors have been increasing in groundwater-related coalmine accidents in China. Such groundwater inrush accidents have not been prevented effectively, because the mechanism of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation from coal seam floors has not been clearly recognized. In this paper, there was a new knowledge of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation from coal seam floors in the domain of prevention and cure water disaster in coalmines firstly, based on the review of the fault reactivation concept in different domains. Then the advances in the research on mechanisms of the groundwater inrush caused by fault reactivation in coalmines were expounded and research findings of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation with each view were summarized. In the end, the mechanisms of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation have been clearly recognized on the basis of influential factors of the groundwater inrush caused by the fault reactivation.
