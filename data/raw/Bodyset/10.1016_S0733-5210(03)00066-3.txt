Nine waxy barley samples (grown at the same site during the same season) were investigated to identify those molecular aspects of amylopectin structure and architecture which define the order and gelatinisation characteristics. Using 13C CP-MAS/NMR it was confirmed that the number of double helices within the starches were approximately constant although differences in crystallinity were identified by X-ray diffraction. These differences in terms of amount of crystalline order correlated well with gelatinisation temperatures. The onset (T

                     p) and conclusion (T

Crystalline lamellae lengths were found to be 5.2±0.7 and 6.2±0.4 nm using high sensitivity differential scanning micro-calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively.In a previous publication ( The benefits of using waxy starches to study amylopectin crystallisation independently of amylose are obvious with waxy starches also being low in lipid content or lipid free ( One objective of this work was to differentiate between the forms of molecular association within waxy barley starch granules and use this to build a more coherent picture with respect to the crystalline order within the granules (with potential relevance to other starches). The second objective was to differentiate (if possible) between the different waxy starches in terms of crystallite dimensions (genetic variation independently of environmental factors). Thirdly, the work was structured to identify the key architectural aspects (α-glucan associations) of the starch granules that provide starch specific gelatinisation characteristics and model these accordingly. Because the starches were extracted from grains grown in the same location at the same time, environmentally induced variations in starch deposition patterns were constant. This publication forms part II of a waxy barley starch investigation published in this journal edition. All chemicals, reagents and solvents were of Merck Analar quality or better. Nine samples of waxy barley grown under the same environmental conditions during the same season in field plots were obtained from the Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI), Dundee, UK as previously described ( Starches were extracted as discussed previously ( Amorphous cereal starch controls were prepared by ball milling commercial maize (Fisher, S/7880/69) or wheat (BDH, 30265) starches (10 g) for 24 h. The amorphous conversion was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and both the α-glucan and damaged starch contents were quantified ( Acid hydrolysis was performed on 100 mg (±0.1 mg) samples of starch as described previously ( The digestibility of native or annealed starches with fungal ( Crystalline (lamellae) dimensions (lengths) were determined by high sensitivity differential scanning micro-calorimetry (DSM) and conventional DSC as described elsewhere ( Starches were annealed in excess water (>96% by weight). Triplicate samples of starch (1 g) were accurately weighed into 100 ml screw-cap conical flasks to which 100 ml deionised water containing 0.02% sodium azide (as a bacteriostatic agent) was added. After sealing and equilibrating at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were placed in incubators at the required temperatures (below Annealing was also done in the presence of A Brucker DSZ 200 NMR operating at 200 MHz with a standard Brucker 7 mm PH MASV probe head was used to obtain X-ray diffraction data was generated with a Philips PW 1840 Bragg-Brentano type parafocusing diffractometer mounted on a PW 1066/11 sealed tube X-ray generator operating at the Cu The (A-type) X-ray diffractograms generated from the native waxy barley starches are presented in The These two techniques, X-ray diffraction and NMR, determine the amount of crystallinity and double helices, respectively, and indicate that although within the group of waxy barley starches investigated the proportion of double helices is constant, there are some differences in the proportion of crystallinity. Some starches, therefore, have better ordered structures than others. The gelatinisation temperatures of the waxy barley starches are presented in Annealing at 48 °C in excess water ( The number of double helices post annealing would be expected to be constant although the crystalline order (registration) would be enhanced ( Gelatinisation temperatures might be regarded as the thermal reflection of the ease in which water can penetrate starch granules and provide hydration for double helices to permit dissociation. The water will also facilitate the gelatinisation process by plasticising the amorphous glass transition ( With the above model in mind, annealing enhances order of double helices without creating more double helices. There may be a small improvement in double helix length if ‘ends’ were not optimally formed as double helices although this is not apparent from any significant overall change with respect to the gelatinisation enthalpy post annealing. This annealing event then restricts hydration and elevates the gelatinisation temperature (reflecting the higher temperatures required to ‘drive’ hydration and dissociation of the double helices). This would also be associated with a diminished capacity of water to hydrate amorphous regions and hence plasticise When the annealed starches are hydrolysed by acid to remove amorphous regions ( The primary role of annealing with respect to causing enhanced crystalline order can be proved further by annealing in the presence of According to As anticipated, based on the significant ( In contrast with the above, there is no correlation between the starch crystalline length and the amount of crystallinity by XRD. The gelatinisation enthalpy is independent of the indicators of crystallinity (crystalline length and XRD parameters)—also as anticipated—since the enthalpy reflects the number of double helices rather than crystallinity per se. This work was conducted to understand more extensively how starch crystalline structure (order, crystallite dimensions and architecture within granules) controls gelatinisation parameters. It is apparent that crystalline lamellar regions control the gelatinisation parameters of the starch. It is concluded that although crystallite length contributes to the origin of the gelatinisation temperatures (but not enthalpy), it is the overall optimisation of registration of these double helices that control gelatinisation by in effect more or less restricting hydration of the granules when heated in water. The more exact role of amylose in this process will be explored.
