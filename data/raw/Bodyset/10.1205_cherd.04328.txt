The role of flocculants in changing the dewatering properties of aggregated particulate suspensions has been examined. The hindered settling and compressibility characteristics of suspensions have been measured for a range of aggregate formation conditions. The effect of post formation shear on the dewatering has also been quantified for a range of shear rates. A critical shear rate transition has been observed between beneficial and detrimental effects in dewatering.
