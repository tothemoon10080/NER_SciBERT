Matrix vesicles (MVs) are a specific type of extracellular vesicles with a unique function of supporting the initiation of the mineralization process of the skeletal and dental tissues. Although it has been proposed that MVs are formed by shedding off the cell membrane, the molecular mechanisms driving formation of mineralization-competent MVs are not fully understood. The goal of our studies is to identify molecular mechanisms regulating MVs biogenesis during the initiation of the mineralization process. We hypothesized that molecular stimuli of the mineralization process are involved in the MVs biogenesis. Using cellular in vitro models of mineralization and nanoparticle tracking analyses, we have demonstrated that committed osteogenic cells rapidly increase release of MVs upon stimulation with inorganic phosphate (P
