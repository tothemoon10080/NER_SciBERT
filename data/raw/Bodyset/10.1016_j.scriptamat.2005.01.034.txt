SiC ceramic is joined to itself, to stainless steels and to Inconel 718 using indigenously developed active brazing alloys. Detailed interfacial product analysis by scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis and X-ray diffraction revealed that the interfacial reactions are dependent on Ti concentration and the composition of the metal member in the ceramic–metal couple.Previous studies The SiC employed is supplied by International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy & New Materials (ARCI), Hyderabad, in hot isostatic pressed condition. The ceramic and the metal members are employed as 5 For convenience, the joints SiC–AgCuTi–SiC, SiC–CuAgTi–SiC, SiC–AgCuTi–AISI 304SS, SiC–AgCuTi–AISI 316SS, SiC–AgCuTi–Inconel 718 and SiC–CuAgTi–AISI 304SS are designated as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6, respectively. The back scattered electron (BSE) image and EPMA X-ray image analysis of joint S1 (  In order to understand the effect of the presence of the active element Ti in the metal member on the interfacial reactions, SiC is joined to Ti stabilised AISI 316SS (0.4 It was observed by Prakash et al.  In SiC–AgCuTi–AISI 304SS joint, interestingly Cr Strong presence of Cr In SiC to metal joints, the presence of Ni in the metal member does not influence the reactivity of active element Ti as observed in Al The authors are grateful to DRDO for funding this programme.
