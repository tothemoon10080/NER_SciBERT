The mechanical properties and tribological properties of a particular aluminium alloy is dependent on the composition and the preparation techniques. Aluminium alloys are used extensively in numerous applications like aerospace, automobile, structural etc. because of their corrosion resistance, high strength to weight ratio. Effect of Vanadium addition in Al-Si alloys on the mechanical, wear properties are investigated. Vanadium is added to the Al matrix in compositions varying from 0.05 to 0.15 wt.%. The composite is prepared using stir casting in a muffle furnace. The wettability of Vanadium in aluminium matrix is improved by the addition of K2TiF6. The specimens were prepared for the tensile, hardness and wear tests. Optical Microscope was used for microstructural analysis of the prepared specimens. The tensile strength and hardness values of the Vanadium added specimens were greater than the base Al-Si alloy. The elongation was also improved in the prepared specimens. Tribological properties were also enhanced due to the addition of Vanadium particles in Al-Si matrix. Pin on disc wear test was performed on the specimens by varying load at constant sliding velocity and then varying sliding velocity at constant load.
