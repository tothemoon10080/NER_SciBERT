The intensity of boreal forest wildfires is highly variable, such that natural wood charcoal can be produced at different peak temperatures. This, in turn, may have consequences on the physico-chemical and functional properties of the charcoal that is returned to soil. We report on a microcosm study where black spruce wood charcoal produced at five peak temperatures (450, 550, 650, 750 and 850 °C) was added to forest soils, and subsequently incubated at room temperature, with and without additions of condensed tannins and/or protein. A fourth experimental factor was added to this full factorial design, which comprised the mixing of soil so as to simulate mechanical scarification in the field. Increasing the charcoal production temperature resulted in higher %C and lower %O and %H, suggesting an increase in aromatic structures. Specific surface area was negligible at 450 °C, was about 50 m2 g−1 at 550 °C, and was 260–300 m2 g−1 at the three highest temperatures. At these higher charcoal production temperatures, 85–90 % of total surface area was attributed to pores <20 nm. The incubation demonstrated a decline in soil basal respiration (BR) with charcoal addition, with increasing charcoal production temperature and with tannin additions, whereas BR increased with protein addition and with soil mixing. Charcoal addition reduced soil microbial biomass (MB), however charcoal production temperature had no effect on MB. Consequently, we observed a decrease in microbial metabolic quotient (qCO2) with increasing charcoal production temperature, which reflected the decline in BR. Increasing charcoal production temperature increased net

                      production more so in the mixed than in the non-mixed soils. Our results thus show that charcoal production temperature has a marked and significant effect on soil C and N cycling, and that these effects are substantially modified by soil mixing. This further suggests that changes in boreal forest fire intensity, due to anthropogenic changes in tree species composition or climate, could affect the dynamics of forest regeneration through variations in the chemical and functional properties of the charcoal, and that these effects may be substantially modified by post-fire silvicultural treatments such as mechanical scarification.Forest fire is the most common natural disturbance and an essential driver of ecological succession in boreal forest ecosystems (e.g., Climate change can affect forest fire regimes in a number of ways, and has thus been the focus of several modeling studies aimed at predicting future forest dynamics (e.g., Mechanical scarification is a post-disturbance silvicultural treatment that may abate the growth check of conifer seedlings by ericaceous shrubs. This treatment is a disk-trenching operation whereby the organic surface soil is plowed and buried, while a trough is created exposing deeper mineral soil layers. Scarification was shown to reduce Another silvicultural treatment that may abate the growth check of conifer seedlings by ericaceous shrubs, is the application of mineral N fertilizers ( We report on a microcosm study in which mineral and organic soils were jointly incubated for 8 weeks with a full factorial array of treatments that included the addition or exclusion of Bulk samples (50 kg) of organic forest floor (F-layer) and of surface mineral soil (0–30 cm) were collected from two mature black spruce-feathermoss stands located near the Town of Forestville (48°44′ N, 69°05′ W), in the black spruce-feathermoss biogeoclimatic zone ( We produced charcoal from untreated black spruce boards (5 cm × 10 cm × 3 m) purchased from a local lumber dealer. Boards were cut into 30 cm long sections, were placed four at a time in a stainless steel pan and heated for 4 h in a toaster oven set at 180 °C in order to release volatile substances. After cooling to room temperature, the pre-charred wood sections were placed four at a time into stainless steel beakers with a lid. Each beaker was transferred into a muffle furnace, and furnace temperature was then increased to either 450 °C, 550 °C, 650 °C, 750 °C or 850 °C. Each peak temperature was maintained for 30 min, after which the furnace was turned off. Once cooled to room temperature, charred wood sections produced at similar temperatures were pooled together, crushed using a hammer, and double sieved to yield charcoal fragments of 0.5–2.0 mm dia. Using a mechanical corer and saw, a 1 cm In order to test our hypotheses, we constructed microcosms to which we applied 4 experimental factors arranged in a full factorial design yielding 48 treatments, each replicated into 3 blocks ( The microcosms were incubated at room temperature for 8 weeks. Every 2 weeks, basal respiration rate (BR) in each jar was determined by flushing the headspace with ambient air for 5 min, sealing jars with air-tight lids equipped with rubber septa, and sampling the headspace with a needle and syringe after 2 h. Air samples were analyzed for CO At the end of the incubation period, substrate induced respiration (SIR) was used to estimate microbial biomass (MB) in each jar. We first gently mixed the material in each microcosm to obtain a homogeneous mixture, and then weighed a 12 g (dry wt equiv.) subsample into a 500 mL plastic vessel. Each subsample was amended with a 500 mg glucose:talc (3:97) powder mixture, which was dispersed using a kitchen hand-mixer with one beater. Subsamples were immediately transferred into 125 mL gas sampling jars and left uncovered for 100 min to reach optimum SIR rates ( Following the 8 wk incubation, ammonium ( Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to test the effect of sampling date and its interaction with treatments on BR. We used mixed model ANOVAs to test the effects of soil mixing, charcoal temperature, CT, BSA and interaction terms, on MB, The furnace temperature at which the charcoal was produced had a significant effect on its physico-chemical properties ( Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of sampling date ( Charcoal production temperature had no effect ( We found a significant interaction ( The most important changes in physico-chemical characteristics of charcoal occurred at production temperatures ranging from 450 °C to 650 °C. The increase in %C, and the decreases in %O and %H over this range are indicative of an increase in the aromatic structure and a gradual shift towards graphite-like material ( Our results show an effect of charcoal on soil C and N mineralization, but also significant differences in these effects due to the temperature at which the charcoal was produced. One of our hypotheses was that charcoal might stimulate microbial activity, by adsorbing tannins and other phenolic compounds that could otherwise bind and sequester soil protein. Our results contradict this hypothesis, as all charcoal treatments had lower BR than the control treatment. This suggests that the reactive surface area of the charcoal may be adsorbing a myriad of molecules, including easily degradable substrates that would otherwise be available for microbial growth. This is corroborated by the progressive reductions in BR with increasing charcoal production temperature. This result is also consistent with those of Soil mixing increased BR, possibly the result of increasing the exposure of soil organic matter to microbial degradation. This reflects what can be observed in the field, where mechanical scarification may be accompanied by an increase in soil respiration (e.g.,  The production of charcoal by heating dimensional lumber under controlled laboratory conditions may yield a product that differs physically and chemically from charcoal produced by natural wildfire. Nevertheless, the protocol used in the present study does offer some realistic comparisons. For example: (1) black spruce (i.e., the wood we used) is the most common boreal forest tree in Canada; (2) the five temperatures that were used represent a realistic range of peak intensities for boreal forest fires ( We thank Médéric Lanoix, Valérie Masse, Sonia van Wijk, Anne Sophie Julien, Carole-Anne Létourneau and Carl St.-Louis for technical assistance.
