This paper presents a comparison of two present meshfree approaches for modelling brittle material in case of ballistic impact, where extensive cracking and fragmentation is present. These phenomena are very unfeasible to simulate with a standard Lagrangian technique thus alternative methods have been considered in the last years. A comparison between two methods is the main aim of the present article. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is an almost consolidated method that exploit the description of a continuum by means of discrete elements whose properties are “smoothed” by a Kernel Function. In this paper a procedure that exploits the transition from finite elements (FE) to SPH particles, following the onset of an erosion criterion is used. This approach and its results are then compared to the recent state-based Peridynamics. Peridynamics method is based on integral equation and allow a direct application to discontinuities and fractures. The results from both methods are critically compared with experimental data and show that the damage morphology is reproduced similarly by both approaches; however less computation efforts are required when peridynamics are used.
