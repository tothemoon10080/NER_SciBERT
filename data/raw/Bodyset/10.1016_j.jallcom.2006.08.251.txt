In order to investigate an effect of rapid solidification on the thermoelectric performance and materials properties, p-type Bi2Te3–Sb2Te3 thermoelectric alloy doped with 4wt.% Te was synthesized using gas atomization and sintering processes. The gas atomized alloy presented a homogeneous distribution of Te, Bi and Sb. Bending strength was also improved compared with the alloy prepared by conventional casting process. Variation of thermoelectric properties such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and Hall properties were analyzed as a function of the initial powder size, annealing treatment and sintering temperature.It is known that the intrinsic low strength and uneven thermoelectric performance of directionally grown p-type Sb In the present study, p-type Sb Sb Standard four points probe method and Van der Pauw method (5 The strength of sintered body was obtained by three-point bending tests. For the microstructural analysis, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM, JEOL 5410) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscope (EDS, Oxford 3.0) were used. The crystal structures in both ribbon and bulk were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Siemens) using monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation. ICP (ICPS-1000III, Shimadzu) was used to analyze the composition variation. Gas atomized and sintered p-type Sb In order to know the effect of RSP on the mechanical properties, bending tests were applied to both alloys conventionally cast and gas atomized (sintered at 450  Considering the sintering temperature, the increase of Improvement of Electric conductivity ( The thermal conductivity (  The as atomized p-type Sb
