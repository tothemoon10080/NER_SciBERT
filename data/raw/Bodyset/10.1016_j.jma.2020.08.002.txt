A review of the literature confirmed that the intrinsic corrosion rate of high-purity Mg as measured by weight-loss is 0.3 mm/y in a concentrated chloride solution. Atmospheric corrosion of Mg alloys has produced corrosion rates of Mg-Al alloys an order of magnitude lower than the intrinsic corrosion rate of Mg in a concentrated chloride solution of 0.3 mm/y. The only successful strategy to produce a Mg alloy with a corrosion rate in a concentrated chloride solution substantially less than the intrinsic corrosion rate as measured by weight loss of Mg of 0.3 mm/y has been to improve the protectiveness of the corrosion product film.Much research has been expended to understand Mg corrosion The aims of this review are: to review Mg corrosion rates, to confirm that the intrinsic corrosion rate of high-purity Mg as measured by weight loss is 0.3 mm/y in a concentrated chloride solution, to understand the Mg alloy development strategies that have produced Mg alloys with low corrosion rates in such solutions, and to examine the recent claims of a new highly-corrosion-resistant Mg alloy To explore these aims, the recent literature of Mg corrosion was reviewed, with an emphasis on corrosion rates measured using weight loss, The corrosion rate of Mg measured using hydrogen evolution in a chloride solution, The results of the review of Mg corrosion rates are presented in  Reasons The corrosion rate soon after specimen immersion can be orders of magnitude smaller than the steady state corrosion rate. Electrochemical measurements are typically carried out soon after specimen immersion in the solution, before there is steady state corrosion behaviour The evolving hydrogen (from the cathodic partial reaction) can isolate part of the specimen, so that this self-corrosion cannot be detected by any electrochemical measurement The Mg corrosion rates from  In this context it is worth repeating that the high-purity Mg that shows the intrinsic corrosion rate in chloride solutions as measured by weight loss of 0.3 mm/y contains no second phase particles and is typically in ingot form. Heat treatment of ingot Mg can cause precipitation of Fe-rich particles and much higher corrosion rates   The two exceptions of Mg alloys with a corrosion rate (measured by weight loss) in a chloride solution much lower than the intrinsic Mg corrosion rate of 0.3 mm/y are the Mg alloys with weight loss corrosion rates of 0.1 mm/y: (i) Mg-1.5Sr This Mg alloy development strategy was suggested by Song and Atrens  Thus, it is demonstrably not accurate or reasonable to claim that an alloy with a corrosion rate as measured by weight loss above 0.3 mm/y in a concentrated chloride solution has a corrosion rate much lower than any existing Mg alloy It was also suggested that low corrosion rates in chloride solutions could be produced by decreasing the cathodic partial reaction of hydrogen evolution  A review of the literature confirmed that the intrinsic corrosion rate as measured by weight loss of high-purity Mg is 0.3 mm/y in a concentrated chloride solution. Atmospheric corrosion of Mg alloys has produced corrosion rates of Mg-Al alloys an order of magnitude lower than the intrinsic corrosion rate of Mg in a concentrated chloride solution of 0.3 mm/y, Two Mg alloys, (namely Mg-1.5Sr, and Mg-4Y-3Nd) were identified with corrosion rates as measured by weight loss less than the intrinsic corrosion rate of high-purity Mg of 0.3 mm/y in a concentrated chloride solution, The only successful strategy to produce a Mg alloy with a corrosion rate as measured by weight loss substantially less than the intrinsic corrosion rate as measured by weight loss of Mg of 0.3 mm/y has been to improve the protectiveness of the corrosion product film, Corrosion rates for Mg alloys measured by electrochemical methods are typically lower than the steady-state corrosion rates measured by weight loss, often by orders of magnitude, The recent claims that new Mg alloys have been produced that are more corrosion resistant than Mg-based alloys reported so far are not supported by the literature.
