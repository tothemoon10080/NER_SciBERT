The management a first anterior dislocation of the shoulder includes analysis of mechanism of injury and physical examination that help confirm the diagnosis. From this stage it is possible to separate the simple forms of complicated forms, including vascular and neurological complications. The imaging assessment confirms the diagnosis and reflects the importance of displacement and associated bone lesions (impaction, fracturesâ€¦). This imagery has two orthogonal views achieved without mobilizing the shoulder and must be repeated after reduction.
               The reduction is always tempted by external manipulations after premedication adjusted to the intensity of pain. General anesthesia may be necessary (hyperalgic and/or complicated forms). There is no consensus on the proper technique of reduction, except that it should be smooth and painless.
               Currently, the immobilization is commonly in internal rotation for 3 to 6 weeks depending on the patient's age.
               Research associated lesions is essential because if complications are rare, they can cause significant functional sequelae.
               Follow-up visits should verify the functional recovery (especially in cases of immediate complications) and detect recurrence of instability and damage to the rotator cuff.
               Indications for surgery in the acute phase are rare, and are the result of complications or irreducible dislocation.
               Immobilization in lateral rotation and surgical treatment in the first dislocation are controversial and will be discussed.
