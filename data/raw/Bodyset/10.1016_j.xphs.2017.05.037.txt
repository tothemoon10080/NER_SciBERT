The present work investigated the solid state change of 4 acyclovir polymorphs when ground at room temperature (Method A) and under cryo-grinding in the presence of liquid nitrogen (Method B). Modifications in particle size and shape (evaluated by scanning electron microscopy) and in the water content (evaluated by thermal analysis) were related to transitions at the solid state, as confirmed by X-ray powder diffractometry. Anhydrous Form I was stable under grinding by both Methods A and B. The anhydrous Form II was stable during grinding under Method A, whereas it was progressively converted to the hydrate Form V during grinding under Method B. The hydrate Form V was stable under Method A, whereas it was converted to the anhydrous Form I after 15 min and then to the hydrate Form VI after 45 min of grinding. The hydrate Form VI proved to be stable under grinding by both Methods A and B. Thus, Form I and VI were the only forms that yielded a sizeable decrease in particle size under grinding, with a consequent increase in particle dissolution rate, while maintaining solid state physicochemical stability. Form I treated under Method B grinding gave the best dissolution rate.
