The crystallisation behaviour of an iron rich glass, obtained by recycling zinc hydrometallurgy waste, was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy. The transformations occurring in the glass subjected to different thermal cycles, i.e. liquid–liquid separation and crystallisation, were investigated by FTIR, XRD and TEM. The asymmetric SiOSi stretching vibration wave-number, 1016cm−1 in the FTIR spectrum of the glass, increased with the heat treatment temperature and was related to the variation of the coefficient of thermal expansion and density of the glass-ceramic. The magnetite and pyroxene crystalline phase peak, at 638cm−1, was utilised for determining the degree of crystallisation of the glass-ceramic by measuring the area of the peak as a function of the thermal treatment time; the results were compared with the same evaluation carried out by density measurements.The Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, FTIR, has been widely applied to the interpretation of the structural modifications occurring in glasses when subjected to a thermal treatment. The FTIR spectrum of silica shows the most intense peak at about 1100 The band at 1100 In the present study, the FTIR spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the crystallisation process of iron rich glasses obtained by mixing jarosite, a zinc-hydrometallurgy waste, in combination with granite scraps and glass cullet. A glass with the following wt.% composition: SiO In In order to understand the effect of a thermal treatment on the FTIR spectrum, two glass samples were heat treated at 630 and 700 In The FTIR spectroscopy was successfully applied to investigate the crystallisation process in iron rich glasses. Compared to the as quenched glass, the Si The magnetite and pyroxene crystalline phase peak, at 638
