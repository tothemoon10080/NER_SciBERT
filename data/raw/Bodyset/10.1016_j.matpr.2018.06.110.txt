In present work, an attempt has been made to study the experimental characterization of Iron-ore suspension. Characterization of iron-ore suspension depends on physicochemical, morphological and flow characteristics. In this context, physical, chemical and flow properties of iron ore slurry had been investigated at solid concentration ranging from 20-50% (by weight). Rheological experiments were performed at shear rate ranging from 0-600 s-1. From experiments, it is observed that iron-ore slurry shows the Newtonian flow characteristics up to 30% solid concentration (by weight). Results showed that apparent viscosity of slurry increases with solid concentration. The modelling results obtained from Rosin-Rammler (RR) model found to be in good agreement with experimental data of mass distribution function F(d) as compared to Gates-Gaudin-Schumann (GGS).
