Polycrystalline (Zn0.95M0.05)2TiO4 (M=Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Cu2+) samples of sintered density ≥94%, were prepared by ceramic powder mixing and solid state reaction followed by sintering (in air) between 1060 and 1180°C. The XRD patterns of the furnace cooled samples revealed single ortho-titanate tetragonal inverse spinel phase. The SEM micrographs showed fairly uniform grains between 5 and 25μm depending upon the composition. Dielectric measurements on the samples were made at low frequencies (1kHz to 1MHz) from 30 to 450°C. The dielectric constant

                     u·f) values ranged between 2100 and 9650GHz. The (Zn0.95M0.05)2TiO4 (M=Mn2+ or Cu2+), samples exhibited over four times improvement in quality factor vis-à-vis pure Zn2TiO4, which is attributed to relative increase in grain size and density in case of Cu2+, and reduction in tetragonality of the unit cell for Mn2+ substitution.In recent past, R.F. multilayer device structures have been developed to reduce the device size and weight. These often require low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCCs) having internal-electrode metal such as silver or copper Traditionally, fine chemicals of Zn–Ti–O system have been used as catalysts and pigments Here, we report synthesis and microwave dielectric properties of (Zn Pure and the substituted Zn High-purity (>99%, AR grade) powders of ZnO, TiO The different ortho-titanate phase powders were uniaxially compacted at ∼100 The powder XRD patterns for the sintered pellets were recorded and lattice parameters computed.
