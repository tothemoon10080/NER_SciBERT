The separation of nickel and cobalt from impurities such as manganese, magnesium and calcium using solvent extraction with Versatic 10 was largely improved by the addition of a synergistic reagent LIX63 (an α-hydroxyoxime) or 4PC (a pyridine carboxylate ester). With the organic systems containing Versatic 10 alone, the separation factors of nickel and cobalt over manganese were 6 and 15 respectively. When 4PC was added to the system, these increased to 147 and 1870 respectively, and with LIX63, they were even higher at 534 and 7720 respectively. This indicates that the synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) system with Versatic 10 and LIX63 performed very well and better than that with Versatic 10 and 4PC.
                  The SSX system consisting of 0.5M Versatic 10, 0.45M LIX63 and 1.0M TBP in Shellsol D70 performed the best among the systems tested containing LIX63. After a single contact, the extraction of Ni and Co was 99.6% and 96.9%, respectively. Only 6mg/L Mn, 8mg/LMg and 1mg/L Ca were found in the loaded organic solution. The manganese scrub efficiency was 97.7% at pH 5.3, resulting in a scrubbed organic solution containing only 0.8mg/L Mn. Over 99% nickel, cobalt and manganese were stripped at pH 2.0, indicating easy stripping of these metals.
                  The SSX system consisting of 0.5M Versatic 10 and 1.0M 4PC in Shellsol D70 performed the best among the systems tested containing 4PC. After a single contact, the extraction of Ni and Co was 99.4% and 89.4%, respectively. Some 200mg/L Mn, 10mg/LMg and 48mg/L Ca were found in the loaded organic solution. The manganese could not be scrubbed at the tested pH range of 5.4–6.0. Very fast Ni and fast Co stripping kinetics were observed, however, the Mn stripping kinetics were very slow. After 2min of stripping, only 1.22% Mn was stripped.
                  It is concluded that the SSX system containing 0.5M Versatic 10, 0.45M LIX63 and 1.0M TBP performed much better than the SSX system containing 0.5M Versatic 10 and 1.0M 4PC in terms of both manganese and calcium behaviour in extraction, scrubbing and stripping.Existing nickel laterite processes can be divided into three generic categories depending on the downstream processing route after leaching: mixed sulphide precipitation (MSP), mixed hydroxide precipitation (MHP) and direct solvent extraction (DSX) processes, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages ( The Bulong process used a DSX approach in which cobalt, copper, zinc and manganese were separated from nickel, calcium and magnesium by solvent extraction with Cyanex 272 ( In the Goro process, a DSX process approach is also used ( The DSX processes avoid the intermediate precipitation, solid/liquid separation and re-leach steps of the MSP and MHP processes, potentially leading to lower capital and operating costs. After comparing the DSX processes with the MSP and MHP processes, An SSX system consisting of Versatic 10 (2-methyl-2-ethylheptanoic acid) and a synthesised synergist 4PC (n-decyl-4-pyridinecarboxylate ester) was used for the separation of nickel and cobalt from manganese, magnesium and calcium, with test work utilising a pilot plant solution and producing promising results ( The synthetic laterite leach solution was prepared by dissolving AR or technical grade sulphates of nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, magnesium, iron(III), iron(II), aluminium and chromium, chlorides of sodium and calcium, and sodium silicate in tap water. The solution was then subjected to an iron precipitation step with lime at pH 5.0 and 60 The reagent Versatic 10 acid and the diluent Shellsol D70 (100% aliphatic) were provided by Shell Chemicals Australia and LIX63 was purchased from Cognis Australia. The composition of the LIX63 was reported by Cognis to be 70% active oxime component in a diluent. The TBP reagent was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The reagent 4PC was manufactured by Chemorex and reportedly contained 92% active component. All reagents were used as received. All the tests were carried out in 0.5 To determine metal extraction pH isotherms, the organic solution was mixed with the synthetic solution at a particular A/O ratio at 40 To determine metal scrubbing pH isotherms, the loaded organic solution and a selected scrub solution were mixed at an A/O ratio of 1:1 and 40 To determine metal stripping pH isotherms, the loaded organic solution and the strip solution were mixed at an A/O ratio of 1 and 40 The organic systems were loaded by mixing with the synthetic solution in a range of A/O ratios at 40 To determine metal stripping distribution isotherms, the loaded organic systems were mixed with strip solution in a range of O/A ratios and 40 Fresh organic solution was mixed with a predetermined volume of the 12.5% (v/v) ammonia solution. The volume of ammonia solution required had been determined from the equilibrium tests previously conducted. Timing was started immediately when the synthetic solution was added to the pre-equilibrated organic solution. Solution mixture samples were taken at different mixing times for assay. To determine the metal stripping kinetics, the loaded organic solution was mixed with the strip solution at an A/O ratio of 1:1. The strip solution contained 6 The two organic systems were loaded and the two phases were then separated in a separation funnel for 2 The two phases of the solution mixture samples taken were separated through a Whatman 1PS filter paper. The aqueous phase of each sample was then filtered through a 0.45 The objectives of the batch tests were to compare the performance of the two SSX systems, Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP and Versatic 10/4PC, in terms of extraction, scrubbing and stripping pH isotherms, extraction and stripping distribution isotherms, extraction and stripping kinetics, and phase separation. It was also important to optimise the composition of the selected SSX system for the separation of nickel and cobalt from manganese, magnesium and calcium. A series of tests were conducted with Versatic 10 concentrations in the range of 0.25 A series of tests were conducted with Versatic 10 concentrations in the range of 0.25 The nickel and cobalt extraction distribution isotherms and their McCabe–Thiele diagrams with the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system are shown in With the Versatic 10/4PC system the nickel and cobalt extraction distribution isotherms and McCabe–Thiele diagrams showed that only one theoretical extraction stage is needed to extract almost all the nickel and two theoretical extraction stages are needed to extract almost all the cobalt. After a single contact at an A/O ratio of 2:1, 40 The nickel, cobalt and manganese concentrations in the loaded Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system were 2.25, 0.112 and 0.033 For the Versatic 10/4PC system, the nickel, cobalt and manganese concentrations in the organic solution were 7.26, 0.338 and 0.206 Over 99% nickel, cobalt and manganese were stripped in the pH range of 0.5–2.0 with the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system, indicating easy stripping of nickel and cobalt from the loaded organic solution ( With the Versatic 10/4PC system, the manganese stayed within the organic solution until pH reached 0.8 while nickel was stripped almost completely in the pH range of 0.5–3.5 and complete stripping of cobalt was obtained in the pH range of 0.5–1.0 ( The objective of the scrubbing stage is to remove the co-extracted manganese, magnesium and calcium as much as possible and the extracted valuable metals especially cobalt as little as possible at a lower pH than that for extraction with a scrub solution containing nickel by using the crowding effect of the hydrogen and nickel ions. With the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system and a scrub solution containing 120 A scrub solution containing 300 The scrubbing pH isotherms of manganese and cobalt with the two organic systems are shown in With the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system, 91% Ni, 97% Co and 13% Mn were extracted in the first 30 With the Versatic 10/4PC system 75% Ni and 22% Co were extracted in the first 30 The purpose of adding TBP in the V10/L63 system is to improve the nickel strip kinetics ( Stripping tests were conducted using the loaded Versatic 10/4PC system containing 7.26 The Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system was pre-equilibrated at 40 The Versatic 10/4PC system was pre-equilibrated at 40  Selectivity. The selectivity of Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system was much higher in terms of separation factors and ΔpH Calcium extraction. The Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system extracted much less calcium than the Versatic 10/4PC system. Therefore, with the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system, no gypsum scaling should occur in the SX plant, which was identified as a problem in Bulong's SX plant ( Scrubbing. The co-extracted manganese with the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP SSX system can be scrubbed by nickel either in the extraction or scrubbing stages. However, the co-extracted manganese with the Versatic 10/4PC SSX system could not be scrubbed by nickel either in the extraction or scrubbing stages, possibly because a large portion of the Mn(II) had been oxidised to Mn(III). Stripping kinetics. The stripping kinetics of nickel and cobalt were fast with both Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP and Versatic 10/4PC SSX systems. The manganese stripping kinetics with the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP system was fast. However the stripping kinetics of manganese with the Versatic 10/4PC system was very slow. Loading capacity. The loading capacity of Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP SSX system was lower than that of the Versatic 10/4PC SSX system due to the low concentration of the effective oxime component in the LIX63 extractant ( Based on the above points it was judged that the Versatic 10/LIX63/TBP SSX system outperformed the Versatic 10/4PC SSX system. Therefore the former was selected as the SSX system for further tests in semi- and fully-continuous tests, the results of which will be reported in the part 2 of this paper. Synergistic shifts were obtained for nickel and cobalt by the addition of 4PC or LIX63 to the organic solution containing Versatic 10, resulting in large ΔpH It is concluded that the SSX system containing 0.5 The authors would like to thank Dr Matthew Jeffrey for reviewing this paper and providing valuable comments.
