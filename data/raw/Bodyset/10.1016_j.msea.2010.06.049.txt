Commercial purity titanium was processed through up to 8 passes by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature using a die with a channel angle of 120°. The billets showed no evidence for any surface damage after ECAP. This processing reduced the grain size from ∼23μm in the unprocessed condition to ∼200nm after 6 or 8 passes. It also increased the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength and increased the elongation to failure by comparison with CP Ti processed by ECAP at an elevated temperature. The results demonstrate the advantage of processing CP Ti by ECAP at room temperature.The processing of metals by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) refers to a procedure in which a billet is pressed through a die constrained within a channel bent through an abrupt angle It is relatively easy to process soft pure face-centered cubic metals by ECAP and there are now numerous reports describing the application of this process to materials such as aluminum and copper. However, it is less easy to apply ECAP to complex alloys or hard metals where the number of active slip systems is limited. An added difficulty is the requirement to conduct the ECAP at a low temperature in order to avoid significant grain growth. Several procedures are now available for achieving successful ECAP in these more complex materials including the development of special strategies for the processing of age-hardenable alloys There have been several reports describing the application of ECAP to commercial purity (CP) titanium and several titanium alloys. These materials are of interest because in the long term they are attractive candidate materials for use in aerospace and automotive applications but, more importantly, in the short term they are of potential use for medical and dental implants The processing of Ti by ECAP is difficult because of the occurrence of cracking and segmentation. Early experiments established that it was not possible to process CP Ti at room temperature using a conventional ECAP die with a channel angle of 90° and instead the billet broke into several pieces by segmentation A recent report demonstrated that it was feasible to successfully press CP Ti at room temperature for a single pass of ECAP by increasing the channel angle to 120° and reducing the ram speed to 0.5 The experiments were performed using an annealed hot-rolled plate of CP Ti (grade 1) having an average grain size of ∼23 Microstructures were observed after ECAP using both optical microscopy (OM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on polished surfaces cut perpendicular to the pressing axis: this is equivalent to the Tensile testing was conducted by cutting samples from the central regions of the pressed billets with gauge lengths of 10 Although it is generally assumed that CP Ti cannot be processed by ECAP at room temperature, the present experiments demonstrated the potential for achieving excellent samples after processing. Processing through 1 pass was described earlier   All specimens were tested in tension to failure at room temperature and the results are tabulated in These results confirm that there is excellent strengthening after ECAP with the yield strength increasing from 275 to 710 These experiments provide the first demonstration of the ability to process CP Ti through multiple passes by ECAP at room temperature. By increasing the channel angle within the die to The experiments used CP Ti with an initial grain size of ∼23 It is convenient to compare the present results with earlier data reported for CP Ti when processing at elevated temperatures using an ECAP die with a channel angle of 90°.  Commercial purity titanium was successfully processed through up to 8 passes by equal-channel angular pressing at room temperature using a die with a channel angle of 120°, a relatively slow ram speed of 2 The grain size of the CP Ti was reduced from ∼23 Both the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength are increased in the billets processed at room temperature and the elongation to failure is also increased by comparison with materials processed by ECAP at an elevated temperature using a 90° die. The results provide a very clear demonstration of the advantage of processing CP Ti at room temperature. This work was supported by the
