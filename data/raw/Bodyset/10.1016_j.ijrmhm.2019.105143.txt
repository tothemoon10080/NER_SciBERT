The effects of rapid pulse electric current sintering (PECS), substitution of WC by NbC and Co by Ni, and carbide additives (TiC and Mo2C) on the microstructure, elastic modulus, B3B transverse rupture strength (TRS) and high temperature sliding wear on WC-Co, WC-Ni, NbC-Co and NbC-Ni cermets were studied. Additions of x% Mo2C and y% TiC (where x and y were <10 wt%), coupled with PECS, significantly refined the NbC-Ni cermet's carbide grain size from ~5.0 μm to <0.8 μm, giving mechanical properties comparable to WC-Co and WC-Ni cermets: >14 GPa hardness and ~10 MPa.m1/2 fracture toughness (KIC) and ball-on-three-balls (B3B) TRS > 1600 MPa. The sintering techniques had negligible effect on the samples' elastic and shear modulus, and all WC-based samples had higher elastic modulus than all NbC-based samples (by ~120 GPa). High temperature sliding wear tests were carried out using a ball-on-disk tribometer, with a 10 N force, at a sliding speed of 1.34 m/s for 0.8 km (10 min) and 2.4 km (30 min), using 100Cr6 (AISI 52100) steel balls at 400 °C and 0% humidity. For the 2.4 km sliding distance, all the WC cermets had lower wear volumes than NbC cermets, with LPS WC-0.5Cr3C2-10Co having the lowest wear volume. Additions of TiC and Mo2C to NbC-12Ni improved the sliding wear resistance, with TiC having the greater effect, reducing the sample wear rate by over 30% from 15.1 × 10−6 mm3/N·m to 9.4 × 10−6 mm3/N·m after sliding distance of 2.4 km. Generally, the LPS samples had lower wear volumes than the corresponding SPS samples, due to higher K1c and TRS.Cemented carbides or hardmetals are one of the oldest and most successful commercial powder metallurgy composites [ Niobium carbide has slightly lower room temperature hardness than WC [ The lower fracture toughness of the liquid phase sintered NbC-Co cemented carbides than WC-Co was attributed to poor wetting of NbC by Co [ In this study, the effects of pulse electric current sintering (PECS), NbC as a major carbide phase, substitution of Co by Ni, as well as Mo The starting powders and their characteristics are given in The milled composite powders were consolidated in a PECS furnace (HP D5, FCT Systeme, Germany). The powders were poured into cylindrical graphite dies with inner and outer diameters of 20.9 mm and 40 mm respectively, and 48 mm height. The composite powder assemblies were heated in a vacuum (2 Pa) in two steps, for example WC-10Co (wt%) powders were first heated to 1000 °C at a rate of 200 °C/min and subsequently to 1240 °C at a heating rate of 100 °C/min, and the temperature was held at 1240 °C for 5 min during sintering. A cooling rate of 200 °C/min was used for all samples. The applied pressure was adjusted from 16 MPa to 30 MPa at 1000 °C, and from 30 MPa to 50 MPa at 1240 °C within 30 s. The pressure was then held constant at 50 MPa throughout the rapid sintering cycle. Horizontal and vertical graphite papers were used to separate the powders from the die and punch set-up. Hexagonal boron nitride was placed on the graphite paper to prevent carbon diffusion from the graphite paper to the powders during sintering. The graphite die was wrapped in a carbon cloth to minimize the heat loss from the die surface. The temperature was controlled by an optical pyrometer focused on a central borehole on the upper punch, 1 mm above the top surface of the sample, to give an accurate estimation of the sample temperature [ Liquid phase sintering (HIP, Ultra Temp, USA) was done by heating the compositions in a vacuum (0.04 MPa) at an initial heating rate of 2.4 °C/min up to 1200 °C. At 1200 °C, cobalt loss protection (CLP) was carried out by the addition of argon gas at a pressure of 0.37 MPa, and a heating rate 3.5 °C/min up to 1430 °C. The temperature was held constant for 75 min, and for the last 20 min, hot isostatic pressing (SinterHIP) was done at 4.4 MPa to eliminate all porosity [ Archimedes' principle was used to determine the density of the sintered samples (ED224S, Sartorius, Germany). Microstructures of the cemented carbides were examined in a field emission scanning electron microscope (SIGMA, Karl Zeiss, Germany), with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-act, Oxford Instruments, United Kingdom) and annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) (JEOL 2100, with a LaB Vickers hardness (HV The transverse rupture strength (TRS) was determined by the ball-on-three-balls (B3B) method (5500R Universal tester, Instron, USA) on 16 mm dimeter samples with 1.7 mm thickness using 13 mm diameter balls. Loading was achieved using a 50 KN loading cell at a loading speed of 1.5 mm/min, with a pre-load of 20 N applied before every test. High temperature sliding wear tests were carried out using a ball-on-disk high temperature tribometer (BAM, Germany), applying a 10 N force at a sliding speed of 1.34 m/s for 0.8 km (10 min) and 2.4 km (30 min). The abrasive materials were 100 Cr6 steel balls and the test temperature was 400 °C at 0% humidity with no lubrication. The samples' worn volumes (ΔV Secondary electron microscopy images of LPS ( Although both WC-10Co (wt%) and WC-10Ni (wt%) samples were produced from larger WC starting powders (~0.5 μm) than the NbC starting powders (0.35 μm), in the NbC-12Ni (wt%) sample ( The finer NbC grains were due to the to the shorter sintering time and lower sintering temperature during PECS, preventing continuous Ostwald ripening [ Additions of Mo Pulse electric current sintering refined the microstructures of all samples ( The Vickers hardness, fracture toughness (K The WC-10Co (LPS) cermet had a higher K The WC based cermets irrespective of the sintering method and type of binder had significantly higher elastic modulus (by ~120 GPa) than all the NbC cermets ( Generally, the WC based cermets had high TRS than the NbC based cermets ( The sample wear rate (SWR) and coefficient of friction (μ) for investigated samples are shown in This debris on the wear track was subjected to cyclic loading by the 100Cr6 balls during sliding wear, leading to plastic deformation and strain hardening, forming hard abrasive bodies [ The WC-10Co (wt%) samples had lower SWR values than all the NbC based samples irrespective of sintering technique ( All pulse electric current sintered (PECS) samples had higher hardnessess and lower fracture toughness (K This work was financially supported by
