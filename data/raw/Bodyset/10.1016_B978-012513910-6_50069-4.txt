What is Currently Happening?. Natural Zeolite Products Found Now in the Market Conclusions       Acknowledgments References Natural zeolites have held substantial attractiveness to geologists, chemists, engineers, veterinarians, medical doctors, physicists, and other specialists in different fields on account of their remarkable properties. Nevertheless, the rapid advance of synthetic zeolites has obscured the really widespread commercial utilization of natural zeolites. The purpose of the present chapter is to summarize what is known about natural zeolites of sedimentary origin as a consequence of the results obtained in fundamental research on these minerals and the progress achieved in the application of natural zeolites in environmental remediation and industry. Natural zeolites were discovered by Freiherr Axel Fredrick Cronsted, a Swedish mineralogist, during the collection of minerals in a copper mine in Lappmark, Sweden. Cronsted baptized the new mineral with the name zeolite, because of the characteristic intumescence of the mineral observed by him during blowpipe tests on the crystals he found. The term zeolite is derived from two Greek roots “zeo” to boil and “lithos” a stone. Since Cronstedt's initial discovery of stilbite, approximately 50 natural zeolites have been detected. In fact, these unique minerals were known by mankind during centuries before the Cronsted's recognition of them as a distinct mineralogical species. They were used as dimension stones in the construction of pyramids and temples in Mexico and of houses and churches in Cappadoccia, Asia Minor, and were also used by Romans for the production of pozzolanic cement [ For two hundred years rock hunters and geologists have recognized crystals of different zeolites in the cavities of basaltic and volcanic rocks and adorned museum cases with beautiful, very well-formed, and curious crystals with little utility owing to the impossibility of obtaining commercially feasible deposits [ The late 1950s, however, major geological discoveries have revealed the widespread occurrence of natural zeolites in large sedimentary deposits, suitable for mining, throughout the world [ Commercially feasible deposits of zeolites have been discovered in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States. Occurrences have been reported in Angola, Argentina, Botswana, Burundi, Chile, Congo, Egypt, Germany, Guatemala, France, Iran, Kenya, Korea, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, the Philippines, Spain, the South African Republic, and Tanzania. The structure of zeolites and related materials is very well described in divers textbooks, handbooks, and articles [ Chabazite (CHA framework type [ The structure of clinoptilolite (HEU framework type [ The structure of mordenite (MOR framework type [ To illustrate the actual elemental and phase composition and the external morphology of real natural zeolite rocks, in Natural zeolites, after the elimination of zeolitic water by heating, are capable, on account of their structure, of adsorbing gases and vapors in the zeolite primary porosity [ Extraframework charge-compensating cations are able to be exchanged during ion exchange reactions [ The structure, the composition, the feasible phase transformations during hydrothermal, thermal, and tribochemical treatments, and the properties of adsorption, ionic exchange, catalysis, and cationic conduction are responsible for the large Fontana discovered the adsorption effect in 1777. In natural zeolites, adsorption was first noted by Grandjean in 1910 and later studied by Weigel and Steinhof in 1925, Mc Bain in 1926, Sameshina in 1929, and Tiselius in 1934. Mc Bain introduced the concept of zeolites as molecular sieves in 1932 to describe the selectivity of zeolites during molecular adsorption according to size [ The study of zeolites as adsorbent materials was initiated by Prof. Richard M. Barrer around 1938, when he published the paper “Sorption of Polar and Non-polar Gases by Zeolites” [ Natural zeolites are good adsorbents for H Zeolites are complex adsorption systems. During the adsorption process, initial micropore filling (adsorption in the primary porosity) is followed by surface coverage on the walls of open mesopores and macropores (adsorption in the secondary porosity), which occurs at higher pressures and comprises monolayer and multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation [ The primary and secondary porosity of natural zeolite rocks containing 80–90 wt% of chabazite, clinoptilolite, erionite, or mordenite is characterized by a micropore volume of [ When a molecule diffuses inside a zeolite channel, it is attracted and repelled by various interactions, such as the dispersion energy (Φ The origin of the electrostatic potentials Φ It is evident from this discussion that the dispersion and repulsion interactions are present in all gas-zeolite adsorption systems; therefore they are nonspecific interactions [ For the application of zeolites as adsorbents or catalysts, the migration or diffusion of sorbed molecules through the pores and cages within the zeolite crystal plays a dominant role. Configurational diffusion is the term coined to describe diffusion in zeolites, a type of transport characterized by low diffusion coefficients and high activation energies, as in the case of atomic diffusion in solid crystals [ Experimental investigation of the diffusion of gases and vapors in natural zeolites is very scarce [ In sorption kinetic studies of hydrocarbons in chabazite and mordenite [ Diffusion in clinoptilolite was studied, and it was demonstrated that the rate of uptake is clearly affected by the charge-balancing cations present in the zeolite structure [ The diffusion of hydrocarbons in erionite is significant in petrochemistry. The adsorption rate of normal paraffins The values reported for the corrected diffusion coefficient It is a very well-known fact that the cationic composition of zeolites directly affects the adsorption capacity in the primary porosity of these materials [ Chabazite, for example, is very useful for H The substitution of Na by Ca in chabazite leads to a considerable increase of the heat of adsorption for CO In In In practical applications, such as in bed reactors and pressure or vacuum swing devices [ The sorption capacity and the separation factor of erionite are clearly dependent on cationic composition [ For mordenite an increase in the size of the exchanged cation (H Another procedure for altering the adsorption properties of natural zeolites is leaching with mineral acids. The acid treatment exchanges cations of the zeolite with H Acid leaching of a natural clinoptilolite, for example, increases the adsorption of benzene [ Leaching of zeolites with weak acids such as H As was asserted, the most significant commercial adsorption-related applications reported for natural zeolites are the purification of acid natural gas streams, gas drying, ammonia removal from gases, air separation, biogas purification, N Chabazite and clinoptilolite are normally used for the removal of H The separation of air into N The working principle of a PSA installation (see The zeolite-related processes for N Gas separation with natural zeolites is also applied as an analytical tool, using modified natural zeolites as adsorbent columns for permanent-gas and low-hydrocarbon-gas analysis in a gas Chromatograph [ The solar energy storage [ In solar cooling installations (see The above examples are fundamentally related to the adsorption in the primary porosity [ Another example is deodorization, which is a very important application of natural zeolites [ One of the uses of the deodorizing power of zeolites is in laboratories where animals are used for experimentation. The use of zeolites in laboratory rat litters increases the time between litter changes to 15 days from the usual 3 or 4 days. Recently natural zeolites were used for the adsorption of pollutants from liquid phases. Natural zeolites to be used in the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons from water solutions must be modified because of their hydrophilic nature [ Benzene, toluene, and xylenes are present in aquatic ecosystems because these aromatic hydrocarbons are present in fuels (crude oil, gasoline and diesel). Chabazite and clinoptilolite zeolite rocks modified with organocations (TMA For the adsorption of polar compounds dissolved in water solutions one can use NH Cell immobilization in the secondary porosity of natural zeolites can be used in biotechnological applications such as alcohol fermentation where the zeolite act as a catalyst [ Inclusion phenomena are related to adsorption, but inclusion is not really an adsorption process. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the organization of the present chapter, this section is a good place to discuss it. The primary and secondary porosity of zeolites can accept various compounds [ Inside the zeolite primary or secondary porosity, selected compounds can be occluded. The inclusion process can be carried out thermally [ Ionic exchange is perhaps the most useful attribute of natural zeolites. It is extremely important, since on one hand it is used for zeolite modification [ Based in this knowledge, processes were developed for the treatment of municipal and radioactive wastewaters [ Ionic exchange in zeolites is a complicated process involving two particles: the extraframework charge balance cation present in the zeolite, and the ion dissolved in solution. The ion exchange reaction in zeolites is represented by [ Ion exchange equilibrium data are reported in the form of isotherms with the help of the equivalent ionic fraction [ The total exchange capacity of a aluminosilicate zeolite is a function of the framework Si/Al ratio. It is easy to get a numerical relation between the total exchange capacity in milliequivalents per gram and the number of Al atoms per framework unit cell ( Kinetic aspects are significant in the employment of ionic exchange in zeolites. Is generally accepted that the ionic exchange process in zeolites is described by three steps [ Interdiffusion in the thin adhered liquid layer (0 < An intermediate step, where interdiffusion in the thin liquid layer and crystalline interdiffusion are both present ( Interdiffusion of A and B in the zeolite crystals ( The kinetic of the earliest process, the interdiffusion in the thin adhered liquid layer, is described by [ The values reported for the interdiffusion coefficients of cations in natural zeolites are around 10 The charge of the interdiffusing cations. Monovalent cations move faster in zeolites and have lower activation energies than divalent cations [ The structure of the zeolite, or more specifically the dimensions of zeolite channels and cavities. Cations move faster in mordenite than in clinoptililolite, and faster in clinoptilolite than in erionite [ The cationic radius. The cation exchange rate decreases with increasing cationic radius [ The concentration of the exchange solution. The rate of the ionic exchange increase with the solution concentration [ Experimentally it has been shown [ Sewage treatment has both ecological and economic importance. Ammonium and phosphate ions are the primary inorganic In the common sewage treatment, ammonium is removed by biological denitrification, and phosphates are precipitated with the help of aluminum and iron salts [ Based on the above described characteristics, the application of natural zeolites as ionic exchangers has been considered as an alternative technology for ammonium removal from municipal wastewater. Large-scale facilities have been constructed to accomplish this goal, for example, in Tahoe–Truckee, California (22,500 m The removal of Chabacite, clinoptilolite, and mordenite, as was previously explained, selectively exchange radioactive Cs These materials are also employed for the removal of radionuclides from polluted areas around nuclear power station accidents or where nuclear weapons have been stored, such as the Chernobyl area in Ukraine, the Chelyabinsk area in Russia, the Semipalatinsk area in Kazakhstan, or the Krasnoyarsk area in Siberia [ One more important application is the eradication of radionuclides from animal products such as milk and meat produced by farm animals exposed to the contamination of radionuclides [ Heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, Zn, Ni, Fe, Hg, Mn, Sn, Ti, W, V, and Zr) in water and wastewater turn out to be a serious environmental problem on account of the highly toxic effect of these metals on living organisms and because they are objectionable for some manufacturing operations. The common process for the elimination of heavy metals from wastewater is its precipitation with lime or soda [ An ionic exchange operation with a low-cost minerals such as natural zeolites could be an adequate solution in many cases [ It has been shown that chabazite, clinoptilolite, and mordenite are selective to heavy metals, especially to Pb [ For the recovery of Ni Colloidal manganese oxide is used for the removal of trace metals in water solution [ Zeolites are cationic exchangers, but it is possible to alter natural zeolites to carry out anionic exchange. In recent years this has been done by hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) exchange. The materials achieved with the help of this manipulation are able to exchange chromates and other oxyanions [ Chabazite, clinoptilolite, and mordenite, as was previously mentioned, are greatly selective for NH Another procedure for the reduction of NH Zeolite-related technologies relevant to agronomy include slow-release fertilizers [ Slow-release fertilization is a combination of ion exchange and mineral dissolution reactions. Mixtures of clinoptilolite and phosphate rocks have been used as active components for supplying the most essential plant nutrients [ Zeoponics [ Urea is one of the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizers; however, it is very soluble in water and is transformed into ammonium ions by urease, an enzyme found in soils. Subsequently, the produced ammonium ions are transmuted to leachable nitrate anions by soil bacteria. If we introduce molten urea in to the cavities and channels of natural zeolites, we can produce a slow-release fertilizer where the rate of nitrogen release is reduced by sequestering urea in the zeolite. The zeolite here acts in two fashions: initially it obstruct the urease action, delaying the formation of ammonium cations; and when the ammonium cations are eventually produced, the zeolite exchanges them, protecting them from the action of nitrifying bacteria [ The large amount of nitrogen contained in swine and bovine wastes represent a valuable resource for crops. Natural zeolites can be the basis of different methods for the treatment of these wastes to recover nitrogen. For example, one can produce fertilizers composed of powdered and dried natural zeolites and swine or bovine wastes; these materials are effective for improving sandy soils and soils low in organic matter [ Zeolites neutralize biological media by proton exchange [ Zeolites used as packing material in anaerobic filters in the purification of wastewater with high volumetric organic loading are effective in decreasing its chemical oxygen demand and acidity and intensifying biogas production [ Abundant evidence indicates that increased weight gain, increased feed efficiency, and decreased incidence and severity of diarrhea result from the addition of 1–5 wt% of clinoptilolite to the diet of pigs, cattle, and sheep [ It has been suggested [ Around thirty years ago, natural zeolites were called “the mineral of the century;” but at present natural zeolites are considered by some authors the “stepchild” of the synthetic zeolite industry [ Natural zeolites can be cleaned to high purity using currently available mineral processing equipment [ The simplest manipulation necessary for the use of a zeolite as an adsorbent is its dehydration. Some zeolites, such as chabazite, clinoptilolite, erionite, and mordenite, can be heated to 300–400 °C and completely dehydrated without loss of crystallinity, but other zeolites, such as scolecite and natrolite, undergo transformations during dehydration [ Water molecules in zeolites are held with a pseudo-continuous range of energies: some water molecules are desorbed at relatively low temperatures, and the rest are firmly held to the extraframework cations and often evolve with concomitant cationic migration and structural relaxation [ If the zeolite temperature is increased to 500–600 °C after the dehydration, one observes a phase transformation of the zeolite to a siliceous phase such as quartz or cristobalite or a compact aluminosilicate phase such as labradorite [ Moreover, if we grind a zeolite (for example, sample HC), sieve the obtained powders to obtain particles of grain size less than 100 μm, and prepare wafers from these particles by pressing them at 100 MPa after first agglomerating the powders with polyvinyl alcohol, then if the wafers are thermally treated at 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, and 1150 °C, then we observe an increase of the density of the wafers from 1 g/cm A very significant thermal modification is found in zeolites previously exchanged with ammonium cations; they are transformed into acid zeolites by the decomposition [ This procedure may be followed by ultrastabilization, which is one of the basic operations in the industrial production of acid catalysts, consisting in controlled dealumination produced by thermal treatment in water-vapor atmosphere, which increases the thermal stability of the zeolite [ The thermal reduction of zeolites previously exchanged with metals is the method currently used for the preparation of bifunctional catalysts [ The procedure for the preparation of natural-zeolite-supported bifunctional catalysts is the same as for synthetic zeolites [ Previously, we described the modification of zeolites by ionic exchange and leaching with mineral acids in relation to the improvement of the adsorption properties of natural zeolites. These procedures are hydrothermal treatments, and with the help of these techniques it is also possible to obtain catalysts [ The hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites is carried out with highly reactive aluminosilicate gels in autogenous conditions. This kind of synthesis may involve the structure directing role of alkaline cations in solution-mediated crystallization of the amorphous gel [ The hydrothermal treatment of natural zeolites [ Employing a high-temperature modification of a natural zeolite one can produce a material [ The obtained powders were tested in the construction of grinding tools applying the Longinotti procedure. In the manufacture of the tool, all the pumice usually employed in the Longinotti procedure was replaced with natural zeolite SA, and 50% of the silicon carbide was replaced with natural zeolite SA thermally modified at 1150 °C. The tool was assembled and successfully tested in the Elpidio Berovides Construction Materials factory located in Cotorro, Havana, Cuba [ Natural zeolites are generally not considered for catalyst manufacture by reason of the impurities present in the natural zeolite rocks used as raw materials. Nevertheless, in some reactions, such as the isomerization of hydrocarbons, this contamination does not effect the catalytic transformation; therefore, acid natural zeolites can be used for this purpose [ It has also been shown that acid clinoptilolite, used as a catalyst in ethanol dehydration, exhibits a high selectivity to ethylene production, due to steric restrictions imposed on the formation of diethyl ether [ A pilot plant test of the ethanol dehydration reaction was carried out in a 20-cm In addition, it has been found that acid natural clinoptilolite and mordenite catalyze the cyclization of citronellal to isopulegoll [ Bifunctional catalysts are also made up for hydrocarbon hydrogenation. Clinoptilolite [ A natural erionite ore exchanged with NH Cadmium-exchanged chabacite, clinoptilolite, erionite, and mordenite (natural zeolites) were tested as catalysts in the hydration of aceltylene to acetaldehyde, and it was shown that Cd–clinoptilolite is the most active, selective, and stable catalyst [ Natural zeolites can be used as raw material for the production of Na-X and Na-Y zeolites; for instance, clinoptilolite can be recrystallized to faujasite by hydrothermal treatment with NaOH solutions [ The most ancient and, so far, the most massive application of natural zeolites is in the building industry. This circumstance is related to the highly acceptable mechanical properties of natural zeolites, their low weight, and their agreeable external appearance [ The easiest application of these materials for building is directly as dimension stones [ The use of zeolitic tuffs for the preparation of blended cements is a common industrial practice [ Further applications of natural zeolites in the building industry are the preparation of lightweight brick [ Natural zeolite rocks have been mined since ancient times to be used as building materials and for the preparation of cements. The production of natural zeolites for other purposes was started in Japan and the United States during the 1950s, and afterwards in Georgia, Russia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy, Cuba, Slovakia, Mexico, Romania, Ukraine, Canada, Greece, Turkey, Spain, Australia, and Serbia [ In Japan, natural zeolites have been used during the last 40 years as fillers in paper, for livestock feeding, as carriers of agricultural chemicals, as fertilizers, as additives in detergents, as aggregates in the production of lightweight bricks, as adsorbents for water removal from refrigerants, for air separation, for SO In the United States, in 1961–1962 the Union Carbide Corporation's Linde Division made the first commercial application of chabazite rocks mined in the Bowie, Arizona deposit, and in the following years W. R. Grace and Norton Company also began the production of natural zeolites for adsorption applications that required acid-resistant zeolites [  During 15 years, approximately from 1970 to 1985, many believed that natural zeolites would become another major mineral commodity. This did not occur [ The high cost of transportation from the deposits to the application sites. The availability of competitive minerals such as kaolin and vermiculite. The impurity of natural zeolites. The lack of technological consistency in the product offered. The poor characterization of the zeolite rocks. The low level of fundamental and technological research on which some proposed applications were based. It is the authors belief that all these problems could be solved, and perhaps the real explanation for the lack of commercial success of natural zeolites during the last 40 years lies elsewhere—possibly in the competition of synthetic zeolites: synthetic zeolites A, X, and Y, and to some extent ZSM-5, were discovered and used extensively prior to the existence and commercial exploitation of large deposits of natural zeolites. In 1995 the world synthetic zeolite market was $1.5 billion, with about 2 million metric tons of production [ On the other hand, the applications of synthetic zeolites will increase with the advent of a new field in zeolite science and technology, called advanced zeolite materials science, [ These comments indicate that the market for synthetic zeolites is not threatened by natural zeolites. For instance, the properties of zeolite A that make it useful as a detergent builder are very special, and there is no natural zeolite so white, with such a high cationic exchange capacity, and available with a particle diameter of 1-3 μm; therefore, in this important field there is no competition. For catalytic cracking, notwithstanding the fact that faujasite is a natural zeolite, as far we know it does not exist in industrially minable deposits. Besides, the particle size and the chemical composition useful for catalytic cracking are very difficult to find in nature. Furthermore, a zeolite like ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio is not easily found in nature. To conclude this section, it is my opinion that there currently exists a market for both synthetic and natural zeolites, and the evidence supports this belief [ The demand for natural zeolites has increased steadily over the past years in the United States and Europe, and the process will continue with the incorporation of emergent economies of Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East [ Likewise, due to the environmental applications of these materials, the natural zeolite business is also growing. For the 1990s environmentalism became one of the biggest social and political concerns for the world, and from the Three Mile Island cleanup and Superfund site toxic waste applications to landfill liners, natural zeolites could be applied to solve environmental problems [ Currently natural zeolites are marketed by several companies [ Moreover, natural zeolites are classified in the United States as Deodorization is a very well-known use of natural zeolites [ Steelhead Specialty Minerals promotes its products as a natural mineral known as zeolite, a mineral formed by volcanic ash falling into bodies of water, which adsorbs moisture and ammonia [ Agriculture is one of the oldest field of application of zeolites. Continuing the development begun in Japan [ As far as we know, the first zeoponic substrate was proposed by scientists from Bulgaria [ Animal nourishment is one of the most important applications of natural zeolites. Based in experiments carried out mainly in Japan [ When Prof. R.M. Barrer commenced his study of the properties of zeolites [ Now, Soika-Axis [ The high cation exchange capacity of natural zeolites, combined with their selectivity, as was previously discussed, makes these materials very useful for applications in water treatment and aquaculture. In this regard, Aquatic Eco-system Inc. [ Finally, the Hungarian company Borsod Chemical Works promotes the product Ongrofloc as a very effective flocculent, prepared with natural zeolites, to be used in the biological treatment of sewage [ It is my opinion that at the present time natural zeolites are becoming a genuine mineral commodity and the process is irreversible, since:  As a rule, zeolite rocks are soft and friable enough for easy, mechanized mining. After mining, these minerals, for the majority of their applications, require little processing. The mineral need only be crushed and sieved then dried. These minerals are suitable to help in the solution of some of the most important problems of mankind, such as: Pollution abatement. Energy saving. Increase of agricultural production. Reclamation of degraded soils. Production of building materials. On the other side: The increase in the number of companies in the natural zeolite business decreases the high transportation cost from the deposits to the application sites, because is possible to find the zeolite near you. The rival minerals are not competitive with natural zeolites in the most important applications, because they have not the necessary properties. The impurities found in natural zeolites can be removed by various methods, depending on the end use. The lack of technological consistency in the product offered can be remedied by careful organization of the mining process and precise characterization of the mined zeolite rocks (see The level of the fundamental and technological research in the field of natural zeolites is increasing. During the literature recompilation to write the present review the author noted a steady increase year by year in the number and quality of the publications in the field, and the incorporation of new and very enthusiastic research groups in the natural zeolite community. Finally, the minerals are generally inert and nontoxic, and step by step the health organizations in different countries are authorizing the industrial use of natural zeolites. The classification of pores in adsorbents [ Adsorption in zeolites is considered as a physisorption process, because even the interaction with hydroxyl groups in zeolites is a Van der Waals interaction [ Zeolites are complex adsorption systems. Adsorption occurs as: (1) micropore filling (adsorption in the primary porosity), and later, at high pressures, (2) surface coverage, consisting of monolayer and multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation taking place on the walls of mesopores and macropores (adsorption in the secondary porosity). Monolayer adsorption occurs when all adsorbed molecules are in contact with the adsorbent. In multilayer adsorption, not all adsorbed molecules are in direct contact with the solid surface. Capillary condensation is the filling of mesopores that remain after multilayer adsorption is complete. It is responsible for adsorption hysteresis, which means that the adsorption and desorption curves do not coincide [ Zeolites are The terms (Φ In the preceding discussion dispersion and repulsion interactions were described. The electrostatic terms can be expressed by [ where For the slab geometry ( The integration is carried out from In commonly used zeolites, the pore and cavity effective dimensions are approximately from 3 to 14 Å [ If we define Γ = The previously calculated adsorption potential ξ(θ) can be interpreted, for θ ≈ 0, as the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption for low recoveries: The following equation, obtained by Thomas Graham and Adolf Fick around 1850 [ The Fickean transport diffusion coefficients The adsorbate–adsorbent interaction field inside a zeolite framework is characterized by the presence of sites of minimum potential energy for the interaction of adsorbed molecules with the zeolite framework and charge-compensating cations. A simple model of the zeolite–adsorbate system is that of a periodic array of interconnected adsorption sites [ One of the possible applications of the solid product of the hydrothermal transformation of clinoptilolite into faujasite (see During the process of pelletization a proportion of 10–20% of binder is commonly added to the final product. The most commonly used binders are sepiolite, kaolinite, attapulgite, and montmorillonite. On account of the fact that the adsorption capacity of the binder is very low and the industrial process of synthesis of zeolites is not 100% efficient, the adsorption space of commercially available zeolites is around 80% [ In At that point, is necessary to clarify why we use the Dubinin adsorption isotherms for all our calculations. The methodology used here to measure the adsorption parameters, based in the application of the Dubinin and osmotic adsorption isotherm equations, is valid on account of the phenomenological character of both equation, the accurate fitting of experimental data to this isotherm and the consideration of the heterogeneous character of adsorption in zeolites by the Dubinin isotherm [ The first step for any use of a natural zeolite rock involves a complete characterization of the raw material to be used. My personal experience during twenty-five years of research in the field indicates that the must important failures in natural zeolite applications were related to a poor characterization of the raw materials used. The number of methods for zeolite characterization is very large and includes X-ray diffraction (XRD), magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), adsorption calorimetry, thermoprogrammed desorption, thermoprogrammed reduction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), adsorption methods of characterization [ Natural zeolite rocks are complex mixtures of minerals such as zeolites, feldspars, clays, calcite, quartz, iron oxides, and volcanic glass [ From our point of view, the most important properties of natural zeolites are adsorption and ionic exchange; thus the measurement of these properties in a controlled way can bring a first view of the sample. On the other hand, to get information about the structure, composition, and dynamics of the natural zeolite rock system, a rational selection of the set of available analytical instrumental methods must be made, because it is not necessary in all cases to use the whole set of methodologies, and from a practical point of view it is difficult or impossible to find them all in one laboratory. In our experience, it suffices to use for natural zeolite rock analysis the following set of methods: a quantitative XRD phase analysis method [ The author appreciates the financial support provided by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) of Spain and the fruitful collaboration with his colleagues at the Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica UPV-CSIC in Valencia, Spain.
