In the novel clean chromate production process, the alkali liquor recycled to decompose the chromite ore mainly consists of KOH and K2CO3 which accumulates aluminium impurity and affects the quality of the product greatly. Aluminium impurity can be removed by adding CaO to precipitate as 3CaO·Al2O3
                     ·6H2O (C3AH6). A study of the effects of various parameters, such as KOH concentration, K2CO3 concentration and temperature on the behaviour of C3AH6 show that C3AH6 is decomposed to 3CaO·Al2O3
                     ·CaCO3
                     ·11H2O and CaCO3 below 150 g L−1 KOH, and decomposed to Ca(OH)2 above 150 g L−1 KOH. With K2CO3 concentration increasing, C3AH6 decomposes significantly, which results in more CaCO3 or 3CaO·Al2O3
                     ·CaCO3
                     ·11H2O produced. Temperature has a large positive effect on the decomposition of C3AH6 at 45 g L−1 KOH but has no significant effect at 150 g L−1 KOH. The optimal condition for removing aluminium impurity in the KOH+K2CO3
                     +H2O system is 150 g L−1 KOH, 50 g L−1 K2CO3 and 80 °C.Chromium compounds are essential to many industries including paper making, high-quality alloy manufacturing, dyeing, catalysts and rubber synthesizing ( The new process is based on the following principles: (1) Highly concentrated caustic alkali solution (KOH sub-molten medium) greatly intensifies the decomposition of chromite ore compared with Na In the new process, the chromium is effectively oxidized to Cr(VI) and leached from the chromite ore in KOH sub-molten medium with air at 300 °C to form crude crystal K The schematic flowchart of the new process, The method of removing Al in the new process is adding CaO to the KOH Pure 3CaO The preparation procedures are as follows. Sodium aluminate solution (NaOH 120 g L The desired KOH The Al content (calculated as Al X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D/max-2400 diffractometer, with Cu The results of different KOH concentration on the decomposition of C When KOH concentration was above 150 g L In the process of removing aluminium from the liquor, high concentrations of KOH mean low consumption of evaporation energy. Therefore, 150 g L The results at different K The effect of different temperatures and the corresponding XRD spectra are illustrated in As noted above, when the KOH concentration was 150 g L The removal efficiency of Al was calculated as the following formula:  The stability and behaviour of 3CaO (1) KOH concentration has a significant effect on the decomposition of 3CaO (2) 3CaO (3) 3CaO (4) The preferred condition to remove aluminum impurity from the sub-molten KOH The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) under grant No.2006AA06Z129 and the National Science Foundation of China (No. 50234040).
