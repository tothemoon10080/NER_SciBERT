Outokumpu has developed a new algorithm for a mill volumetric charge measurement, which utilizes an oscillation in the power draw of a grinding mill. The new algorithm based on spectral analysis is described along with other reported charge volume measurement systems. The algorithm was tested on an industrial mill, which was equipped with another direct charge measurement system. In this paper the results and a comparison of the two charge measurement systems are presented.
