Complex sulfide ores are typically mixtures of various sulfide minerals like sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), galena (PbS), pyrite (FeS2), and barite (BaSO4) and processed by selective flotation to recover target-sulfide minerals like chalcopyrite and sphalerite. Some complex sulfide ores, however, contain anglesite (PbSO4), a mineral with relatively high solubility, that complicates selective flotation because its dissolution releases Pb2+, which ‘activates’ co-existing sulfide minerals (e.g., ZnS). Because both target and non-target sulfide minerals are recovered when flotation is non-selective, another flotation stage to recover target minerals in froth products is required. Aside from anglesite, co-existing gangue sulfide minerals like pyrite also complicate selective flotation because of their strong effects on the floatability of target-sulfide minerals via electrochemical interactions.
                  In this study, the effects of pyrite on the floatability of lead-activated sphalerite were investigated using flotation tests and electrochemical techniques coupled with contact angle measurements. Moreover, factors important to lead-activated sphalerite floatability were elucidated in detail using dissolution experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, a mechanism for lead-activated sphalerite depression by pyrite is proposed.The high demand for critical metals like copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co) is projected to increase in the future because of their importance in electronics and computers, aviation and transportation, electric and hybrid vehicles, and clean/renewal energies ( A typical complex sulfide ore contains sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS Some complex sulfide ores contain not only galena but also anglesite with higher solubility (K In practice, chalcopyrite and galena are floated first followed by sphalerite, so activation of sphalerite by Pb Although many studies have been reported about the galvanic/electrochemical interactions of sulfide minerals and/or conducting materials in grinding circuits ( In this study, the effects of pyrite on the floatability of lead-activated sphalerite were investigated using flotation tests and electrochemical techniques coupled with contact angle measurements. Moreover, factors important on lead-activated sphalerite floatability were elucidated in detail using dissolution experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, a mechanism for lead-activated sphalerite depression by pyrite is proposed. Three types of mineral specimens were used in this study: sphalerite (Kamioka Mine, Japan), pyrite (Huanzala Mine, Peru), and galena (Beni Tadjit, Morocco), which were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF, EDXL300, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, MultiFlex, Rigaku Corporation, Japan). The chemical and mineralogical compositions of these samples are summarized in Flotation experiments were carried out using an agitator-type flotation machine (FT-1000, Heiko-Seisakusyo, Japan) equipped with a 400-mL flotation cell under the following conditions: 25 °C, impeller speed of 1000 rpm, and air flow rate of 1 L/min. Ground sphalerite and pyrite (−75 µm) were used as model samples. After flotation for 10 min, froth and tailings were dried at 105 °C for 24 h and analyzed by XRF to determine the recovery of Zn and Fe. All the experiments were done in duplicates to ascertain that the differences observed were statistically significant. In the flotation cell, a suspension of 10 g of sphalerite and 400 mL of distilled water was conditioned for 3 min after adding the following reagents in sequence: 1 kg/t Na In the flotation cell, 10 g of sphalerite and 10 g of pyrite were conditioned in 400 mL of distilled water for 3 min after adding the following reagents in sequence: 1 kg/t of Na In the flotation cell, a suspension of 10 g of sphalerite and 400 mL of distilled water was conditioned for 3 min after adding the following reagents sequentially: pre-determined concentrations of Fe Contact angle measurements were carried out using galena and pyrite electrodes in a solution containing 0.1 M of Na The galena electrode was pre-treated for 5 min in a solution containing 5 ppm of KAX. Bubble contact angles on the surface of galena were measured using the captive bubble method as illustrated in The model sample (2.5 g of galena mixed with 0.0, 2.5, or 5.0 g of pyrite) and 100 mL of distilled water were put in a 100 mL beaker, and the pH of suspension was adjusted to 7 using dilute NaOH and H The XPS analysis was conducted using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.7 eV) operated at 100 W (voltage = 10 kV; current = 10 mA) under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (~6.7 × 10  Mixed sphalerite-pyrite flotation was carried out to evaluate the effects of pyrite on Zn recovery. Prior to the flotation experiments with KAX, two types of samples (sphalerite only and sphalerite with pyrite) were treated with 5 ppm Pb To elucidate how pyrite depressed the floatability of lead-activated sphalerite, the effects of dissolved Fe and S, both known oxidation products of pyrite (Eq. As shown in To investigate the remaing two mechanisms of lead-activated sphalerite floatability depression by pyrite shown in When pyrite and lead-activated sphalerite are stirred in the flotation cell, PbS-like compounds formed on sphalerite could be dissolved electrochemically due to galvanic interactions and/or peeled off by attrition. It follows that after the dissolution and/or exfoliation of PbS-like compounds formed on sphalerite, xanthate adsorbed on these compounds will also be desorbed, resulting in the lower floatability of lead-activated sphalerite in the presence of pyrite. To evaluate this mechanism in more detail, the changes in contact angle of galena treated in a KAX solution with and without electrical connection to pyrite as well as the extent of galena dissolution with varying amounts of pyrite were investigated. The changes in contact angle of xanthate-treated galena with and without electrical connection to pyrite ( This enhanced dissolution of galena due to galvanic interactions could cause xanthate desorption and the release of Pb Dissolution tests of galena (2.5 g) with varying amounts of pyrite (0.0, 2.5, and 5.0 g) were conducted to confirm whether the presence of pyrite enhances the dissolution of galena due to their galvanic interaction or not. In this experiment, galena was used instead of lead-activated sphalerite because the estimated concentration of Pb To characterize the surface of galena after the dissolution tests with and without pyrite, XPS analysis of dissolution test residues was conducted. The XPS spectra (Pb 4f  In this paper, the effects of pyrite on the floatability of lead-activated sphalerite were investigated and the findings of this study are summarized as follows: Lead activation improved sphalerite floatability but pyrite significantly depressed lead-activated sphalerite flotation. Dissolved Fe and S released from pyrite had negligible effects on the floatability of lead-activated sphalerite. Contact angle on xanthate-treated galena with electrical connection to pyrite was lower than that without electrical connection, which indicates the desorption of xanthate and/or the formation of Pb(OH) Pyrite enhanced the dissolution of galena due to galvanic interactions and made the surface of galena less hydrophobic due to the formation of hydrophilic surface Pb(OH) The floatability of lead-activated sphalerite was suppressed directly via galvanic interaction that dissolved PbS-like phases with adsorbed xanthate and indirectly due to the formation of hydrophilic Pb(OH)  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
