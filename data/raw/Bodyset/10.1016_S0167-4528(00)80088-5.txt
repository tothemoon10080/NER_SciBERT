Gravel from the Sava-river bed contains coal particles, which remain in sand after classification. The coal content in class <4 mm ranges from about 0.5% to 2%, while in relatively close classes, such as −1 + 0.5 and − 2 + 1 mm it is even up to 6.23% and 6.37%, respectively. The possibility of separating coal particles from sand was tested on standard equipment used at gravity concentration, which are: the jig, the shaking table and the spiral. The tests were made with classes − 4 + 1 mm; − 4 + 0.5 mm; − 2 + 1 mm; − 1 mm; − 1 + 0.5 mm and − 0.5 mm, where the coal content in sand was 1%, 3% and 6%. The best results were reached with the jig, where sand recovery ranged from 73% to 80%, while the coal content in separated sand was 5 to 6 times lower than in the feed. The tests with spiral showed recovery even to 98% but the coal content was only 3 to 5 times lower than in the feed. The separation tests made on the concentration table showed relatively good results with recovery from 80% to 97%. On the ground of investigations carried out on adequate samples it is proposed that for the elimination of coal particles from Sava sand air jigs must be used, so that by sand quality the prescribed norms can be satisfied.
