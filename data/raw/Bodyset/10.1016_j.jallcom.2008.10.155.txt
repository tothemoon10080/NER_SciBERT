Multiferroic bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3, was prepared using conventional solid-state-reaction and mechanical activation assisted solid-state-reaction method. Room temperature X-ray diffraction patterns for these samples at various stages of processing were collected to analyze the phase evolution. The patterns showed that as compared to the conventionally processed samples, perovskite structured BiFeO3 phase formation temperature decreases by ∼100°C in the samples produced by mechanical activation assisted process. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements of both samples show a ferroelectric transition at ∼825°C, characteristic of ferroelectric BiFeO3. Ferroelectric measurements and the leakage measurements reveal that despite the presence of predominantly BiFeO3, mechanical activation assisted samples show higher leakage over the conventionally processed samples, attributed to the decreased grain size and higher defect concentration of the mechanical activation assisted samples. Mechanical activation assisted samples also show enhanced magnetization and a clear magnetic transition at ∼375°C.Multiferroics are the materials exhibiting spontaneous electric and magnetic ordering in the same phase and offer potential for the development of spintronic devices, dual storage devices and sensors Recently, epitaxial films Preparation of polycrystalline phase-pure BFO is reported to be difficult because of its narrow temperature range of phase stabilization.
