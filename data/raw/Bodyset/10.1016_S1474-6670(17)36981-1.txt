Although various material balance software are available to process data related to solids and liquids, few, if any, are available to process data from gas/solid reactors. This paper describes the basis for an algorithm to process such type of data. Particularly, a pyrometallurgical plant state observer and data reconciliation algorithm is developed in order to provide operators and supervisors with a more reliable and enriched information including a coherent estimation of the overall gas flow distribution which could not otherwise be available.
