Calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent heart valve disease in high-income countries ( The purpose and design of the PROGRESSA (Metabolic Determinants of the Progression of Aortic Stenosis) study were previously described ( The primary endpoint was the AS progression rate measured as the annualized increase in peak aortic jet velocity (V Among the 162 patients (mean age: 65 ± 13 years; 29% women), comorbidities, including hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and smoking, were similar across the tertiles of femoral neck BMD, defined by sex-specific thresholds (women: bottom tertile: ≤0.80 g/m During a median follow-up of 3.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.0 to 4.0 years), the median and mean ± SD annualized increase in V The main limitation of this study is the small number of patients with low BMD and with diagnosis of osteoporosis. In summary, this study suggests that osteoporosis may be associated with faster progression of AS. The vast majority of patients who presented osteoporosis were not treated with antiosteoporotic drugs. Whether the treatment of osteoporosis in patients with AS could be efficient to reduce AS progression needs to be further investigated. To this effect, an ongoing randomized clinical trial, SALTIRE II (Study Investigating the Effect of Drugs Used to Treat Osteoporosis on the Progression of Calcific Aortic Stenosis), is testing bisphosphonates and denosumab as novel treatments for AS.
