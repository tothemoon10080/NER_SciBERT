The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres have been prepared by thermal oxidation etching strategy, and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres can be obtained by means of controlling the thermal oxidation times of solid carbon spheres in air. The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres at the optimum thermal oxidation time of 1.5 h in air showed the highest specific surface and the highest total pore volume. Furthermore, the hollow carbon sphere-sulfur composite cathodes achieved high initial discharge capacity of 1423.9 mAh g−1, excellent discharge capacity and excellent rate performance.Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) are widely regarded as one of the most promising devices for next-generation energy storage systems. However, LSBs faces many difficulties, such as poor conductivity of sulfur, volume expansion from sulfur to Li Firstly, monodisperse phenol-formaldehyde resin spheres (PR) were synthesized by stÖber method according to previous reports As schematically illustrated in     In order to understand the electrochemical performance of the LSBs, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the MHCS-1.5/sulfur cathode was shown in The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (MHCS) have been prepared via thermal oxidation etching strategy, and the mesoporous hollow carbon spheres have excellent specific surface area and total pore volume. The mesoporous hollow carbon spheres can improve conductivity of sulfur cathodes and suppress the shuttle effect. The mesoporous hollow carbon sphere-sulfur cathodes show high initial discharge capacity, good cycle stability and excellent rate performance.
