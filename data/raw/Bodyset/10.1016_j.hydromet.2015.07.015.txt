To overcome the low recovery, generally obtained for the heavy and middle rare earth elements (HREE and MREE) by sodium double sulfate precipitation, the recovery of the MREE and HREE as phosphate salts was investigated. High recovery yields (≥95%) were obtained even for sulfate solutions containing low concentrations of REE and a high concentration of iron(II). The influence of many industry-relevant parameters (temperature, pH, stoichiometric excess of phosphate, aluminum contamination, residence time) is discussed in order to optimize the REE recovery and to minimize the precipitation of iron. The developed process was also validated in continuous operation at a pilot scale. Finally, the REE phosphate concentrate could be converted into REE hydroxides which allows its dissolution into diluted HCl. Taking into account the phosphate precipitation, the conversion into hydroxides and the dissolution in HCl(aq), high recovery yields were obtained for Y, Gd and La (68%, 77% and 86% respectively). The results show that it is possible to economically obtain purified REE solutions starting from industrial solutions which are usually discarded.Rare earth elements (REEs) namely, scandium, yttrium and lanthanides, play a critical role on the global economy due to the numerous applications where those elements are used. Rare earth-based materials are used in electronic industry, steel industry, household batteries, fluorescent lamps, permanent magnets, and lasers for surgical and nuclear technologies ( Even if an intensive effort is being made worldwide to recycle REE from waste electronic equipments, magnets or waste fluorescent lamps ( Since the early 2000s, the recovery of REE from a Gabonese ore, called Maboumine, has been studied by ERAMET. The Maboumine deposit not only accounts for one of the main sources of Nb for the future but also contains other valuable elements as given in In this paper, a brief review of REE recovery from leach liquors produced by acid or alkaline decomposition is presented. Experimental work was conducted on a process for the recovery of yttrium and lanthanides from sulfate solutions containing low concentrations of REE, a low content of aluminum and a high excess of iron as previously reported in a patent ( Monazites generally contain 35–71% of rare earth oxides (REO) whereas xenotime and bastnasite commonly contain 52–54% and 70–74% of REO, respectively ( acid decomposition of the natural minerals and dissolution of the REE in acidic media (generally H alkaline decomposition of the natural ores to produce a REE hydroxide concentrate that can then be dissolved selectively in acidic media (generally HCl For bastnasite ores [(La, Ce)CO Rare earth elements can also be recovered, as by-products, from the uranium or phosphoric acid productions ( The REE precipitation by the addition of oxalic acid is effective owing to the strong affinity of the oxalate ion for hard ions like REE Powder XRD spectra were collected using Cu K The concentrations of aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), neodymium (Nd), gadolinium (Gd), praseodymium (Pr) and yttrium (Y) were determined by ICP–OES using an iCAP 6000 series spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Other REEs were determined by ICP–MS using an Aurora M90 spectrometer (Bruker). Samples were diluted in 2% (v/v) HNO The pH measurements were performed with an 827 pH-lab (Metrohm) pH-meter and low alkaline error combined electrode (Unitrode, Metrohm). The pH-meter was calibrated with NIST standards at pH Sodium phosphate dodecahydrate (Sigma Aldrich, 96%), aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate (VWR, 97%), phosphoric acid solution (Sigma Aldrich, 85%), sulfuric acid solution (VWR, 96%), sodium hydroxide solution (VWR, 50%), nitric acid solution (VWR, 65%) and calcium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich, 96%) were used as received. The REE solution used in this study was provided by ERAMET Research (France) and comes from the Maboumine hydrometallurgical process ( The filtrate is used as REE stock solution and its composition is given in Precipitation experiments were carried out by adding a mixture of Na For precipitation experiments performed at different pH values, micro-quantities of 1.5 To study the influence of aluminum on the REE precipitation, the required amount of aluminum sulfate octadecahydrate was dissolved in the REE stock solution so that the aluminum concentration varied from 30 to 1000 The stoichiometric quantity (SQ) mentioned in this work is defined as follows: The yields of precipitation were calculated from the elemental analysis of the solution before and after precipitation. The present study investigated the precipitation of yttrium and lanthanides from low concentration sulfate solutions by the addition of sodium phosphate solution. Due to the strong affinity of Y The precipitation of REE was investigated at different temperatures between 40 It should be highlighted that the sodium concentration resulting from the addition of Na For all lanthanides, the precipitation yield increases slightly from 40 To improve the cost-effectiveness of the developed process, the quantity of phosphate vs. REE was studied at constant pH and temperature ( The precipitation yield of iron phosphate is rather low compared to the REE phosphates ( The precipitation of iron under the conditions given in Hence, a short residence combined with a low excess of phosphate ions reduces the precipitation of iron and, therefore, enhances the quality of the REE precipitate without impacting the recovery of the valuable elements. Another poisoning element that is often present in REE hydrometallurgical processes is aluminum. Compared to ferric ions, which can be easily reduced into ferrous ions, aluminum ion poses major difficulties due to its similarity with REE(III) ions. The aluminum concentration was varied from 30 Another relevant parameter that has to be studied while developing hydrometallurgical processes is the solution pH. Concerning the system investigated in this work, several proton-equilibria take place. Indeed, the REE  In order to validate the precipitation process developed at the laboratory scale, the recovery of REE from industrial sulfate solution ( A good REE recovery was obtained during the pilot campaign with an average precipitation yield higher than 95% for all the REEs initially present in the sulfate solution and about 6 The XRD analysis of the REE concentrate indicates that the solid is mainly amorphous ( As highlighted in The REE concentrate was treated with NaOH  Finally, dissolution tests of the REE hydroxide concentrate were conducted in dilute HCl as recently reported by The recovery of REE from an industrial solution containing 230 The financial support for this work from
