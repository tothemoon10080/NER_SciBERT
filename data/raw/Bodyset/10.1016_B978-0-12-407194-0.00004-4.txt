Some of these are given in The most widely used procedures for the extraction of lipids are those of Folch The combined lipids may be subjected to further purification by column chromatography on Sephadex G-25, which removes any carbohydrate or protein that may have coextracted with the lipid, Plant tissues, in contrast to animal or microbial tissues, tend to have much lower amounts of phospholipids in relation to neutral or nonpolar lipids. For this reason, it is usually advisable to do a preliminary fractionation to remove the bulk of the nonpolar lipids from the extract. A widely used procedure is column chromatography on silicic acid. Successive elution with chloroform, acetone, and then methanol separates the lipid extract into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids, respectively. Some of the PA and DPG, however, may be carried into the acetone fraction. Older methods that are now seldom used are acetone precipitation, Two-dimensional TLC has been the method of choice for the separation and quantitation of plant phospholipids since the early 1960s. The The reproducibility of the method was tested in a seven-laboratory collaborative study. The HPLC method, introduced in 1981, Direct quantitation of the phospholipids is possible if the UV detection is replaced by flame ionization (FID) Moreau Methods have been developed for the preparation of gram-scale quantities of PC, PE, and PI of high purity (> The normal-phase HPLC procedures described here serve to separate the phospholipids by class. Later we shall see that the phospholipids of each class can be further separated into their component molecular species by reversed-phase HPLC. This method, which is still in the developmental stage, provides an alternative to HPLC that has the advantage of much higher peak capacity resulting in improved resolution. It separates the phospholipids based on their partition coefficients between a mobile phase and a pseudostationary micellar phase. The mobile phase is usually 30% This method, adopted in 1988, is useful in that it quantitates phospholipids directly by their phosphorus content. A crude soybean extract was separated into 11 phospholipid classes (7 PLs and 4 LPLs) in a single 24-h run. For example, seven phospholipid classes and four lysophospholipid classes were identified in a crude soybean extract in a single 24-h run. Each class of phospholipid in a typical plant extract comprises long-chain fatty acids of variable chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation. The distribution of fatty acid residues within each class is readily determined by transesterification with methanol and analysis of the resulting mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by gas chromatography. The following procedure is typical: Morrison The FAME method has been applied to the majority of the phospholipids listed in  The C Each of the foregoing phospholipid classes comprises a range of individual compounds, the so-called molecular species, which contain fatty acid residues of variable chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation. In the molecular formula given at the beginning of this chapter, the nature of the “Z” group determines the class into which a particular phospholipid falls. In this section, we are concerned with the nature of the “R” groups, R Silver ion has a retarding effect on the TLC of unsaturated compounds owing to the formation of a reversible complex between the silver ion and the double bond. This effect has been used to advantage in the separation of intact PC, This procedure determines the pairings of the acyl groups in the phospholipids but not their relative positions. For this an additional step is needed, such as selective cleavage of the Reversed-phase HPLC offers a method for separating the phospholipids of each class (PC, PE, etc.) into its individual molecular species, often with baseline resolution, short columns, and isocratic solvents. In general, the retention time increases with increasing chain length and decreases with increasing unsaturation regardless of phospholipid class. Resolution is improved considerably if an ion-pairing reagent such as tetrabutylammonium phosphate is added to the mobile phase; this procedure is applicable to PC and PE, This method, introduced in 1982, The molecular species are identified in most cases by comparison with the retention times of standards or with the relative retention time factors published by Myher and Kuksis, Conventional electron impact (EI) ionization techniques are unsuitable for the present purpose, but the development of “soft” ionization modes such as field desorption (FD), fast atom bombardment (FAB), or chemical ionization (CI) has enabled MS techniques to be applied to intact phospholipids such as PC, PE, PG, or PI. FD-MS of commercial soybean PC or PE gives molecular species profiles that agree with those of the HPLC or GLC methods. The formation of [M FAB-MS in either the positive or negative mode gives the [M Isobutane CI-MS has been used to identify the molecular species of soybean PC, PE, and PI If the acyl group distributions at the The procedure is best illustrated by a concrete example ( The data in parentheses represent the corresponding values obtained experimentally by the GLC/TMS method. The terms The first lysophospholipid reported to occur in plants was lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), isolated from polished rice by Iwata in 1930. The compound, a strong hemolytic agent, formed colorless needles, mp 262-264 Physical properties have been reported for a few lysophospholipids derived from plant sources without regard to the presence therein of acyl groups of different chain lengths or degrees of unsaturation. Some of these are reported in The lysophospholipids are incompletely extracted by the solvents usually employed to extract phospholipids, such as chloroform/methanol, but are efficiently extracted by water-saturated The method of Colborne and Laidman The separation of wheat LPLs on a 7μ Lichrosorb Si-60 column, hexane/THF/2-propanol/water mobile phase, and ELS detection gives, in order of elution, NALPE This group comprises the phosphatidylcholines (PC) and the lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC).  1,2-Dipalmitoyl- DPPC [R.N. 63-89-8]: Plates, X-ray [CdCl 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- POPC [R.N.26853-31-6]: 1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl- PLPC [R.N. 17708-90-6; see also 6931-84-6]: Pale yellow oil. 1-Palmitoyl-2-linolenoyl- PLnPC [R.N. 35418-56-5 or 95268-94-3]: 1-Stearoyl-2-oleoyl- SOPC [R.N. 56421-10-4]: EI-MS (fig.), [CdCl 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl- SLPC [R.N. 27098-24-4]: Spectra: FD-MS, 1-Stearoyl-2-linolenoyl- SLnPC [R.N. 35418-57-6; see also 40811-59-4]: 1,2-Dioleoyl- DOPC [R.N. 4235-95-4; see also 10015-85-7]: Colorless waxlike substance, soluble in chloroform and ethanol, less soluble in acetone, insoluble in ether, water [CdCl 1-Oleoyl-2-linoleoyl- OLPC [R.N. 17041-44-0; see also 99166-28-6]: FD-MS, 1-Oleoyl-2-linolenoyl- OLnPC [R.N. 105017-24-1; see also 74936-57-5, 96497-78-8, 120502-93-4]: HPLC. 1,2-Dilinoleoyl- DLPC [R.N. 998-06-1; see also 6542-05-8, 81902-03-3]: Glass, 1-Linoleoyl-2-linolenoyl- LLnPC [R.N. 85046-19-1; see also 105120-83-0]: FD-MS, 1,2-Dilinolenoyl- DLnPC [R.N. 2701-19-1; see also 40811-59-4]: DSC.

HCl. Separation of the phosphoinositides has also been carried out by HPLC on an amino-NP silica column with a 0 → 0.8 A protocol for separating all known isomers of PIP and PIP That the PIP and PIP PIP appears to have the same molecular species distribution as PI. HPLC analysis of the PIP in maize coleoptile shows the principal species to be 16:0:18:2 (59.0%) together with smaller amounts of 16:0/18:1, 16:0/18:3, 18:0/18:2, 18:2/18:2, and traces of 18:1/18:2 species.  1,2-Dipalmitoyl- DPPI(3)P [R.N. 165689-81-6]: White solid, mp 108-110 NH 1,2-Dipalmitoyl- DPPI(4)P [R.N. 57606-15-2]: White solid.
