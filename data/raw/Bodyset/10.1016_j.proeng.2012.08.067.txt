It is imperative to explore a type of automatic long-term fixed-point displacement monitoring technology with low cost and high precision in the current monitoring system of dam and slope. The new system obtains information of slope stability through mutual transformation of photoelectric signals which are magnified by a telescope, and it is of strengths of accuracy, timeliness and low cost compared to conventional monitoring instruments, through remote wireless monitoring. In addition, it can also be used to measure the vibration parameters of slope during the blasting. According to the testing and field observations, it has been verified that the system monitored well, without site operations. Therefore, the system may be applied to automatic static and dynamic displacement monitoring for both long-term and short-term without wiring and operations.
