A xenotime flotation concentrate prepared from Sarabit El Khadem ferruginous sandstone of Southwestern Sinai (55.4% RE2O3 and 0.9% U3O8) is subjected to processing via alkali fusion using NaOH under different conditions. The obtained oxide cake of REEs and U was dissolved in sulfuric acid followed by separation of REEs as oxalates. Extraction of uranium from the REE-free sulfate solution was then studied using trioctylamine in kerosene. The relevant conditions of both the alkali fusion of the concentrate as well as those of uranium recovery through the tertiary octylamine have been optimized. Highly pure products of the REEs and U have been prepared and subjected to an ESEM qualitative analysis.Xenotime is a REE (rare earth elements) phosphate mineral and represents one of the three principal REE minerals together with monazite and bastnasite ( On the other hand, while bastnasite and monazite are abundantly available in nature in almost equal quantities, xenotime occurrence and availability is very small. Xenotime is actually a minor constituent of granite or gneiss rocks. Having undergone a weathering, transportation, and concentration process similar to that of monazite, xenotime co-occurs with it in placer deposits, but such deposits are relatively few. Usually the content of xenotime may range from 0.5 to about 5% of the monazite present ( Yttrium and the heavy rare earths are actually used in a growing number of applications and at the forefront of this wave of discovery are new technologies being developed for computer science uses, industrial engineering, renewable energy sciences and military applications. In electronics, the heavy rare earths are used in television screens, computers, cell phones, silicon chips, monitor displays, long-life rechargeable batteries and camera lenses besides high strength magnets, alloys, stress gauges, ceramic pigments, colorants in glassware, chemical oxidizing agent and as additives for strengthening other metals in addition to several medical applications. In technology, the heavy rare earths are used in the manufacture of lasers, optical glass, fiber optics, masers, radar detection devices, nuclear fuel rods and batteries together with high temperature superconductors and renewable energy devices ( According to The present work is concerned with the processing of the xenotime mineral concentrate that has been physically upgraded through froth flotation from its occurrences in Sarabit El Khadem area of Southwestern Sinai. While the purity of the latter attains up to 82.8% RE phosphates, it was also found to assay up to 0.9% U The working xenotime concentrate has indeed been prepared from the ferruginous sandstone of Sarabit El Khadem area of Southwestern Sinai through froth flotation as mentioned above. A representative sample has first been subjected to complete chemical analysis of its major oxides of SiO Several fusion experiments have been performed upon the working xenotime concentrate using NaOH. In these experiments, different amounts of NaOH were mixed with fixed weight sample portions (2 To study the recovery of both REEs and U, a 50 From the obtained sulfate leach liquor, the REEs were recovered by their direct precipitation as oxalates using oxalic acid while U was left behind in the solution. In order to obtain an adequately pure uranium concentrate, it was found necessary to study the U extraction from the REE-free sulfate leach liquor using the synergistic system of TOA/Octanol in kerosene as diluent to prepare different concentrations thereof. Octanol (C For the control analysis of all the performed experiments, both the REE and U have been analyzed in all the working stream solutions via the above mentioned procedures; viz spectrophotometric and titrimetric respectively. On the other hand, the two highly pure products of both the REEs and U were analyzed in the labs of the Chemical Warefare by ESEM qualitative analysis using EWAR Model FEI Inspect S (Hollanda-USA). As previously mentioned, the xenotime concentrate has completely been analyzed by the relevant methods for its major constituents. From the obtained results as shown in As previously mentioned, the alkali fusion using caustic soda has been used for the breakdown of the xenotime mineral and the relevant factors of this procedure have been optimized; namely the fusion time and temperature as well as the xenotime concentrate/alkali ratio. After water leaching of the melt, the dissolved P The effect of the fusion time upon the breakdown of the working xenotime concentrate was studied in the range of 1 to 4 A series of experiments has been performed to study the effect of temperatures upon the breakdown of the working xenotime concentrate in the range from 300 to 600 A set of experiments has been performed using different xenotime concentrate/NaOH ratios ranging from 1:3 up to 1:7 while the other fusion conditions were fixed at 500 From the above studied fusion factors of the working xenotime concentrate, it can be concluded that the optimum conditions for its complete breakdown involve: Fusion time: 3 Fusion temperature: 500 Xenotime concentrate/NaOH ratio: 1/7 A 50 The recovery of the REE from the prepared sulfate solution was carried out by their direct selective precipitation as oxalates leaving uranium in solution. This was performed by increasing the pH to 1.5 by ammonia followed by adding 30% oxalic acid till pH After separation of the rare earths oxalates, the sulfate solution left behind has first been evaporated till 1 The expected exchange reactions involving the working trioctylamine in sulfate media would result in the formation of the amine salts in which the anions are represented by both the sulfate and the bisulfate as shown in Eqs. The uranium anion exchange would thus be represented by the reactions shown in Eqs. The studied relevant factors affecting the uranium solvent extraction have included the solvent concentration, the contact time, the pH of the leach liquor and the aqueous/organic ratio (A/O). Effect of contact time To study the effect of contact time upon the extraction efficiency of U by TOA, four experiments have been performed at different contact time periods ranging from 5 to 20 Effect of pH of the prepared sulfate liquor To study the effect of pH of the prepared sulfate liquor upon U extraction efficiency, a set of experiments was performed at different pH values ranging from pH Effect of TOA concentration The effect of TOA concentration upon the U extraction efficiency was studied by contacting equal volumes of the sulfate leach liquor with TOA solvent of different concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 Construction of McCabe-Thiele extraction diagram From the prepared sulfate liquor, the effect of the aqueous/organic (v/v) phase ratio upon the extraction of U was investigated in the range of 3:1 down to 1:3 while fixing the other extraction factors at their determined optimum values (0.05 For uranium stripping, a loaded TOA/kerosene liquor assaying 3.77 Effect of alkali concentration A series of stripping experiments were carried out for U stripping using Na Effect of stripping time The effect of the stripping time upon U stripping efficiency was studied in the range from 5 to 15 Construction of McCabe-Thiele stripping diagram From the equilibrium stripping data under different A/O ratios and using 1.5 By neutralizing the uranium strip solution with 10% NaOH solution, it was completely precipitated at pH of about 11â€“12 as sodium diuranate (Na After calcination, a highly pure Na The fusion procedure using caustic soda was applied for treating the xenotime flotation concentrate of Southwestern Sinai followed by dissolution of the obtained oxide cake in sulfuric acid for REEs and uranium recovery. The optimum conditions of the alkali fusion for complete breakdown involved 1/7 concentrate/alkali ratio and a fusion temperature of 500  uranium oxide rare earths oxide environmental scanning electron microscopy trioctyl amine aqueous phase/organic phase
