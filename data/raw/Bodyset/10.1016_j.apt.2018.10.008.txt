In this paper, several well-known energy-size reduction relationships have been analyzed using Kapur’s similarity solution to the integro-differential equation of batch grinding. It has been shown that: (i) relationships proposed in terms of the energy actually utilized for breakage of particles, E, cannot be used to develop a practical energy-size reduction relationship as E is neither measurable nor it is found to be proportional to the measurable net energy input, En

                      in the case of ball mills, (iii) α values of 0, 0.5 and 1 cannot be associated with the laws of Kick, Bond and Rittinger, respectively. Based on the results of this analysis, the empirical scale-up models proposed by Bond and Morrell have been modified by replacing the exponents of 80% passing sizes by α. Further investigations have been recommended for resolution of large differences in the energy estimates obtained from these models for materials characterized by grindabilty values less than 1.0 and greater than 3.0 g/rev.constant in Eq. constant in Eq. constant in Eq. breakage distribution function, dimensionless constant in Eq. constant in Eqs. constants in Eqs. constants in Eqs. useful fraction of the specific net energy input, kWh/t defined in Eq. specific net energy input, kWh/t specific gross energy input, kWh/t function defined in Eq. cumulative mass fraction finer than size x at time t, dimensionless a non-negative, monotonically non-decreasing function in Eqs.

However, in practice only the gross energy input and the net energy input to the grinding mill can be measured, not the energy actually received by particles. Therefore, for verification of these three laws and other empirical energy-size reduction relationships In this paper, by combining the basic statements of Rittinger, Kick and Bond laws with Kapur’s similarity solution to the fundamental integro-differential equation of batch grinding Most of the energy-size reduction laws are based on a single characteristic size of the particle size distribution, such as the 80% passing size, 70% passing size, size modulus, and mean size The well-known integro-differential equation of batch grinding Eq. And Kapur showed that F(x,t), the mass fraction of particles finer than size x at time t, is also a similarity function of x/ He further showed that in the self-similar regime any particular passing size such as the 80% passing size, From Eqs. It has been observed that the net power drawn by the mill, By inverting Eq.  Before proceeding further, we would like to emphasize the importance of the energy-size relationship given by Eq. Thus, Eq. Starting with the basic statement of each law and making use of Eqs. Kick’s law states that the energy required for analogous changes in configuration in geometrically similar bodies of equal technological state varies as the volume or weights of these bodies Combining Eqs. Integrating Eq. Eqs. Substituting for Eq. It can be seen that for the case, The energy-size relationship proposed by Bond is Differentiating Eq. Combining Eqs. Integrating Eq. Eqs. Substituting for Eq. It can be seen that for the case, Rittinger’s law states that the energy input is proportional to the increase in the specific surface area Kapur Substitution of Eqs. Combining Eqs. Integrating Eq. Eqs. Substituting for Eq. It can be seen that for the non-zero and zero values of For the purpose of comparison of the three laws, first we evaluated the value of the ratio There are two types of energy-size reduction relationships. The first one is given by Eq. The second one is the general form of Eqs. In the literature, several other energy-size reduction relationships Charles The parameter β of this distribution is known as the distribution modulus. It should be noted that this parameter also appears in Eq. Another major drawback of the Charles relationship is that Eq. The postulate of particle size dependence of the parameter Morrell Voller Substitution of Kapur and Fuerstenau However, as Eq. For the purpose of mill scale-up design, presently no suitable model exists that is based on the population balance modelling approach, though considerable amount of basic work has been done The Bond model is purely an empirical model that has nothing to do with his original Third Theory. It is widely used for estimation of the mill motor power and the size of ball and rod mills for grinding of minerals, ores, cement and various other materials. Basic to this model is a parameter called Work index, It will be seen that in those cases where the values of the two sets of feed and product characteristic sizes, ( However, in those cases where the values of the two sets of characteristic sizes differ quite significantly The modified Morrell relationship can be written as The modified relationships for the Work indices It will be seen that the greater the difference in the value of α and the value of the exponent of 80% passing sizes in Eqs. From Eqs. The energy aspect of the size reduction operation has been dealt by a number of researchers in different ways and with different interpretations of the observed results. It is hoped that the results of the analysis, and arguments and explanations presented in It should be pointed out that while Bond’s relationship has been used extensively for the last six decades with a reasonable degree of success (±20% accuracy in most cases), Morrell’s relationship has not been adequately tested as it was proposed only about ten years back. Bond introduced a number of correction factors for different situations, which have been expanded and modified over the years  In general, the useful fraction of the gross energy input is not proportional to grinding time or the net energy input to the mill. Energy-size laws formulated in terms of the useful energy, therefore, cannot be verified unless this energy is directly measured. The exponent of the characteristic particle size, Contrary to the propositions of Hukki and Morrell, α is not a function of particle size in the case of ball mills. The particular α values of 0, 0.5 and 1 cannot be associated with the laws of Kick, Bond and Rittinger, respectively. Similarity in size spectra is a basic requirement to using any energy-size relationship that is based on a single characteristic size of the particle size distribution. Energy-size reduction relationships that are not based on self-similar size distributions are not sound relationships. Kapur’s energy-size reduction relationship, which has been found to hold good for a number of materials, is preferable to all empirical energy-size reduction relationships. The correct value of the exponent of the characteristic particle size in the scale-up models of Bond and Morrell is α, not 0.5 or 0.295. In view of the large differences in the specific energy estimates obtained from the Bond and Morrell relationships for materials characterized by grindability values less than 1.0 and greater than 3.0 g/rev, more work needs to be carried out for further modification of these relationships.
