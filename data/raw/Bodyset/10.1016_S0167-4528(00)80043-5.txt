The conditions for the synthesis of aragonite by the carbonation process were investigated, and these results were applied to the recycling of stainless refining dust in iron & steel plants. The formation of aragonite has no relation to the pH value, the mole ratio of MgCl2/Ca(OH)2 and Mg/Ca ion concentration in solution. The condition for the synthesis of aragonite requires that the concentration of Mg ions should be in an appropriate range (about 0.1รท0.26 mol/l) and the concentration of Ca ions below a certain range (less than about 0.16รท0.25 mol/l). Too many Ca ions or Mg ions favor the formation of calcite. Needle-like aragonite was successively synthesized using dusts and thus, effective recycling of dusts can be expected.
