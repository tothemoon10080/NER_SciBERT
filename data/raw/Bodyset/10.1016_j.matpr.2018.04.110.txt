It appears at present that there is little scope of doing innovative work in metal extraction and mineral beneficiation so most of the schools in west do not pay much attention to this classical area and we follow them. But there is a need to take a re-look at the classical areas because of changing scenario.
                  Over the years, we exploited high grade ores so what is left now is inferior grade ores but we require to produce quality metal economically from these. Secondly the slag generated during extraction and refining cannot be dumped in open space any more but has to be utilized and finally new type of wastes, electronic waste and batteries, are being generated at a very rapid rate. These wastes contain valuable as well toxic metals and they must be recovered. These are the new challenges. Two case studies of innovative approach in mineral beneficiation is presented.
