The corrosion inhibition efficiency of nicotiana tobacum (tobacco leaves) on the corrosion performance of zinc electrodeposited mild steel in 2 mole of HCl was studied using weight loss and gasometrical principle. The zinc electroplated mild steel coupon of 45mm by 20mm was immersed in HCl, in the presence of nicotiana tobacum of varying extract concentration of 25, 55, 75 and 100cm3 at 50oC elevated temperature in 56 minutes. Increasing rate of hydrogen gas during the chemical reaction was examined. Inhibition feasibility was explained by formation of insoluble complex absorbing adhesion on the surface metal. However, results obtained indicate that, percentage of extract concentration increase as the number of H2 
                     gas generated. Extract in acid medium retard corrosion degradation of the deposited mild steel and forcefully reduce corrosion rate. Micro structural examination through OPM, AFM and XRD revealed the morphology and evaluation performance of nicotiana tobacum.
