Low strain amplitude multi-axial compression (LSA-MAC) increases the work hardening capacity and uniform ductility of Aluminum after Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) through Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP). The mechanisms associated with this processing after ECAP are analyzed. LSA-MAC after 1 ECAP pass in Aluminum softens the material and is connected to the stabilization of the dislocation structures induced by ECAP into a configuration displaying an increased fraction of High Angle Grain Boundaries (HAGB). This occurs for a lower total imposed strain than that through a sequence of high strain ECAP passes or high strain amplitude multi-axial compression (HAS-MAC).The production of ultrafine-grained (UFG), high strength metals, through Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) usually employs Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP), High Pressure Torsion (HPT) or High Strain Amplitude (Δε) Multi-Axial Compression (HSA-MAC, Δε ≈ 0.5–0.8), As-cast 1070 Aluminum specimens underwent: 1 ECAP pass, annealing, another ECAP pass, LSA-MAC (12 compressions, Δε = 0.075) and simple compression. Detailed experimental procedures have been described elsewhere The average microhardness for the various conditions were:    SPD initially forms dislocation tangles and cell walls; that thin and evolve into more stable and lower energy dislocation configurations such as HAGBs The present results show that a straining of 1.15 by ECAP followed by LSA-MAC with a total strain of 0.9 (12 steps, Δε = 0.075), totaling a strain of 2.05, led to an HAGB fraction of 0.251, similarly to that for an ECAP strain of ∼3 in Al 99,99% SPD through ECAP and high strain amplitude multi-axial compression (HSA-MAC, Δε ≈ 0.5–0.8) stabilizes the dislocation structures after a large total strain and number of deformation steps. Low strain amplitude multi-axial compression (LSA-MAC, Δε = 0.075) after ECAP accelerates, in terms of a lowered total imposed strain, the stabilization of the dislocation structures into lower energy arrangements, leading to softening and increased work hardening capacity of the material for further monotonic straining.
