Objectives
                  Isolated anterior table frontal sinus fractures are commonly repaired through a coronal incision. Endoscopic repair of these injuries has recently been described. This study evaluates the endoscopic repair of isolated anterior table frontal sinus fractures with a Medpor implant.
               
                  Methods
                  Preinjury photographs of 10 cadaveric heads were obtained. Anterior table frontal sinus fractures were generated in all cadavers. The fractures were documented with postinjury computerized tomography (CT) scans. The fractures were then endoscopically repaired with a Medpor implant. Five cadavers received prefabricated implants generated from the post injury CT data. Five cadavers received a standard implant (0.85 mm sheet) contoured intraoperatively. The success of each repair was documented with post repair CT scans, photographs, and direct transcutaneous visualization.
               
                  Results
                  All 10 defects were successfully repaired within 1 to 2 mm. All implants were palpable, but no objective asymmetry could be appreciated photographically or on CT scan.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Anterior table frontal sinus fractures can be endoscopically repaired with either a standard 0.85 mm sheet or a prefabricated implant. Clinical application of this technique would be expected to reduce operating time, surgical morbidity, and cost.
