Pyrite cinder and high sulfur magnetite were used as raw materials to produce iron ore pellets. Good qualities of green balls and fired pellets were obtained from the feed comprising 50% pyrite cinder and 50% high sulfur magnetite concentrate at a small scale. Small-scale tests were proven by pilot-scale tests. The high grade fired pellets, assaying 63.22% Fe, were analyzed, and the compressive strength of fired pellets was over 2500 N/pellet. The fired pellets possessed excellent metallurgical performances, such as reducibility index higher than 67%, reduction swelling index lower than 15% and low temperature reduction degradation index (+ 3.15 mm) higher than 1%, which can be used as the burden for blast furnace.
