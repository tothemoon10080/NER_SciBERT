The objective of the paper is to propose a new estimation method of measurement error variances for data reconciliation. The method relies on a flow distribution model which assumes that, in steady-state, the behavior of the process can be described by a set of material split coefficients at each separation unit. It is compared to classical direct and indirect estimation methods using a flotation circuit simulator, a separation process widely used in the mineral processing industry. Results show that the suggested method leads to more accurate estimates when underlying assumptions are respected. It is also less restrictive compared to the indirect method in terms of the number of measured variables required to solve the estimation problem.
