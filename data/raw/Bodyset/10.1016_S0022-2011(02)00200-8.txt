Earthworms (Annelida: Oligochaeta) are generally among the largest contributors to soil fauna biomass and are important for their contributions to organic matter decomposition and comminution, nutrient mineralization, soil profile development, and soil macropore development (   The above experiment was repeated with intact earthworms only because of the very high mortality in sectioned earthworms. Earthworms were washed in 0.1% formalin and rinsed in distilled water prior to use. Both the treatments had three replications with 5 earthworms in each replicate. Experiment was terminated after 20 days. Data on mortality of earthworms were arcsine transformed and subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Statistica 5.5 software (Stat soft, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the data on mortality of earthworms over time and differences between treatments were determined using contrasts. Breakdown and one-way ANOVA was used for weight loss data and LSD was used to test the differences between treatments. All comparisons were considered significant at  Mortality was very high in case of sectioned earthworms irrespective of the treatments, yet no treatment effect was evident. In the second experiment also, there was no significant difference between earthworm mortality in the control and nematode treatments (data not shown). We did not observe any signs of nematode infection in the earthworms in the two experiments. Dissections of the dead earthworms revealed no These results show the safety of
