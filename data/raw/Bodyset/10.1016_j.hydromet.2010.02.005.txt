High purity nickel powder (99.5% Ni) was prepared by direct hydrogen reduction of commercial NiO powder in an acidic slurry in an autoclave with a yield of approximately 100% at 250°C, initial pH 5.4 and 300psi partial hydrogen pressure. It was found that the initial pH of the solution and the addition of NiSO4 play critical roles in the NiO/Ni powder conversion process. They provide an adequate acidic media and a source of SO4

                     − counter ions for dissolving NiO into Ni2+ ions, while the subsequent reduction of Ni2+ ions to metallic nickel proceeds.The nickel powders have attracted a great deal of attention over past decades due to their specific properties such as magnetism, thermal resistance and chemical activity; and have a wide range of applications including batteries, hard alloys, catalysts etc. ( The preparation of nickel powders from slurry compounds such as NiO, Ni(OH) It has been well known that a polyol process has successfully prepared metal powders from the corresponding metal oxides or hydroxides directly ( In this work, a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of preparing nickel powder by direct hydrogen reduction of analytical grade NiO slurry has been made and the influence of some key parameters on the conversion has been investigated. The reaction of metal oxide slurries to metal powders proceeds via a dissolution-crystallization process rather than a solid phase transformation ( Theoretically, this suggests that the NiO slurry–Ni powder conversion can be carried out by hydrogen reduction in acidic solution in the pH range of 4–6. Therefore, nickel powders should be synthesized from NiO by the following scheme: Dissolution of NiO into Ni  Reduction of Ni  Nucleation and growth;  Additionally, by looking in detail at the proposed conversion scheme, the dissolution reaction The hydrogen reduction experiments were carried out in an autoclave equipped with a 350 Once the reaction temperature reached 250 The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X-Ray Diffractometer MAX 2500 The effect of the initial pH on the conversion was investigated at three different values of pH The XRD patterns of the final products shown in The effect of NiSO The SO In order to verify this mechanism, the hydrothermal reactions were performed at different concentrations of NiSO  Accordingly, addition of NiSO The impact of SO  In order to preliminarily evaluate the scale-up ability of this process, a double amount (0.64 High purity nickel powder (99.5% Ni) was successfully prepared by direct hydrogen reduction of pure commercial NiO powder in acidic slurry in autoclave with a yield of ∼ This research was supported by the General Research Project of the Korea Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) funded by the
