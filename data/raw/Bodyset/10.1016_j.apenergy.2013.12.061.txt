In this study, the effect of the addition of LiNO3 and/or Ca(NO3)2 to the solar salt NaNO3/KNO3, which is used as a storage material in CSP plants, on the physicochemical properties thereof was studied.
                  Thermal analyses were performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), obtaining the phase transitions, melting points, heat capacities and thermal stability of the materials studied. In addition, viscosity measurements were carried out at different temperatures close to the melting point of the salt mixtures to determine their flowability.
                  The study of these low-melting-point mixtures was executed through the synergistic effect exerted by a 30% LiNO3
                     +60% KNO3
                     +10% Ca(NO3)2 mixture, and it was observed that the addition of LiNO3 increases the thermal stability of the tested salts, whereas the addition of Ca(NO3)2 reduces the melting points and improves the economic cost of these mixtures
                  These mixtures were designed such that the melting point of the molten nitrates would be reduced, allowing for the mixtures’ direct use as storage materials in parabolic-trough solar power plants, therefore replacing the synthetic oil currently used as a heat transfer fluid (HTF) and heat exchanger oil. The use of these mixtures is intended to reduce the economic costs and improve the thermal storage of current solar technology.The solar conditions in northern Chile, in particular the Atacama Desert, which presents an annual global radiation value of 2500 Overall, there are several factors that make concentrating solar power (CSP) technology an ideal resource for the mining sector, notably because of the location of mines in desert areas with low population levels and excellent solar resources. The proximity also favours the direct supply of electrical energy to mining operations. Another major advantage of thermal storage is the improvement in manageability it presents, that is, the ability to satisfy consumer demand according to the temporal profile thereof and even the ability for Chile to become a major exporter of thermal energy. Given the engineering designs that have been developed, there are diverse commercial solar plants worldwide with proven operations. Research and development in the solar energy sector is focussed on reducing the high cost of the operation and maintenance of these plants. One of the most important lines of research in this respect is the study, design and characterisation of salts that are used as energy storage fluids. The fluid that is currently used to store energy in solar plants is a binary mixture of 60% NaNO However, it is necessary to improve this fluid to construct less expensive and more profitable thermosolar plants In the 1990s, patents began emerging for new additives and mixtures for solar concentration plants. Michel Kniep et al. developed several patents In 2000, Lotz Of all of the additives and formulated mixtures, the ones that present the greatest potential are those that are composed of Ca(NO Ca(NO In addition to reducing costs, this substitution would increase the maximum working temperatures of this type of plant, given that the maximum working temperature is currently limited by the thermal stability of the synthetic oils that are employed, which does not exceed 400 Bradshaw and Meeker The The most widely accepted diagram of the ternary phases was developed by Bergman et al. The diagram shown in Another one of the most studied additives for energy storage is lithium nitrate. Bradshaw and Siegel Thus, cost is one of the main reasons why salts without lithium have not been used in any commercial application. In the current study, the viability of using these mixtures in predetermined proportions was investigated. The addition of lithium is assumed to improve the performance of molten salts, which, in the short term, can be profitable despite the higher cost of operating plants with these fluids. Cordaro The first study documenting the eutectic point of this mixture dates back to 1964 The exact eutectic point has not yet been determined because the measurement is influenced by the quality of the salt used and the types of impurities in it. In a recent study, Wang et al. Bradshaw and Meeker The saline nitrates that were used in the research were NaNO We also studied the viscosity of the designed ternary salts, taking measurements at 150, 175, 200 and 300 The composition of the mixture chosen for the study of the addition of calcium to mixtures of potassium and sodium nitrates was named Hitec XL, and it has a composition of 48% Ca(NO Calcium nitrate is one of the most promising additives for use in formulations of molten nitrates because it considerably reduces the melting point and the cost of the salt, as it is the component with the lowest market price. The results of the thermal analysis of the ternary mixture are shown in This figure illustrates the transitions and transformations that occur in the ternary calcium salt, in which we can observe a first transition that is due to water loss (45.90 The other signals that are observed represent the loss of intermolecular water that is present in the salts, at 221.44 It is important to note that the water content of calcium nitrate also contributes to its melting, given that the registered melting point for this pure nitrate (without water) is 561 Brockner and Gjikaj Paulik et al. The results of the thermogravimetric study shown in In this work, we defined the maximum stability temperature as the temperature at which a sample, after stabilising with the elimination of its water content, lost 3 Another feature of these salts that is of major commercial interest is their heat capacity, which should be maximised to store the greatest possible amount of energy in the lowest possible volume. To determine the heat capacity, a modulated analysis highly sensitive to the variations that could be produced in the assays was conducted. Based on this consideration and to obtain a representative value, the assay was repeated 10 times, yielding the final mean value shown in The heat capacity that was obtained for this salt is 1.272 The viscosity of the liquid mixture is another parameter of major commercial interest because the salt must flow properly through the pipes of a heliostat field at the lowest possible temperature. The results are shown in According to the viscosity curves in The eutectic compositions of the ternary mixtures of lithium, sodium and potassium nitrates are not precisely known, but they fall within the following ranges: 12–30% LiNO 17–33% NaNO 40–70% KNO Based on the ranges reported in the literature The results of the thermal analysis of the ternary lithium mixture with a composition of 20% LiNO The crucibles that were used for these assays were hermetically sealed; consequently, the water vapour that was liberated was retained in the upper part of the crucibles. When the sample was cooled, this vapour rose along the sides of the crucible, which masked the end product of the crystallisation of the mixture, and a single transition to a temperature below the melting point during the heating stage (super-cooling) was observed. Consequently, for all of the experiments that were conducted in this study, the values that were obtained in the heating stages were used. The thermal decomposition curve ( This increase in weight, which was responsible for the increase in the thermal stability of the salts containing LiNO The initial weight loss corresponds to the loss of water by the mixture because water is more soluble in lithium nitrate than in sodium or potassium nitrate The results of the study of the heat capacity that was conducted through modulated thermal analysis of the salt are shown in The value that was obtained for the heat capacity of the salt at 390 The viscosity levels that were obtained in this case for the liquid mixture are shown in The results show a decrease in viscosity over time, except for the results obtained at 300 The most representative values at the maximum shear rate (100 The addition of Ca(NO To obtain a synergetic effect between the two additives, a ternary mixture based on the Ca(NO Regarding the choice of the third component of the mixture, there are a few references to this composition of ternary mixtures in the literature. In fact, the mixture has only been assessed by Sandia National Laboratories in the USA, where the authors Cordaro and Bradshaw proposed NaNO This same laboratory reported a study of the viscosity of nitrate salts in which it was determined that the addition of sodium nitrate increased the viscosity and that this characteristic is a critical parameter in new formulations of molten nitrates. In the present study, we selected potassium nitrate as the third component of the mixture The results of the thermal analysis that was conducted with the ternary 10% Ca(NO Of the two signals that were obtained in the heating curve, it would be complicated to predict Therefore, a cyclic thermal curve was generated, which consisted in first heating to 200 The cyclical thermal stability results are presented in In the first cycle, the aforementioned signals were obtained at 132 and 181 The second signal at 181 The thermal stability curve for the ternary salt 30% LiNO The obtained curve presents two small mass gains at 346 and 450 In this case, by increasing the lithium content to 30%, the formation of these oxides was favoured, and signals that were indicative of the formation of these individual oxides were obtained. The heat capacity that was obtained for the studied mixture of lithium and calcium discussed in this section is shown in The representative value that was obtained for this mixture is 1.395 The viscosity levels that were obtained for this mixture are presented in The values that were obtained at the maximum shear rate (100 The viscosity values indicate that this last mixture presented better results than the mixtures with the individual addition of Ca(NO The results from the physicochemical study of these new fluids are shown in The results from the thermal study of the ternary 48% Ca(NO The thermal study that was conducted using the ternary 20% LiNO This last parameter represents the greatest advantage observed for the ternary lithium salt, given that it considerably increases the previously known maximum value in new formulations of the ternary mixtures that are reported in the literature. This increase in thermal stability was assigned to the formulation of Li The thermal study of the ternary 30% LiNO The addition of Ca(NO The thermal stability of the salts was determined to be similar to that of the solar salts that are currently used for formulations with LiNO The individual addition of Ca(NO The newly designed salts did not present problems in our study of viscosity, given that they flowed properly over the range of temperatures studied. Overall, it is important to note that the viscosity values that were obtained for the 30% LiNO
