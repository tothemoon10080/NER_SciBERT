The effects of adding combinations of rosemary (R: 1500, 2000, 2500 ppm) and green tea (G: 100, 200, 300 ppm) extracts in combination with synthetic antioxidants on the physiochemical, microbial, and sensory characteristics of fresh pork sausage were evaluated. R and G improved (P < .05) oxidative stability as evidenced by lower TBARS. R2500 and G300 had fewer PPC than the control at d 7, 14, and 21 of storage. Consumer acceptability scores were greater (P < .05) in sausages with R and G when compared to the control, and the majority of the R and G treatments were liked by 98% of the respondents. Treatment combinations of at least R2000 and G200 were described by positive drivers of liking such as spice-complex, ginger, nutmeg, rosemary flavors and aromas and lower scores for descriptors such as rancid, fruity, and off-flavor/odor. This research demonstrates that rosemary and green tea extracts improved the keeping quality of fresh pork sausage under simulated retail display.Ground meat products, such as fresh pork sausage, are susceptible to oxidative changes because the comminution process disrupts the muscle membrane system and promotes the autoxidation process by exposing unsaturated fats and proteins to molecular oxygen, oxidative enzymes, heme compounds, and metal prooxidants ( One of the major strategies employed by manufacturers to reduce oxidation and prevent microbial growth is the use of synthetic food additives with antioxidative and antimicrobial properties including butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), tertiary-butylhydroxyquinone (TBHQ), and propyl gallate (PG) ( Rosemary ( The antioxidant activity of green tea ( Commercial rosemary- ( Coarsely ground whole-hog pre-rigor meat (30–45 min postmortem, containing 1.5% salt to delay rigor onset) was made into sausage within 7 d of slaughter with a target of 27.5 ± 1% fat and 55% moisture. Meat temperature was 1 ± 1°C (Model 00645 W2; Acu-Rite, Schaumburg, IL) upon arrival and was stored in a walk-in cooler (3 ± 1 °C) for 24 h to facilitate blending. The addition of synthetic antioxidants in all treatments included a proprietary combination of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and propyl gallate (PG) at approximately 0.02% based on fat composition, which is within the legal limits described by USDA (9 C.F.R. §319.141, 9 C.F.R. §424.21) (United States Code of Federal Regulations, 2015). Ten 36.3-kg batches of fresh pork sausage were formulated and randomly assigned to contain one of the following treatment combinations: Control (synthetic antioxidants only); 1500 ppm rosemary (R) + 100 ppm green tea (G), 1500R + 100G; 1500 ppm R + 200 ppm G (1500R + 200G); 1500R + 300G; 2000R + 100G; 2000R + 200G; 2000R + 300G; 2500R + 100G; 2500R + 200G; 2500R + 300G. A total of 30 (10 treatments × 3 replications) 36.3-kg batches of fresh pork sausage were manufactured in the entire study. A proprietary combination of a spice blend, corn syrup solids, chilled water and synthetic antioxidants were added with each treatment combination to a batch of prerigor meat and blended for 3 min in a commercial paddle mixer (Model 150, Butcher Boy Limited, Ayshire, Scotland, UK). The natural plant extracts were added dry and dispersed in the spice blend prior to addition to the meat block. The blended meat was stored in a walk-in cooler (1 ± 1°C) for 48 h prior to grinding (Model 80,055 Mixer-Grinder, Hollymatic Co., Countryside, IL) through a 4-mm grinder plate. Aliquots of ground meat were collected and analyzed for fat, moisture, and protein contents (Method 2007.04; AOAC, 2007) using a FOSS FoodScan™ Meat Analyser Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectrophotometer (Model 78810; Foss Co., Hillerød, Denmark) prior to stuffing. Fat, protein, and moisture content ranged from 26.9 to 28.1%, 13.3 to 13.9%, and 52.3 to 53.4%, respectively. After grinding, the meat was vacuum stuffed (Model RS1040C; Risco Vacuum Stuffer, Thiene, Italy) into natural hog casings (Model 10,003, 32/35 mm; Wolfson Casing Corporation, Mount Vernon, NY, USA). Natural casings were tenderized (proprietary procedure), washed with water to eliminate salt, acid-treated and kept in warm water (40 ± 1°C) prior to use. The microbial counts of the untreated and treated casings were enumerated using 3 M™ Petrifilm™ Aerobic Count Plates (3 M™ Global Headquarters, St. Paul, MN, USA). Untreated casings contained 3.3 to 4.1 log cfu/g and treated casings contained between 1.4 and 2.6 log cfu/g. Fresh pork sausages were hand-linked to a 12.7 ± 1-cm length with a 34 ± 1-mm diameter. Fresh pork sausages (5 links per tray) were packaged in polystyrene trays (20S Yellow Tray; Cascades Plastics Inc., Warrenton, MO, USA), overwrapped with PVC stretch film (O After 3 mo of frozen storage (−20 °C), fresh pork sausages (16–20 trays per treatment) were randomly arranged at 3 ± 1 °C in a walk-in cooler (Model TK-3476-WF-L; K Thermo-Kool, Mid -South Industries Inc., Laurel, MS, USA) where all treatments were exposed to continuous fluorescent lighting (Cool White 34 W; Sylvania Supersaver Ecologic, Danvers, MA, USA) for 21 d. The light exposure level was positioned so that it provided approximately 800 lx at the package surface to simulate retail conditions in a multideck open display cabinet. Five packages from each treatment were randomly chosen after 0, 7, 14, and 21 d of retail display and subjected to instrumental color, lipid oxidation, and sensory descriptive analysis. Consumer acceptability was determined after 8 d of retail display. Samples for psychrotrophic plate counts (PPC), pH, and proximate analysis were vacuum packaged in 3-mil standard barrier vacuum pouches (Prime Source® 75001826, 0.75 gauge nylon/2.25 gauge polyethylene, OTR = 0.6 cm Only the treatment combinations which were selected for consumer acceptability were evaluated for pH, proximate analysis, and psychotrophic plate counts as it was not feasible to analyze all treatments due to time constraints. Instrumental color measurements were obtained for Lipid oxidation was evaluated by the determination of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) according to the procedure of A 10-g sample of meat was homogenized with 100 ml of distilled water for 30 s using a Model 700S Waring The fat, moisture, and protein contents of fresh pork sausage were determined according to AOAC Official Method 2007.04 (AOAC, 2007) using a FOSS FoodScan™ Meat Analyser Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectrophotometer (Model 78,810; Foss Co., Hillerød, Denmark). Psychrotrophic plate counts (PPC) were conducted on fresh pork sausages that were stored for 0, 7, 14, and 21 d under simulated retail display. Two links were aseptically removed from the packaged tray, cut into small pieces, weighed in 25-g portions and placed in a sterile sample bag (52-oz. Whirl-Pak® Bags; 7″ × 11″, Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI, USA) with 225 ml of 0.1% sterilized peptone solution (Difco Bacto-Peptone, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). This was followed by homogenization for 1 min in a Stomacher® Laboratory Blender (Model 400; A. J. Seward and Co. Ltd., London, England). Duplicate plates were prepared from each dilution by plating on 3 M™ Petrifilm™ Aerobic Count Plates (3 M™ Global Headquarters, St. Paul, MN, USA) which were incubated for 72 h at 20 °C. The sensory evaluation panels were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB# 09-084). Fresh pork sausages were cooked in a covered nonstick pan (Farberware® 10.5 in Covered Fry Pan; Farberware Licensing Company LLC, Needham, MA, USA) over medium-high heat (Viking Professional 60″ Custom Sealed Burner Range; Viking Range Corporation, Greenwood, MS, USA) to an internal temperature of 75 ± 2 °C. The links were placed with 227 ml of water in the covered pan for 5 min. The links were then turned over and cooked covered for another 5 min. The cover was removed after 10 min, and the sausages were turned over every 2 min until the desired internal temperature (75 ± 2 °C) (Model 00645 W2; Acu-Rite Digital Thermometer, Schaumburg, IL) was achieved. After resting the samples for 15 min, they were sliced into 1.8-cm thick pieces and kept warm (60–70 °C) in 7.6 L chafer dishes (Model ROCK-7, Rockwell Chafer Dish; Admiral Craft Equipment Corp., Hicksville, NY, USA) until sensory analyses were conducted. Descriptive analysis was conducted by a 10-member descriptive panel, with >100 h of experience pertaining to the evaluation of meat products ( Ten treatments were evaluated after 0, 7, 14, and 21 d of retail display. At the risk of panelist fatigue, 2 sessions were conducted at each sampling day which totaled 24 panels. Sausage samples were served in 2-oz. plastic containers with lids (Sweetheart Cup Co., Owing Mills, MD) and were coded with three-digit random numbers. Each panelist received 2 pieces (first piece was used to evaluate aroma and basic tastes and the next piece was used for flavor and textural attributes) of each treatment for every session. A factorial rotation was applied for the order of presentation of the samples to consider the effect of rank. Panelists were provided with water (Natural Spring Water, Crystal® Springs, Atlanta, GA, USA), unsalted crackers (Premium Nabisco, East Hanover, NJ, USA), apple juice (Lucky Leaf Apple Juice, Knouse Foods Co-op Inc., Peach Glen, PA, USA) and expectorant cups to remove residual flavors between sample evaluations. Sausages were evaluated daily following 14 d of retail display by three members of the trained panel to determine product shelf-life. Shelf-life was defined as when the product was deemed unacceptable compared with the gold standard due to off-flavors and/or texture. Three consumer-based sensory panels ( A randomized complete block design with 3 replications and a factorial arrangement was utilized to determine if differences existed ( The addition of rosemary and green tea extracts reduced lipid oxidation ( The partitioning and localization of exogenously added antioxidants within muscle foods is critical to their activity and efficacy ( To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the synergistic antioxidative effect of using rosemary and green tea extracts in pork sausage.  The A number of studies have reported that the addition of these natural plant extracts did not prevent the discoloration of meat products. For instance, Initial psychrotrophic bacterial counts (PPC) ranged from 2.9 to 3.9 log However, increased PPC could have been due to the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which indicates that the sausages may not be spoiled when PPC reaches 7 log Similarly, rosemary extract (1000 ppm) together with ascorbic acid exhibited lower aerobic psychrotrophic counts and extended the microbiological shelf-life of fresh pork sausages by at least 4 d ( No differences among treatments existed ( The intensities of “spice complex”, “ginger”, “nutmeg”, “rosemary” aromas, “flavor intensity”, “spice complex”, “ginger”, “nutmeg” flavors and “juicy” texture decreased ( On d 14, R1500 + G200, R2500 + G100, and R2500 + G200 were differentiated from other treatments due to their stronger “savory”, “browned”, “salty”, “spice complex”, and “ginger” flavor attributes which were largely correlated with the positive PC1 dimension (48% of the variation). Results indicated that the inclusion of higher concentrations of rosemary extract in the manufacture of fresh pork sausage is a key factor in differentiating the products based on preventing the development of rancidity associated notes. These findings were consistent with the results of lipid oxidation following 14 d of storage where the samples with the lower TBARS values compared with the control sausages included higher concentrations of the rosemary extract ( These results were in agreement with the findings of All fresh pork sausage treatment combinations had flavor, aroma, and texture shelf-lives of at least 15 d of storage compared with the control whose shelf-life was limited to <14 d (between 8 and 13 d, These results indicate that the addition of natural plant extracts could be helpful for improving the sensory qualities of the sausages. In addition, the extracts did not impart any deleterious flavors or aromas characteristic of rosemary or green tea such as astringent or bitter tastes, especially when incorporated at high concentrations in food products and are typically one of the reasons for consumer rejection. Overall, consumers ( The addition of the natural plant extracts to fresh pork sausage effectively suppressed lipid oxidation and slowed psychrotrophic bacterial growth when compared to the control samples. Combinations of rosemary and green tea extracts delayed discoloration. However, it was ineffective at inhibiting the loss of red color of sausage during extended storage. The results also indicated that the addition of rosemary and green tea extracts improved the keeping quality of fresh pork sausage under simulated retail display, and enhanced the sensory properties, which demonstrates the potential for utilization of these natural plant extracts in combination with synthetic antioxidants in fresh, comminuted meat products.
