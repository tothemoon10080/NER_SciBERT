This chapter reviews the solvent extraction transfer method of copper from leach solution to electrolyte. Solvent extraction transfers dissolved copper (Cu) from low Cu++, impure pregnant leach solutions to high-Cu++, pure electrowinning electrolytes. It is a crucial step in producing high purity electrowon copper from leached ores. The process consists of three steps: (1) extracting Cu from aqueous pregnant leach solution into an organic extractant, (2) separating the aqueous and organic phases by gravity, and (3) stripping Cu from the organic extractant into high-sulfuric acid electrowinning electrolyte. It is a continuous process, done in large mixer-settlers. Loading of Cu into the organic extractant is favored by the low acid concentration of the pregnant leach solution. Stripping of Cu from the organic extractant is favored by the high acid concentration of the electrolyte. The organic extractants used in the copper industry are aldoximes and ketoximes, which are mixed to give optimum extraction, strip, and phase separation properties. The problems, chemistry, and circuit design of this method are also discussed.
