The influence of mineralogy on microwave assisted grinding is elucidated. Detailed mineralogical analysis of various commercially exploited ores was carried out and the textural relationships between the individual mineral phases established. Microwave heating profiles were determined for each constituent mineral. Each ore was then subjected to microwave radiation for varying time periods, and change in work index with microwave exposure time quantified. It is suggested that increases in grindability of ores after microwave treatment are related to the specific mineral species present, particle size of the specific mineral and also the degree of dissemination. Conclusions are made regarding the economic implementation of this technology.
