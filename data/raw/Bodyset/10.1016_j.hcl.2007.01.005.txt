In this article we describe the fundamental concepts that were established by Essex-Lopresti over 50 years ago and explore the current concepts in anatomy, biomechanics, diagnosis, and treatment for longitudinal radioulnar dissociation. Moreover, we present encouraging results for treating chronic injuries to the IOM achieved by bone-ligament-bone (BLB) reconstruction using a patellar tendon graft, giving hope for this seemingly unforgiving injury. A treatment algorithm is also provided to aid in the management of acute and chronic longitudinal radioulnar dissociation.
