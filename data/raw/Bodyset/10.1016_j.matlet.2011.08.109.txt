An Al-doped SiAlOC polymer was derived from polymethyl(phenyl)siloxane resin and aluminum tri-sec-butoxide through sol–gel preparation. After dried, this polymer was further annealed at 400, 600, 800 and 1000°C in inert atmosphere to follow its structural evolution. These pyrolyzates obtained at various temperatures were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), elemental analysis (EA), 29Si and 27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR). It can be found that the conversion of the polymer into an inorganic network is achieved at 1000°C. There are at least seven different Si and two different Al units in SiAlOC polymer. In the mineralization process from polymer to glass, two different Si units remained at the inorganic network and the transition from AlO6 to AlO4 occurred.Silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) glasses are commonly produced through pyrolysis of polysiloxane or sol–gel-derived preceramic networks At high temperatures SiOC glasses undergo a redistribution of Si The final structure of the PDCs is formed step by step during polymer pyrolysis, through exchange and radical reactions, with evolution of low molecular weight species In this article, an Al-doped SiAlOC polymer was synthesized, and its structure characterizations, from polymer to inorganic network, were reported. Commercially available polymethyl(phenyl)siloxane resin (Dow Corning 249 flake resin) and aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (commercial al-alkoxide, general formula: (C Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA449C, NETZSCH) was employed for the measurement of weight change as the sample was heated at 10 The thermal behavior of SiAlOC gel was examined by TGA ( Crack-free SiAlOC specimens ( The The An Al-doped SiAlOC polymer was synthesized through sol–gel process, and its structural evolutions, from polymer to glass, were investigated. SiAlOC polymer mainly consists of seven different Si and two different Al units. On increasing the pyrolysis temperature, condensation reactions of Si This study was supported by
