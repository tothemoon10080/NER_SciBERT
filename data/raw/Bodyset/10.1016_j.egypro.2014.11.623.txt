This work investigated the performance of oil shale fly ashes (OSFA) as feedstock for CO2 mineral carbonation using an ammonium salts based pH swing process. A CO2 uptake of 156kg CO2/t ash was obtained for the OSFA from cyclones. This CO2 uptake was similar to that previously obtained using a direct mineral carbonation process with less favorable process scale up conditions. Among pulverised fuel ashes, OSFA samples collected from the electrostatic precipitation tend to present lower CO2 uptake compared to the OSFA sample obtained from the cyclones. OSFA from circulating fluidised beds were found to be less attractive for CO2 sequestration process with ammonium salts.
