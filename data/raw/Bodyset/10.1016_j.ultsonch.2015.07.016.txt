To clarify the role of solubilized organics derived from drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS) in the elimination of natural organic matter (NOM) in the DWTS recycling process, a probe sonoreactor at a frequency of 25kHz was used to solubilize the organics at varied specific energies. The coagulation behavior related to NOM removal in recycling the sonicated DWTS with and without solubilized organics was evaluated, and the effect on organic fractionations in coagulated water was determined. The study results could provide useful implications in designing DWTS recycling processes that avoid the enrichment of organic matter. Our results indicate that DWTS was disrupted through a low release of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and proteins, which could deteriorate the coagulated water quality under the specific energy of 37.87–1212.1kWh/kgTS. The optimal coagulation behavior for NOM removal was achieved by recycling the sonicated DWTS without solubilized organics at 151.5kWh/kgTS specific energy. Recycling the sonicated DWTS could increase the enrichment potential of weakly hydrophobic acid, hydrophilic matter, and <3kDa fractions; the enrichment risks could be reduced by discharging the solubilized organics. Fluorescent characteristic analysis indicated that when recycling the sonicated DWTS without solubilized organics, the removal of humic-like substances was limited, whereas removal of protein-like substances was enhanced, lowering the enrichment potential of protein-like substances.Drinking water treatment sludge (DWTS), the byproducts generated at water treatment plants that is primarily composed of amorphous Fe/Al hydroxides, is generally produced during flocculation–sedimentation or flotation processes because Fe/Al-based coagulants are usually used. DWTS and solids within filter backwash water (FBWW) are the major components of water treatment residual. Okuda et al. Several approaches to sewage sludge solubilization have been investigated, including thermal, chemical, acoustic-mechanical disintegration, and a combination of chemical and acoustic-mechanical methods In previous studies On the other hand, results of our previous investigation Currently, little research exits on the NOM removal characteristics of the DWTS recycling process, and the effects on organic fractionations in coagulated water also need to be investigated further. In this study, to clarify the role of solubilized organics in the elimination of NOM in the DWTS recycling process, a probe sonoreactor at a frequency of 25 The raw DWTS sample used in the experiments was collected from a water treatment plant (Beijing, China) that handles 1,500,000 Raw water was collected from the same water treatment plant as the raw DWTS samples. The main physicochemical characteristics of the raw water were as follows (seen in A probe-type sonoreactor (XH-2008DE, Xianghu Ultrasonic Instrument Co., Beijing, China) operating at a fixed frequency of 25 Coagulation experiments were performed in a six-paddle stirrer with impellers equipped with 50 Another series of jar tests was conducted to investigate the impact of solubilized organics. When recycling sonicated DWTS without solubilized organics, the raw DWTS was first exposed to a probe-type sonoreactor and the sonicated DWTS was collected at a predetermined condition and set aside for a 24 MW distribution of the NOM in the coagulated water from the recycling process was conducted using a dead-end batch ultrafiltration unit with a 300 Resins were cleaned and conditioned as described by Leenheer The fluorescence characteristics of solubilized organics derived from DWTS (under optimal specific energy), and that of the NOM in the coagulated water of the DWTS recycling process, were measured using 3D-EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. A 1-cm quartz cuvette with four optical windows was used for the analysis using a spectrofluorometer (F-4500, Hitachi, Japan). Emission scans were performed from 220 to 550 All analysis were performed using chemicals of analytical grade. pH was determined by a Thermo pH meter (Shanghai, China), which was calibrated daily using a pH buffer solution. Turbidity was monitored with a 2100N Turbidimeter (Hach, USA). TS, VS, TCOD, and SCOD were determined according to standard methods  From the preliminary jar tests, the optimum amount of FeCl  Meanwhile, the UV Through mass balance calculations of SCOD in the supernatant of the DWTS sample, it was deduced that recycling 6% of raw DWTS or sonicated DWTS treated at optimal ultrasound conditions resulted in a minimum of 0.922 In addition, the pH of coagulated water was always lower in scenarios without solubilized organics than in scenarios containing solubilized organics. Although the DWTS had a strong acid and alkalinity buffering capacity and the ultrasound had a slight effect on the sonicated DWTS In order to further reduce the energy consumption while maintaining a high NOM removal efficiency, we investigated the effects of an ultra-sonication time of less than 20 The release of SCOD and proteins in the supernatant of sonicated DWTS is illustrated in It can thus be concluded that DWTS was affected by the relatively low release of SCOD and proteins, which could deteriorate coagulated water quality at the specific energy input of 37.87–1212.1 NOM can be chemically fractionated into hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity. The hydrophobic portion is rich in aromatic carbon, having phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds, while hydrophilic NOM contains a higher proportion of aliphatic carbon and nitrogenous compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, sugars, and amino acids As shown in After ultrasound treatment at specific energy of 151.5 In order to study which organic fractionation has the greatest enrichment potential, the DOC percentage of a constant fraction in treated water minus the percentage of the same fraction in a control test, defined as ΔDOC%, was investigated. A larger positive ΔDOC% implied a greater enrichment potential, and a larger negative ΔDOC% implied a further removal (see As seen in Additionally, as indicated in In general, the main organic fractionations in recycled DWTS were WHoA and HiM, with the MW distribution of >100 There are five commonly referred to key fluorescence peaks, fluorophores A, C, T1, T2, and B, found in water samples The fluorescence spectra of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the supernatant of raw DWTS and sonicated DWTS with a specific energy of 151.5 The fluorescence EEM spectra in the DOM of coagulated water samples from the recycling process are illustrated in The operating cost of treatment is the primary selection criteria when determining economic viability of water treatment techniques. Taking lead from this concept, the ultrasound pretreatment cost had been calculated for the experimental UV The most cost effective ultrasonic parameters and their cost figures were put in bold and italic font to differentiate them from the other parameters. It should be noted here that the cost provided here only concerns the treatment cost and can constructively be used in combination with the analysis of the capital and maintenance cost to reach a rational decision with regards to the application of ultrasonic DWTS pretreatment in water treatment practices. The physical application of recycled DWTS is restricted due to possible negative effects of complex components within the recycled DWTS. In order to avoid the organic enrichment of recycle design, in this study, we firstly used ultrasound to solubilize the organics derived from DWTS, and then elucidated their impacts on the NOM removal and enrichment characteristics of each organic fractionation in coagulated water. According to our previous study On the one hand, from the perspective of NOM removal in the recycling process, we found that the UV Additionally, it was observed that the DWTS recycling process could increase the enrichment risk of WHoA, HiM, and <3 The main conclusions drawn from this work are as follows: DWTS was disrupted by the relatively low release of SCOD and proteins, which could deteriorate the coagulated water quality under the specific energy input of 37.87–1212.1 The most desirable coagulation behavior in regards to NOM removal was achieved by recycling sonicated DWTS without solubilized organics, which could be achieved with a specific energy of 151.5 The main organic fractionations in recycled DWTS were WHoA and HiM, with the MW >100 Fluorescent characteristic analysis confirmed that both humic-like (peak A) and protein-like (peak T1) substances were released into the supernatant of sonicated DWTS. By discharging the solubilized organics in the recycled sonicated DWTS, the humic-like substances could not increasingly be removed, whereas the enhanced removal of protein-like substances could be achieved, lowering the enrichment potential of protein-like substances. A useful strategy using ultrasound as a pretreatment of DWTS and then discharging the solubilized organics was recommended to avoid the organic enrichment risk of the DWTS recycling process.
