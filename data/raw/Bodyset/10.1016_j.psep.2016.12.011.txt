The treatment of highly recalcitrant and non-biodegradable solutions of 1mM of o-toluidine has been comparatively treated by different water treatment technologies based on Fenton’s reaction: conventional Fenton process, electro-assisted Fenton process and electro-assisted photo-Fenton process. The pollutant was mainly oxidized by the homogeneous OH released in situ by the Fenton’s reaction. The electro-assisted photo-Fenton technology demonstrated better performance due to the faster electro-regeneration of iron(II) and the coupled photolysis of several by-products such carboxylic acids attaining complete o-toluidine removal in 60min of treatment. The study of the biodegradability enhancement after the treatment achievieng values near to 0.4 of BOD5/COD ratio assessed the feasible application of electro-assisted photo-Fenton process as pre-biological treatment. In addition, a reaction pathway for o-toluidine mineralization by electro-assisted photo-Fenton’s reaction is proposed.Aromatic compounds are considered to be toxic, potential carcinogenic species and hazardous for human and environmental health ( The advanced oxidation processes are water treatment technologies based on the generation However, the Fenton-like reaction is considerably slower than the Fenton reaction. Thereby, the degradation kinetics is limited by the catalyst regeneration. One feasible strategy to accelerate the iron(II) regeneration and to minimize the sludge formation is the simultaneous electrochemical cathodic reduction of iron(III) by means of Reaction Furthermore, the selection of an appropriate anodic material could also enhance the performance of the conventional Fenton process by its integration with the electrochemical advanced oxidation process known as electrochemical oxidation (EO) ( On the other hand, the Fenton process performance could be further enhanced by the treated solution irradiation with UV by the so-called photo-Fenton process ( The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the improved capability of the electro-assisted photo-Fenton process on the removal of The model pollutant The reactor schemes are depicted in The pH of treated The relative oxidation ability of  The operational parameters of conventional Fenton process such pH, H It is well known that Fenton’s reaction has an operational pH range limitation ( To define the optimal concentration of Fenton’s catalyst is of high relevance to obtain the faster degradation kinetics with the highest efficiency. From On the other hand, the concentration of H From the results described above, optimal operation conditions to treat 1.0 Fenton’s technologies have been considered not only feasible water treatment technologies able to remove recalcitrant organic pollutants in low concentration but also promising pre-treatments of biological water treatment processes ( The BOD The scheme of The mineralization process is initiated by the oxidation of the amino group of The effectiveness of different water treatment technologies based on the Fenton’s reaction on the treatment of The authors would like to thank the
