This paper discusses the design and characterisation of a short, and hence portable impact load cell for in-situ quantification of ore breakage properties under impact loading conditions. Much literature has been published in the past two decades about impact load cells for ore breakage testing. It has been conclusively shown that such machines yield significant quantitative energy-fragmentation information about industrial ores. However, documented load cells are all laboratory systems that are not adapted for in-situ testing due to their dimensions and operating requirements. The authors report on a new portable impact load cell designed specifically for in-situ testing. The load cell is 1.5 m in height and weighs 30 kg. Its physical and operating characteristics are detailed in the paper. This includes physical dimensions, calibration and signal deconvolution. Emphasis is placed on the deconvolution issue, which is significant for such a short load cell. Finally, it is conclusively shown that the short load cell is quantitatively as accurate as its larger laboratory analogues.Comminution processes can be described using “black box” models More and more, comminution models are being developed This necessary evolution must be supported by experimental techniques that can provide increasingly fundamental information about ore breakage properties. In addition, such fundamental ore breakage characterisation techniques must be developed so that they become mainstream and available to industry. One particular area where fundamental ore breakage characterisation is becoming increasingly significant is that of single-particle impact breakage. At present, industry uses the drop-weight tester Over two decades ago, another type of drop-weight testing machine was invented, which will be referred to as         Despite these significant advantages over impact drop-weight testers, impact load cells are not commercially available or used in situ. Indeed, the use of impact load cells remains restricted to specialised laboratories mainly due to their physical dimensions and the sensitivity of their electronic ancillaries. It is also noted that an additional length is necessary on the impact side of such devices for releasing the impact striker. Because of their physical dimensions, such pieces of equipment cannot be easily transported, and are therefore unadapted to in-situ testing. In this paper, a short transportable impact load cell is presented. It is shown that its accuracy is as high as that of larger impact load cells. The main difference arises from the need to accurately characterise signal reflections during acquisition of impact breakage traces. A detailed analysis of the signal deconvolution is provided, which confirms that shortening of the rod does not impact on the accuracy of the technique. The load cell that is described in this paper is schematically presented in The dimensions of the rod as measured with precision callipers are given in It is noted that the physical distance between the top of the rod and the strain gauges is not given here. This will be determined, later in the paper, from speed of sound measurements. The overall length of the measuring rod is only 25% of the length of the existing impact load cells available for ore breakage characterisation (see The device is equipped with two strain gauges in diametrically opposite positions on the steel rod. The model strain gauges are Kulite S/UGP-1000-090 with a nominal unbonded resistance of 1000 Ω and gauge factor of +155. These two strain gauges are mounted in a standard Wheatstone bridge as shown in The voltage The set-up that is presented in this paper was designed for in-situ testing, where temperature can be expected to vary greatly. Consequently, the option of using variable resistance in the inactive arms to cope with changes in strain gauge resistance was adopted. This issue is revisited in the A fixed resistance with value equal to the lowest strain gauge resistance (which occurs at low temperature), and A variable resistance that covers the range of variation in resistance of the strain gauges with temperature. A 20-turn knob is used for precise adjustment of the variable resistance. In order to balance the bridge, the voltages are measured across the active arms of the bridge, and the bridge is balanced when both of these voltages equal half the input bridge voltage, It is important to accurately characterise the properties of the rod so that the impact load cell can be used to generate accurate and precise quantitative information. Density is measured by weighing and sizing a short anvil made of the initial steel rod as the measurement rod. The anvil properties are given in Based on the values of The Young's modulus for the calibration of the load cell and for calculating the energy absorbed by the rod during compression Possibly the most accurate method for measuring Young's modulus is by using the speed of sound through the steel rod. The speed of sound is obtained by direct measurement of the time of travel of a compressive strain wave through the instrumented rod. The method for measuring the speed of sound is illustrated in The Young's modulus is related to the speed of sound and density via The closeness of the values obtained with both methods confirms the adequacy of determining the modulus of elasticity of the rod from speed of sound measurements. Poisson ratio is traditionally obtained by measuring the shear modulus, the torsion analogue of the Young's modulus. Poisson ratio is then derived from the unique relationship between modulus of elasticity, shear modulus and Poisson ratio. However, Deconvolution is perceived as a potential difficulty when designing a short impact load cell. Typically, impact duration for a single particle is around 0.5–1 ms, whereas impact on a bed of particle can last as long as a few milliseconds Measurement of the strain gauge position, Verification of the timing between reflections, Quantification of the signal attenuation. It is stressed that signal deconvolution should be done on the raw output signal from the load cell, which is the Wheatstone bridge output Accurate signal deconvolution implies that the actual measurement position of the strain gauges is precisely known. Given that strain gauges have a finite length, It is noted that the objective during physical mounting of the strain gauges was to position their upper surface 100 mm below the top of the rod. Given their physical dimensions, the value obtained by speed of sound measurement indicates that the mounting operation was done quite accurate indeed. In this section, the validation of the signal deconvolution process is. Given a complete impact signal This pulse is 100 μs in duration. If such a pulse travels through the steel rod, the expected convoluted trace will be as per  It is clear from However, it is visible that the match is not perfect with respect to the voltage values. This is quite clearly evident by examination of the peaks of the signal. Indeed, the measured signal shows an attenuation that Let us define A number of load cell signals were acquired from steel-on-steel impacts. It was found that by matching predicted and measured signals peak for peak the values for As can be seen from It is important to note that the ability to predict the reflected signals accurately also proves that the impact signal is not distorted by reflections at the ends of the bars. This is a very important point, as should distortion of the signal occur, the problem of deconvoluting the signal would become inextricable. In practice of course, one is more concerned with deconvoluting the signal, which is the reverse to the convolution problem. Assuming that the measured convoluted signal  When  These figures confirm that it is not a problem to deconvolute the signal measured with the short impact load cell. In each case, the start and end of the impact signal is clearly apparent. Calibration is based on matching the signal measured under controlled impact condition, say with a ball reading dropped onto the rod, and matching the output signal to that predicted by the Hertz law of contact Provided the gauge factor of the strain gauges is known under the ambient conditions that prevail during use of the impact load cell, GF Another approach, which is employed in this work, is to make a direct estimate of the value of GF After having conducted an impact between a well-characterised ball bearing and the impact load cell, the maximum output voltage To demonstrate the usability of the technique, the value of GF  The reader may question the precision of the device, as the resolution of  It is noted that the force resolution depends on the voltage range used, the smaller the range, the higher the force resolution. Finally, it is also noted that the force resolution impacts on the maximum force that can be measured, so that the smaller the voltage range, the higher the force resolution but the lower the maximum resolvable force. A compromise is therefore necessary in practice between force resolution and maximum measurable force. The traditional force and energy analysis The analysis of Force at first fracture: 1059 N, Particle strength: 52.9 MPa, Particle stiffness: 18.7 GPa, Energy absorbed by the particle at first fracture=75.7 mJ (or 50.4% of the total comminution energy available), Total energy absorbed by the particle for breakage=148.5 mJ (or 98.9% of the total comminution energy available). It is important to stress some additional design issues that can potentially affect the calibration of the impact load cell. As implied by In addition, because the voltage output of the strain gauges is typically less than 10 mV with such systems, the signal needs be amplified. Typically, the voltage output signal is amplified ×200 to ×500 depending on the forces measured. The linearity and stability of the amplification system is also a factor that must be carefully considered in the design of impact load cells. In our case, the use of high-quality instrumentation amplifiers ensure maximum linearity of the amplified voltage. Fundamental ore breakage characterisation is becoming increasingly important and is no longer restricted to specialised laboratories. One such fundamental characterisation technique is single-particle impact breakage testing. This field has received a great deal of attention in the past decade and is now mature from both testing and data analysis standpoints. This paper presented a short impact load cell designed for in-situ characterisation of single-particle impact breakage of industrial ores. The characterisation of the device was fully described, and involved accurate elastic property characterisation of the load cell and detailed calibration and signal deconvolution analysis for quantitative use of the apparatus. It was shown that signal deconvolution is inevitable with such a short load cell, yet it is dealt with without effect on the accuracy and precision of the load cell measurements. A simple calibration procedure adapted for routine in-situ operation of the device was also presented. Overall, it can be concluded that it is possible to design and build a short impact load cell without loss of resolution compared to its larger analogues. Such a short load cell combines the accuracy of existing laboratory measurement devices with the flexibility and advantages of in-situ testing. Future development of the short impact load cell includes retrofitting an automatic feeding system that will permit continuous unattended single-particle breakage testing.
