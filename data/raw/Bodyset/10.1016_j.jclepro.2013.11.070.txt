Modern long distance ore pipeline systems are subject to strong costs, both from the economic and environmental standpoints. The task of assessing the relative importance of energy and water consumption without a detailed engineering analysis is often not obvious. In the present paper, the relative importance of water and energy unit costs is assessed by a novel dimensionless formulation accounting for the essential hydraulic and cost elements that conform the slurry transport. It is found that, for conditions resembling those of copper and iron concentrate pipelines, the ratio between energy and water costs has a wide range, depending on the particular transport conditions and unit cost scenarios. Although operating at similar volume fractions, results indicate that energy/water cost relations may differ between copper and iron concentrate pipelines and local conditions, thus suggesting the need to explicitly include energy and water cost in the design strategy.The new challenges that modern slurry engineering faces include the need not only to take into account environmental variables such as carbon footprint at project and operation phases ( Despite the need, as in any other industrial process, to minimize both water and energy consumption in the mining sector, the hydraulic transport of ore concentrates faces a new dilemma. At equal dry tonnages, reducing the amount of water causes an increase on the slurry concentration, with a subsequent increase of the energy requirement, and potential water/energy consumption scenarios may be seen as the result of the competition energy and water costs ( In slurry transport, water acts as a mere vehicle for the granular matter containing the mineral; is required in considerable quantities and is obtained from diverse sources, including aquifers and the sea. Disregarding additional social or environmental components, the cost of water, depending on whether it comes from aquifer or a desalinated plant, may fluctuate depending on their origin and potential pre-treatment requirements ( Pumping ore slurries through long distances, which commonly exceed 100 km, requires electrical powers that may exceed several megawatts during steady operation. The inherently nonlinear nature of transport often makes an Consider the water and energy required to transport a given amount of dry concentrate per unit time, The amount of consumed water may be obtained by virtue of mass conservation ( Using (3) and (4), a general relation in terms of the friction factor, with the aforementioned set of hypotheses, is expressed as: This dimensionless number is fairly general and requires, in particular, the knowledge of the flow rate, It is instructive to parameterize it in terms of a particular slurry rheology and a frictional law. It is assumed that the slurry is well-described using the Bingham model ( The small, albeit non-negligible yield stress (typically below 1 Pa in iron and copper concentrate slurries at common transport concentrations) is mostly relevant to characterize the laminar-turbulent transition, A condition for the critical depositional velocity, For the particle size range of copper and iron concentrates, the depositional velocity has been successfully correlated by The minimum transport velocity may be estimated as that which exceeds both the laminar-turbulent transitional threshold and depositional value. Considering the design factors To obtain order of magnitude figures for the case of copper and iron concentrate flows, whose most typical dynamical regime is that of smooth wall friction, the friction factor may be expressed as a strong function of the Reynolds number and perhaps a weak function of the non-Newtonian characteristic of the slurry. In most copper and iron concentrates, the yield stress is small compared to the wall shear stress and thus, at moderate Reynolds numbers and flow rates above the minimum value, the slurry effectively flows similarly as a Newtonian one with little effect of the stratification due to the presence of solids, as discussed elsewhere ( For turbulent flow of Bingham fluids with To have a rough estimation of the relative importance of the energy and water costs, the dimensionless relation (5) may be evaluated without a detailed knowledge of the system hydraulic behavior, by means of (7), (8), (9) and (10), with proper assumptions of the model parameter coefficients The relations presented in the previous section are strongly dependent on the solids concentration, Here, The value obtained in (13) defines two alternative ways to write the dimensionless number (5), depending whether it is the deposit velocity or the laminar-turbulent transition velocity that which needs to be considered. In either case, the new dimensionless number Π has the general form: On the other hand, when the minimum velocity is controlled by the laminar-turbulent transition ( In summary, the dimensionless number Π, given by (16) may be roughly estimated following the steps as below: Identify proper values of Solve (13) for If The dimensionless model parameters referred in the numeral 1 may be obtained either from the literature or from direct experimental measurements when possible. Although the combined effect of inaccuracies in their identification may be a significant source of uncertainty in the cost terms ( It is seen from the structure of (16), (17) and (20) that both Λ  The overall effect of concentration and energy-water unit costs on the energy-water cost ratio Π may be exemplified for conditions typical to copper and iron concentrates.  The results shown in The hypothetical situation depicted herein shows that hydraulic similarities do not necessarily imply that ore concentrate pipelines in different locations will have a similar impact regarding energy and water consumption. A key element that may limit the uptake of the present approach is, however, the ability to make a proper definition of the unit costs Another implication of the present proposed dimensionless number is the potential to directly evaluate different water-energy relative cost scenarios through different possibilities involving the pipeline path —thus impacting the total tube length It has been shown that the dimensionless number Π, representing the energy-water cost ratio, exposes the widely different conditions that different locations may imply. The form of the dimensionless number depends on whether the minimum transport velocity is conditioned by the solids deposition mechanism or by the laminar-turbulent transition.
