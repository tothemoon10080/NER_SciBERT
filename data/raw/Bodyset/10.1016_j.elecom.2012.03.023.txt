A nanotubular composite of TiO2–WO3 was synthesized via anodic oxidation of titanium in a single-step process using phosphotungstic acid as the tungsten source. The composite material was evaluated for photoelectrochemical water splitting and demonstrated a 46% increase in conversion efficiency by incorporating WO3 compared to TiO2 nanotubes prepared under similar conditions.Solar-assisted water splitting to generate hydrogen as an energy carrier is anticipated to be at the foundation of sustainable energy systems Tungsten trioxide (WO In this communication we report the formation of TiO Synthesis of TNT and TNT–WO Experiments were carried out in a custom-built quartz window cell with the TNT or TNT–WO Scanning electron micrographs of samples anodized in the presence of PTA show the formation of nanotubes with diameters in the range of 90–120 X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on annealed samples to determine the crystalline phases and composition of the material ( The formation of TNT–WO A potentiodynamic plot of TNT–WO The efficiency for conversion of light energy to chemical energy under an applied external potential was plotted versus applied potential under illumination The literature indicates that addition of WO Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to investigate charge transfer kinetics and recombination processes at semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces The method for incorporating tungsten with titania nanotubes during the anodization process, presented here, showed enhanced optical and electronic properties. Moreover, by employing the correct anodization bath chemistry and anodization conditions, this method can possibly be used to couple other transitional metals with titania nanotubes for a variety of applications. Further studies are underway to examine the roll of anodization conditions with tungsten ions and the photoelectrochemical performance. This work was supported by
