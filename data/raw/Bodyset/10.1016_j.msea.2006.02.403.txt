Nanometer scale Pt metal islands formed by the dewetting of two-dimensional film on SiO2 dielectric materials during rapid thermal annealing were investigated. For the case of 30nm thick Pt films, pattern formation and dewetting were initiated at temperatures of >600Â°C. Controlling the annealing temperature and time as well as the thickness of the Pt metal film permitted the size and density of Pt islands to be controlled. Furthermore, the islands show good resistance to dry-etching by a CF4-based plasma for dielectric etching, indicating that the metal islands produced by dewetting are suitable for use as an etch-mask in the fabrication of nano-scale structures.Low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures have considerable potential for use in applications in optoelectronic devices such as low-dimensional laser diode and waveguide using a photonic band gap On the one hand, some researchers have investigated alternative methods that avoid the use of electron-beam lithography for reliable pattern formation, especially for a suitable mask for the dry-etch. These approaches are the use small colloid particles In this paper, we report findings to show that the thermal annealing of Pt films can induce dewetting of the film with a high density of nanometer scale islands appearing on the dielectric surface. Furthermore, a method for the fabrication of a nano-scale GaN structure by inductively coupled plasma etching is also proposed, in which the Pt clusters are utilized by dewetting of the two-dimensional Pt film on the SiO The experimental procedure used in this study is shown in The samples were heated from 500 to 1173 In order to investigate the feasibility of using Pt islands as etch-masks, the dry-etching of a SiO  At a higher temperature of 673 When the sampled was annealed at 773  As the temperature is increased to 973   Nano-scale Pt metal islands were formed by the dewetting of two-dimensional film on SiO This work was supported by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE) through the project of Regional Research Center (RRC) at Sunchon National University.
