Ankle injuries occur frequently in the athlete. The incidence of ankle fractures has been estimated to be 250,000 per year in the United States; therefore, it is one of the most common fractures treated by the orthopedic surgeon. The usual mechanism of injury is supination-eversion, making up 42% to 72% of ankle fractures. With displaced fractures, anatomic reduction of the joint and rigid internal fixation are crucial for proper healing and returning to sports activities.
