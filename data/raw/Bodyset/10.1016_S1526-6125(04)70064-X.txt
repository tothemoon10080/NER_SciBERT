Deep X-ray lithography based techniques such as LIGA (German acronym representing Lithographie, Galvanoformung, and Abformung) are being currently used to fabricate net-shape components for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Unlike other microfabrication techniques, LIGA lends itself to a broad range of materials, including metals, alloys, polymers, as well as ceramics and composites. Currently, Ni and Ni alloys are the materials of choice for LIGA microsystems. While Ni alloys may meet the structural requirements for MEMS, their tribological (friction and wear) behavior poses great challenges for the reliable operation of LIGA-fabricated MEMS. Typical sidewall morphologies of LIGA-fabricated parts are described, and their role in the tribological behavior of MEMS is discussed. The adaptation of commercial plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to coat the sidewalls of LIGA-fabricated parts with diamond-like nanocompositeis described.
