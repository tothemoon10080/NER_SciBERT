Deinking is very important for paper recycling and usually flotation is used for deinking. In the case of office wastepaper, photocopy and laser-print toner particles are thermally fused and bonded to cellulose fibers, which makes deinking some more difficult than common waste paper. In this paper, the surface physico-chemical properties such as electrokinetics and wettability of the toner composites such as carbon black, some polymers and cellulose have been determined through zeta potential and contact angle measurement. The interaction forces between the toner composites and cellulose have been calculated and their implication to flotation have been discussed based on interfacial polar interaction theory and extended DLVO theory.
