Mo–0.6Ti–0.2Zr–0.1C alloy was prepared by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequently consolidated by powder processing techniques. The pellets prepared from the fine size MA powder showed a high rate of densification during sintering in the temperature range of 1300–1500°C. Close to theoretical density was attained by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1250°C and TEM studies revealed the uniform distribution of complex carbide precipitates (<100nm) in the fine grain microstructure of the consolidated alloy. The alloy consolidated by HIP showed a high hardness of the order of 500HK due to the presence of the carbides in the fine grain microstructure.Molybdenum base alloys such as Mo–30W and TZM, TZC, etc. possess excellent creep and tensile properties beyond 1000 The aim of the present investigation was to prepare Mo–0.6Ti–0.2Zr–0.02C (wt%) alloy powder by mechanical alloying and subsequent consolidation by powder metallurgical techniques such as (i) compaction followed by sintering and (ii) hot isostatic pressing. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM and OIM analysis were conducted to characterize the alloy powder as well as the consolidated alloy. Initially high purity molybdenum metal powder (1–1.5 The powder processing techniques applied to study the consolidation behavior of both the parent powder mixture and mechanically alloyed powder are (i) cold uniaxial and isostatic compaction (CIP) followed by sintering between 1000 and 1800  The actual powder size measured by SEM was 728, 325 and 233 The green densities of uniaxially compacted pellets prepared from the parent powder mixture and MA 120 The density better than 99.9% of the theoretical value (10.16  The alloy was further annealed at 1700 Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) images of as consolidated alloy are presented in Mo–0.6Ti–0.2Zr–0.02C alloy was prepared by mechanical alloying. Faster sintering kinetics of the compact prepared from fine size alloy powder was observed between 1300 and 1500 The authors wish to thank Dr. Ritu (WIP) and Mr. R.
