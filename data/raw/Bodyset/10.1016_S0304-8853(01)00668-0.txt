The change in the residual stress and its effect on mechanical bending and magnetic properties of sputtered amorphous Sm–Fe–B thin films are investigated as a function of annealing temperature. Two stress components of intrinsic compressive stress and tensile stress due to the difference of the thermal expansion coefficients between the substrate and thin film are used to explain the stress state in as-deposited thin films, and the annealing temperature dependence of residual stress, mechanical bending and magnetic properties.Thin films of giant magnetostrictive Sm−Fe based alloys were shown to be suitable for Si-based microdevice applications Thin films of Sm−Fe−B alloys with a thickness of 1 The state of residual stress present in thin films is well correlated with the bending, as can be seen from the results shown in Changes in magnetic properties were also investigated as a function of annealing temperature. In Two types of residual stress are considered to exist in the present Sm−Fe−B thin films. One is “intrinsic” compressive stress, the formation of which is related to the sputtering process itself Two important points can be drawn from the results for the annealing temperature dependence of residual stress and bending for a Sm−Fe−B thin film ( The annealing temperature dependence of magnetic properties can also be explained by residual stress change with annealing. Magnetoelastic interactions indicate that compressive stress enhances in-plane anisotropy in thin films with negative magnetostriction such as Sm−Fe. Further evidence on the annealing temperature dependence of residual stress can be seen from the anisotropy change with annealing, the results of which are shown in SHL thanks Research Center for Advanced Magnetic Materials (an ERC at Chungnam National University) for its financial support of this work.
