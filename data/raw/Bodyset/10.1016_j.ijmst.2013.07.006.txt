Recently, many regression models have been presented for prediction of mechanical parameters of rocks regarding to rock index properties. Although statistical analysis is a common method for developing regression models, but still selection of suitable transformation of the independent variables in a regression model is difficult. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) has been employed as a heuristic search method for selection of best transformation of the independent variables (some index properties of rocks) in regression models for prediction of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and modulus of elasticity (E). Firstly, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was performed on a data set to establish predictive models. Then, two GA models were developed in which root mean squared error (RMSE) was defined as fitness function. Results have shown that GA models are more precise than MLR models and are able to explain the relation between the intrinsic strength/elasticity properties and index properties of rocks by simple formulation and accepted accuracy.
