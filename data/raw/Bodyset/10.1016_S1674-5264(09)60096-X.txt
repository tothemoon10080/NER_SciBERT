Cutting tests were done using a test bed designed to measure pick cutting forces when cutting coal and rock. The test equipment has a drum with two starting helical vanes. Cutting forces on a pick were measured as a function of coal compressive strength, pick carbide tip diameter and the cutting depth per drum revolution. The results show that the cutting force is linearly related to the compressive strength. The relationship between the cutting force and both the carbide tip diameter and the cutting depth are exponential. Fluctuation in the cutting force does not increase with coal compressive strength but it has a linear relationship to tip diameter. A plot of cutting force fluctuations versus the cutting depth follows a sigmoidal curve. Based on the analysis of these test results a theoretical basis is supplied for design and effective use of shearer drums.
