We propose a new model for the prediction of the specific grinding energy, which proved to approach very well the values calculated with the help of the Denver slide rule. The proposed model, combined with a model giving the ball-mill power draw, is used for the ball-mill scale up. Comparisons with the Bond procedure showed a good agreement for the prediction of the ball-mill dimensions, due to the fact that the proposed model is not sensitive to the various corrections associated with the Bond methodology.
