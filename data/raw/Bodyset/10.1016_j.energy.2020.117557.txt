China’s existing subsidy policy for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is putting pressure on government finances, and the effect of EV promotion has not been ideal. Sharing EVs can reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions while meeting people’s demand for a vehicle. This paper proposes a new government subsidy sharing scheme that is based on vehicle mileage. Using Beijing as the case study, the pricing and profits of vehicle sharing companies (VSCs) are analyzed. Three main conclusions are obtained. First, VSCs have trouble meeting market demand and consequently also have trouble making a profit. Second, allocating subsidies between VSC and consumers in a certain proportion will better motivate residents to use shared EVs. As the sharing factor increases, the demand for shared EVs in each market segment will increase by at least 16.2%, and the maximum profit of VSCs under the new subsidy mode can be increased by 3.4%. Third, the optimal pricing of a VSC is about 1.8 RMB/km under the traditional subsidy mode, while with the new subsidy mode, the optimal pricing of a VSC will increase along with the subsidy sharing factor.The rapid development of the automotive industry has made travelling and cargo transportation more convenient. At the same time, as demand for vehicles increases, the total amount of transportation energy consumption is also growing rapidly. The energy demand of the transportation sector—second only to that of the industrial and construction sectors—will further increase in the future. The transportation sector consumes most of the world’s liquid fuels and is the main driver of liquid fuel consumption growth [ In recent years, vehicle sharing has increased in China. Due to their low operating cost, shared vehicles that are used for transportation within cities are mainly NEVs. Sharing travel greatly enhances the use of NEVs [ Considering the traditional drawbacks of the subsidy mode that is only for vehicle manufacturers, this paper proposes a new subsidy strategy, which provides subsidies according to NEV mileage and shares the subsidy between VSCs and consumers. Using Beijing as the case study, and modeling the net profit of the VSC under two different subsidy modes during the NEV operation period, we provide a reference for the pricing decisions of the VSC and the subsidy decisions of the government. The results suggest a path for promoting the use of NEVs in China. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The second section reviews the research on NEV development, promotion and car-sharing. The third section constructs the model and sets the corresponding parameters. Analysis of the results, and the corresponding conclusions and implications, are given in the fourth and fifth sections. The promotion of NEVs is conducive to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions [ In regard to promoting the development of NEVs, policy incentives and innovative business models are the two main methods, and the existing research focuses on the evaluation of relevant policies and the exploration of innovative business models. The promotion of NEVs cannot be separated from policy support [ Some studies have sought to encourage NEV adoption by finding an innovative business model for NEV promotion. He et al. [ In China, vehicle and bicycle sharing represent a popular form of a sharing economy, and the pricing problem is critical for sharing economies [ It can be seen that the existing research focuses on the impact analysis of policies and the exploration of innovative business models, but it lacks a combination of these two aspects. Promotion of NEVs in the early stage should be an effective combination of the two forms. To promote widespread adoption of NEV usage, the government should provide certain subsidies for innovative business models rather than a single subsidy for electric vehicle manufacturers only. To this end, this paper quantifies the market for, and cost factors of, NEVs in the shared promotion model, and innovatively proposes a new model for subsidizing NEV sharing mileage, in the hopes of providing a reference for two significant problems through the comparative analysis of two subsidy modes: (1) for VSCs, what pricing decisions should be taken under different subsidy modes to maximize net profit; and (2) for the government, whether the mode of subsidizing NEV sharing by mileage is better than a lump sum subsidy for the promotion of NEVs. In the long term, subsidies based on product units are more effective than a lump sum subsidy [ The pricing decision model used in this paper is similar to the one used in Zhao et al. [                       The model used in this paper has been fully demonstrated in Ref. [ Consumers who use shared cars are usually price sensitive [ When adopting the subsidy mode based on the operating mileage, the VSC will share subsidies with consumers as a form of discount; this has a positive impact on demand, and government subsidies are directly proportional to demand. Demand under this subsidy mode is shown in Eq. Therefore, the sum of the various market segments represents the total demand for year Considering the two different subsidy modes, the description of the net profit of the VSC is different. The profit of the VSC for M1 is shown in Eq. For the subsidized mode according to mileage (M2), the profit of the VSC is as shown in Eq. For each order completed, the ratio of government subsidies available to the VSC is The expressions of Since the change in consumer preference for travel mileage is unknown, we assume that the net profit each year is the same, as shown in Eqs. In the operating cycle of the NEV, the total benefits to the VSC under the two subsidy modes are described as Eqs. To map the model to actual conditions, this paper uses Beijing as a case study to set the model’s parameters. The capital of China, Beijing is a cosmopolitan city with a population of 21,729 million (as of 2016) [ According to the actual mileage distribution of a VSC operation [ The vehicle models used by several major VSCs in Beijing—according to data gathered from a survey of car sharing platform Apps—are shown in The rest of the parameters are set as shown in The profit of the VSC under M1 is shown in When the price is 1.8 RMB/km, the VSC can achieve a maximum profit of 5.176 × 10 The profit of VSCs under M2 is shown in It can be seen that as the percentage of subsidy sharing increases, the optimal pricing of the VSC will also increase. When the subsidy sharing percentage is 0–4%, the optimal pricing is 1.7 RMB/km. When this percentage is 5%–28%, the optimal pricing is 1.8 RMB/km, which is the same as the optimal pricing under M1. When the subsidy sharing percentage is higher than 29%, the optimal pricing of the VSC under M2 will be higher than it is under M1. When the subsidy sharing percentage reaches 100%, the VSC will share the entire subsidy with the consumer, while the optimal pricing will be increased to 2.2 RMB/km. It should be noted that the change in the proportion of subsidy sharing has little effect on the maximum profit of the VSC (the maximum optimal profit is only 0.12% higher than the lowest optimal profit). When the price is 2.1 RMB/km, and the subsidy sharing percentage is 88%, the VSC will receive the maximum benefit of 5.351 × 10 From the foregoing discussion, it can be found that the mode of subsidy by mileage is superior to the vehicle-subsidized model in terms of the highest profits and the most attractive incentive for consumers. However, it is worth noting that for different values of the subsidy sharing coefficient Under a certain subsidy sharing proportion, increasing the subsidy In terms of the amount of subsidies, in 2016, the average daily order per shared vehicle in Beijing was 5.1, and the average order mileage was 20 km [  Note: To make the display of results more concise and clear, corresponding results of  This paper proposes a subsidy scheme that can be applied to the sharing of NEVs: the topics of subsidies according to mileage, and the VSC’s profits under two subsidy modes are discussed through simulation modeling. The main conclusions are as follows: Overall, under the two subsidy modes, with the increase of the price per kilometer from low to high, the profit of the VSC first increases and then decreases. Lower pricing will result in a large demand for shared NEVs, but at the same time, the revenue per order will be reduced, resulting in slower cost recovery, lower gross profits and difficulty in achieving profitability. Excessive pricing can increase the revenue per order, but it will cause the VSC to lose some of the high mileage market, which will lead to lower profits. Under the condition that market demand can be met, the optimal price under M1 conditions is about 1.8 RMB/km, while in M2, with the subsidy sharing factor increasing from 0 to 100%, the optimal pricing of the VSC will rise from 1.7 RMB/km to 2.2 RMB/km, and the maximum profit under each optimal pricing shows little difference and remains at about 3.4% higher than that under M1. Under a certain subsidy sharing ratio, the subsidy mode based on mileage makes the use of shared NEVs more appealing for consumers. However, when the value of As the subsidy sharing coefficient The change of  The demand of the local market for NEV sharing should be properly assessed. The VSCs should clarify demand for shared NEVs from local residents through market research or other means and estimate the number of vehicles operated according to the determined demand situation. Because the purchase cost of an NEV is one of the most important costs of the VSC, a blind increase in the number of vehicles operated may result in the VSC being unable to make ends meet. On the other hand, an insufficient number of operating vehicles will cause the VSC to fail to meet the market demand and to thus lose profits. Therefore, an accurate investigation of demand is crucial. A segmented pricing mode could be implemented. Per the above discussion, VSCs will lose the high mileage travel market when the pricing is too high, while those that are able to fulfill an order with high mileage can obtain higher profits. Thus, increasing market share of high mileage travel to improve profits would benefit the VSC. Consumers in the low-mileage segment are more likely to use shared NEVs because of their convenience. Most low-mileage travelers are located in the central business district of Beijing, our case study city. VSCs could appropriately increase the costs for the low-mileage traveler, and this likely would not dampen the willingness of this segment to travel with shared NEVs. A segmented pricing mode could be implemented with relatively high pricing for consumers in the low mileage market and relatively low pricing for consumers in the high mileage market. This could increase the income provided by the low mileage market, as well as stabilize the market share of the high mileage market, thereby increasing the overall profits of the VSC. The capabilities of vehicle operation scheduling should be enhanced, as this is crucial for the VSC’s operation and scheduling of vehicles. Through proper scheduling, VSCs should try to arrange to charge shared NEVs at night and during other periods of non-use. VSCs should deploy shared NEVs in densely populated areas through a precise positioning system, so that consumers can rent cars more smoothly and as needed. This precision and convenience would play an important role in increasing consumer satisfaction and stabilizing the shared NEV market.  Government should reduce or eliminate the one-time purchase subsidy for operating NEVs, and instead implement the subsidy based on mileage. The one-time subsidy requires the government to subsidize a large amount of money to NEV manufacturers, which may lead to subsidy cheating. If the government chooses to subsidize shared NEV mileage, the VSC can choose certain manufacturers with whom it will place its entire NEV order; this will cause low-performance NEV products to be naturally eliminated by the market. Through such a method, the competitive industry pressure faced by NEV manufacturers will increase. To ensure the survival of their own enterprises, manufacturers will inevitably increase their investment in research, and this should lead them to produce NEVs capable of performance that meets market demand and consumer expectations. Government subsidies of NEV mileage could also increase travelers’ enthusiasm for using shared NEVs, especially for short-haul travel. Residents may use more shared NEVs instead of taxis, which would obviously increase the usage of NEVs. The issuance of license plates for operating NEVs could be increased appropriately, but it should not be increased blindly. The government should conduct a joint market survey with the VSCs and formulate a policy regarding annual licenses for NEVs to meet demand in the shared vehicle market and reduce residential vehicle purchases. Government should improve NEV-related infrastructure. The operating mode of the shared vehicle industry is mostly based on network dot based distribution; i.e., consumers need to go to fixed outlets to rent vehicles. The main reason for this is the limited number of charging stations in the city (Beijing) and the high cost of parking. Increasing the number of charging stations and reducing parking fees would help to ensure that a shared NEV could be parked anywhere and used anytime. At the same time, VSCs should cooperate with the dispatchers, so that a convenient and smart city shared NEV system can be implemented to meet user demand for shared NEVs.
