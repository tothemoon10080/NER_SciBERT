Pd(II) ions sorption from the model solutions of the composition: 0.1–8.0 M HCl – 0.0011 M Pd(II) and 0.1–0.9 M HCl – 0.9–0.1 M HNO3 – 0.0011 M Pd(II) on the ion exchangers with the thiol (Duolite GT-73) and thiourea (Lewatit TP-214) functional groups was discussed. These ion exchangers possess a considerable ion exchange capacity in the model chloride–nitrate and chloride systems e.g. 1.16 mmol Pd(II)/g of Lewatit TP-214 in 0.1 M HCl solution. In the purification of Pd(II) of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Al(III) salts macroquantities, the best results were obtained by means of Lewatit TP-214
