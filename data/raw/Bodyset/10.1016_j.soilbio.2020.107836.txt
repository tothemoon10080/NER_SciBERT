Despite the enormous size of the organic nitrogen (N) pool contained in mineral subsoils, rates of N cycling and soil exoenzyme activities are rarely measured in soils below 10 or 20 cm depth. Furthermore, assumed relationships between N mineralization rates and the activities of various decomposition exoenzymes are poorly characterized. We measured rates of gross and net N mineralization and nitrification as well as the potential activities of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes at five soil depths (forest floor to 50 cm) in Spodosols at three hardwood forests of varying age (45 and 100 years post-harvest and old growth) at and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA. As expected, rates of N cycling and potential enzyme activities per unit soil mass correlated strongly with soil carbon (C) concentration, and these parameters declined exponentially with increasing soil depth. After normalization per unit soil organic matter, N cycling rates and specific enzyme activities generally decreased little with depth within the mineral soil. Gross N mineralization rates correlated with specific activities of those enzymes that hydrolyze cellulose (β-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase) and N-rich glucosamine polymers (N-acetylglucosaminidase), but not those that degrade protein or more complex C compounds. Hence, gross N cycling appear associated with the N released during microbial N recycling, rather than from decomposition of soil organic matter. Across the three stands, the youngest had a larger ratio of N- to-phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities, indicating a greater N demand in younger than older forests. For all three stands, mineral soil below 10 cm contributed 30–53% of total gross and net N cycling per unit area to 50 cm depth. Overall, even though microbial N cycling and enzyme activities per unit soil mass decreased with depth, microbial processes in subsoils contributed substantially to ecosystem-scale gross N fluxes because of the sustained microbial activity per unit soil organic matter at depth and the large size of the organic matter pool in the mineral soil. These results support the inclusion of often-ignored mineral subsoils and microbial N recycling in both ecosystem N budgets and in model simulations, due to their contribution to soil N fluxes and the importance of microbial N dynamics in forest stands.Studies measuring soil microbial nitrogen (N) cycling and extracellular enzyme activity (e.g., as synthesized in Gaps persist in quantifying N cycling rates and N budgets in deep soil even at well-studied sites, such as the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a Long-Term Ecological Research site in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where the mineral soil may play a more important role than previously recognized in both supplying and retaining N over the course of succession ( Microbial processes can both add and remove N from SON pools. Microbes drive the process of N mineralization, which is the decomposition-mediated release of N from organic matter. Microbial production of a range of extracellular enzymes propels the first step of this process, the depolymerization of complex organic matter into simple monomers ( This study examined how rates of soil N cycling and potential activities of extracellular enzymes varied with each other and with depth in three forest stands of different ages at and near the HBEF, in order to quantify the contributions of mineral subsoils to ecosystem N cycling and to identify links between these N cycling rates and the activity of soil exoenzymes. Measuring both gross and net N cycling rates and a suite of potential exoenzyme activities in the same samples allowed examination of the connections between these indicators of microbial activity, both per unit soil dry mass and when normalized for SOM concentration. We hypothesized first that gross N mineralization rates would correspond with the specific activities of commonly measured soil exoenzymes, particularly those associated with N acquisition: N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), which hydrolyzes glucosamine from chitin and other oligosaccharides, and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), which hydrolyzes leucine and other amino acids from polypeptides. This hypothesis addresses the expected link between activities of decomposition enzymes and N cycling, and whether mineralization of inorganic N depends more on the activity of enzymes degrading N-containing organic compounds than those degrading other types of organic matter. Second, we hypothesized that potential enzyme activities and N cycling rates per unit soil mass would both decrease with depth, because expected decreases in SOM concentrations provide less organic substrate for decomposition. In addition we expected that when normalized for SOM content, these processes would decrease with depth due to expected increases in the age and stability of the SOM that occurs in deep soil. Third, we hypothesized that potential enzyme activities and gross N mineralization rates would be greatest in the youngest site, because greater plant demand for N might lead plants to allocate C belowground to stimulate microbially driven release of N through decomposition of SOM. Soils were collected in July 2014 from three sites at and near the HBEF, where monthly mean temperature is 18 °C in July and −9 °C in January, and precipitation averages 1400 mm per year. Soils are largely acidic sandy loam Spodosols derived from glacial till, and are classified as well-drained Haplorthods ( At each site, eight soil cores were collected from within a 900 m Bulk density and soil C and N stocks were determined from the quantitative soil samples following Rates of gross N mineralization and nitrification were assessed using the isotope pool dilution method ( The KCl extracts were analyzed with colorimetric methods for NH Gross N cycling rates were calculated using the differences in atom percent Two soil slurries were created for each soil sample, each using 2 g of soil in 150 mL of a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) homogenized with a hand blender. One slurry was used for measurements of hydrolytic enzyme activity and the other for oxidative enzyme activity. Lack of material precluded analysis of oxidative enzyme activity for one sample at the old-growth site and eight samples at the mature site, including all four of its forest floor samples. For both sets of enzyme analyses, 50 μL of each sample slurry was added to 8 replicate wells in a column of a 96-well plate. Potential activities of six hydrolytic enzymes used for microbial acquisition of C-, N-, and P were quantified with fluorometric assays using the method outlined in Potential activity of the lignolytic oxidative enzyme phenol oxidase (POX) was assessed using two different enzyme substrates, ABTS (2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) and L-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), as suggested by Enzyme assays were all conducted on soil samples stored by freezing at −20 °C. This commonly used storage method (e.g., Nitrogen cycling measurements were examined per unit dry soil mass (μg N g Soil C and N concentrations decreased exponentially with depth ( When considered per unit dry soil, rates of gross N mineralization ( When computed per unit SON to normalize for potential substrate availability, gross N mineralization decreased non-significantly between the organic horizon and 0–10 cm depth, then decreased significantly between 0–10 cm and deeper mineral soil (10–20, 20–30, and 30–50 cm) ( At the ecosystem scale, N cycling in the mineral soil contributed more mineralized N than the organic horizon due to the large mass of the mineral soil ( Similar to depth patterns for the N cycling rates, all of the exoenzyme activities per unit soil mass declined with depth (not shown), and all increased (P < 0.0001) with soil C concentration (e.g., When normalized per unit soil C, specific enzyme activities sometimes differed between the forest floor and mineral soil, but then were remarkably constant with increased depth in the mineral soil ( Compared across sites, for all enzymes except NAG, the old-growth site regularly had significantly greater specific enzyme activity than the mature stand at most depths, while specific activities at the youngest site typically fell intermediate to the other two sites ( When considered per unit soil mass, gross N mineralization rate correlated significantly (P < 0.002) with all enzyme activities (R Despite the large quantities of organic C and N stored in mineral soils, few studies have measured enzyme activities or gross N cycling rates in mineral subsoils, especially when normalized for SOM content, and to our knowledge none have explored connections between these two sets of measurements. We show that N cycling rates and enzyme activities per unit soil mass decreased with increasing depth in correspondence with decreasing organic C concentration, with relatively constant rates across depths when normalized per unit soil C. We further show correlations between gross N cycling rates and the activities of those enzymes that degrade simple, but not more complex, C- and N-containing organic substrates. In the following three sections, we discuss these results and related work for each of our three hypotheses, focused on expectations that gross N mineralization rates and enzyme activities would (1) correlate with each other, particularly for the N-acquiring enzymes; (2) decrease with increasing soil depth; and (3) decrease from the young to the two older stands. Nitrogen mineralization was once viewed as the relatively simple net release of inorganic N from SOM as a microbial waste product during the process of decomposition; however, conceptual models have shifted to address the earlier steps in this process, to consider depolymerization of N-containing complex organic matter and the role of microbial production of exoenzymes as drivers of decomposition ( We hypothesized that gross N mineralization rate would correspond with the activity of the enzymes generally associated with N acquisition, NAG and LAP (e.g., Neither gross nor net N cycling rates varied significantly with the specific activities of the enzymes that degrade proteins (LAP) or lignin and humic material (POX), either directly in bivariate analyses ( We hypothesized that soil N cycling rates and enzyme activities would decrease with depth, both because soil C and N concentrations typically decrease with depth, and because the SOM that does occur is typically older and more likely to occur in stabilized forms in association with soil minerals than at the surface (e.g., Past cross-biome data syntheses show that variation in SOM concentration in surface soils acts as a fundamental control on microbial processes measured per unit soil mass, explaining 42% of the variation of gross N mineralization ( Organic horizon and surface (0–10 cm) mineral soil gross and net N cycling rates measured here were broadly similar to those previously measured at the HBEF ( Estimates of N cycling per unit area show that mineral soils contribute a substantial amount of N to total profile net and gross N cycling rates. For net N mineralization, mineral soil B horizons produced 14–58% of total profile rates in New England ( Calculated SON turnover rates were very fast throughout the soil profile, consistent with inferences from exoenzyme activities that gross N mineralization rates better reflect microbial N turnover than new mineralization of stable SON. That is, comparison of gross N mineralization rates (kg N ha Of the few other studies of enzyme activity in subsoils, most report rates on a per unit soil mass basis and show that rates decline with depth, most dramatically between the forest floor and mineral soil ( Why does specific enzyme activity change so little with increasing depth? Factors such as soil texture, moisture, oxygen levels, dissolved organic matter availability, and microbial community composition could all play roles affecting patterns of enzyme activity with depth, and merit further study. We hypothesized that enzyme activity and gross N mineralization rates would be greatest in the youngest site (W4) as a result of priming driven by plant demand for N. However, specific oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme activities at this site typically fell intermediate between the two older sites, and rarely differed significantly among the three sites ( Microbial “mining” of SON has been associated with activity of POX and peroxidase, used to break down lignin and related polyphenolics ( Results from this study demonstrate the often-underappreciated importance of microbial activity and N cycling in deep soils. Soil N cycling rates per unit soil mass decreased with increasing depth, but these decreases were more than compensated by the large size of the subsoil pool to contribute to ecosystem-scale N fluxes. Apparent SON turnover was rapid throughout the soil profile, and gross N cycling rates corresponded most strongly with activities of those enzymes involved in breaking down labile organic matter (NAG, BG, CB), patterns more consistent with microbial turnover and N recycling rather than N mineralization from complex SOM. Belowground plant C inputs might support these processes, and should be measured across soil depths. These observations illustrate how stand-level N budgets that neglect measurements from subsoils will greatly underestimate whole-ecosystem soil N fluxes. Decomposition models that assume that microbial activity slows with depth, or that neglect microbial N recycling, will likely to underestimate the role of soils and soil microbes as sources and sinks for N.
