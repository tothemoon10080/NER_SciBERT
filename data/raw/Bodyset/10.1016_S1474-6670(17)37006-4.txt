Fine powders of minerals are used in the paper and paint industry, and for ceramics. Grinding of minerals for fineness of few micrometers needed in these applications needs a lot of energy and therefore, an optimized control of grinding processes is very important to minimize the energy consumption. A good control system requires suitable simulation model of the process to be controlled. In this study, the suitability of the population balance model for simulation of attrition bead mill and jet mill grinding is tested, and new S-function for modeling of an attrition bead mill and a new C-function for the modeling of a jet mill is presented.
