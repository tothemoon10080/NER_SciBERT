It has been recently reported in the literature that using a fast freezing rate during freeze-drying of drug nanosuspensions is beneficial to preserve the original particle size distribution. All freezing rates studied were obtained by utilizing a custom-made apparatus and were then indirectly related to conventional vial freeze-drying. However, a standard freeze-dryer is only capable of achieving moderate freezing rates in the shelf fluid circulation system. Therefore, it was the purpose of the present study to evaluate the possibility to establish a typical freezing protocol applicable to a standard freeze-drying unit in combination with an adequate choice of cryoprotective excipients and steric stabilizers to preserve the original particle size distribution. Six different drug nanosuspensions containing itraconazole as a drug model were studied using freezeâ€“thaw experiments and a full factorial design to reveal major factors for the stabilization of drug nanosuspensions and the corresponding interactions. In contrast to previous reports, the freezing regime showed no significant influence on preserving the original particle size distribution, suggesting that the concentrations of both the steric stabilizer and the cryoprotective agent are optimized. Moreover, it could be pinpointed that the combined effect of steric stabilizer and cryoprotectant clearly contribute to nanoparticle stability.
