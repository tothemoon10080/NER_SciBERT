Electric arc furnace (EAF) steel slag and serpentinite were tested in columns either alone or mixed with limestone to determine their capacity to remove phosphorus (P) from a solution containing initially 20mg P/L (for 114 days) than 400mg P/L (for 21 days). EAF steel slag was nearly 100% efficient due to specific P adsorption onto metal hydroxides and precipitation of hydroxyapatite. Serpentinite also showed a good performance that decreased with time, adsorption appearing to be the dominant mechanism for P removal. Mixing limestone with these two materials did not improve their performance and in the case of serpentinite, it actually even decreased it. In 114 days of experimentation, serpentinite alone and the mixture of serpentinite and limestone removed 1.0mg P/g while in 180 days of experimentation, EAF steel slag and the mixture of slag and limestone removed an average of 2.2mg P/g, without attaining their maximum P removal potential. The void hydraulic retention time (HRTv) was a key factor for growing hydroxyapatite crystals and had a significant effect on P removal efficiency by EAF steel slag. A temporary increase in HRTv caused by clogging resulted in an increase in EAF steel slag efficiency (from 80% to almost 100%) towards the end of investigation. Results from this study indicate that the use of EAF steel slag in constructed wetlands or filter beds is a promising solution for P removal via adsorption and precipitation mechanisms.With increasing pressure and changes in water discharge legislation since the 1970's, phosphorus (P) has become a pollutant of a concern, due to the eutrophication and deterioration of watercourses if discharged to water bodies in excessive amounts ( It has been established that selection of the most suitable material for P removal is site specific and is dependent upon various factors such as physico-chemical characteristics, P retention capacity, recycling potential, the cost and local availability of the material ( Although batch tests provide good indication of the materials’ capacity to retain P, when making a selection of potential substrates to be used in designing constructed wetlands and/or filters for P removal it is necessary to conduct longer-term column or pilot-scale experiments ( The materials tested in columns were selected as a function of their P removal coefficient (R Serpentinite and EAF slag materials were tested alone or mixed with limestone (2.5–10 The experimental set-up was comprised of 10 columns with five materials or mixtures tested in duplicate: Sp1 and Sp2 (100 Each column consisted of a base, a clear plastic cylinder, a covering plate and one valve connected at each inlet and outlet ends. The inside diameter of each column was between 15.2 Each column was gravity fed from the top with a reservoir filled with a P solution (20 The samples were kept under saturated conditions by positioning the outlet at the height of each column and the effluent was collected in closed buckets to minimise evaporation ( Effluent volume applied to all columns was recorded once a day by weighing and the flow rates were accordingly adjusted to their setpoints. The effluent of each column and the feeding solution were sampled twice a week and analyzed for orthophosphates, using a vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method ( EAF steel slag was rich in Fe and calcium oxides, representing 35% and 30%, respectively ( Magnesium oxides (MgO) constituted 36% of serpentinite ( Ca and Mg were the main constituents of limestone on an oxide basis (29 and 18%, respectively) and they contributed to P removal via both adsorption and precipitation mechanisms. Mg has been shown to have a strong effect on the morphology, crystal perfection, nucleation and growth kinetics of ACPs ( The P removal efficiency by serpentinite (Sp1 and Sp2) and the mixture of serpentinite and limestone (SpL1 and SpL2) as a function of number of pore volumes is presented in The columns filled with serpentinite (Sp1 and Sp2) were very efficient for the first 37 pore volumes (40 days), achieving a P removal efficiency of more than 95% ( Organic matter was not present in the P feeding solution in this experiment and the efficiency and life span of serpentinite material could decrease significantly if applied at field-scale treating an actual effluent ( The P removal rate did not seem much influenced by the HRTv increase caused by clogging after the increase in the feeding solution P concentration (at 53 pore volumes). The columns filled with the mixture of serpentinite and limestone (SpL1 and SpL2) were equally efficient for the first 22 pore volumes (30 days), and then gradually decreased to only 15% ( Addition of limestone to serpentinite in our experiments increased the content of Ca when compared to the Mg content ( EAF steel slag alone or mixed with limestone was nearly 100% efficient for the first 116 pore volumes ( The P removal efficiency of gravel was stable at around 10% at the lower P concentration ( The P removal capacity of a material is an important parameter for practical applications as it enables designers to estimate the longevity of a full-scale system ( The P removal capacity of the materials investigated in this study as a function of pore volumes is presented in Comparing values of P removed should be done cautiously given that both the number of pore volumes passed through each column, and the mass of P added to the materials, were different at the end of the experiment, due to the differences in HRTv ( Presenting P removal efficiency in the form of mass of P removed (mg P/g of material) as a function of the mass of P added to the system (mg P/g of material) provides a useful way of comparing the performance of different materials, as it allows to determine the mass of P that each material can retain ( The fact that no macroscopic precipitation could be visually observed in the columns filled with serpentinite containing materials suggested that adsorption through ligand exchange was the main mechanism responsible for P removal by these materials under the conditions studied. Other elements present in the serpentinite could also affect P retention. Important mechanisms involved in P removal by EAF steel slag are specific adsorption on metal hydroxides and precipitation ( Adding limestone to the EAF steel slag did not significantly improve P removal efficiency, probably because steel slag is already rich in Ca due to lime addition during the steel-making process. In the case of serpentinite, adding limestone even led to a decrease in its P removal efficiency. The difference between columns filled with serpentinite (Sp1) and serpentinite and limestone (SpL1) could be related to the proportion of serpentinite added to each column. For a 1.7 EAF steel slag showed a very high efficiency (nearly 100%) in P removal from an effluent (20 then 400 The financial assistance provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Society for Research and Development in Continental Aquaculture of Quebec (SORDAC) is acknowledged.
