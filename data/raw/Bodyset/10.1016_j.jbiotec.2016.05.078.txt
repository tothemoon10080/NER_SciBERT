Sourdough is a mixture of flour and water that is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts. The sourdough microflora contains metabolically active LAB and yeasts that form this intermediate product for dough preparation. The positive effects of sourdough generally rely on the metabolism of the LAB in sourdough that can be originated from flour and other dough ingredients. The main metabolic activities of sourdough LAB determining importance of sourdough are their proteolytic activity, formation of volatile, antibacterial and antimould compounds as well as their exopolysaccharide (EPS) production characteristics. Recently we have isolated 11 different LAB strains from Turkish sourdough some of which have antibacterial and antifungal roles as well as phytase activity. Importantly all LAB strains exhibited the presence of genes required for EPS production and in the presence of sucrose all strains produced glucan type homopolysaccharides. This study clearly reveals the importance of LAB strains on sourdough biotechnology related to the potential of sourdough in food technology.
