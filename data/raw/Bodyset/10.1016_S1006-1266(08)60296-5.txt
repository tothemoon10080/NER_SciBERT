The optimum conditions for sulfur removal from coal by electrochemical reduction flotation in an aqueous NaCl solution were determined from orthogonal experiments. The effect of electrolytic conditions on the desulfurization ratio was also studied. The electrochemical-reduction processed coal was examined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and wet chemical analysis. The results show that electrochemical reduction converts hydrophobic pyrite in Nantong coal into hydrophilic FeS and S2- and leads to an increase in the concentration of hydroxyl groups and aliphatic moieties and a corresponding decrease in carboxyl and carbonyl groups, which enhances the flotation desulfurization of the coal.
