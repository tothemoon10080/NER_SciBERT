Dr. Matthew O’Keefe, associate professor of metallurgical engineering and a leader of this research says use of Meso-MEMS as switches will mprove reception quality, and save energy. O’Keefe and Dr. James Drewniak are working with Dr. Keryn Lian of Motorola Labs. Over four years the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) have contributed $2.6m towards the research. O’Keefe, Drewniak and researchers s have worked directly with Motorola’s Advanced Technology Center and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio, to develop small RF switches. Meso-MEMS switches work like a light switch, either on or off, unlike current solid state technology, which is on at some level all the time. Advantage to using a switch is as it does turn off, it saves energy. Energy savings are also realised with current MEMS switches made of silicon, but silicon RF MEMS switches are relatively expensive, O’Keefe says. The Motorola /UMR team discovered that alternative polymer and metal materials work just as well as silicon, for a much lower price. In the next phase of the program the researchers will be developing fuel cells to power the wireless devices, providing power for longer than traditional batteries.
