Solvent extraction of hydrochloric acid has been studied from solutions containing 185.42 g/L acid using Alamine 336, Aliquat 336, TBP and Cyanex 923 as extractants. Kerosene was used as the diluent. Extraction of hydrochloric acid increased with the increasing concentration of the extractants. For all the extractants studied, the species extracted into the organic phase appears to be associated with one mole of extractant. For Alamine 336, the McCabe–Thiele construction indicated the possibility of >99.5% HCl extraction in two counter-current stages at A:O=1:4. For Cyanex 923, the McCabe–Thiele construction indicated the quantitative extraction of HCl in four counter-current stages at the A:O=1:5 phase ratio. The acid loaded onto Aliquat 336, TBP and Cyanex 923 could be easily stripped with water. But acid loaded onto Alamine 336 could not be stripped with water. The stripping efficiency was ∼12% with dilute acid and quantitative with 1 N NaOH for acid loaded onto Alamine 336.In hydrometallurgical processes, dissolution of metals by leaching with a suitable acid or acids is quite common. Often, the leach solution is quite acidic and requires neutralization before further treatment for metal extraction. This neutralization process, besides consuming alkali adds more cations/anions to the leach liquor. These cations/anions may play a significant role during metal separating using a solvent extraction technique. So to overcome these problems, attempts can be made to recover the free acids from the leach liquor thereby avoiding neutralization. Studies have been reported on the use of Tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) for the extraction of acid ( Although a considerable amount of work has been reported for the extraction/recovery of different acids using extractants such as TBP, Cyanex 923, tri- After leaching of a typical secondary, the leach liquor contains 185.42 g/L HCl along with different metal ions such as 11.8 g/L Fe, 24.8 g/L Cu, 0.23 g/L Zn, 3.8 g/L Co, 35.2 g/L Ni and 48 g/L SO The commercial solvents Alamine 336 (tri-octyl/decyl amine), Aliquat 336 [(R Desired volumes of the aqueous solution containing acid and the extractants were equilibrated manually in a separating funnel for 5 min (initial experiments on the effect of contact time on acid extraction indicated that 5 min is sufficient to reach equilibrium). After the phase disengagement, the aqueous phase was separated and the acid concentration was estimated volumetrically. The concentration of acid in the organic phase was calculated from the difference between the concentration in the aqueous phase before and after extraction. Also the organic phase was filtered through IPS, stripped and analysed volumetrically. While calculating the organic phase concentration, minor volume change of the organic phase was also taken into consideration. For the extraction of HCl, Alamine 336, Aliquat 336, TBP, and Cyanex 923 were used. The initial concentration of hydrochloric acid was 185.42 g/L. The extraction of hydrochloric acid, studied in the Alamine 336 concentration range of 10 to 100 vol.%, can be expressed in a simplified form of the general formula The equilibrium constant, The extraction studies were carried out at a 1:1 phase ratio and the results obtained were plotted in Having decided to use undiluted Alamine 336 for HCl extraction, the extraction isotherm was obtained to find out the number of stages required at a chosen A:O ratio. The feed solution and undiluted Alamine 336 were contacted at different phase ratios (A:O Various concentrations (10–80 vol.%) of Aliquat 336 were prepared and the extraction of acid from the solution was carried out at the A:O phase ratio of 1:1. The extraction of HCl by Aliquat 336 can be expressed in the same form as described above. The extraction of acid at different concentrations of Aliquat 336 is shown in Single-stage extraction tests were carried out using hydrochloric acid as the aqueous phase and 80% Aliquat 336 as the organic phase at the A:O phase ratios of 1:1, 1: 2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5. The raffinates were analysed and the extraction efficiencies obtained were 11.74, 16.74, 24.18, 28.37 and 33.95% respectively at the above phase ratios. These results indicate that for the quantitative extraction of HCl (185.42 g/L) with 80% Aliqaut 336, the number of stages required will be quite high even at A:O The extraction of HCl was carried out with TBP in the concentration range of 13.66 to 100 vol.%. The A:O ratio was kept constant at 1:1. The time taken for the phase separation was the same for all concentrations of TBP except for the undiluted TBP. The percentage extraction of acid increased from 0.99 to 9.20 with the increase of TBP concentration from 13.66 to 100%. The log [TBP] vs. log Single-stage extraction tests were carried out with 100% TBP at the A:O phase ratios of 1:1, 1: 2, 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5. The raffinates were analysed and the extraction efficiencies obtained were 9.26, 16.27, 20.46, 25.58 and 33.41% respectively at the above phase ratios. Hence like Aliquat 336, the number of stages will be more for the quantitative extraction of HCl. Cyanex 923 of various concentrations (10–100 vol.%) was prepared with kerosene and the extraction of HCl was carried out at a 1:1 phase ratio. The results obtained are given in The extractive power of phosphorus-containing extractants increases with the increase in the number of carbon–phosphorus bonds over the series: phosphates, phosphonates, and phosphine oxide ( The extraction isotherm was obtained to find out the number of stages required at a chosen A:O ratio for the extraction of HCl with Cyanex 923. The feed solution and Cyanex 923 were contacted at different phase ratios (A:O Sufficient quantities of loaded organics (with different solvents) were generated to carry out stripping studies. Stripping of loaded organic was carried out at an equal volume ratio of loaded organic and stripping solutions (water/acid/alkali) in separating funnels. After contacting for 5 min the phases were allowed to disengage. The aqueous phases were separated and analysed. The results obtained are given in Solvent extraction of hydrochloric acid was carried out using Alamine 336, Aliquat 336, TBP and Cyanex 923. For all these solvents, the extraction of HCl increased with the increase of solvent concentration. The log The extraction of HCl with these extractants follows the order Alamine 336 The authors wish to thank the Director, Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar and Dr. R. K.
