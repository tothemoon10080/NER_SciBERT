The hydrophobic flocculation flotation of rutile fines in the presence of styryl phosphonic acid (SPA) was investigated by flotation tests, zeta-potential measurement, optical microscope observation, laser-based particle size analysis, adsorption measurements and DLVO theory. The flotation tests indicated that rutile fines could be flocculated by SPA, and pH, shear force (stirring speed) and stirring time played significant roles in flocculation. The isoelectric point (IEP) and zeta-potential in whole range all moved to negative values as SPA was added according to the results from zeta-potential measurement. It was demonstrated that the primary reason for above was chemical adsorption. The laser-based particle size results showed the particle size at a stirring speed of 1800 r/min and 1000 mg/L SPA was the largest in all experiments. Furthermore, using the optical microscope observation and flotation tests, it was important for flotation of rutile fines to produce the flocculant. In the light of above-mentioned facts, floc flotation of rutile fines could be induced in the form of chemical adsorption by SPA to increase particle size. The data calculated from DLVO theory also indicated that chemical adsorption was the main reason for the formation of flocculant.
