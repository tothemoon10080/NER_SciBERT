In this study, rising and deformation of a single bubble in a viscoelastic fluid obeying the Giesekus model are numerically simulated by a modified version of weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WC-SPH). It is shown that the developed algorithm is robust enough to simulate two-phase flow with large density and viscosity ratios (up to 1000 and 100, respectively) not only in Newtonian cases but also in viscoelastic ones. After quantitative and qualitative verification of the developed code against previously published results, it is applied for simulating the rising bubble in the Giesekus fluid as a realistic model for polymeric solutions. Several simulations are performed to investigate the effects of mobility factor (0

It is found that in contrast to relaxation and polymer concentration parameters which have dramatic effects on the rising bubble, the mobility factor has no significant effect on the rising bubble in high viscous polymeric solution. Also, the cusp trailing edge is postponed by decreasing the domain width.The movement and deformation of gas bubbles in the presence of gravity is encountered in a lot of industrial (e.g. polymer foaming, waste water treatment, mineral processing, etc.) and natural (e.g. blood aeration, volcano eruption, boiling, etc.) processes. It is well-known that the presence of bubbles and their motion could dramatically affect the heat and mass transfer and reaction rates Three distinct phenomena are experimentally observed regarding rising bubble in viscoelastic fluids, including: (I) An apparent cusp is developed at the trailing edge of the bubble (i.e., tear-drop shape) In the recent years, several researchers have focused on the numerical simulation of bubble rising in viscoelastic fluids which could be summarized as follows: Wagner et al. Based on the above literature review, the Giesekus model has not been used before for modeling the viscoelastic effects on the rising bubble problem. It is worth mentioning that the Giesekus model is a realistic model (at least in comparison to simpler models such as convected Jeffrey, Maxwell, and Oldroyd-B model) for polymeric solutions and foams because it is compatible to model variable shear viscosity In this study, numerical simulation of a rising bubble in a viscoelastic fluid obeying Giesekus model as a realistic model for polymer solution is aimed. In addition, the simulations are extended to large density and viscosity ratios. For this purpose, a two-phase weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamic (WC-SPH) is applied. The encouraging reason for selecting SPH is the success of this method in simulating bubble rise in Newtonian fluids In this study, rising of an initially circular bubble in a rectangular vessel filled with viscoelastic fluid is aimed. In isothermal conditions, the well-known continuity and Cauchy equations govern the problem In order to solve these equations, surface tension force and stress tensor must be determined. Herein, surface tension force is evaluated based on continuum surface tension model (CST) which consider surface tension force as divergence of a second order tensor as  It is worth mentioning that the important non-dimensional parameters ruling the problem are In the weakly compressible SPH, the pressure field is evaluated by considering that the fluids are partially compressible and it is feasible to assume an artificial state equation between pressure and density. The most applied artificial state equation in WC-SPH (inspired from Tait state equation In this equation,  In the present work, we have decided to rely on the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method thanks to its flexibility for free-boundary problems with large fragmentation, inherent unsteady paradigm and its simplicity of programming. In a typical SPH algorithm, the physical domain is substituted with some In order to achieve good results in multi-phase flow problems, the original algorithm should be modified The specific volume ( In practice, for time integration a simple predictor–corrector scheme There are several techniques for enforcing wall boundary condition in SPH literature. Herein, the mirror dummy particles technique is used. In this technique, for each near boundary real particle, a dummy particle is placed outside of the domain in the mirror position of the real particle. These dummy particles are contributed in the evaluation of field properties of real particles while their own properties are not evaluated from particle approximation. Instead, their properties are deduced from extrapolation in a way that correct Dirichlet or Neumann condition is imposed on the boundary position. It is notable that these dummy particles are generated at the beginning of each time step and discarded at the end of that time step.  In order to verify the developed code, various published cases regarding the rising bubble in Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids are considered. First, the obtained steady state shapes and ultimate Reynolds numbers for bubble rising in Newtonian liquid is compared with those reported in  The next test case is a rising bubble in a viscoelastic fluid obeying the Oldroyd-B model presented by Damanik et al. Finally, the developed code is assessed by applying a viscoelastic case presented by Pillapakkam and Singh  In this section, the developed code is applied to simulate the bubble shapes during its rise in polymeric solution as a viscoelastic fluid which obeys Giesekus model. The considered domain has a width of Also, as one can see in  In this section, the effects of different parameters including mobility factor, polymer concentration, relaxation time, density ratio, viscosity ratio, and domain width are investigated through several additional simulations. In each set of simulations, one parameter is varied while the others are held constant as base-line simulation. Firstly, the effect of mobility factor of the Giesekus model is investigated by varying Secondly, the effect of polymer concentration is studied by setting  As mentioned before, practical gas–liquid systems have larger density and viscosity ratios. Accordingly, some simulations are performed to show that how rising bubble in the Giesekus liquid is affected by these ratios. In these test cases, the properties of the liquid are held constant while the bubble density and/or viscosity are changed. The center-of-mass velocity of the bubble for several density ratios is depicted in     The mobility factor ( By increasing polymer concentration parameter ( By increasing relaxation time ( An increase in density ratio leads to an increase in the bubble speed. In a wider viscoelastic domain, the bubble rises faster and the trailing cusp edge forms earlier.
