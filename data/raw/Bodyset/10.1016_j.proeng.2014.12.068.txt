Robotic total stations belongs to the most innovative and advanced geodetic instruments used in engineering practice with the performance to maximize productivity and to accomplish requirements concerning to the high angle and distance precision. Robotic Total Station Trimble S8 was used for precise terrestrial measurements of railway track built on ballast-less track construction to diagnose the track behaviour under traffic loading.
