The present study investigates the influence of small amounts of MoSi2 sinter-aid on the densification and high-temperature properties of TiB2. Almost full densification of TiB2 is achievable with 2.5wt.% MoSi2. The hardness of TiB2 decreases with temperature, though the samples retained their maximum hardness of 10.5GPa up to 900°C. A promising outcome of the present research is that the flexural strengths of TiB2 and TiB2–2.5wt.% MoSi2 have been found to increase with temperature (550MPa at 1000°C). We recently reported that MoSi The starting powders for the hot-pressed materials were in-house processed TiB Appropriate amounts of TiB The experimental densities of the samples were measured in water using the Archimedes principle. The crystalline phases in the starting powders and hot-pressed sample were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. The microstructural analysis was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM observations were performed using a 200 The specimens for flexural tests were cut from the hot-pressed disks and machined into bar shapes with dimensions of 3 For measuring hot hardness using a high-temperature microhardness tester (QM-2, Nikon, Japan), samples (5  The XRD analysis of hot-pressed TiB The presence of these phases (Mo Thermodynamic calculations based on the available thermodynamic data reveal that the free energy changes (ΔG°) are –53.67 and –76.17 The effect of temperature on flexural strength of the hot-pressed TiB The fracture strength of TiB At 1000  The hot hardness values of TiB A comparison of the hot hardness properties of TiB The following conclusions can be derived from the present research. (a) The results of hot-pressing experiments confirm that the addition of 2.5 (b) Microhardness measurements as a function of temperature of the TiB (c) High-temperature flexural strength measurements indicate that a high strength of 550
