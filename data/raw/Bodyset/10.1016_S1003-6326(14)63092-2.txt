A technology of one-stage roughing and one-stage scavenging vanadium pre-concentration with shaking table was investigated for improving vanadium grade and decreasing acid consumption minerals content based on the quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electronic microscopy (QEMSCAN). In order to visually illustrate how the vanadium-bearing minerals were separated from system, a loose-stratification model was established with Bagnold shear loose theory and Kelly stratification hypothesis. Through the model, it was inferred that fine fraction and coarse fraction of vanadium-bearing muscovite particles easily became the concentrate in roughing and scavenging stages, respectively. The type of the dominant effect on the loose-stratification was confirmed. In the roughing stage, gravity sedimentation played a leading role in the loose-stratification process. However, in the scavenging stage, shearing dispersion pressure caused by asymmetric motion of table deck took an important part in the loose-stratification process. Finally, the correction of the loose-stratification model was validated by the practical experiment.
