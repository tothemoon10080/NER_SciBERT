A novel method to recover zinc and iron from high iron-bearing zinc calcine by reduction roasting-low acid leaching-magnetic separation was proposed. The effects of roasting and leaching conditions were investigated and their optimum conditions were established. Meanwhile, the mineralogical changes during the processes were characterized by XRD, VSM, SEM and LPSA. The results show the ZnFe2O4 in the calcine was decomposed into ZnO and Fe3O4, and about 92.6% Zn was extracted from the roasted calcine with reporting most of iron as magnetite into the residue. Finally, more than 90% Fe was recovered from the residue by magnetic separation method.Zinc is a vital metal in the world and is mostly produced from zinc sulphide concentrates through the roast-leach-electrowinning process In order to solve this problem, the residue generated from neutral leaching procedure is subjected to hot acid leaching instead of low acid leaching to destroy the ferrite structure and thus improve the zinc leaching rate and reduce the amount of leaching residue Concerns over the problems, such as iron release, energy consumption and environmental pollution, have been brought about by the oxidative roasting procedure, and consequently, direct acid leaching methods In this study, a novel method, i.e., selective reduction roasting with low acid leaching followed by magnetic separation, was proposed to recover zinc and iron simultaneously from high iron-bearing zinc calcine (roasted high iron-bearing zinc sulphide concentrates). The reduction roasting process aims to selectively decompose the zinc ferrite contained in zinc calcine into zinc oxide and magnetite. After roasting, the zinc oxide generated will be extracted selectively by low acid leaching and the magnetite enriched in leaching residue will be able to be recovered using low intensity magnetic separation. The application of this method would simplify the process of zinc production, lower the quantity of leaching residue and reduce the requirement of leaching equipment. In addition, the reduction roasting can be performed taking full advantage of the heat carried by zinc calcine generated in the previous oxidative roasting process. In this paper, the effects of roasting and leaching parameters on the transformation of ZnFe The high iron-bearing zinc calcine used in this study was collected from a zinc hydrometallurgical plant in Inner Mongolia, China. The chemical and phase composition (wt%) of zinc and iron in the iron-bearing zinc calcine are depicted in The schematic diagram of the airtight rotary kiln designed especially for this research was depicted in In the present study, the percentage composition of zinc and iron were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES, IRIS Intrepid II XSP) while the percentage composition of other elements were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Rigaku, ZSX Primus II), and the qualitative and quantitative information about crystalline phases were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, TTR-III) and chemical methods, respectively. The changes of magnetism, morphology and particle size were investigated by Vibration sample magnetometer (VSM, BHV-50HTI), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6490LV) and laser particle size analyzer (LPSA, MICRO-PLUS), respectively. The magnetic susceptibility of sample was determined by using magnetic balance (Ancient Egypt, MB-1A/2A). All of these techniques are carried out in accordance with ISO standard. In addition, the content of soluble zinc of sample was obtained by chemical method, which is described as follow. Initially, 0.5 In order to selectively decompose zinc ferrite to zinc oxide and magnetite, that is, to prevent further reduction of Fe It is can be seen from  As discussed above, the optimum reduction roasting parameters were established as follows: flow rate ratio of CG to CO XRD patterns of the original and roasted zinc calcine at different temperatures are presented in In order to further study the effect of reduction roasting on transformation of zinc ferrite, the magnetic hysteresis loops of the unroasted and roasted calcine were investigated by VSM and the results are shown in The morphological changes of the zinc calcine after the reduction roasting were examined by SEM and the results are given in The roasted zinc calcine obtained under the optimum roasting conditions, containing about 58.7% Zn and 14.1% Fe, was subjected to low acid leaching for selective dissolving zinc in leach solution rejecting iron in the residue and hence achieving the separation of zinc and iron. The effects of acid concentration, liquid/solid ratio ( It can be seen from Based on the above discussion, a satisfactory result, about 92.6% of zinc were extracted with only 12.4% of iron, was obtained from the low acid leaching under at a liquid/solid ratio of 9 The XRD pattern of the residue, obtaining in the leaching process under the optimum conditions, shown in In order to further investigate the leaching residue, the magnetic hysteresis loops of the leaching residue and pure zinc ferrite were given by VSM and the results are shown in The SEM image and particle size distribution of the leaching residue was shown in The magnetic separation was performed on the leaching residue to investigate the possibility of iron recovery using the proposed method. The test results show that about 90.1% of iron was recovered from the residue by a magnetic separation process at 35 The ZnFe The authors would like to acknowledge the
