This chapter presents the dense medium separation, which is applied to the pre-concentration of minerals that is the rejection of gangue prior to grinding for final liberation. It is also known as heavy medium separation or the sink-and-float process. It is also used in coal preparation to produce a commercially graded end-product and clean coal being separated from the heavier shale or high-ash coal. In principle, it is the simplest of all gravity processes and has long been a standard laboratory method for separating minerals of different specific gravity. Heavy liquids of suitable density are used so that the minerals lighter than the liquid float while the minerals denser than the liquid sink. Pre-concentration is most often performed on metalliferous ores that are associated with relatively light country rock. Thus, finely disseminated galena and sphalerite often occur with pyrite as replacement deposits in rocks such as limestone or dolomite. The chapter explains various kinds of denser medium such as liquids, suspensions, and separating vessels. Several types of separating vessel are in use and may be classified into gravitational and centrifugal vessels. The chapter also describes the performances and efficiencies of different types of denser medium separators. The chapter explains the partition curves for an operating dense medium vessel by sampling the sink and float products and performing heavy liquid tests to determine the amount of material in each density fraction. The results of heavy liquid tests on samples of floats and sinks from a vessel separating coal from shale are shown in the chapter.
