As one of the important metallic filter materials, sintered porous monel alloy has been widely used in chemical, nuclear and petrochemical industries because of its extremely high temperature corrosion resistance, high resistance to impact and good weldabilty. In the present paper, porous monel samples were prepared by power metallurgy and the shear test was carried out. The experiment results indicated that the sample has two stages of deformation and failure during the shear test, corresponding to two peak points at the shear stress-strain curve. Before the first peak point appears the porous metal sheet is compressed and extruded. The porous metal sheet is stretched after the first peak point appears. The shear strength of the porous plate decreased with the porosity increases.
