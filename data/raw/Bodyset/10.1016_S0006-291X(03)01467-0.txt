Tooth development was cooperatively regulated by the epithelial ameloblasts and mesenchymal odontoblasts. Ameloblasts secrete enamel matrix, critical for enamel formation. While there are several reports about establishment of immortalized ameloblast-like cells by introducing viral oncogene, we tried to establish a spontaneously immortalized ameloblast-lineage cell line, maintaining the cell type specific character, including the ability to induce in vitro bio-mineralization. The established cell line (ameloblast-lineage cell; ALC) maintained the expression of several ameloblast specific genes (Amelogenin, Tuftelin, and Enamelin) in long-term culture. They formed calcified nodules after the induction by medium switching from SMEM to DMEM, having high-level alkaline-phosphatase activity. The size and number of calcified nodule formation were enhanced by TGF-β treatment. Six weeks after sub-cutaneous implantation of ALC to athymic nude mice, we ectopically observed enamel epithelium like structure formation, chondrogenesis, and calcification. These data indicate that ALC is a useful experimental tool to analyze ameloblast character.Production of enamel matrix by ameloblast in enamel organ epithelium is critical for the formation of enamel, mostly composed of inorganic hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals While the developmental regulation on ameloblast or biochemical nature of enamel matrix was well analyzed in vitro and in vivo, the detailed cellular character of ameloblast is still not clear because of the lack of a method to continuously culture it in vitro. Primary cultured ameloblast was reported to keep differentiated character in vitro, including the expressions of ameloblast specific genes and the potential to form calcified nodules, but have restricted potential of cellular proliferation        To establish enamel epithelial cell line, we referred a method to establish spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte cell lines To investigate the characteristics of ALC, we performed RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Because many epithelial cell maturations are regulated by calcium concentration in vitro We tried to analyze the effect of TGF-β1 treatment on DMEM switched ALC, having inducing activity of up-regulation of extracellular matrix production on many cell types To estimate the tissue forming activity of ALC, we sub-cutaneously transplanted the cultured cells with matrigel into the athymic nude mice. Six weeks after the transplantation, we detected clusters of polarized cells with basolaterally located nuclei with elongated cell shape, the representative characters of ameloblast ( This work was supported in part by a grant for the Research for the Future Program from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, by Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
