Physical waste pretreatment carried out prior to landfilling comprises a series of operations aimed at modifying the physical properties of the waste (size, composition, density, moisture content, etc.) to enhance recovery of material resources, prolong landfill life span, improve landfill operations, and reduce environmental impacts produced by landfill emissions. Physical waste pretreatment processes may include separation and classification, size reduction, baling, and washing. Size separation and classification may significantly modify waste composition and represent a crucial step in general waste management strategies. These procedures also represent an important preliminary step in biological and thermal pretreatment before landfilling. Indeed, separation and classification have already been illustrated and discussed for this purpose when addressing the mechanical biological process concept. This chapter provides an insight into the other aforementioned physical pretreatment options, introducing processes, describing technologies, and discussing landfill performance of the pretreated waste.Physical waste treatment prior to landfilling comprises a series of operations aimed at modifying the physical properties of the waste (size, composition, density, moisture content, etc.) with the following objectives: to increase the possibility of material resource recovery, prolong landfill life span, simplify landfill operations, and reduce environmental impacts produced by landfill emissions. To this regards, physical waste pretreatment processes may include the following: separation and classification, size reduction (shredding, milling, etc.), baling, and washing. Size separation and classification may significantly modify waste composition and represent a crucial step in general waste management strategies. These procedures also represent an important preliminary step in biological and thermal pretreatment before landfilling. Indeed, separation and classification have already been illustrated and discussed in Waste size reduction or shredding is a form of mechanical pretreatment, the main result of which is waste volume reduction. After shredding, the larger fractions (e.g., >50 Several types of size reduction apparatus are used in the pretreatment of municipal solid waste (MSW), including hammer mill and shear shredder ( The power required by a particular shredder is determined by a series of variables: internal configuration of the machine, rotational velocity of hammer tips, in addition to rate, size, composition, and moisture content of the feed. The analysis of data obtained resulted in the development of analytical relationships between comminution parameters, and the development of methods aimed at characterizing shredder performance on the basis of energy consumption and hammer wear associated with size reduction of solid waste. Landfilling of shredded residues may provide the following advantages: Extension of landfill life as a result of the higher achievable compaction, which increases density by 60%–80% ( Shredded wastes are more homogeneous and manageable on side slopes ( Increased specific surface area promoting better contact among waste, nutrients, and microorganisms and, in general, enhancing biological degradation rate. However, below a certain particle size, acid generation may increase, resulting in inhibition of methane production ( In a study carried out to investigate bioreactor landfills, The effect of waste shredding on gas production in a field application has been reported by A cost-benefit analysis performed by The use of shredding as pretreatment for MSW may be combined with treatment steps aimed at recovery of materials prior to landfilling ( The baling technique is a process comprising a series of different operational phases including sizing, arrangement, and compaction with or without wrapping of waste material with net and plastic film ( This technique has been widely used by farmers and the recycling industry, and in recent decades its application in the field of MSW management has become more common both for temporary storage or transportation techniques prior to other treatment process and as an alternative to traditional landfill disposal ( Baling–wrapping of MSW is a common storage technique applied prior to thermal treatment ( Landfills adopting the plastic-wrapping technology include countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Korea, Lebanon, and others ( Bales are particularly advantageous during operations of waste loading and transport. Moreover, landfill operation proves to be less costly, due to the ease of placement of the bales using forklift tractors, and faster, creating fewer emissions such as dust, littering, and odors compared to the use of conventional landfilling methods. In addition, the use of daily cover may be reduced or completely avoided. Two types of presses are used in the treatment of MSW, resulting in the production of different shaped cylindrical and rectangular bales ( During the compression phase varying amounts of liquid, depending on moisture content of the waste, are released, thus diminishing the potential generation of leachate ( A lower degree of compression is achieved with cylindrical than with rectangular bales ( The average achievable waste densities of bales are reported in Bales are generally wrapped using low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) films, tied with plastic or metal strips ( Compared with traditional landfill, the disposal of baled waste implies a reduction of environmental emissions and an increase in operation time of the landfill due to increased waste compaction. Furthermore, the handling of bales allows for a cleaner management and transportation, reducing inflammation hazards, and the need for daily cover soil ( MSW decomposition and associated emissions within bales depend on waste quality and type of bales. Unwrapped bales can be assimilated to an open landfill with compacted waste, whereas the wrapping of bales aims to reduce the decomposition rate and infiltration of water into the waste as in a lined closed landfill (  However, More recently, The temperature inside the bales is generally expected to reflect ambient temperature ( The influence of shredding, waste particle size and waste density, thickness of wrapping layers, and type of wrapping film have also been investigated ( Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration in wastes stored in cylindrical or rectangular bales was evaluated by With regards to costs, the cost model applied by Based on findings reported by The washing of waste was developed with two main aims: to achieve the wet separation of different waste fractions resulting in the recovery of cleaner recyclable materials and to improve the environmental quality of waste (e.g., residual material from thermal pretreatment processes) prior to final landfill disposal ( Waste washing prior to final disposal may represent an effective pretreatment option aimed at reducing the emission potential of specific landfilled waste. Water-soluble compounds are transferred from the solid phase into the liquid phase, from which they will subsequently need to be removed during water treatment. The remaining solid residues are assessed for material recovery and/or safe disposal subsequent to further treatment. Waste washing with water is generally applied to reduce the readily leachable fraction and may not significantly affect the emission potentials associated with mobilization processes occurring at a slower rate from deposited waste ( Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of water washing of residues from thermal treatment plants in reducing the leachable fraction of metals, leachable salts, chlorides, and organic matters before subsequent valorization or landfill disposal ( To define the most appropriate washing procedure, a series of different operative conditions should be taken into account: washing solution, liquid to solid (L/S) ratio, mixing time and speed, washing frequency, temperature, and waste size fraction. A water-washing procedure would be suitable for use in the removal of highly soluble compounds, while washing with different solutions (acid or alkaline solution, chelating agents, organic acids etc.) would be more appropriate to remove less water-soluble The L/S ratio influences the dissolution of compounds in line with their degree of solubility. However, the mixing time may influence the kinetic of compound dissolution. In particular, a lengthy mixing time may reduce the dissolution or extraction rate.  The efficiency of a washing pretreatment step may be evaluated using standard batch leaching test to quantify the improvement of landfill sustainability targets calculated as an index as follows ( Waste washing as a pretreatment method applied to residues from different kinds of waste (residues from plastics sorting process, mechanical–biological treated waste, bottom ash from MSW incineration and automotive shredder residues) showed chemical oxygen demand removal rates of more than 60% for all different kinds of waste, reaching up to 85% for plastic residues. Similar removal rates were observed for dissolved organic carbon. Batch leaching tests verified the significant reduction of metals and anions released. This had been demonstrated by a decrease of electric conductivity in a range from 60% to 78% (  To set up an efficient washing treatment, water consumption should be minimized using a sufficiently high L/S ratio for each washing step but a reducing L/S ratio for the entire process (water volume used per solid mass treated). To achieve this, the same solution can be reused for several washing steps in a countercurrent or a recirculating process implemented by adding freshwater only to maintain the same L/S ratio at each stage ( Furthermore, the use of large amounts of water may contribute toward raising the cost of treatment and increase environmental impacts due to the subsequent need for wastewater treatment. Indeed, washing pretreatment implies a transfer of contaminants from waste to the resulting solution, which will subsequently need to be treated prior to discharge ( Physical treatment of waste before landfilling is an option that can play an important role in modern landfills where the deposit of raw waste is progressively discouraged. In particular, residues resulting from circular economy treatment and recyclables might take advantage of baling in managing (transporting, storing, depositing) waste fractions with low putrescible contents, bulky materials, or small size residues. Washing can guarantee the environmental sustainability by controlling the long-term emissions of soluble inorganic or soluble nonbiodegradable organic compounds.
