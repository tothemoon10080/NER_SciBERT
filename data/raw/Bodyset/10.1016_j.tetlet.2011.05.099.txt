A novel multidentate ligand N,N,N′,N′-tetra(2-ethylhexyl) dithiodiglycolamide DTDGA has been synthesized and studied for its extraction behavior towards various elements present in high level liquid waste (HLW). The extractant showed remarkable extractability and selectivity for palladium vis a vis other metal ions present in HLW. The distribution ratio as well as the separation factor for palladium was found to be the highest reported so far thus making this extractant one of the most promising candidates for effective separation of palladium from HLW.Separation and recovery of palladium from high level liquid waste (HLW) solutions originating from PUREX process of spent nuclear fuel is necessary from the viewpoint of various problems encountered during vitrification In a recent work, we have reported the synthesis of novel ‘S’ donor ligand namely DTDGA was synthesized ( To establish the nature of extracted species, both the chemical (mole ratio method) as well as physical (ESI-MS) approaches were followed.
