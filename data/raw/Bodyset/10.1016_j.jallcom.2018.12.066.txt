Synthesis mechanism of tungsten carbides via mechanically-induced self-propagating reaction (MSR) was investigated. Scheelite (CaWO4) is the main ore of tungsten and was used as precursor of tungsten in this study. To investigate the effect of magnesium and carbon contents on the milling products various mixtures were prepared according to the following equation: CaWO4 +

                      values. CO gas was detected in vial for samples in MSR mode that was due to participation of carbon in reduction reaction of scheelite. Therefore W2C phase was formed because of carbon deficiency. WC was not formed because of high reaction temperature and carbon deficiency.

                     . WC disappeared by addition of more carbon due to decrease of adiabatic temperature and interruption of atomic diffusion.Recent development of nanostructure materials suggest that the nano-structured cemented tungsten carbides can introduce a group of materials with significantly improved mechanical properties [ The synthesis of tungsten carbide by MSR process have been investigated by several researchers. Most of them have used WO Unlike the above mentioned researches, scheelite (CaWO Analytical grade of hydrated sodium tungstate (Na  The target of this research is to investigate the reaction mechanism of scheelite-magnesium-carbon mixtures during mechanical milling based on temperature monitoring. The main method for recognition of the events during the process is to measure the temperature of vial. Thus it is necessary to use a sensitive and accurate temperature data logger, whereas commercial temperature monitoring systems use types of thermocouples that have problems such as delay in signal transmission and low sensing resolution. Therefore the temperature of vial was monitored using a self-designed temperature data logger. DS18B20 digital temperature sensor was used in this data logger. The operating temperature range of this sensor was −55 °C to +125 °C. The resolution of the sensor was set at 0.125 °C. The accuracy of the sensor is about 0.1 °C in the range of 25–40 °C. The system measures and saves the temperature every 375 ms. The detailed information about the accuracy and possible systematic error of sensor has been mentioned in the data sheet [ Two sets of experiments were carried out in the present study. In the first group the effect of magnesium and carbon contents on the reaction mechanism during mechanical milling were studied. Therefore, the equation given below was considered as probable reaction: In the second group of experiments, the effect of carbon content on the reaction was investigated. Accordingly, various mixtures of CaWO For milling experiments, powders were loaded in a 200 ml hardened steel vial. The mass of the samples were kept constant (4.12 g) in all experiments. Three sizes of hardened steel balls (6, 8 and 10 mm) were used in the process with ball to powder ratio of 30:1. The vial:supporting disk rotation velocity ratio was 2:1 and the supporting disk speed was 250 rpm. After interruption of milling, the gases generated during the process, CO/CO2, were evaluated by MQ-7 semiconductor gas sensor. The detailed information about the accuracy and operation mechanism of this sensor has been mentioned in the data sheet [ Samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (EXPLORER GNR analytical instrument group) equipped with a plane monochromator using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 A). Diffraction patterns were acquired using a count time of 1 s per 0.02° step. The obtained diffractograms were matched with ICDD standard cards using X'pert High Score software and the details of the cards are given in It should be mentioned that the thermodynamic calculations are incapable for precise prediction of non-equilibrium processes such as MSR but concerning them can be beneficial to interpret the events. Two groups of reactions can occur in CaWO  The second group of reactions in CaWO The thermodynamic characteristics of these reactions are mentioned in  We have drawn a comparison between the synthesized scheelite and the natural sample that is kept in the University of Arizona Mineral Museum [  According to  There is a secondary temperature raise immediately after ignition peak in samples with MSR reaction. It can be seen also in  It is seen in Carbon needs long and severe milling to participate partially in gradual reactions due to thermodynamical conditions [ As it is mentioned earlier, MSR occurs at The best way for this purpose is the minimization of total Gibbs energy of system. This method determines the combination of As it was mentioned earlier, the adiabatic temperature increases by increasing magnesium content. Thus the formation of metallic tungsten is more preferred thermodynamically at higher WC forms in low temperatures and higher amounts of carbon content according to the According to the XRD patterns and above mentioned events, reaction sequence of scheelite-magnesium-carbon mixtures in the MSR mode include two main steps. The first is reduction of scheelite and the second is formation tungsten carbides. Thus reaction sequence can be explained as below: Then the MSR heat activates the endothermic reduction reaction of scheelite as below: In the next step metallic tungsten reacts with carbon and W Continued milling leads to the gradual conversion of W to W WC was not formed in the first group of experiments due to carbon deficiency and high adiabatic reaction. Accordingly the second group of experiments were carried out on CaWO As it can be seen in the patterns metallic tungsten is completely converted to W According to the XRD patterns WC is appeared in the range of 0.8–1 for the first time. Thus it can be concluded that the formation heat of WC increase the ΔT of ignition at Fabrication of tungsten carbide via mechanically-induced self-propagating reaction (MSR) is the basic idea of this study. This process includes two steps. The first is the synthesis metallic tungsten and the second is formation of tungsten carbides. In the present study an aspect of the second step was investigated. The effect of magnesium and carbon contents on the products of MSR was described. It was seen that the metallic tungsten is more stable at higher temperatures and hence the tungsten peaks were stronger than W2C peaks in samples with higher adiabatic temperature. It was seen that the released heat of exothermic reaction activate the carbothermic reduction of scheelite. On the other hand, calculations showed that formation of WC needs sufficient amount of carbon and low temperature. Thus, due to participation of carbon in reduction of scheelite, WC was not formed. In the second group of experiments, milling of CaWO4 - 3 Mg - (1 + y) C mixtures were investigated. The elimination of carbon deficiency was the aim of these experiments. It was seen that metallic tungsten was converted to W This research was supported by
