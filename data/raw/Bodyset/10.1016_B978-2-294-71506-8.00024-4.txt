The arthroscopically assisted fixation of fresh distal radius fractures (ARIF) is still controversial. However this technique is a real improvement compared to more traditional methods of fixation. It is the best means of checking and fixing the articular displacements. Moreover, arthroscopy allows the diagnosis and immediate treatment of associated ligamentous injuries. The author describes the technique of ARIF and its current results. The current technique and indications of arthroscopically assisted treatment of malunions is also described in the second part of this paper. This surgery is more difficult and the indications are rare since very few papers are published in the literature about this topic.
