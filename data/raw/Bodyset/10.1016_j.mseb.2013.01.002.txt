Coatings of hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanorods onto titanium surfaces were synthesized with the aim to improve coatings’ mechanical properties and adhesion to the substrate. The coatings are consisting of HAP nanorods synthesized in the presence of a cationic fourth generation diaminobutane poly(propylene imine) dendrimer (DAB) bearing 32 amine end groups employing varying calcium: dendrimer ratios and varying hydrothermal treatments. The quality, surface morphology and structure of the coatings were characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive microanalysis. Wear resistance and adhesion properties of the coatings onto titanium substrates were studied through nanoindentation analysis. The experimental conditions, namely the calcium: dendrimer molar ratio and the hydrothermal treatment temperature were carefully selected; thus, it was possible to produce coatings of high hardness and elastic modulus values (ranging between 1–4.5GPa and 40–150GPa, respectively) and/or high wear resistance and plastic deformation values.Bone is a highly specialized composite consisting of hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca Bone implants must possess the same characteristic with bone, in order to be successfully applied. Although HAP has excellent biocompatibility with hard tissues, skin, and muscle tissues, its use is limited to non-load bearing applications due to its poor mechanical properties (low crack resistance) Microstructure control in sintered HAP primarily involves the attainment of fully dense bodies (i.e., elimination of porosity) and refinement of grain sizes. It is well established that the hardness of HAP increases with its density As a consequence, the research efforts now focus on biomimetic approaches for the synthesis of HAP crystals of various morphologies, employing polymers such as monosaccharides Dendrimers exhibit a highly precise architecture In this framework, we reported HAP was synthesized as described in our previous work Ti coupons with different polishing levels were employed for this purpose with the aim to evaluate the effect of substrate's surface roughness and morphology on coatings properties. Mechanical polishing was conducted with different silicon carbide (SiC) metallographic papers ranging between #220 to 1000 The crystal structure of the synthesized samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuK The indentation analysis was performed using a nanomechanical test instrument which allows the application of loads from 1 to 10,000 The crystal structure of samples prepared under the different conditions was investigated by XRD analysis. The final polymer content in the HAP crystals prepared is affected by both the initial Ca The homogeneity degree of the developed coatings was investigated using SEM ( Bioceramics, such as HAP, present brittle and fragile properties; as a result, applied loads of 10–500 Coatings on Ti substrates ground up to 400 The In contrast, among the coatings synthesized at rt, HAPb coating revealed higher However, HAPa and HAPb exhibit the same polymer content and a very fine nanostructure. A possible better crystallization of HAPb with less amorphous phase in its structure due to the higher initial DAB content, which assists nucleation and crystal growth The trend in In general, HAP has an hcp crystal structure revealing different values of Nelea et al. SPM images of the indented areas confirmed the absence of any cracks and fractures around the indents ( Hydroxyapatite (HAP) coatings consisting of HAP nanoparticles synthesized in the presence of a cationic fourth generation diaminobutane poly(propylene imine) dendrimer (DAB) bearing 32 amine end groups under different conditions (i.e., calcium:dendrimer molar ratio and hydrothermal treatment parameters) were developed onto titanium surfaces. The investigation of nanomechanical behavior of coatings revealed that both the grain size and the polymer content of coatings are important parameters affecting hardness (
