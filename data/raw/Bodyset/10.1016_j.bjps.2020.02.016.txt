Surgical treatment of unstable phalangeal fractures can be a challenging task even in experienced hands. Multiple fixation techniques are available for this purpose, including percutaneous pinning with Kirschner wires In order to achieve successful internal fixation, it is crucial to obtain and maintain anatomical reduction until metalwork is secured in place. Direct manipulation of the fracture site with bone reduction forceps is not always enough to achieve this goal, especially in the context of comminution. In this situation, axial distraction of the fracture site can be a helpful manoeuvre by taking advantage of the ligamentotaxis principle, as distracted soft tissues tend to bring skeletal fragments together. This orthopaedic concept is well-known to hand surgeons, being the cornerstone for the use of the Suzuki frame for managing comminuted proximal interphalangeal joint fractures We have addressed this issue by using a temporary Kirschner wire placed distal to the fracture site. For proximal phalangeal fractures we start by marking the exact position of the head of the middle phalanx on the lateral aspect of the affected finger, with the aid of a 25â€¯G hypodermal needle placed subcutaneously Once stability has been achieved by fracture fixation, the distal temporary Kirschner wire can be removed. The operation is then completed by closure of the incisions and protection of the operated site with dressings and appropriate splints. Evidence of traction k-wire insertion can be seen on subsequent X-rays but does not affect the recovery or affect later rehabilitation. There were no external sources of funding for this study.
