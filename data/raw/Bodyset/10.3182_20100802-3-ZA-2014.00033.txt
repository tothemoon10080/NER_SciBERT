Anglo Platinum's control schema for crusher circuits follows a layered approach that includes basic control (regulatory, interlock and sequence control), fuzzy logic, rule-based and model predictive control. This allows for a robust approach to circuit optimization. This paper outlines a typical control schema for a crushing plant, and discusses the benefits that have been achieved over a wide range of fluctuating feed conditions and different equipment availabilities at two industrial installations.
