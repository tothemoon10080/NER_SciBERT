This work presents a novel batch scheduling solution that has been developed for a copper plant. The major characteristics of the copper production process with some specific interdependencies are briefly summarized, the main modeling challenges and some key elements of the resulting mixed-integer optimization problem are presented, followed by a concrete example problem highlighting the benefits of the solution.
