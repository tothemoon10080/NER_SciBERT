An investigation has been conducted in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a Ni-base alloy known commercially as Colmonoy 88, deposited by HVOF spray technique. Fatigue tests were conducted under axial conditions (R
                     =0.1), employing samples of the substrate material in the as-polished condition, after grit blasting with alumina particles and after grit blasting and coating with a deposit of about 250μm thick. The fatigue tests were conducted at maximum stresses in the range of 380–533MPa, depending on the condition of the material. A detailed fractographic analysis of some selected samples tested at different stresses was carried out, aimed mainly at determining the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the deposition of such a coating leads to a fatigue strength debit of the substrate in the range of 10–20% and a similar debit in fatigue limit of ∼11–13%. It has been found that grit blasting is the process responsible for the fatigue strength debit observed in the coated samples. Fatigue cracks have been observed to initiate at the substrate–coating interface and at the free surface of the coating, mainly close to alumina particles embedded on the substrate and sharp notches produced during the process. The fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the coated specimens points out the characteristic heterogeneous nature of the coating, particularly regarding some of its mechanical properties, such as fracture toughness.High velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spray technique is one of the leading technologies that have been proposed as a feasible alternative to the replacement of electrolytic hard chromium (EHC) plating in a number of engineering applications. EHC is widely employed for the improvement of surface properties of parts and components that operate under conditions that require corrosion and wear resistance. Particularly in the aircraft industry such parts include, among others, landing gear cylinders, axel journals and pins, hydraulic actuator rods, pistons and cylinders, shafts and bearing holders of gas turbine engines, gears, arrestor hooks, locators and different wear surfaces. The success of EHC relies on the fact that it is cheap and simple; coatings can be obtained in a wide range of thickness, possess an excellent bond strength and are easily stripped from the substrate. However, in the past few years, significant efforts have been made to substitute EHC due mainly to the numerous environmental hazards involved in its production. Chromium plating baths contain chromic acid solutions, in which the chromium is in the hexavalent state, with hexavalent chromium (hex Cr) and several catalytic anions being known as carcinogenic substances. Also, hex Cr has a level of toxicity greater than arsenic or cadmium and is known to cause a wide variety of medical problems HVOF constitutes a more friendly deposition process from the environmental point of view, which has already been applied successfully for the replacement of EHC by means of other coatings such as WC–17Co, WC–10Co–4Cr and Co–Mo–Cr alloys. Such coatings are characterized by possessing a high density and good adherence to the substrate, while their deposition could be carried out to reach a wide range of coatings thicknesses It widely acknowledged that the substrate fatigue strength debit that arises from EHC plating can be attributed to the presence of high tensile residual stresses and microcracks density already contained within the coating Thus, given the great concern that arises from the effect of thermal spray coatings on the fatigue and corrosion-fatigue behavior of different substrates, in the past few years a number of research studies have been carried out This investigation concluded that such a steel substrate undergoes a substantial decrease in fatigue properties due to the alumina particles that remained embedded at the surface of the material after grit blasting. Such particles are able to act as stress concentrators and promote the initiation of fatigue cracks. However, these researchers also observed that the subsequent coating of the grit blasted substrate with the Colmonoy 88 alloy led to a further reduction in fatigue properties associated with the fracture and partial delamination of the coating from the substrate along the substrate–coating interface, and the reduction in the area of the load-carrying segments of the substrate–coating system during fatigue testing. More recently, Puchi-Cabrera et al. The analysis of the fracture surfaces of the specimens tested in air revealed again that alumina particles present on the surface of the grit blasted samples acted as stress concentrators, inducing the initiation of fatigue cracks at the substrate–coating interface, which explained the reduction in fatigue life. However, under corrosive conditions and low alternating stresses, the presence of the coating provided an effective protection against corrosion-fatigue failures, giving rise to an improvement of the corrosion-fatigue performance of the coated system. On the contrary, at elevated alternating stresses, the coating was observed to delaminate from the substrate, leading to an impairment of the corrosion-fatigue behavior of the coated samples. Thus, the present investigation has been conducted in order to study furthermore the fatigue behavior of the SAE 1045 steel substrate grit blasted with alumina particles prior to HVOF thermal spray coating with Colmonoy 88 alloy, but tested in air under axial conditions ( The present investigation has been carried out employing samples of a SAE 1045 steel, with the following chemical composition (wt.%): 0.46 C, 0.75 Mn, 0.04 P, 0.05 S and Fe bal. This material is commonly employed in the manufacture of machine parts such as shafts, gears, screws, tools, bolts and different components that could undergo friction and wear during operation. The material was provided in the form of rectangular bars of 9 After polishing, the specimens were grit blasted with alumina particles of 1–3 Subsequently, the blasted samples were coated with a deposit of Colmonoy 88 alloy of approximately 250 The particles that constituted the Colmonoy 88 alloy powder had a quasi spherical morphology, with a particle size in the range of 22–62 The static mechanical properties of the investigated materials were evaluated by means of tensile testing employing a computer-controlled servohydraulic machine, Instron 8502, at a crosshead speed of 2 Fatigue tests under cyclic tensile axial loads ( After fatigue testing, a detailed SEM fractographic analysis of some selected grit blasted and coated samples was carried out, aimed at characterizing the failure mechanisms that took place during fatigue testing, in particular the identification of the fatigue crack nucleation sites and the determination of the mechanisms of crack propagation that predominate in these heterogeneous materials. The fractographic analysis of the coated specimens was carried out on samples whose number of cycles to fracture was found to be close to the mean number expected at the lowest and highest maximum applied stress. The study was conducted both on the specimens fracture surfaces and on sections normal to these (cross sections), employing a Phillips SEM coupled with EDS capabilities. The evaluation of the static mechanical properties indicated that the uncoated substrate has a yield stress of ∼ The fatigue properties of the uncoated and coated materials were evaluated at maximum stresses in the range of 385–533 Where The analysis of the above results clearly indicates that after grit blasting and grit blasting and coating the fatigue strength of the substrate is reduced significantly, as can be observed from the location of the Wöhler curves for the latter conditions. The minor differences in the fatigue behavior of the grit blasted material prior and subsequent to coating indicates that the decrease in fatigue strength for both conditions can be attributed essentially to the grit blasting process, as it has been found in previous investigations involving steel substrates  Regarding the fractographic analysis of the coated samples,  The analysis of the sections normal to the fracture surface showed that fatigue cracks are not only initiated at the substrate–coating interface due to the presence of alumina particles, but also could be formed at the free surface of the coating, possibly as a consequence of the marked heterogeneity of such a material. These features are clearly observed in At higher maximum stresses, similar fracture features have been determined as shown in As the maximum stress applied to the material increases, for example to 450 As indicated in the previous section, the Colmonoy 88 deposit tends to delaminate from the substrate at maximum stresses above the yield stress of the steel substrate, which was found to be less than 400 The Wöhler curves presented in An interesting observation revealed by the fractographic analysis is that fatigue cracks are not exclusively formed at the substrate–coating interface, but also at the coating free surface. It has been shown that such cracks are able to propagate through the entire coating thickness, leading to the delamination of the deposit from the substrate and activate other fatigue crack initiation sites such as existing sharp notches on the substrate–coating interface. Whether or not the coating by itself could lead to the observed fatigue strength debit should grit blasting had not occurred prior to coating, could only be determined by conducting similar fatigue experiments employing samples coated subsequent to polishing. However, such a procedure would be meaningless, at least in this substrate–coating system, since the mechanical bonding of the deposit would be significantly compromised due to the lack of substrate roughness. In any case, the comparison of the Wöhler curves for the grit blasted and coated specimens indicates that coating deposition apparently does not lead to a further increase in fatigue debit, above that produced by grit blasting alone. Experiments of this nature have been carried out recently with samples of much softer substrates such as AA6063-T6 aluminum alloy, coated with WC–10Co–4Cr by HVOF, for which, on the contrary, a significant increase in fatigue life has been reported Finally, the fractographic evidence conducted on the coated specimens clearly points out the highly heterogeneous nature of this kind of thermal spray coatings, composed of different regions with distinct mechanical properties, in particularly fracture toughness. Such heterogeneities promote continuous changes in the fatigue crack propagation paths, leading to tortuous irregular propagation patterns, rather than straight paths observed in other coatings of a more homogeneous nature.
