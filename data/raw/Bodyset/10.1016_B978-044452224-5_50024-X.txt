X-ray Photo-electron Spectroscopy was used to characterise chromium passivation layers formed on tinplate during dip and cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation treatments. The passive layers consisted of chromium hydroxides and/or oxides for the CDC and dip treatments respectively with tin oxides below it. No chromium or tin metal was detected in the passive layers. The poorer lacquer adhesion on CDC treated material is probably related to the presence of chromium hydroxides in these passive layers. Standard production tinplate samples were used and surface characterization of the samples were done using X-Ray Photo Electron Spectroscopy (XPS) using a Physical Electronics model 5400, equipped with both an Al/Mg dual x-ray source and an Al monochromator. The instrument was operated at a base pressure < 4Ã—10 The XPS survey analyses of tinplate passivated by dip and CDC treatments in sodium dichromate are shown in The present results confirm that the chromium passivation layer on tinplate is formed by the reduction of soluble chromium (VI) species to insoluble chromium (III) hydroxide and/or oxides, but not chromium metal, during both the dip and CDC treatments.
