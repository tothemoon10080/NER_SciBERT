To reveal the mechanism of chalcopyrite biooxidation at different temperatures, pure chalcopyrite leached by mesophiles (30°C) and moderate thermophiles (48°C) was characterized by synchrotron X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). Solution studies show that elevated temperatures promoted chalcopyrite dissolution. A final copper recovery of 41% was achieved at 48°C, while only 15% at 30°C. Cu K-edge XANES analyses indicated more iron than copper dissolved, leaving on the particle surface CuS

In addition, Fe K-edge XANES indicates no significant amount of jarosite formed at 30°C; however, at 48°C, jarosite precipitation was profoundly accelerated, which accounted for 51% of the iron species in the residue at day 35.With the depletion of high grade copper resources, the exploitation of low grade, complex copper ores becomes increasingly important. In many cases, these ores cannot be processed economically by pyrometallurgy, while biohydrometallurgy provides a potential alternative. Biohydrometallurgy has been successfully applied at commercial scale for secondary copper sulfide recovery. However, for chalcopyrite, the most abundant copper sulfide mineral, the bioleaching rate is still too low. The dissolution mechanism of chalcopyrite during bioleaching needs to be better understood in order to improve bioleaching rate, and for the process to be commercially viable. Chalcopyrite dissolution is a complex process and still is an open question for researchers. Some opine that metals preferentially dissolve into solution, leaving a metal deficient layer of copper sulfide on the top of bulk mineral. This assumption has received some evidence from electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. In electrochemical studies some researchers found non-stoichiometric polysulfide (Cu Another important issue related to CuS X-ray near edge absorption structure (XANES) is a powerful method to study the composition and structure of materials. When the energy of the incoming photons is large enough to excite an electron from a deeper core level, an abrupt rise of the spectra appears. A complicated oscillation appears following that, which is caused by the interference of a spherical wave of outgoing electron and the backscattered wave scattered by neighboring atoms ( In this paper, Cu and Fe A mixed mesophile culture, consisting of High grade chalcopyrite ore used in this study was provided by Mt Lyll, Australia and the mineral was ground to −200 Jarosite was synthesized according to the method of For experiments at 30 Solutions were sampled for microbial count, pH value, metal ion concentration (Fe X-ray absorption spectra were recorded at BL-20B beamline (Australian National Beamline Facility, ANBF) at the Photon Factory, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Japan.
