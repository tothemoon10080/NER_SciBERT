Estimation of a reservoirâ€™s production potential depends on accurate physical and mathematical modeling of natural fracture networks. However, prediction of spatial locations and connectivity of these fracture networks is uncertain due to lack of sufficient data to model them. A stochastic simulation technique has been developed based on Multiple Point Statistics (MPS) using non-gridded training images and flexible spatial templates. The local angle of propagation of fractures are simulated based on the pattern of fractures in the vicinity of the simulation mode. The fracture is propagated in the simulated direction and a new set of simulation nodes are generated. The process is continued until the target fracture lengths are attained. A synthetic case was successfully used for demonstrating the working of the algorithm.
