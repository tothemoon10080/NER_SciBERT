It has been the general practice amongst researchers to use the molar concentration of thiosulfate salts to be the same as that of S2O3
                     2− ions involved in various equilibrium or rate expressions for interpreting gold oxidation kinetics. However, chemical speciation analysis based on the association of thiosulfate ion with monovalent cations (ion-pair formation) shows that the concentration of free S2O3

                     − shows that the rate constant for gold oxidation is 4.2×10−4 mol m−2 s−1.Recent publications by It is generally accepted that the reaction mechanism and rate of a heterogeneous reaction, such as gold dissolution, involves the following steps: diffusion (mass transfer) of reactants to the surface, surface adsorption, chemical reaction at surface, desorption/stabilisation, diffusion of products away from the surface into the bulk solution. Depending on the slowest step the reaction is chemically controlled (step iii or iv) or diffusion controlled (step i or v).  In most fundamental studies the thiosulfate ion concentration in solution [S   The electrochemical oxidation of gold in sodium thiosulfate solutions can be expressed by the following equations, where M Adsorption Anodic oxidation Desorption/stabilisation Assuming a surface coverage of  If Au(S The mechanism described in The ammonium ion also forms an ion-pair NH Association of thiosulfate ion with sodium ion leads to a higher concentration of NaS
