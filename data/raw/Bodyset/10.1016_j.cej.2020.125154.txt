The design and construction of superior electrocatalysts based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have attracted increasing interest. However, COFs typically exhibit low electrocatalytic activity as a result of their poor electrical conductivity. In this study, a highly graphitic nitrogen-doped porous carbon electrocatalyst (GC@COF-NC) is fabricated by utilizing metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived GC@COF core-shell heterostructure as a sacrificial template. Featured with high conductivity, hierarchical porosity (micropores and mesopores), and abundant N doping, the resulting GC@COF-NC heterostructure manifests a high activity for ORR in an alkaline solution with exceptional onset and half-wave potentials, direct four-electron pathway, and good long-term stability. This synthetic strategy is expected to open a new avenue toward the construction of other COF-derived heteroatom-doped graphitic carbon heterostructures with promising potential for electrocatalytic applications.Clean energy conversion technologies, such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells, have been extensively developed owing to their high efficiency and environmental-friendliness Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an emerging class of crystalline porous polymers with fascinating architectures and versatile functions Pyrolysis has been demonstrated as another simple and efficient strategy for the construction of COF-based electrocatalysts Herein, we report a novel strategy for achieving the controlled integration of COF into metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived graphitic carbon (GC) to form a well-defined GC@COF core-shell structure. The thermal conversion of GC@COF produces graphitic nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NC), termed as GC@COF-NC, with high conductivity, hierarchical porosity (micropores and mesopores), and abundant N-doped catalytic edges. We demonstrate that the fabrication of an ideal carbon-based electrocatalyst is possible by combining two strategies: (i) Core: the use of a suitable MOF-derived GC template to form COF nanofibers and further guide the pyrolysis of COF, in particular, the crystalized Co nanoparticles from the GC template play an important role in transforming the COF to COF-derived GC. (ii) Shell: The strong interfacial interaction between COF and MOF-derived GC provides a significant confinement effect that can keep the GC core adjacent to the internal surface of the COF-NC during pyrolysis, allowing for the attainment of uniform hollow micro- or mesoporous structure. The newly-synthesized GC@COF-NC functions as a highly efficient catalyst for ORR with exceptional onset and half-wave potentials, which are comparable or superior to those of benchmark platinum and carbon catalysts. As schematically illustrated in The solvothermal condensation of DAAQ and TFP in The as-synthesized GC@COF was pyrolyzed under N The ratios of ZIF-67 derived GC core to DAAQ-TFP-COF shell have a great influence on the formation of well-defined core-shell GC@COF-NC, and therefore, exert a crucial contribution to the ORR performance. To investigate these effects, the GC@COF-NC samples were prepared at different concentrations of the monomer (0.01, 0.04, and 0.08 mM) followed by pyrolysis at 800 °C, and these hybrid materials are labeled as GC@COF-NC The RDE experiments at various rotating rates were carried out, and the corresponding kinetic parameters were analyzed with the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) equation ( In summary, a graphitic nitrogen-doped porous carbon-based electrocatalyst which combines highly conductive graphitic structure and abundant N-doping has been constructed for the first time by utilizing MOFs-derived graphitic carbon@DAAQ-TFP-COF core-shell hybrid as a sacrificial template. Here, the DAAQ-TFP-COF shell serves a precursor to form the N-doped porous carbon, while the ZIF-67 derived GC core acts a template to generate the graphitic structure. The resulting GC@COF-NC core-shell heterostructure shows a high electrocatalytic performance for ORR with comparable onset (0.923 V The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
