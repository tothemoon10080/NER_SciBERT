An intermetallic titanium aluminide thinfilm was deposited on glass substrates by reactive thermal evaporation. The magnetic field was applied with substrate heating for directional growth of thin films. X-Ray diffraction and microhardness technique using Knoop indentation were used for characterization of the deposited films. The optical properties were measured using optical spectroscopy in the UV-Visible (200nm-700nm) range. The electrical resistivities of the films were measured using two- probe method. A detailed investigation was carried out to examine the effect of various process parameters influencing the properties of the deposited film. A comparative study was done on the growth of Ti-Al on various substrates to extend the application areas of this material. The film cracking - threshold was observed during the time of aging the sample at a temperature of 870Â°C.
