The preparation of palladium (Pd) from a water- and air-stable room-temperature ionic liquid, 1-ethyl- 3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([emim]OTf), was investigated. Cyclic voltammetry was applied in examining the electrochemical behavior of Pd (II) chloride and in identifying the current density for the electrodeposition of Pd. The optimum parameters of Pd electrodeposition were obtained through single-factor experiments. Surface morphology and elemental composition of final products were probed by scanning electron microscopy and energy- disperse spectrometer analyses. The deposition of crystalline Pd metals was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results demonstrated that 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate was a potential electrolytic medium for electrodepositing high-purity Pd at room temperature.
