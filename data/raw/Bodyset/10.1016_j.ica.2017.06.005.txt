Reaction of [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2] with the 2-methyl-acrylic acid 3-trimethoxysilane propyl ester in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N) afforded the neutral 17e ruthenium(III)-carboxylato complex [RuCl2{κ2-O,O-O2CCCH2(CH3)}(PPh3)2] (1) as a result of the break of ester functional group. Interaction of [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2] with 2-chlorobenzoic acid under similar reaction conditions gave the 17e carboxylato ruthenium(III) complex [RuCl2(κ2-O,O-O2CC6H4-2-Cl)(PPh3)2] (2). Treatment of 2 with two equivalent n-BuLi, followed by addition of SO2 and Et3N resulted the cyclometalated 18e ruthenium(II) complex [Et3NH][RuCl(SO2)(κ2-C,O-C6H4-2-CO2)(PPh3)2] (3). When [Et4N]Cl was used instead of SO2 and Et3N, the reaction yielded the cyclometalated 18e ruthenium(II) complex [Et4N]2[RuCl2(κ2-C,O-C6H4-2-CO2)(PPh3)2] (4). Formation mechanisms of complexes 3 and 4 are supposed. The four complexes were spectroscopically characterized and the crystal structures of complexes 1–3 have been established by X-ray crystallography. Molecular orbital calculations of complexes 1–3 are presented by the B3LYP functional methods.The chemistry of the carboxylato-chlorido-phosphine complexes of ruthenium and osmium, as well as their different derivatives, are very rich and complex, of which carboxylato derivatives of these and other platinum-metal complexes have attracted much attention in view of the various structures and extensive chemistry displayed by them [RuCl 2-Methyl-acrylic acid 3-trimethoxysilane propyl ester (87 2-Chloro-benzoic acid (55 To To A summary of crystallographic data and experimental details for [RuCl Geometrical optimizations of complexes As illustrated in The IR spectra of complexes The crystal structures of mononuclear complexes The molecular structure of [RuCl The anion structure of cyclometallated [Et Complexes The energies and compositions of the front linear molecular orbitals for the three complexes When the compositions of HOMO and LUMO in complexes In summary, mononuclear ruthenium(III)-carboxylato complexes [RuCl This project was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
