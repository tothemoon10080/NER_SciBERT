Selective solvent extraction of Ca and Mg was applied to purify Ni from a concentrate sulfate solution ([Ni]=88g/L, [Mg]=3.1g/L, [Ca]=0.5g/L). In the first extraction circuit using D2EHPA as an extractant, 98.6% Ca were extracted (2 stages, [D2EHPA]=0.3M, pH3, 50°C, A/O ratio=1). The co-extracted Ni (~2.8%) was selectively stripped out (99%) from the loaded organic phase with only 2.6% Ca using a dilute H2SO4 solution (2 stages, [H2SO4]=0.038M, 50°C, A/O ratio=1). Over 99% Ca were stripped out from the loaded D2EHPA in one theoretical stage with 2M HCl (O/A ratio=15). The aqueous solution depleted in Ca was subjected to the second extraction circuit using Cyanex 272 as an extractant, where 99% Mg were extracted (3 stages, [Cyanex 272]=0.32M, pH5.7, 50°C, A/O ratio=1). The co-extracted Ni (~6.9%) was recovered (99%) from the loaded organic phase with only 2.1% Mg using a dilute H2SO4 solution (3 stages, [H2SO4]=0.031M, 50°C, A/O ratio=1). Magnesium was stripped out (>99%, 50°C) from the loaded Cyanex 272 in one theoretical stage using 2M H2SO4 or 3M HCl (O/A ratio=20 or 11, respectively). The purified liquor with approximately 80g/L Ni is suitable for electrowinning. The apparent equilibrium constants using real concentrations of metals were obtained.The production of an intermediate Ni-Co concentrate MHP (Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate) is widely used in a downstream processing route to obtain nickel from leaching solutions of laterite ores ( In the Cawse plant (Australia), for instance, MHP is re-leached using ammonia-ammonium carbonate medium ( Alternatively, MHP can be re-leached using H The removal of Ca an Mg was evaluated by In this context, the objective of the present work is to evaluate the purification of NiSO A synthetic solution was prepared to simulate a typical MHP re-leach sulfate liquor after the removal of Cu ( Cyanex 272 (Cytec Canada, 85% purity), D2EHPA (Baysolvex-Lanxess, 95% purity) and Exxsol D80 (ExxonMobil, aliphatic kerosene, aromatic content ≤ The solvent extraction tests were carried out using a glass reactor of 1 Samples of the aqueous phase were analyzed by atomic absorption (GBC, model XplorAA Dual) to assess the metal species concentrations. In the organic phase, metal concentration was determined by mass balance. X-ray diffraction analysis (Panalytical Empyrean, model PW1710) was performed to identify the crystalline phases that formed in the organic crud at specific operating conditions. The loaded organic solution was filtered and the retained crud dried at 60 The simultaneous extraction of Ca, Mg, and Ni using D2EHPA (0.3  The crowding out effect verified on the Ca extraction due to the presence of Ni is a transient behavior that is similar to a scrubbing operation. It was verified by Tests with 0.6 D2EHPA loaded with Ca, Mg and Ni as well as the separation factors βCa/Ni and βCa/Mg at a pH range of 2–6 are shown in The isotherm of Ca extraction with D2EHPA was evaluated at varying A/O ratios (10:1, 5:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1 and 1:3) by placing the sulfuric synthetic liquor in contact with 0.3 The real moles of D2EHPA involved in the extraction of Ca, Mg and Ni from the studied sulfuric liquor were assessed, as the apparent equilibrium constants, by using the data fitting procedure given by real metal concentration in multicomponent aqueous solution; simultaneous co-extraction of different metals, which may influence the metal transfer to the organic phase; formation of metal-extractant complexes and adducts; ionization of some molecules of extractant and diluent; intermediate complexes (other metal ions) are not extractable; equilibrium reaction of metal extraction by cathionic extractant given by Eq. M all metallic species in the aqueous solution (Ca, Mg, and Ni); RH D2EHPA in the organic solution; n number of moles; MR Based on the Eq. and the equilibrium concentrations of the extractant were obtained as: As shown in Based on the low extraction of Ni at pH After the selective recovery of Ni, the stripping of Ca (0.481 The raffinate from the Ca extraction circuit contains approximately 86 Crud was generated at pH According to The isotherm of Mg extraction was evaluated at varying A/O ratios (10:1, 5:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5) by placing the sulfuric synthetic liquor in contact with 0.32 The real moles of Cyanex 272 involved in the extraction of Mg and Ni from the sulfuric synthetic liquor, as well as the apparent equilibrium constants, were determined according to the data fitting procedure given by Since < The stripping of Mg (2.389 In the present work, the performance of D2EHPA and Cyanex 272 extractants was assessed to selectively extract Ca and Mg aiming to purify a concentrated NiSO D2EHPA was selected to extract Ca and Cyanex 272 to extract Mg. Ni was rejected in the raffinate by both extractants. In the Ca extraction circuit, approximately 70% Ca were extracted by 0.3 Ca extraction with D2EHPA was not affected by the crowding out effect of Ni at pH The co-extracted Ni in the loaded D2EHPA solution was selectively stripped (99%) using an H After Ca removal, the raffinate was subjected to the Mg extraction circuit, where 73% Mg was extracted by Cyanex 272 (0.32 The Ni co-extracted by Cyanex 272 was selectively stripped out (99%) with only 2% Mg using [H The apparent equilibrium constants of Ca, Mg and Ni extractions with D2EHPA and Cyanex 272 using real concentrations of metals were obtained for the conditions studied.
