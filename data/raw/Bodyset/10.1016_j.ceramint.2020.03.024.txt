This study investigates the strength progression of calcium aluminate cement (CAC)-bonded castables with a CAC content ranging from 2 to 16 wt% in the temperatures between 300 and 1000 °C. Focusing on the phase changes and microstructure evolution of the hydrates due to heating, we discovered that castables with higher CAC contents have increased strengths between 300 and 800 °C because the morphology and structure of the dehydrated C3AH6 and AH3 remain similar. At 1000 °C, a higher strength of the 16 wt% CAC castable results from the higher degree of coalescence/sintering between the particles formed from the decomposition products of CAC hydrates. The CAC-bonded castables were prepared using tabular alumina aggregates and α-Al2O3 micro-powder as starting materials, and CAC as the binder. The phase compositions and the microstructures of the castable matrices were characterised by X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively.Calcium aluminate cement (CAC) has been widely used as a hydraulic binder to prepare the refractory castable linings of high-temperature vessels for various applications [ Different hydrates of CAH In a previous analysis [ The above-mentioned two-step decrease in the mechanical strength of CAC-bonded corundum-based castables was assessed by examining the changes in the phase composition and morphology/structure of the hydrates in a castables with 5 wt% CAC [ The formulations of the CAC-bonded castables tested in this study are shown in The mixtures were dry-mixed for 1 min, and then wet-mixed for 3 min with a water-to-solid ratio of 0.044:1. The homogenised castable blends were cast in 40 mm The apparent porosity (AP) and bulk density (BD) of the castable samples were measured according to the Archimedes method. The cold crushing strength (CCS) and cold modulus of rupture (CMOR) of the fired castable bars were measured based on the GB/T 5702-2008 and GB/T 3001-2007 standards, respectively. Each measurement was repeated three times, and the results reported are the average of three measurements. Furthermore, sample matrices with different ratios of CAC and α-Al As expected, both the CCS and CMOR of the castables continuously increase with the increase in CAC content after drying at 110 °C for 24 h ( As shown in It would be expected that a higher amount, and in turn, a higher dehydration rate, of C  As shown in  However, C16 with 16 wt% CAC have a much higher MOR (23.4 MPa) and CCS (145.6 MPa) than C02 with 2 wt% CAC (MOR = 4.4 MPa and CCS = 37.3 MPa) after firing at 800 °C ( It is seen in C16 samples with 16% CAC have a much higher average MOR (25.7 MPa) and CCS (160.5 MPa) than C02 with 2% CAC (MOR = 10.4 MPa ( This work demonstrates that the strength of CAC-bonded castables increases when the CAC content increases from 2 to 16 wt%, and shows variable trends going from 300 °C to 1000 °C. Higher CAC contents endow the castables with higher strengths after heating at 300, 600, and 800 °C, because the morphology and structure of the network formed by C There are no conflicts of interest to declare.
