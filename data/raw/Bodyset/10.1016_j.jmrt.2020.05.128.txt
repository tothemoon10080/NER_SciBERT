Brazil has the second largest rare earths mineral (REM) resource in the world, mainly associated with the weathered portion of carbonatite complexes. This paper reports process mineralogy studies performed for 10 samples collected from the deeply weathered portion of different relevant Brazilian deposits, having a soil appearance and varied grain sizes with a significant content of natural fines (below 20μm). The results indicate that REM are mainly composed of light rare earth elements and present a fine-grained nature and intricate associations with gangue minerals. Monazite is by far the most relevant REM; cerianite and bastnaesite are typical of only one of the studied deposits. The complexity of the occurrence of the rare earths challenges the development of mineral processing routes. A scandium phosphate mineral identified as a trace in one of the studied deposits has not yet been reported in the Brazilian alkaline complexes.Considerable attention has been paid to rare earth mineral (REM) resources over the last decade. The demand for rare earth elements (REEs: lanthanides – La to Lu, scandium – Sc, and yttrium – Y) in high technology applications has increased, and because China accounts for about 70% of world production The policies of the Brazilian government have encouraged the exploration of new REE projects under the 2030 National Mining Plan for strategic minerals. Financial support is provided for R&D in the entire REE production chain to overcome technological issues in exploiting Brazilian REE resources Brazil was the major producer of REEs from the late 19th until the early 20th century, from the monazite-rich sand deposits of the Bahia State coast Process mineralogy studies applied to REE mineralization in the Brazilian carbonatites are poorly documented in the literature. Tassinari et al. This study reports the chemical and mineralogical features of REMs from a set of 10 samples from the four major Brazilian occurrences of rare earths as well as the implications for mineral processing. The purpose of the paper is to contribute to current knowledge by providing a detailed characterization of REM occurrences and associations to face physical concentration or even hydrometallurgical extractions which may be a possible alternative for processing these resources. The study was carried out in 10 representative samples from four major Brazilian alkaline carbonatite deposits – Barreiro, Salitre, Morro do Ferro, and Catalão – located in the States of Minas Gerais and Goiás. Samples were identified as deposit A (five samples, A1 to A5, collected in different and representative areas of the deposit), B (two samples, B1 and B2), C (one sample, C1), and D (two samples, D1 and D2), respectively. Samples were collected from the deeply weathered areas of the carbonatites, having a soil appearance and varied grain sizes with a significant content of natural fines (below 0.020 homogenization and sampling of the bulk sample; initial sieve size analysis by wet screening with screen apertures of 0.30, 0.074, and 0.020 chemical analyses of the bulk sample and all size fractions by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES); identification of the major mineral associations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and definition of the comminution size (P95–95% w/w passing through) based on the mineral grain sizes and their associations; selected samples (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, D1, D2) were ground below 0.30 or 0.125 all samples were submitted to another sieve size analysis by wet screening (screen apertures of 0.30, 0.15, 0.074, and 0.020 The REEs in bulk samples were quantified by ICP-OES (Horiba Ultima Expert) after performing the four-acid digestion method. Loss on ignition (LOI) was performed by sample calcination in a muffle furnace at 1050 Mineralogical analysis was performed by XRD using the powder method with Cukα radiation (D8 Endeavor diffractometer, from Bruker AXS), and the mineral quantification utilized the Rietveld refinement method (using Topas software and database). The modal mineralogy, elemental distribution of the main oxides in the bearing minerals, and mineral associations by area and perimeter of contact were determined by sieve fraction, with an automated image analysis system (MLA software, FEI) coupled with an FEI Quanta 650 FEG SEM coupled to an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS–Esprit, Bruker Nano Analytics). This technique is considered very robust and has been widely used in the mining industry for quantitative mineralogical studies including studies of REE resources The chemical composition of bulk samples [highlighting the sum of the rare earth oxides (REOs)] as well as the mass and REO distributions by sieve fraction is presented in The REO content ranges from 1.27 to 6.45 The sieve size classification indicates significant weight proportions of particles below 20 The mineralogical composition of samples is represented in The mineral assemblage is composed of Fe-oxy-hydroxides (goethite, hematite, and rarely magnetite), Al-phosphates (plumbogummite-group minerals), fluorapatite, quartz, kaolinite, gibbsite, micaceous minerals (biotite, phlogopite, vermiculite, and interlayered clay minerals), ilmenite, anatase, and perovskite. The typical REMs include monazite [(REE)PO Regarding the REEs (  The REO distribution in Therefore, a considerable portion of the REOs are associated with other minerals beyond the typical carriers. This is attributed to the deposit's genetic formation processes, when different minerals incorporate REEs during the supergenic evolution Depending on the size of these associations and the pixel size in the image analysis by MLA/SEM (REE-bearing minerals versus host minerals), it is sometimes impossible to perform a proper mineral classification considering workable resolution criteria The reliability of the reported data was verified considering the reconciliation of the chemical results assayed by XRF against those calculated by MLA based on modal mineralogy ( A summary of the chemical composition of REMs obtained by the microanalysis system (SEM-EDS) is shown in The compositional variability of bastnaesite is reflected in the cerium and lanthanum concentrations; thorium is usually present in higher proportions than in monazite, while yttrium occurs rarely, as a trace. Cerianite is composed essentially of cerium, showing varieties rich in thorium or iron (maximum of 10 The main chemical and physical features observed by SEM/EDS/MLA for the typical REE-bearing minerals are illustrated in terms of morphology ( The typical associations of REMs and their aggregates reach an average degree of liberation of around 50 The degree of liberation by area increases gradually toward the fines, occurring incompletely even at very fine-grained stages due to intergrowths with other minerals The degree of liberation by perimeter of contact is slightly lower than that by area due to the tendency of the gangue minerals to concentrate at the border of locked particles ( The studied deposits show particularities in terms of chemical and modal mineralogical composition typically related to the genetic and lateritic differentiations of Brazilian alkaline–carbonatite complexes. However, the 10 studied samples show the complexity of REO occurrence and mineral associations with the gangue. Relevant features observed for the REMs are:     The low degree of liberation and occurrence in ultrafine-grained REE-bearing minerals are a challenge for the development of mineral processing routes since existing technologies are limited for those features. The energy for grinding of this fraction could be evaluated as well as magnetic separation of the Fe-oxy-hydroxides followed by flotation could be assessed, and a balance between energy for milling and recovery must be set. Otherwise, the chemical process must consider a pre-concentration to reduce the content of gangue minerals, such as Al-phosphates, Fe-oxy-hydroxides, Ti-minerals, mica, BaMn-oxy-hydroxides, and quartz, depending on the deposits (the main associations with the REMs). Due to the complexity of REM occurrence and its relevance of resources, a multidisciplinary approach must be carried out to develop an integrated solution involving physical, chemical, and eventually biological methods, considering the costs, recovery, and other impacts.
