Platinum recovery from secondary sources such as end-of-life polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFCs) via electrowinning and chemical dissolution in deoxygenated 4M potassium iodide with varying added iodine content was investigated. Previous research in this field has shown that complete platinum recovery from model systems is possible, but further study was necessary to determine the process viability with Pt containing devices. The work presented here investigated the leach rate of platinum black deposited on an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) as well as the effective recovery of Pt from untested and end-of-life polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Platinum black dissolution rates were found to be dependent on added iodine content, with higher concentrations accelerating the reaction. Platinum recovery from leached materials, as determined by aqua regia digestion, was found to be 98.7% and 96.7% for untested and end-of-life PEMFCs, respectively. Results indicate that higher iodine concentrations continuously improved recovery efficiency, but increasing iodine concentration above 5mM resulted in comparatively minor improvements.Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which generate current capable of performing useful work in an external electrical circuit by separating two half cell reactions with an electrolyte. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which oxidize hydrogen to water, are of particular interest due to their characteristically high current density and consequent suitability for application in automotive power. Currently the majority of these devices use platinum nanoparticles as the principal catalyst, and with a typical PEMFC automotive stack consisting of greater than a hundred individual cell estimates which state that 34% of the total stack cost in 2010 was directly due to platinum content ( Recovery processes can typically be classified in three different ways: selective chlorination or gas phase volatization, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical ( Pyrometallurgical processes operate at temperatures between 1500 and 1700 Most hydrometallurgical methods reported require extremely aggressive conditions immersing the spent material in highly acidic and oxidising chloride containing media such as aqua regia ( A less studied, but highly promising alternative to both aqua regia and cyanide extraction is the use of iodine to complex PGMs. Zanjani and Baghalla investigated platinum extraction in acidified 0.12–0.48 Platinum black electrodes were produced using 1-inch platinum quartz monitor crystals (Inficon 149240-1) as the substrate using a method adapted from literature ( Hydrogen adsorption was used to determine the active surface of the platinum black electrode, and the method described here is adapted from the referred text ( Potassium iodide (ReagentPlus®) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich, and was used to produce 0.15 To understand further the kinetics of the Pt dissolution at applied potentials the dissolution rate of Pt black at varying potentials in 4 PEMFCs were provided by a fuel cell manufacturer as both untested and EOL samples. These materials were cut into strips measuring approximately 0.5 A final digestion phase in extremely aggressive conditions was used to determine any residual Pt left on the iodide leached materials. As stated previously aqua regia digestion is a well-documented and established method for PGM recovery, and was viewed as the most reliable method for accurately determining residual platinum content in the PEMFC materials. Aqua regia was prepared prior to each digestion by combining 37 XPS measurements were conducted at the NEXUS facility located at Newcastle University, and were performed using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha XPS. The instrument produced X-rays with an energy of 1486.6  The complete oxidation of Pt metal to Pt The cyclic voltammogram and associated mass losses for a platinum black electrode in 4 As stated previously the effect of iodine concentration on Pt dissolution was also investigated. The initial surface areas of the platinum black electrodes as well as the total mass removed during each experiment is shown in In order to separate the relative effects of both electrode surface area and iodine concentration it was necessary to calculate a molar flux, ν Using these values it is possible to calculate the dissolution of Pt from the electrode over time, the results of which can be seen in Finally, it remains that despite accounting for surface area, the tabulated molar flux grows drastically from 10  Whilst the cycled materials exhibit the same trends as the untested samples, dissolved Pt content rises at a much slower rate for the cycled samples, achieving near complete dissolution after 60  XPS analysis of the samples shows that the materials go through significant chemical changes during both cycling and leaching protocols. Survey scans for the control samples can be seen in Platinum recovery from target substrates was shown to be feasible using 4 Due to confidentiality agreements with research collaborators, supporting data can only be made available to bona fide researchers subject to a non-disclosure agreement.
