Nowadays polymeric composite materials are widely used in the shipbuilding industry. Fillers from milled fibers of carbon fabrics, graflons, reinforce these polymeric composite materials. The study ivestigates the anti-friction properties, friction coefficient, and wear resistance of graflon exposed a wide range of loads while rubbing on steel 12H18N12T and titanium in seawater. The construction of the test bench (stand) and the research method have been described. It is possible to change the reciprocation speed during the tests from 0.02 to 0.5 m/s. The pressure on the friction surface can be adjusted in the range from 0.2 to 20 MPa depending on the weight of loads and dimensions of samples. The experimental dependences of friction coefficient and wear intensity under friction in the seawater and in the artificial seawater with impurities have been obtained.
