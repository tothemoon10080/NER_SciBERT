The laboratory investigation about short chain alcohol effect on flotation performance of quartz using N-dodecyl ethylenediamine (ND) as collector was carried out through flotation tests, zeta-potential measurements, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies. Experimental results showed that the addition of short chain alcohol could improve flotation performance of ND effectively, resulting in a higher flotation recovery of quartz. Maximum flotation recovery of quartz was obtained when the mass ratio of ND and alcohol was 1:1. More importantly, chain structure of alcohol played an important role in quartz flotation. Longer hydrocarbon chain and more substituents of alcohol usually related to higher flotation recovery. Zeta-potential measurement and FTIR spectroscopy study demonstrated the co-adsorption of diamine and alcohol on quartz surface, of which hydrogen bonding and electrostatic adsorptions between collector and quartz surface were strengthened by the addition of alcohol. Furthermore, higher cross-sectional area of alcohol usually related to stronger hydrogen bonding and electrostatic affinity. Therefore, higher flotation recovery of quartz was obtained.
