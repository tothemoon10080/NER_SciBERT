Mechanochemical synthesis of hafnium nitride ceramic powder was accomplished through direct nitridation of hafnium particles in nitrogen atmosphere during high-energy milling in a planetary ball mill. The nitrogen content was measured and evaluated to determine the reaction kinetics for hafnium – nitrogen across a range of treatment durations. The observed reaction rates are notably faster than for conventional thermal treatment, and, for hafnium treated for 5 min in the ball mill, the onset of nitridation begins at a temperature 200 °C lower than for the initial hafnium metal. The crystal structure and microstructure transformations were also investigated. A mechanism for the rapid hafnium nitridation occurring under high-energy ball milling conditions is proposed and discussed. Based on this proposed mechanism of metal nitridation via ball mill treatment in nitrogen atmosphere, we may suggest this process as an effective method for fabrication of fine (sub-micron) hafnium nitride powder from relatively large (10–100 μm) initial metal particles.Mechanochemical synthesis (MS) is a simple, fast, and controllable method for producing various materials [ Mechanical synthesis can be conducted in a reactive atmosphere, and through the application of different gas reagents in the milling volume has been used to fabricate oxides [ Hafnium nitride is of particular interest due to its melting point (3290 It is well recognized that in order to fabricate materials with desired properties, one must be able to control the MS process, which can only be accomplished through fundamental knowledge of the interaction mechanism of chemical species, as well as the reaction kinetics. There are few studies of the mechanism and the kinetics of hafnium nitride formation during mechanical treatment [ In this paper, we report mechanochemical synthesis of hafnium nitride powder through direct nitridation of hafnium particles in nitrogen atmosphere during high-energy milling in a planetary ball mill. The amount of reacted nitrogen at different stages was measured through chemical analysis, as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The crystal structures present in the material were characterized via synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction. Microstructure evolution was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was shown that such MS conditions result in extremely rapid reaction rates, with the total milling-time required for complete reaction at less than an hour. A comparison of the obtained MS kinetics is made to those from conventional thermal treatment. Based on these observations, a mechanism that explains the relatively rapid nitridation of hafnium during high-energy treatment in a planetary ball mill is proposed and discussed.        XRD patterns obtained from powders after different milling times are presented in The weight fraction of HfN in the resulting phase mixture, at various reaction stages, was obtained from Rietveld refinement and is presented in The quantitative discrepancy in nitrogen content obtained from chemical analysis and from XRD data should be noted. Extensive peak broadening due to the decreased particle size and microstrain complicates Rietveld refinement and reduces the accuracy of the quantitative phase analysis results. While the absolute values differ, the general trends are the same and do not impact the conclusions of this work. In subsequent analyses of the nitridation kinetics, we applied data obtained from chemical analysis. The morphology of the powders after different milling times are shown in Typical cross-sections of the powders obtained after different milling time are presented in Under the investigated conditions, relatively rapid nitridation of hafnium during HEBM is observed. During the first stage (0–15 min) the reaction rate gradually increases, followed by a decrease ( It is well known that the rate of solid-gas reactions may either be controlled by the rate of species transport to the reaction site or by the rate of reaction at the active site. In the latter case, the rate of reaction can be generally described by: Hancock and Sharp [ However, it was proposed [ In the above context, it is important to compare results obtained in this work and that for hafnium nitridation in an oscillatory mill [ Typically, metal nitrides are prepared using a nitriding reaction that primarily occurs by means of solid diffusion of nitrogen through the formed metal nitride layer. As a result, high furnace temperatures are required for reaction to complete within a reasonable time range. However, in our case, due to the process of mechanical treatment, fresh metal surfaces are continuously being made available for the uninhibited interaction of metal with gas, which explains the observed rapid kinetics. In other words, our process has shifted the reaction mechanism from a solid-state diffusion limited process to an adsorption/reaction limited process. These fresh surfaces with an increased concentration of reaction sites may appear as a result of (i) an increase in the specific surface area of the powder particles, and (ii) through the removal of contamination and product layers from existing surfaces, as has been previously demonstrated to occur for some brittle powders [ The mechanical action of vibrational milling is applied mostly through mechanical impacts, because there was only one steel ball (12 mm in diameter) in the reactive vessel [ The other interesting aspect is a comparison of the observed nitridation rates during HEBM with those measured under heat treatment at different temperatures. There are two modes of reaction typically observed during HEBM. The first mode is progressive since the product phase gradually forms for increased milling times. Such behavior has been observed for Si–C, B–C, and TiN–B mixtures [ By adjusting the milling conditions, such as milling intensity, ball to powder ratio, milling media size or shape, the degree of active cooling, and the addition of process control agents, the critical milling time can be varied from minutes to hours or vice versa. It appears that, under the investigated conditions, hafnium reacts with nitrogen in the progressive reactive mode (without thermal explosion). Therefore, it is more suitable to compare the obtained results to those from direct nitridation of Hf in a N The precise temperatures at the points of reaction in the milling jar are not known. However, it can be assumed that during continuous HEBM conditions some stationary temperature field exists in the vicinity of the contacts between the particles and the balls, where, as we believe, nitridation takes place. Currently there are no methods that allow measurement of local temperatures at the points of contact between the particles and the balls. Indirect approaches, such as thermocouples measurements immediately after milling was stopped [ The discussion above suggests that some additional factors should be accounted for to explain the rapid nitridation occurring during the HEBM process. The observed transformation of the microstructure of the powder suggests that reaction acceleration is related to the formation of new fresh surfaces during HEBM. It is well recognized that during energetic mechanical treatment the powder is subjected to severe plastic deformation producing work hardening, which makes materials more brittle and thus more easily fractured. Notably, the newly formed surfaces are oxygen free. When HEBM takes place in a reactive atmosphere, the clean surfaces favorably enhance gas absorption and the subsequent reactions. As a result, the gas–solid reaction occurs at a higher rate for much lower temperatures than are typically required. For example, as was previously shown, if the surface of the metal (e.g. Ti) particle is sufficiently clean, nitridation takes place at an appreciable rate even at room temperature [ To check this hypothesis several additional experiments were made. Recalling that 5 min of HEBM does not lead to a noticeable change in the average metal particles size ( At the next stage, comparison is made between the nitridation rate for the initial Hf particles and those after 5 min of HEBM in nitrogen, by running conventional TGA/DTA analysis with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in nitrogen flow. It was demonstrated that an appreciable nitridation rate for mechanically treated powders is detected at a significantly lower temperature (~450 °C) than that for the initial Hf powder (~700 °C), and that it also proceeds to a higher degree of conversion ( The results discussed above lead to the conclusion that the structural transformations that take place within the planetary ball mill significantly enhances the reactivity of the powder during the first stage of the milling process. Therefore, we may suggest a specific mechanism of nitridation under HEBM conditions, which leads to the formation of sub-micron HfN powder with the relatively high specific surface area of 1 m Based on the proposed mechanism for metal nitridation via HEBM in nitrogen atmosphere, we may suggest this process as an effective method for fabrication of fine (sub-micron) hafnium nitride powder from relatively large (10–100 μm) initial metal particles. The primary optimization parameter is milling time, which defines the consumption of energy, as well as the amount of impurities in the produced powders. The milling time required for complete conversion of the metal to metal nitride can be decreased by increasing nitrogen pressure inside the jar, which leads to enhanced reaction kinetics. Future studies may include other optimization parameters such as the K value, the ratio of milling balls to powder, as well as the use of additives capable of increasing the brittleness of the metal particles. This approach may also be suggested for fabrication of other nitride powders such as TiN, ZrN, NbN, and TaN.
