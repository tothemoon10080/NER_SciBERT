Complex instability of the elbow, also known as fracture dislocation of the elbow, is one of the most challenging injuries of the musculoskeletal system. A clear understanding of the biomechanics of the joint with special focus on the relative contributions of the articular components and the ligamentous constraints is critical to the proper management of these injuries. The accurate recognition and implications of associated injuries offers a rationale for approaching these difficult problems by appropriately addressing the elements of the trauma. Further, doing so in a timely fashion enhances the outcome. Currently, even the most devastating of injuries are felt to have a more favourable prognosis than was present in the past if the principles contained herein are followed.
