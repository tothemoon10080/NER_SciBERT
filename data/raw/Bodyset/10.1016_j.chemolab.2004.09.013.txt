The Theory of Sampling (TOS) provides a description of all errors involved in sampling of heterogeneous materials as well as all necessary tools for their evaluation, elimination and/or minimization. This tutorial elaborates on—and illustrates—selected central aspects of TOS. The theoretical aspects are illustrated with many practical examples of TOS at work in typical scenarios, presented to yield a general overview. TOS provides a full scientific definition of the concept of sampling correctness, an attribute of the sampling process that must never be compromised. For this purpose the Fundamental Sampling Principle (FSP) also receives special attention. TOS provides the first complete scientific definition of sampling representativeness. Only correct (unbiased) mass reduction will ensure representative sampling. It is essential to induct scientific and technological professions in the TOS regime in order to secure the necessary reliability of: samples (which must be representative, from the primary sampling onwards), analysis (which will not mean anything outside the miniscule analytical volume without representativity ruling all mass reductions involved, also in the laboratory) and data analysis (“data” do not exist in isolation of their provenance). The Total Sampling Error (TSE) is by far the dominating contribution to all analytical endeavours, often 100+ times larger than the Total Analytical Error (TAE).We present a summarizing set of only seven Sampling Unit Operations (SUOs) that fully cover all practical aspects of sampling and provides a handy “toolbox” for samplers, engineers, laboratory and scientific personnel.  Data analysis is often regarded as separate from chemical analysis and especially separate from the process producing the Chemometricians rightly pride themselves of a holistic approach, for example, pointing out that it is often the same person who analyses the samples chemically and performs chemometric data analysis afterwards; it is emphasized that it is the chemometrician's job also to be involved in the planning of experimental designs before analysis. Design of optimal sampling plans can also be viewed as a special case of experimental design and, consequently, the methods TOS provides should also be an essential part of any chemometrician's toolbox. While it clearly will be unrealistic that the same person Fundamentally the problem is that currently courses on sampling are taught only in very few universities. Without basic training and knowledge on the essence of the sampling theory, it is difficult (or even impossible) to obtain truly representative samples, especially when sampling heterogeneous particulate materials. A fully developed TOS, dealing with all aspects of representative sampling exists—and has done so for 25–50 years in gradually more developed and comprehensive forms. This knowledge base should be incorporated into all relevant scientific and technological educations as a mandatory curriculum subject. Process engineering, analytical chemistry and process chemometrics, to name but a few disciplines, are clearly in need of TOS. Simply speaking, TOS shifts the focus from the In 1950, Pierre Gy began developing what is today known as the It is Apparently worse: Any sampling process will itself generate sampling errors. The only way to be able to eliminate, or to reduce these errors to an acceptable level, is to be able to understand TOS combines the technical part of sampling (i.e., to cut and correctly extract the sample) and the statistical part (to characterize the heterogeneity of the sampling target, to estimate the uncertainty generated by sampling operations and to generalize the results). To understand the most important implications of TOS, a minimum knowledge of the terms and notations involved is essential. A short description of the main definitions to be used is given below The A A An A A   The   The relative It is emphasized that A selection, a sampling process, is A selection is A selection is Therefore, a sample is To understand and use TOS, one needs first a clear understanding of the From the sampling point of view, a lot can be regarded zero-dimensional on two conditions: (1) the whole lot is taken as sample, (2) or the expectance value of a sample is independent on the location of the lot where it is taken, i.e., there is One-dimensional lots on the other hand consist of strings of fragments or groups, process streams or physical bodies that show a distinct Three-dimensional lots exist when the extracted samples cannot be brought to cover any of the dimensions of the lot fully. There is a further physical, or geometrical So far, TOS only fully covers sampling of zero- and one-dimensional lots in full. Lots of higher sampling dimensionality are in principle to be considered separately. But very often it is possible to There are admittedly some The definition of a Additional principles of correct sample delimitation, sample extraction and sample preparation must also be obeyed—these will be duly explained below (see In the literature, a vast catalogue of various methods for estimating “the sampling error” can be found. Most of these estimate just one of the error components presented in Gy's theory, usually the Fundamental Sampling Error. Few methods take autocorrelation into account or distinguish between the three different sample selection strategies, random, stratified or systematic, which lead to different results in estimating the mean of the lot. What is needed to approach all sampling problems is a quantitative understanding of the concept of material heterogeneity and knowledge about the principal sampling errors that can occur, and especially Thus, to understand the importance and impact of correct (and incorrect) sampling, one needs to have an overview of the different sources of sampling error. Systematic dealings with the totality of sampling problems over some 25 years (1950–1975) allowed Pierre Gy to distinguish seven sampling errors. A very brief theoretical analysis of the origin of five of these is given below, with the remaining two errors only pertaining to process sampling. This analysis is needed in order to understand the origin and consequences of correct (and incorrect) sampling. While the full theoretical analysis of the sampling process in all its varied forms (processes, materials, sampling hardware, etc.) is a formidable mathematical construct (precisely because of its complete generality), it is nevertheless still possible to delineate the central tenets in a much simpler context, which is the approach chosen here. The main issue is thus to delineate just enough of the theoretical sampling analysis in order to understand the derivation of the ensuing practical sampling practices (procedures and operations). In the original analysis, Pierre Gy labeled the total error of an analytical result “the Global Estimation Error” (GEE). This error is comprised of two fundamental contributions: The Total Analytical Error (TAE), which all chemists and other analysts are quite familiar with, and the Total Sampling Error (TSE) The Total Sampling Error springs from both the material properties (heterogeneity) as well as the sampling process itself. It is convenient to make this sub-division, as it emphasizes the limits to possible improvement of the results by optimizing the sampling process only (by adopting a more or less reflected or arbitrary “sampling plan”, etc). The view that the sampling process must be direct and easy-to-perform because of obvious stringent resource limitations, etc. is often encountered. However, it is possible, indeed often recommendable, to manipulate the lot material if this is de facto necessary in order to obtain representative samples. Traditionally this is very often considered either difficult, expensive or both. Not wanting to deal properly with the heterogeneity of the lot material (not even on the conceptual level) is probably the greatest error committed in all conventional “sampling” (a more correct term would be “ There are two basic sampling errors encountered in all sampling operations; The Fundamental Sampling Error (FSE) and the Grouping and Segregation Error (GSE). The lot heterogeneity alone is responsible for FSE which is considered the practical minimum sampling error even when all other incorrect sampling error components have been eliminated. GSE on the other hand is related to both the sampling process and the material heterogeneity and arises from the composition and spatial distribution heterogeneity of the lot material. The magnitude of GSE also depends on the sampling process itself, especially the sampling mass. Three further sources of error are attributed to the sampling process. These are the Increment Delimitation Error (IDE), the Increment Extraction Error (IEE) and the Increment Preparation Error (IPE), and are labeled the Incorrect Sampling Error (ISE). All these errors are explained below. The Total Analytical Error (TAE) is almost always under strict control in the analytical laboratory and often the analytical quality control concentrates on this last step of the measurement process. As the tendency of modern instruments goes towards smaller and smaller analytical volumes, this translates directly into more and more difficult representativity problems as To understand  This statement is more easily accepted than would perhaps at first be thought. For any material consisting of particles of different types, consider a An increase in the primary sample volume/mass leads to more representative samples. While this is generally true—there is at the same time an acute upper limit for the sample mass required for analysis. Development in modern analytical chemistry has as its material basis an ever decreasing analytical volume. The analytical results pertain to an ever smaller volume, but these results are nevertheless purported to be representative of the entire lot. Thus, there is a real conflict of interest between primary sampling representativity ( One cannot simultaneously stipulate primacy for Heterogeneity is split into two parts: Constitution Heterogeneity (CH) and Distribution Heterogeneity (DH) CH is inherently dependent on the composition, shape, size, density etc. of the particles or fragments making up the lot. If a great overall composition-wise difference between the individual fragments exists, the constitution heterogeneity is large, but if the fragments are more homogeneous CH is lower. The total contribution to heterogeneity is never nil, however, as that would be the case of all fragments being strictly identical. Mixing and blending does not change CH. The DH is dependent on the physical, spatial distribution of the fragments of the lot, on certain aspects of the method of sample extraction, and finally on CH. The degree of DH is limited by CH of the lot. For the sake of illustration, imagine a lot consisting of black and white spheres and with significantly different grain-size distributions. If all the black spheres are to be found at the bottom of the lot and the white spheres are more to the top, the system displays a very high DH. If on the other hand the spheres were to be well mixed (“homogenized”), the system DH would be significantly reduced. The size of extracted groups of fragments (increments) has great influence on DH. As an ideal end-member case if the increments consist of only one fragment, DH would be zero. An increasing number of fragments in the groups consequently implies an increase in DH. Fragment size and density also influence DH. For example, particles with large differences in size (and/or density) tend to segregate or stratify heavily, with the smallest and/or densest particles at the bottom of the lot. The effective sampling error resulting from DH can be split conceptually into two factors according to the arguments presented above: a The segregation factor, The A Venn diagram of this interconnection between DH and CH (for any given lot which does not undergo comminution) can be seen in Contemplation of these two intrinsic heterogeneity factors The Grouping and Segregation Error (GSE) is a practically unavoidable error in any sampling. GSE is a result of both the material heterogeneity and the sampling process itself. This error arises as soon as the sampling increments are not ideal, i.e., when we do not sample fragments one by one and with equal probability of being selected (FSP). All practical sampling increments do in fact contain thousands to millions or more of fragments depending on the grain-sizes involved. This ensures that all fragments do Thus, GSE depends primarily on the local level of fragment segregation, which in turn depends strongly on the material differences in particle size, shape and density. Segregation almost always occurs when dealing with particulate materials, both stationary and in motion. One prudent rule of thumb would therefore be: to GSE can only be An ideally mixed material would give a minimum GSE, characterizing the lowest possible residual heterogeneity. Materials treated thus are called It is not possible to determine GSE directly, but it can be found by experimentally determining the Fundamental Sampling Error (FSE) and the Total Sampling Error (TSE). Then—presuming all other errors are eliminated or non-existing (only sampling To summarize: GSE comprises two error sources: grouping and segregation. The contribution from (local) grouping can be minimized by decreasing, as far as possible or feasible, the size of the increments—with the ensuing mandate to use (very) many increments to make up the sample ( During the process of sampling, a number of errors can be highly influential on the Total Sampling Error if not properly recognized and countered. These errors are categorized as However, the incorrect errors can be completely eliminated—or at least be reduced (to being negligible) simply by following the guidelines for The Fundamental Sampling Error (FSE), introduced above, is inherent to the material properties (size, shape, density, composition amongst other). For a given state of the lot (particle size, density, etc.), the contribution from FSE is constant and cannot be altered. The only way to do this is to Only in two very special and often unachievable situations, will FSE be strictly zero: The sample is the whole lot ( The lot is (strictly) homogeneous. It is of the highest value to be able to calculate FSE from a number of material parameters to get a realistic idea of the properties of the sampling procedures and especially to estimate the necessary sample sizes. It is therefore vital to be able to assess the magnitude of FSE. This holds for all sampling of particulate materials. To estimate the Fundamental Sampling Error, “ The mass of the lot, As mentioned above, FSE is the sampling error of a zero-dimensional lot, i.e., a lot that can be thoroughly mixed before sampling. Estimation of FSE is, therefore, a useful exercise. It can be used to assess, audit and optimize all sampling and mass reduction steps, where a thorough mixing is possible before extracting the sample, i.e., usually all sampling steps following the primary sampling. As Gy's Formula is of absolutely fundamental importance in sampling. Either the sample mass, or the average grain-size, or the acceptance level of FSE can be directly estimated on this basis. The sampling constant, In contrast to the correct sampling errors (CSE), the incorrect sampling errors (ISE) can all be greatly minimized, sometimes completely eliminated by obeying the principles of For the analysis below, contemplate what will be the outcome of IDE occurs when the actual shape of the extracted increment This type of complete (“stopped belt”) sampling is only used for calibration purposes. Similar operations on a When extracting the (correctly) delimited increment, but not respecting a set of practical extraction rules, the Increment Extraction Error IEE will occur In After the actual extraction of the sample, it may undertake a number of further steps before reaching analysis, storage or further processing. In this process, the sample may be altered by a number of factors such as: human errors, spillage, contamination, packaging, adhesion of critical component(s) to sides of containers/bags/gear, loss of fine particles (dust) during handling or crushing/comminution, moisture uptake/loss, biodegradation, etc. Also deliberate alteration of the samples, like sabotage or fraud, categorizes as preparation errors. Common for all preparation errors are the fact that it is not possible to treat them statistically Correct sampling is defined as the sum total of the set of these (and a few other) practical guidelines for suppressing unnecessary, indeed critically unwanted, inter-sample variations, which loosely can be described as resulting from lack of appreciation of the tenets of TOS. Correct sampling prevents the occurrence of incorrect sampling errors. In the theoretical sampling analysis above, we have along the way highlighted various sampling handling and manipulation procedures that are specifically designed to alleviate one or more of the CSE as well as the ISE. Following from the complete analysis in TOS, we have arrived at formulating what we have termed the seven Always perform a heterogeneity characterization of new materials Mix (homogenize) well before all further sampling steps Use composite sampling instead of premature focus on Only use representative mass reduction Comminution whenever necessary (reduction in grain size) Perform variographic characterization of 1-D heterogeneity Whenever possible turn 2-D and 3-D lots into 1-D equivalents Of these operations, SUOs 2, 3, and 4 constitute the most frequently used everyday tools of the trade, with SUO 5 called upon whenever needed. Representative sampling is not much more than a serious interest in TOS combined with four practical Sampling Unit Operations (SUOs 2–5) and three guiding principles (SUOs 1, 6, 7). As will be appreciated, SUOs 1 and 6 constitute the initial material heterogeneity characterization which is SUO 7 constitutes the For want of space, it cannot be the intention here to also to supply a practical sampling manual. However, a comprehensive TOS-introduction Special Issue, complete with extensive case histories and solved practical sampling cases was recently published Setting up a correct sampling strategy is often both difficult and/or tedious for the uninitiated, but it will always pay off as the Always perform an initial survey of lot heterogeneity (SUO 1). It should be obvious that it is neither possible to fix a sample mass, Use only appropriate problem-specific means (SUOs 1–7), i.e., sample correctly, to eliminate all ISE, and optimize the sampling plan simultaneously to minimize the Fundamental Sampling Error (FSE) and the Grouping and Segregation Error (GSE). In dealing with one-dimensional process streams, or time series, minimize the influence of periodic fluctuations, both long and short term (SUOs 6–7, process sampling is only mentioned very briefly in this paper). At all sampling steps, the sampling correctness should be controlled by respecting the rules about sampling hardware and procedures provided by TOS, as this will eliminate the incorrect sampling errors, and simultaneously ensure unbiased samples. A benefit of this is that the general sampling variances will also be reduced The above exposé mainly focuses on showing the theory and principles behind, and the practical procedures for correct and variance minimized—hence representative—hence reliable primary sampling. What happens next?—What happens when a representative primary sample is sent to the laboratory? Easy! TOS, as delineated above, also governs the secondary, tertiary… sampling steps in the laboratory. The only thing which changes is the Conveyor belts or pipelines, tubes, etc., transporting material can be considered one-dimensional lots. When sampling this type of lot, special attention should be paid to the rules and principles pertaining to autocorrelated process or product streams, which are thoroughly described in TOS under the heading of 1-D process sampling. A special tool for analysis of periodic trends, the To illustrate the most important sampling phenomena and principles from a distinct practical point of view, we provide a brief focus on the critical issue of mass reduction (SUO 4). Whether because of the wish for a Representative sampling is in itself a mass reduction step—but the reverse is most emphatically not true: it is very seldom, if indeed ever, the case that an indiscriminate focus only on the quantitative mass reduction aspect leads to correct and representative sampling results Scoop extraction of a small amount from the top of a container/bag/beaker/bin/box ( More sophisticated scooping methods (alas all Using specially designed mass reduction devices, methods or procedures ( To the uninitiated, this issue often only seems to be an unimportant materials handling step that simply provides a final sub-sample mass for analysis. This is a most dangerous and very unfortunate misunderstanding. The following will clearly illustrate the paramount importance of careful consideration when choosing a method or device for sample mass reduction A large experimental series has been carried out to investigate the reliability of 17 current methods for mass reduction. A three-component lot of 2000 g was reduced in all experiments. The aim of this extensive survey was to assess and rank—with regard to representativity—all the currently used methods for mass reduction available in the international sampling, analytical and industrial–academic realms. Only a brief summary of the salient results from this study is presented below; this study is reported in full in Ref. A complete set of all current methods and devices in use today for mass reduction (see        A composite material was designed to simulate difficult, natural sampling materials and conditions. It was required that the material system should include small, intermediate and large particles to ensure a significant segregation propensity, and that one of the components must be prone to bouncing, with clear differences in density. The material finally chosen was composed of: 0.10% w/w glass spheres (diameter 1 mm) 10.00% w/w rape seed (diameter 2–3 mm bouncing) 89.90% w/w wheat seeds (diameter 3–6 mm) A 2000-g lot was thoroughly mixed at the start of all experiments and reduced by one of the above-mentioned methods to either 100 or 125 g, respectively. All final sub-samples were separated into their constituents by sieving and the individual fractions were weighed. The experiments were repeated 20 times, in two blocks of ten performed by two different operators resulting in very stable and reliable summary statistics. To illustrate the reliability of the methods and devices tested, we here only present the final results for the overall  The following (major) conclusions can be drawn Grab sampling is the by far worst performer of all! Shoveling methods in general also provide unreliable biased results. Riffle splitters generally provide most reliable and excellent representativities.  The larger the number of chutes, the smaller the bias. Closed riffle splitters provide better results than open models (open models loose significant amounts of bouncing material). Rotational dividers provide equally reliable mass reduction. They also require very little maintenance and are fast to use. Set-back would appear to be difficulty to cleaning sticky materials and immobility when needed in field work. The Boerner divider, if used properly, provides the marginally most accurate and precise overall mass reduction with a very narrow replicate distribution, but probably only for this particular material as the Boerner divider actually was When choosing a specific method for mass reduction, either in the field or in the laboratory, reliability and representativity (accuracy and reproducibility) of final sub-samples is the primary focus. Grab sampling (and shoveling methods) is to be totally avoided—even though this is by far the most used method today! There are plenty of alternatives: Most laboratories can easily procure miniature riffle splitters when dealing with powders or other particulate materials, e.g., pharmaceutical mixtures for quality control. This is the best way to perform final sub-sampling for extraction, solution or whatever analytical preparation needed as in TOS. This will greatly improve the quality of laboratory work. Extraction of the primary sample is, as always, a totally separate matter, and may at times be difficult. More attention should be paid to both these sampling aspects. A generic illustration is presented below intended to shed light on most of the principal practical sampling issues delineated above. It is not a complete practical account, but rather a qualitative overview of which relevant SUOs that may be brought to bear on a difficult sampling issue, and their interrelationships. The specific details of all sampling problems are always very much problem-dependent. At first sight perhaps, a simple scenario, yet a very difficult sampling problem, would be that of a container full of, say, waste material, organic produce, rocks or construction materials, where only the top would appear to be readily accessible. Here we shall illustrate by way of a container topped off with waste material from a recent building rejuvenation project, Without TOS training, most chemical and data analysts would agree that primary sampling of such heterogeneous material presents a very difficult task indeed. However, materials of comparable heterogeneity as the one illustrated are universally met for everyday analysis in many industrial monitoring and scientific contexts. How to solve this singularly nontrivial sampling problem? For TOS, there is no problem as such—“there is just a little work”. But in order to obtain the sought for As soon as a reasonable primary sampling rate has been decided for the 3-D→1-D sampling scheme indicated (SUO 7), it is patently obvious that The point here is that the severe heterogeneity and the impracticality of the nature of the lot material Other realizations of the illustrated 3-D→1-D transformation scheme could, e.g., involve installing automatic samplers. This is preferably done for conveyor belts or in pipelines. In this way, the “impossibility” of sampling large heaps, stockpiles or similar storage means correctly can nearly always be circumvented within the confines of creative application of TOS. There are no impossible sampling problems—there are only situations, which are judged, often hastily and quite unscientifically, to be either too impractical or too costly! Based on the exposition of TOS and the presented illustrations, the following conclusions are drawn: It is important to know, at least to a certain level, the basic principles and practice of TOS when dealing with sampling of heterogeneous materials. Respecting the relevant FSE can Mixing minimizes the grouping contribution to GSE significantly. Decreasing increment size minimizes the segregation contribution to GSE. Composite sampling is powerful for primary sampling of 0-D and 1,(2,3)-D lots. Careful consideration of (problem-dependent) correct mass reduction methods or devices is mandatory. The riffle-splitting TOS is available at any entry level one would wish to desire.

We are grateful for the comments of two thorough reviewers, one chemometrician and one geostatistician, who provided numerous valuable and constructive criticisms. A short introductory description of the full set of parameters in the “Gy formula”:      The FSE estimate is better to the extent that these parameters can be determined more precisely. However, this is not always easily possible in practice (without extreme expenditure of resources), whence some default parameter values may be used.
