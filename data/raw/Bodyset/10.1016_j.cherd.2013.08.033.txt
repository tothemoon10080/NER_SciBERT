The extraction kinetics of FeIII by di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) were investigated using a Y–Y shaped microfluidic device. Finite-volume simulations were used to examine the accuracy of a single-step dimeric reaction mechanism in fitting the experimental data. Results demonstrate the validity of the proposed mechanism and show that FeIII extraction occurred at a slow rate (second-order forward rate constant of k

The present study provides insight for the control of FeIII extraction rates in hydrometallurgical processes.area (m Bond number, local species concentration (mol/m velocity-averaged outlet species concentration (mol/m diffusivity (m oxidation–reduction potential (mV) volumetric flow rate (m gravitational acceleration (m total ionic strength (mM) local interfacial flux (mol/m dimerisation constant distribution constant equilibrium constant forwards/backwards rate constant (m water-exchange coefficient (s fluid pressure (Pa) temperature (K) time (s) fluid velocity (m/s) microchannel half-volume (m degree of polymerisation Cartesian coordinates (m) interfacial tension (N/m) dynamic viscosity (Pa signed stoichiometric coefficient fluid density (kg/m viscous stress tensor (Pa) initial aqueous phase equilibrium experiment  interface  optimised organic phase pass-length outlet simulation di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid condensed notation for monomeric D2EHPA condensed notation for dimeric D2EHPA condensed notation for deprotonated D2EHPA mean absolute percentage error solvent extraction microfluidic solvent extraction Solvent extraction (SX), a widely used hydrometallurgical separations technique, exploits an aqueous/organic interface for the purposes of purification and concentration ( Equilibrium concepts have traditionally been used for the design of conventional mixer–settler SX units with large residence times. New equipment, however, will utilise shorter timescales of liquid–liquid contact, meaning that the contribution of kinetics to mass transfer becomes important ( Iron is present as a contaminant in many hydrometallurgical processes ( Above a pH of 1, Fe Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy has been used to determine the nature of the extraction product in the organic phase ( Both aqueous-bulk and interfacial reaction mechanisms have been previously proposed for the present system. Speciation effects have been considered in the formulation of kinetic models. In this study, the extraction kinetics of Fe Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (99.4%, Tokyo Chemical Industry, lot 26OVA), Fe Experiments were performed in a Borofloat The extraction procedure and the experimental apparatus have been described previously ( The equilibrium constant was determined using classic shake tests. An aqueous solution of Fe An oxidation–reduction potential probe (ORP-ECFC7960201B Eutech Instrument) with an Ag/AgCl, KCl (3.0 FeSO Organic-phase D2EHPA was assumed to be distributed between monomeric and dimeric forms according to the dimerisation equilibrium Dimerisation constants in organic solvents are conventionally considered to be high ( Extraction of FeSO The equilibrium constant The fluid dynamic and mass transfer equations governing the system were constructed as per The solvent velocity was determined by solving the incompressible continuity and steady-state Navier–Stokes equations in conservative form as per The fluid velocity was assumed to be fully developed in the A no-slip velocity boundary condition was assumed on all walls. Local species concentrations Negligible partitioning of the extractant into the aqueous phase has been assumed ( For the extraction reaction stoichiometry of Eq. At dynamic equilibrium, As per A no-flux condition was assumed for all species on the microchannel walls and for monomeric D2EHPA on the interface: Physical properties used are shown in Properties of the geometries used for mesh resolution independence testing purposes were identical to those used in Log–log plots of Under the assumption of a simplified system consisting of free Fe The equilibrium constant Rearranging Eq. If the 1:3 stoichiometry of Eq. Similarly, for the proposed 1:1 reaction stoichiometry of Eq. Hence, if Eq.  Shake-test data were used to determine the equilibrium constant for the present experimental conditions. A value of The reaction rate constant was determined through a least-squares fit to all experimental data sets as per Two mass transfer regimes can typically occur in an extraction system. In a diffusion-controlled regime, diffusive transport is slow relative to the reaction rate; whereas the opposite occurs in a reaction-controlled regime in which diffusive transport is fast. To simulate diffusion-controlled transfer conditions, the reaction rate constant was increased by five orders of magnitude (denoted To show that kinetics influence the present mass transfer rate, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was determined using The average interfacial flux of the extraction product, [FeL(HL)SO As discussed in Section The low reaction rate for the Fe In a simplified scheme, higher In the present mechanistic hypothesis, however, it is the sulfate-coordinated species (and not the aquo complex) that is extracted – similarly, for the data reported by Fe The standard deviation error bounds in Existence of the dimeric D2EHPA species at the interface should also be questioned. Note, for example, that interfacial dielectric properties differ from those of the bulk solutions ( The extraction kinetics of Fe Support from the
