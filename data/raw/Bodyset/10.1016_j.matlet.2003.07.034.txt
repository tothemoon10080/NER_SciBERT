Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles were synthesized at room temperature via carbonation route in the presence of terpineol using the radial-shaped sparger. The addition of 0.1–1.0 vol.% of terpineol accelerated the absorption of CO2, leading to the formation of CaCO3 nanoparticles. The adoption of small nozzles or the increase of stirring intensity was also favorable for the formation of CaCO3 nanoparticles. The primary simulation for the mass transfer of CO2 bubbles in carbonation process indicated that the conversion ratio (x) of Ca(OH)2 increased linearly with the reaction time (t): x=1.39×10−2
                     t, which was quite consistent with the regression of the carbonation experiment (x=1.56×10−2
                     t, r=0.9826), implying the possibility that the mass transfer of CO2 bubbles in the gas–liquid interface might be the rate-controlling step.Calcium carbonate (CaCO CaCO The carbonation process (a gas–liquid–solid reacting method—to precipitate CaCO The synthesis of nanoscale CaCO The present work studied the influence of terpineol, a widely used vesicant in hydrometallurgy, on the size and morphology of CaCO A cylindrical plastic reactor with a diameter of 9.0 cm and a height of 25.0 cm and a radial-shaped sparger with 24 nozzles of 0.7–2.0 mm diameter were used in the experiments. All of the nozzles kept a same distance from the gas entrance and were distributed uniformly to ensure the uniform gas dispersion.
