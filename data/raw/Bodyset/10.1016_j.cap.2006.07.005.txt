In two subsequent papers (Refs. A brief description of the apparatus working principles is given in the first part of this work The differences between the theoretical and real behavior of the magnetic particles in the magnetic classifier is taken in account by an empirical coefficient – By magnetic particles we refer to the ones that present a high enough magnetic susceptibility in order to be separated from the “non-magnetic” ones, thus moving in different direction. Magnetic particles may present an additional kind of movement when compared to the non-magnetic ones, i.e., a “flight” towards the central collector ( Movement of the particles while upon the surface of the MAGCLA Moment when the particles lift off towards the central collector ( Movement of the particles in flight towards the central collector ( As performed for the analysis of the movement of non-magnetic particles, to describe the movement of magnetic particles we will introduce the coefficient Although other dependencies will be pointed out later,  In this analysis it is considered that the initial velocity of the particles is null in the tangential direction, and equal to the rotational velocity of the body of the separator–classifier in the rotational direction (this may be achieved by a proper design of the feeding systems). As the movement of the magnetic particles is performed in an opposite direction to the air flow, drag forces must be considered in this situation, which are defined as Based on Computing the tangential force acting on the particles (which is the only macroscopic acting force) as they move supported on the body of the separator–classifier, we obtain, by using Eq. In this sub-subsection both axis systems presented before ( From Eq. In It is known that, Expressions In this case: The net rotational force is null, as the friction force is high enough to equalize in magnitude the drag forces. Therefore the angular velocity, Hence, by computing As the angular velocity is constant, The total velocity of the particle is given by For the majority of the magnetic particles describing the descending movement, there will be a certain radius at which they lift off towards the central collector – From the previous equation an expression may be derived relating the lifting radius (  The net force balances in the To derive the trajectories followed by the particles as they move towards the central collector we must consider the net force balances in the  From It is known that, Expression Solving As The total velocity of the particle is given by The formulae describing the trajectories followed by magnetic particles in the new magnetic separator and classifier (MAGCLA™) were derived.
