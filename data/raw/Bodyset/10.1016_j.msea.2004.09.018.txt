Workability is a measure of the extent of deformation that a powder metallurgy materials can withstand prior to fracture occurred in the forming or upsetting processes. Ductile fracture is the most common mode of failure in bulk forming process. The formability is a complicated phenomenon, dependent upon the process as well as the material parameters. A complete experimental investigation on the workability behaviour of Al–Fe composite was performed under the triaxial stress state. Upsetting of Al–Fe composite having different iron contents with different aspect ratios and iron particle sizes were carried out and the formability behaviour of the compacts at triaxial stress condition was determined. A new true strain considering the effect of the bulging was taken in to account. The curves plotted for different compacts were analyzed and concluded that there is a drastic changes in the formability behaviour of compacts because of different content of iron and its particle sizes and aspect ratios.Workability is a measure of the extent of deformation that a powder metallurgy materials can withstand prior to fracture occurred in the forming or upsetting processes. It is a very difficult term to express as it depends on the ductility of the material being worked and also on the stress, stress rate and temperature distributions in the workpiece. Workability factors are dependent on process variables such as the geometry of the tooling and workpiece, as well as the lubricants used between the contact surfaces. The occurrence of ductile fracture during plastic deformation is a dangerous factor in many metal working processes. The prediction of fracture in the design stage itself and its early modification can save a lot of money. The research work on the deformation of porous material started in the early 1960s. Kuhn and Downey The attention on the hoop strain and the axial strain behaviour of any P/M compacts is much required for any cold forging processes. Sowerby et al. Microscopic voids in any ductile material play a vital role in various fractures. Because in some situations the fracture is a direct consequence of the continued growth of voids with stretching. Tvergaard Performance learning is another important class of learning law, in which the process parameters are adjusted to optimize the performance of the processes. Ohdar and Pash In the present work a complete investigation on the working behaviour of Al–Fe composite with various aspect ratios, iron particle sizes and iron additions has been made and the correlation between the various stress ratio parameters namely ( The mathematical expressions used and proposed for the determination of various upsetting parameters of upsetting for various stress state conditions are discussed below. In the compression of a P/M part, under frictional conditions, the average density is increased. Friction enhances densification and at the same time decreases the height reduction at fracture. The state of stress in a homogeneous compression process is as follows: According to Abdel-Rahman et al. When the compression continues, the final diameter increases and the corresponding hoop strain, which is tensile in nature, also increases until it reaches the fracture limit. Once the fracture is initiated, the forming limit strain is the same as the effective strain. It is determined from: According to Narayanasamy and Pandey Since the radial stress, According to Narayanasamy and Ponalagusamy From the above Eq. In the above Eq. Since The effective stress can be determined from the following relation as explained elsewhere Since Atomized aluminium and iron powders of the characterization stated in the The sintered preforms were cleaned from the sand particles and the dimensional measurement made before and after each deformation. The deformation of the compact was carried out between two flat open dies hardened to           According to the references  For higher iron content in the Al–Fe composite, the larger number of pores is developed and hence the higher hydrostatic stress is developed for closing them during the plastic deformation. The power law constant in plots between the stress ratio parameters and the relative density increases with increase in iron content because of the association with the development of higher hydrostatic stress. For lower iron content, an increase in the fracture strain is obtained. As the iron content increases, the formability stress index value also increases. The slope value of plots between the initial relative density and the fracture strain, increases, reaches a peak value and then decreases with increasing iron content. The slope constant of plots between the initial relative density and the fracture strain, decreases, reaches the minimum value and then increases with increasing iron content.
