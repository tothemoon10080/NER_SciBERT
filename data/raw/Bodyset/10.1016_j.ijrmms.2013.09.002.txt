We present new stability charts for the analysis of rock mass slopes satisfying the Generalized Hoek–Brown (GHB) criterion. Firstly, charts for calculating the factor of safety (FOS) of a slope for a specified slope angle β=45° are proposed. Secondly, a disturbance weighting factor f

                      is introduced to illustrate the effect of disturbance factor D upon the stability of rock slopes. Thirdly, a slope angle weighting factor f

                      is proposed to show the influence of slope angle β on slope stability. Combined with stability charts based on β=45°, the weighting factors f

                      allow the calculation of the FOS of a slope assigned various slope angle under different blasting damage and stress relief conditions. The reliability of the proposed charts is tested against numerical solutions. The results show that FOS from the proposed charts exhibits only 3.1% average discrepancy from numerical solutions using 1680 sets of data. The proposed charts are simple and straightforward to use and can be adopted as useful tools for the preliminary rock slope stability analysis.Determining the stability of rock mass slopes is an important task in many areas of civil and mining engineering, such as open pit excavation and large dam construction. Most slope stability analysis is based on seeking the factor of safety (FOS), which is a traditional measure of the safety margin of a given slope Currently, the Hoek–Brown (HB) Development of rock slope stability charts based on the GHB criterion, however, is a challenging task since there are at least six input parameters (GSI, In the current research, we propose new charts that can be used to estimate the FOS of a slope directly from the Hoek–Brown parameters (GSI, Since Taylor Until now, the slope stability charts by Carranza-Torres In order to estimate the FOS of a slope with a given geometry ( While Carranza-Torres Stability charts for estimating rock mass slopes directly from the Hoek–Brown parameters GSI,  Because the upper and lower boundary results bracket a narrow range of As noted by Li et al. Considering that the LEM is still the most widely used methods for slope stability analysis, we proposed an alternative stability chart based on the LEM. The proposed charts are able to estimate the FOS of a slope directly from the Hoek–Brown parameters (GSI, The work outlined here required hundreds of runs on a microcomputer, analyzing the stability of various slopes having different geometries and rock mass properties. The slope models were analyzed using The competency factor, the ratio of the uniaxial compressive strength In this section, the derivation of the theoretical relationship between the SR and FOS of a given slope slip surface will be explained in detail. In the next stage, based on the relationship between the SR and FOS, charts for calculating the FOS Combined with a generic form of Balmer′s Equations For a generic case Also, The FOS can be defined as a function of resisting force The value of The parameters Eq.  The results show that FOS values for all three groups are exactly the same. Results of the comparison of the FOS calculated for the three groups over a range of GSI and The examination of 54 slope case histories  Alternative form of stability charts are shown in  Practical experience in the design of large open pit slopes has demonstrated that the estimation of rock mass properties from the HB criterion are too optimistic when It is not easy to determine the exact value of Thus, in order to understand the real influence of The current study, therefore, proposes a disturbance weighting factor By considering the limit influence of The values of FOS After hundreds of computer runs using a wide range of rock mass properties and slope geometry, a chart representing the relationship between the slope angle weighting factor Compared with the values calculated in  The use of the proposed rock slope stability charts to calculate the FOS of a given slope is quite straightforward. Firstly, for given values of SR, GSI and Example 2 The following three examples with a wide range of rock properties and slope geometry were used to illustrate the practical application of the proposed rock slope stability charts. The results are shown in New rock slope stability charts for estimating of the stability of rock mass slopes satisfying with the GHB criterion have been proposed. The proposed charts can be used to calculate the FOS of a slope directly from the Hoek–Brown parameters (GSI, Firstly, the theoretical relationship between the strength ratio (SR), Secondly, while the disturbance factor Thirdly, a slope angle weighting factor Combined with stability charts based on The proposed charts are quite simple and straightforward to use and can be adopted as a useful tool for the preliminary rock slope stability analysis.
