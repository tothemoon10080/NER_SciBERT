We report an unusual case of multifragmentary condylar femoral nonunion with severe synovitis and bone loss in a 90-year-old woman. Initially, conservative treatment of the condylar femoral fracture was indicated because the fracture was severely comminuted and the patient was very advanced in age. The fracture failed to heal. Salvage surgery with a total knee tumor endoprosthetic replacement was performed. Four years postoperatively, the patient was walking without knee pain using a walker. We believe that the present results justify the use of a megaprosthesis in the treatment of benign conditions even in very elderly patients.
