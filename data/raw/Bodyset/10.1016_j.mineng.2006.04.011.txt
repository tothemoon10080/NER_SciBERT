A review of literature data for different types of sulphide concentrates and gold ores has been carried out to examine the impact of host minerals and pH upon gold leaching. Analysis of initial rate data over the first 30–60min of gold leaching from sulphide concentrates or silicate ores over a range of ammonia, thiosulphate, and copper(II) concentrations, pH (9–10.5) and temperatures up to 70°C shows the applicability of a shrinking sphere kinetic model with an apparent rate constant of the order k

                     s−1. The dependence of apparent rate constant on pH and initial concentrations of copper(II) and thiosulphate is used to determine a rate constant k

                     s−1 over the temperature range 25–30°C. The discrepancies reflect differences in surface roughness, particle size and the effect of host minerals.Thiosulphate leaching of gold has attracted renewed interest of researchers in gold hydrometallurgy since the late 1970s ( Despite extensive research work in this area, commercialization of thiosulphate processes has not been achieved largely due to the complexity of the chemical reactions involved in the leaching stage depending on the host minerals. The side reactions and products affect gold extraction, reagent consumption, and subsequent unit operations for separation and recovery ( Kinetic studies based on anodic or chemical oxidation of rotating gold discs, freshly plated gold on quartz, gold powders or colloids by: (a) CuSO The beneficial effect of increasing pH on gold extraction is generally related to a high ammonia concentration at high pH according to Eq.  Eqs. One of the requirements of a shrinking sphere model is that the concentration of reagents ( The reaction of copper(II) and oxygen with thiosulphate ( The continuous production of copper(I) and copper(II) due to the leaching of copper minerals ( The presence of sulphate (added or formed during thiosulphate degradation) and the change in ammonia concentration which affect the leaching of host minerals by copper(II) ( Metal ions such as lead(II) and zinc(II) leached into the solution which affect the concentration of thiosulphate as well as the rate of gold oxidation ( Galvanic interaction between host sulphide minerals ( A detailed discussion of all the above complications which are interrelated is beyond the scope of this review. A brief discussion of the most relevant factors which affect the initial rate of gold dissolution is presented in Sections  Copper(II) oxidizes the sulphide minerals in ammoniacal thiosulphate solutions according to Eqs.  Recent work (   The analysis of literature data in previous publications showed that gold leaching kinetics obey a shrinking core model in batch leaching experiments using gold ores, concentrates, calcine or powder ( However, as shown in the effect of high temperature (40–70 larger surface area as a result of fine grinding, and/or beneficial effect of lead(II) or zinc(II) (     Recent analysis of rates of anodic oxidation showed that gold dissolution can take place via the adsorbed ions: The substitution of units of Some data points (set V) based on the results reported by  The leaching results reported by  Since the initial reagent concentrations (0.012    The leaching results of gold from a range of oxide and sulphide ores/concentrates in ammoniacal copper(II)-thiosulphate lixiviant obey a shrinking sphere kinetic model over a range of conditions such as reagent concentration, pH, temperature and particle size. Although host minerals and aeration affect the concentration of copper(II) and thiosulphate, the results reported by Speciation analysis shows that the increase in apparent rate constant ( The rate of gold oxidation per unit surface area, apparent rate constant, particle radius and molar density of gold can be related by the equation A detailed analysis of the variation in
