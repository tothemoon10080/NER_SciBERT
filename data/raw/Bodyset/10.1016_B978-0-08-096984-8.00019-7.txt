Metallurgical processes can be manipulated by changing both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. This chapter considers factors which affect the kinetics of fluid-based reactions.The rather broad concept of “metallurgical process phenomena” here has a quite specific meaning, namely the kinetics of fluid-based (gas–liquid and liquid–liquid) reactions, with an emphasis on the effects of gas flow. In many process metallurgy reactions, gas is a reagent or product; additional gas is often added as diluent or to stir the system. Argon well suited to this purpose: it has very low solubility in condensed phases, is inert, and makes up approximately 1% of the earth's atmosphere. This chapter first summarizes the relevant kinetic principles, reviews both bubble formation by gas injection into liquid metal and slag foaming, and finally presents five process examples to illustrate the kinetic principles. These examples reflect our particular interests in ferrous pyrometallurgy, but should be of interest to process metallurgists generally. Reactions in process metallurgy are manipulated in several fundamental ways. The following affect reaction Temperature Redox conditions (e.g., concentrations of reducible species such as the FeO content of slag, or of reactive elements—deoxidizers—dissolved in liquid metal) Activity and activity coefficients of species dissolved in slag (affected by slag basicity) Mass balance (e.g., the relative masses of slag and metal) Gas phase: change in total pressure; dilution with an inert gas These all affect the These multiple equilibrium and kinetics factors offer several ways of achieving desired process outcomes; they also constitute a list of those variables which must be controlled or known to ensure stable and predictable production.
