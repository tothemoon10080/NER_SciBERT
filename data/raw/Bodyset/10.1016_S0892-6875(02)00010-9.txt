This article applies option pricing technique to determine the satisfactory gold price to exercise the option of improving the recovery of the processing plant at Red Lake gold mine, Canada. Based on option pricing technique, the satisfactory gold price to increase the recovery from 83% to 95% has been found to be US$225.7/oz. The results indicated that the satisfactory price is sensitive to both of the capital cost and the extra operating cost required to exercise the option. As these costs increase, the satisfactory gold price increases. In addition, the article discusses the effects of uncertainty of future gold prices on both of the satisfactory gold price and the decision rule for exercising the option. It has been found that the satisfactory gold price for exercising the option increases with uncertainty level. The decision rule obtained by applying option pricing technique is to exercise the option of improving the recovery if the discounted value of revenues equals or exceeds 2.05 times the discounted value of costs. The results indicated that this rule is not constant, but it is highly dependent on the uncertainty level of the future gold prices.The flexibility of a company to modify its original processing plans makes it more valuable than a company that does not have such flexibility. As argued by In the mineral processing industry, there is a management flexibility to improve the recovery of the plant. Modification of the plant requires extra capital and operating costs and yields extra revenues. The management then has the option, but not the obligation, of spending the extra costs and receiving the extra revenues. This article demonstrates how to apply the option pricing approach to decide when the option to improve the recovery should be exercised. In addition, the article discusses the factors affecting the satisfactory mineral price to exercise this option. The Red Lake gold mine is located in Balmertown, northwest Ontario, Canada. The mine is set to produce 240 In terms of option pricing technique, the management of the project has the option to spend US$20 million as a capital cost and US$1.43 million annually as an extra operating cost and increase the amount of gold produced annually by 35 The investment opportunity of the company to improve the recovery of the processing plant can be regarded as a call option. The company has the option to spend the capital cost (exercise price of the option) required to improve the recovery and receive an extra revenue. Since the company is not obligated to undertake this action, then it will not exercise the option unless the gold price reaches the satisfactory value for exercising it. The satisfactory gold price for exercising the option is obtained by solving the following option pricing model. The detailed explanation and development of the model is found in the work of          Solving Uncertainty of future mineral prices affects the satisfactory price to exercise the option as well as the decision rule upon which the option is exercised. As shown in In this study, option pricing approach is applied to determine the satisfactory gold price to exercise the option of improving the recovery of the processing plant at Red Lake gold mine, Canada, from 83% to 95%. The results suggest that the option should be exercised if the current gold price is greater than or equals US$225.7/oz. The satisfactory gold price is greatly influenced by the capital and operating costs required to exercise the option as well as the level of uncertainty of future gold prices. As the capital and operating costs increase, the satisfactory gold price increases. Uncertainty of future gold prices affects both the satisfactory gold price and the decision rule for exercising the option. As the uncertainty increases, the satisfactory gold price increases.
