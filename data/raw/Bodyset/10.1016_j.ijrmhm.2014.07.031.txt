The effects of rapid sintering by pulse electric current sintering (PECS), variation in starting WC size (0.1–0.8μm), Ni as a Co binder substitute and TiC, NbC and Mo2C additions on the microstructure, abrasion wear, thermal shock and impact resistance of WC–Co and WC–Ni alloys were studied. Abrasion wear tests were done using a ball-on-disk tribometer, with 100Cr6 steel and silicon nitride balls. Use of PECS gave finer microstructures with poorly distributed binder pools than similar liquid phase sintered (LPS) samples, although large angular WC grains of up to 1μm occurred in the nano (0.1μm) and ultrafine (0.4μm) grades. Addition of 5wt.% NbC to WC–10Co (wt.%) had negligible effect on the WC grain size, while 5wt.% Mo2C to WC–6.25TiC–9.3Ni significantly improved WC grain growth inhibition, leading to increased hardness (from ~13 to >21GPa) and reduced wear rate (from 2.73×10−4 to <8.0×10−5
                     mm3·N−1·m−1), compared to the LPS WC–9.3Ni. Thermal shock and impact resistance were measured using a thermal imaging camera and force gauges while testing the samples as cutting tools on Ti–6Al–4V under aggressive interrupted milling conditions. The LPS samples had better thermal shock and impact resistance, due to their higher fracture toughness (>12.5MPa·m0.5) and B3B transverse rupture strength (>2100MPa), as a result of the larger and better binder pool distribution.Cemented carbides based on WC and a ductile metal matrix (Co, Ni and/or Fe) are used in a wide range oftribological applications such as cutting, mining, metal forming, drilling and turning The hardness and abrasion wear resistance of WC cemented carbides produced by powder metallurgy increase with decreased WC grain size from the micron to the nanometric scale, and Co binder strengthening from increased W dissolution Inhibition of grain growth can also be achieved through the introduction of transition metal carbides such as TiC, Cr In this study, WC–Co and WC–Ni cemented carbides with NbC, TiC and Mo The starting powders and their characteristics are given in Milled composite powders were consolidated in a spark plasma sintering (HP D5, FCT Systeme, Germany) furnace. The powders were poured into cylindrical graphite dies with inner and outer diameters of 20.9 Liquid phase sintering (HIP, Ultra Temp, USA) of WC–0.5Cr Archimedes' principle was used to determine the density of the sintered samples (ED224S, Sartorius, Germany). Microstructures of the cemented carbides were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in the backscattered electron and secondary electron modes (JSM-7500F, JEOL, Japan), with 15 Vickers hardness (HV Resistance to abrasion during sliding wear was investigated using a ball-on-disk tribometer, applying a 10 Thermal shock and impact resistance were measured using a thermal imaging camera (D5000, Nikon, Japan) and force gauges (9366CC0, Kistler Multicomponent Force Link, Switzerland), while testing the samples as cutting tool inserts on Ti–6Al–4V under aggressive interrupted face milling conditions. The cutting speeds were varied between 40 and 75 All the WC–Co and WC–Ni cemented carbides produced by PECS had similar relative densities to those produced by LPS (> The micrographs of the liquid phase sintered WC–0.5Cr The microstructure of the WC–0.5Cr The 10Co (LPS) and 9.3Ni (LPS) samples had higher sample wear rates (SWRs) than all the PECS samples, for both the 100Cr6 steel and Si Optical images of the 10Co (LPS) and 5N-s insert cutting edges after milling at a cutting speed ( Increased Although both the WC–Co and WC–Ni cemented carbides produced by PECS achieved good densification (> The larger WC grains in the LPS samples than the PECS samples ( The 10Co (LPS) and 9.3Ni (LPS) inserts had lower flank wear rates (FWRs) than the PECS inserts, irrespective of Although the PECS 9.3Ni sample had finer WC grains than the 9.3Ni (LPS) sample (both produced from nanoWC starting powders), its mean grain size was > The microstructure of the WC–0.5Cr Addition of 6.25 The sample wear rate reduced with increased sample hardness, showing that the abrasion resistance during sliding wear increased with WC grain size refinement and reduction of the binder amount, explaining the significantly higher abrasion wear resistance of the PECS 5M–7Ni samples compared to the LPS samples. However, the LPS inserts had much lower flank wear rates than the PECS inserts because of their significantly higher K Through pulse electric current sintering, different starting particle sizes, different binders and binder amounts and the use of Cr This work was financially supported by the
