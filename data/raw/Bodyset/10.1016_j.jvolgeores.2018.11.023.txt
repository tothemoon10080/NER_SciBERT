Studies on hydrothermal fluids circulation and tectonic structures improve the geothermal exploration and exploitation in Iceland. In this paper we present the results of an integrated study (structural, kinematic, fluid inclusions analyses) carried out on a fossil and exhumed geothermal system at Geitafell (SE Iceland), considered an analogue of the active Krafla geothermal system (NE Iceland). Our work is addressed to the relationships between the main structures and the paleo-geothermal fluids circulation at the boundary between the magma chamber (with magma of gabbroic composition) and host rocks, with the aim to get information on those factors having controlled the hydrothermal fluids flow, its storage and the rocks-fluid interaction, at 1–2 km crustal depth. The structural study is mostly based on defining the architecture of mineralized brittle shear zones, where, by measuring length and width of mineralized fractures, permeability was computed in 1.3 × 10−14 m2. As regards the hydrothermal paleo-fluids, fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz and calcite, usually associated with epidote and chlorite (i.e., the typical alteration minerals found in Icelandic geothermal fields), recorded a fluid circulation with temperature ranging from about 255 °C to 320 °C, and boiling at the highest temperature. Transient pressure drop, likely related to fracture opening and propagation during tectonic activity, triggered local boiling process testified by fluid inclusions in a calcite sample. During a late evolution the system progressively cooled down to 60–90 °C. Paleo-geothermal fluids were characterized by low-salinity meteoric water, although higher salinity fluids (up to 10.6 wt% NaCl equiv.) entered in the system and mixed with meteoric fluid. In the end, based on results from fluid inclusions, derived fluid density, permeability values and modeling of viscosity, hydraulic conductivity between 2.8 × 10−8 to 1.8 × 10−7 m/s, was also computed within the fluids-channelling brittle shear zones. We finally encourage the key-study of fossil geothermal systems as a tool for getting parameters commonly obtained after drilling in active systems.The unique geographic location and geological setting of Iceland enhance the three main factors controlling hydrothermal circulation, thus making this country one of the world's prime sites for geothermal energy production ( High heat flow: related to Iceland's location above an active mantle plume with a high rate of magma production ( Fracture systems: generated by tectonic activity ( Meteoric recharge: Icelandic geothermal fluids mainly derive from infiltration of meteoric waters ( Several methods have been applied to study the structural controls on geothermal fluid pathways, in Iceland. These include numerical simulations of fluid circulation (e.g. In order to contribute to the understanding of the deep roots of an Icelandic active geothermal system, we integrate structural, kinematic and fluid inclusion studies focused on a part of a fossil, exhumed, geothermal system located at the Geitafell area, in SE-Iceland, ( Our work aims to reconstruct the relationship between the main structures and geothermal fluid circulation at the boundary between the magma chamber and host rocks, at about 1–1.5 km depth ( Iceland is an emergent 300 × 500 km wide platform, of flood basalt and intrusive rocks. It is located at the divergent margins, separating the Eurasian and American plates, at the top of a mantle plume ( However, the boundary between the two plates, consisting of rift and transform zones ( Central volcanoes generally rest on a gentle synform consequent to the crustal deformation under the volcanic load ( Two main structural trends are regionally recognized in Iceland: (i) the SSW-NNE trend, represented by normal faults and extensional fissures ( Since the volcanic activity is directly connected to the crustal accretionary process at the divergent margins, central volcanoes have been progressively set apart from the main central rift. In this context the Geitafell volcano, believed to have been located in the rift valley ( Due to glacial erosion, the upper portion of the Geitafell magma chamber is, at present, partly exposed ( A new fieldwork (1:5.000 scale), kinematic - structural and fluid inclusions studies were carried out in ( At Geitafell, the most relevant intrusive phase (Phase 2 in The host rock consists of a NW-gently (10–20°) dipping thick basalt succession, made up of olivine tholeiite and feldspar porphyritic basalt flows ( Fault zones, both within tholeiitic basalt and gabbro, are characterized by up to 30 m thick damage zones and by several sub-parallel faults, isolating between them relatively undeformed rock volumes (lithons), up to 5 m thick ( Fault zone architecture was reconstructed in selected key outcrops ( From protolith to fault-core zone, the fault-related damage zones are characterized by an increased fracture density and by the occurrence of several slip-fault surfaces. With the double intent to have information on the fault architecture and to prepare the data collection for the permeability estimation (see further on), scan lines have been placed in selected areas where outcrops extended for >10 m. By this methodology, structural (attitude) and kinematic data on fractures and hydrothermal veins were recorded. The fault planes mostly contain calcite, quartz, chlorite and, occasionally, epidote slickensides ( Centimeter to dm-sized pockets of hydraulic breccia, mostly cemented by calcite, quartz and epidote are commonly distributed within the fault zones ( More than 500 structural and kinematic data were collected from 36 structural stations ( To evaluate permeability values controlling the fluid flow through structurally deep channels, the most accessible outcrops were chosen in order to apply the methodological approach described in Permeability can be mathematically estimated assuming a parallel plate model as a basis to evaluate the hydraulic conductivity of rock fractures, although fractures with permeability >10   Fractures wider than 2 mm are interpreted as the result of repeated deformational events and their deriving permeability values were considered reasonable only if k < 1 × 10 Scan lines (  Thus, permeability values range between 1 × 10 Hydrothermally altered and mineralized (epidote and chlorite) rock, hydraulically connected with shear zones, can be affected by hydrothermal circulation ( Samples for fluid inclusion analyses were taken at different locations in the Geitafell system and surroundings. A total of eleven samples were collected in basalts near the contact to the gabbro intrusion, at a distance less than some tens of meters. Six of the samples were from drill cores (GG1, GG2, GG7, Fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz, calcite and garnet were investigated in doubly polished 80–150 μm thick wafers. However, microthermometric data from garnet resulted inconsistent and they are therefore not reported in this paper. Samples from drill cores and the GE14 sample are pervasively replaced by secondary minerals and contain irregular amygdales (maximum sizes: up to 2 cm) and numerous relatively small (up to 1 cm) veins. Samples GE120 and GE117 ( The main hydrothermal phases observed in the samples examined for fluid inclusions are reported in Dimensions of fluid inclusions in quartz vary from 10 to 20 μm. In many cases these form small groups with a random distribution or, more rarely, occur along crystal growth zones ( Fluid inclusions are divided into three types, based on the phase assemblage observed at room temperature: i) two-phase liquid-rich (liquid + vapor) fluid inclusions (LV) ( Few groups of fluid inclusions in quartz also show typical necking-down features described in Fluid inclusion microthermometric measurements (see Appendix for analytical details) are summarized in T Whenever the morphology of VL inclusions was favourable, T Tm In quartz and calcite, Tm Few LV inclusions ( The discussion is focused on: (I) fluid composition and its origin; (II) structure settings; (III) permeability and hydraulic conductivity; and (IV) comparison with the Krafla geothermal system. The fossil Geitafell system is thought to have experienced a high-temperature evolution phase, where fluids existed in supercritical or super-heated conditions ( In general, VL and V in quartz and calcite are rare, suggesting that boiling was not a common process at the level of the examined samples. In quartz, VL and V inclusions do not coexist with LV inclusions (except in the case of necking-down process) and their presence is restricted to a few inclusion trails and clusters. These occurrences indicate that sporadic boiling occurred in the system, but not necessarily at the site of quartz precipitation ( Fluid inclusions analysis also showed that T In addition to fluid inclusions data, pressure-temperature at the time of the paleo-hydrothermal activity can be constrained considering that: i) the depth of 1–1.5 km estimated for the gabbro emplacement ( The maximum T Since deep parts of geothermal systems (similarly to the Geitafell hydrothermal system) are usually characterized by hydrodynamic pressure that is slightly (10%) higher than hot hydrostatic pressure ( If the depth of the examined samples was <1.4 km, the existence of a high-temperature boiling liquid phase could also be allowed if an ice sheet covering the Geitafell area pressurized the hydrothermal system, similar to what has already been suggested for the Reykjanes (Iceland) and Yellowstone (USA) geothermal systems (  Thus, considering a constant hot hydrostatic pressure of 115 bars at 1.5 km depth, the temperature range (255–320 °C) during the trapping of most of the fluid inclusions is constrained by the temperatures indicated by the isochore for a T After the main hydrothermal stage a cooling process is recorded by LV inclusions with lower T Salinities of fluid inclusions give information about the origin(s) of the fluid that flowed in the Geitafell system. Salinities are in the 0–0.2 wt% NaCl equiv. range and in the 0–1.5 wt% NaCl equiv. range for 65%, and 81% of total inclusion data, respectively. Such low salinities pointed to a meteoric or prevalently meteoric origin for the fluid as most of the recharging water of present-day exploited high-temperature geothermal systems in Iceland, except those in the Reykjanes ( However, in some cases, LV inclusions are characterized by higher salinity values. T However, only open-system boiling can produce high-salinity fluid from a low-salinity one ( Two main faults systems have been recognized, showing almost orthogonal relationships. Kinematics of both systems display a dominant normal component, although in the WNW-ESE trending faults an oblique left-lateral component is recognizable ( The fault damage zones of these structures display common features, independently of their azimuthal orientation and kinematic features. The main factor is the absence of a core zone as defined by an intense comminution of the rock-volume involved in the slip zones. This can be explained as a consequence of the recent fault activity (i.e. limited offset and frictional shearing) and by the textural and mechanical characteristics of the involved lithotypes, offering a high brittle resistance. Similar observations were also recognized in the Faraoe Islands, where a comparable brittle deformation has been observed in basaltic rocks ( Furthermore, the occurrence of the same hydrothermal mineral associations in NNE-SSW and WNW-ESE trending faults systems clearly indicate their coeval activity during geothermal fluid flow, at least from the time when the fluid deposited garnet (i.e. the hydrothermal mineral of higher temperature recognized in the area) close to the gabbro. No information about the relationships between this fault array and the emplacement of the gabbro is available. However, since the Icelandic tectonic regime is stable, it appears reasonable that even the emplacement of the magma was controlled by the interplay between transform and normal faults, as well as for the later hydrothermal fluid circulation. Finally, existing information from present fluid inclusion data and from isotope studies ( Eqs. (1) and (2) assumed width of fractures limited to <2 mm and permeability <10 Finally, porous rock-volumes can act as structural traps when the latter are hydraulically connected to the shear zones controlling the fluid flow. If this is the case, the hydrothermal fluids can laterally permeate through minor fractures and primary porosity and be stored ( Based on fluid inclusions results previously described (i.e. salinity, maximum and minimum pressure-temperature conditions), representative fluid inclusions values have been selected in order to better define the flow properties. In particular maximum and minimum fluid density and viscosity were computed through the software SoWat NaCl-H Considering permeability results in addition to the parameters listed in Hydraulic conductivity for the Geitafell area, calculated from the aforementioned permeability, density and viscosity values, ranges from 2.8 × 10 The fossil hydrothermal system of Geitafell shows major similarities with the Icelandic present-day systems ( Within the subfields of Krafla, the temperature distribution with depth follows the boiling point curve with depth in Sudurhlídar but remains constant at Leirbotnar (~205 °C) at a depth of 0.5–1.0 km, then it follows the boiling point curve below 1.2 km depth ( As regards the fracture array in Krafla, the main regional trend is defined by NNE-SSW normal faults, although from geophysical studies the WNW-ESE trending fractures have been recognized ( Finally, the hydrothermal paragenesis characterizing Krafla ( Through the study of exhumed geothermal systems and by integrating results from structural studies, fluid inclusion analyses and viscosity modeling, reliable parameters for fault array, estimation of permeability and hydraulic conductivity, have been provided. These parameters, normally obtained after drilling, can contribute to a better definition of predictive models, thus decreasing the exploration costs. Furthermore, a conceptual model on the relationships between geothermal fluid flow and geological structures was defined considering the faults damage zones as the main rock volume channelling and storing geothermal resources ( The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Microthermometric measurements were performed using a Linkam THMSG600 heating-freezing stages set on ZEISS POL-BK microscope at CNR-IGG of Firenze. The stage was calibrated by using pure H Generally, heating experiments were accomplished after freezing, especially for analysis on quartz. However, this sequence was reversed for the study of calcite, since due to its inelastic behaviour (
