High strength cold-reduced steel is typically of stress grade G550 (550 MPa nominal yield and tensile strength) and is less than 1 mm thick. The steel has been used for many years for sheeting and decking, but it is now used for structural members such as roof trusses and stud walls of steel framed houses. The steel has low strain hardening with a tensile to yield stress ratio of 1.0. This chapter summarizes a major research program on the stability of this steel at the University of Sydney. Short and long column compression members are tested and compared with design standards and finite element analyses (FEA). A range of stub columns in G550 sheet steel to AS 1397 has been tested in compression to obtain the strength characteristics of the steel with low strain-hardening. Pin-ended column tests with box-sections and constructed from high strength G550 steel are successfully performed. The plate slenderness (b/t) ranges from 33 to 119 and the column slenderness (L/rx) ranges from 27 to 148. A load eccentricity, which produces a column response equivalent to L/1000, is used for all tests.
