A dense microstructure was developed for the 0.95(Na0.5K0.5)NbO3–0.05BaTiO3 (0.95NKN–0.05BT) ceramics sintered at above 1050°C. Grain growth was observed in the specimens sintered at 1050–1060°C while a liquid phase was found in the specimens sintered at above 1050°C, which explained the increased sinterability and grain size. KTiNbO5 and Ba6Ti2Nb8O30 second phases were also observed for the specimens sintered at above 1060°C. Evaporation of Na2O was responsible for the formation of the liquid phase and the KTiNbO5 and Ba6Ti2Nb8O30 second phases. Muffling with 0.95NKN–0.05BT powders during the sintering improved the piezoelectric properties, possibly due to the increased poling efficiency resulting from the reduced Na2O evaporation.Pb(Zr The (1− The 0.95NKN–0.05BT ceramics were prepared from oxides of >99% purity by conventional solid-state synthesis.
