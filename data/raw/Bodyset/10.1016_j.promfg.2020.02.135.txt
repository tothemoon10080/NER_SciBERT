The present paper addresses grinding technologies for the production of rubber powder from end of life tyres (ELT) in industrial scale. Cryogenic grinding was compared with different ambient grinding processes using the same feedstock (truck or passenger car). Processing capacity, energy requirement, particle size distribution and morphology were determined. In addition, the influence of the underlying grinding process on the particle properties and those of the vulcanizates produced therewith are addressed.
