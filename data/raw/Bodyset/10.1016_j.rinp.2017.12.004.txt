High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) achieves the effective separation to fine weakly magnetic minerals through a magnetic matrix. In practice, the matrix is made of numerous magnetic wires, so that an insight into the magnetic capture characteristics of single wires to magnetic minerals would provide a basic foundation for the optimum design and choice of real matrix. The magnetic capture selectivity of cylindrical and rectangular single wires in concentrating ilmenite minerals were investigated through a cyclic pulsating HGMS separator with its key operating parameters (magnetic induction, feed velocity and pulsating frequency) varied, and their capture selectivity characteristics were parallelly compared with that of a real 3.0 mm cylindrical matrix. It was found that the cylindrical single wires have superior capture selectivity to the rectangular one; and, the single wires and the real matrix have basically the same capture trend with changes in the key operating parameters, but the single wires have a much higher capture selectivity than that of real matrix.High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) has achieved wide applications in the field of mineral processing in the recent 20–30 years In fact, numerous works have been reported on the material, geometry, orientation and magnetic field simulation In this work, the magnetic capture selectivity of cylindrical and rectangular single wires were investigated using a cyclic pulsating HGMS separator with its key operating parameters (magnetic induction, feed velocity and pulsating frequency) varied, and their capture selectivity characteristics were parallelly compared with that of a real 3.0 mm cylindrical matrix. A typical cyclic pilot-scale pulsating HGMS separator A low-grade ilmenite (FeTiO The Magnetic Capture Analysis (MCA) method In this investigation, cylindrical wires of 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mm diameters and a rectangular wire of 2.0 mm circumcircle diameter were used as single wires; for each kind of wire, 6 wires are inserted in the MCA method-made matrix at a distance of 15.0 mm in the horizontal direction and 40.0 mm in the vertical direction between wires, as shown in It should be noted that for all the investigations, the pulsating stroke of the pulsating HGMS separator is fixed at 6.0 mm, and the TiO Magnetic induction is a dominant parameter in the operation of pulsating HGMS process, and thus its influence on the capture selectivity was firstly investigated, at a controlled feed velocity of 4.36 cm/s and a pulsating frequency of 190 r/min. From But, the most important discovery of this investigation is that the single wires have achieved a much higher capture selectivity than that of the real matrix; e.g., at the optimum magnetic induction of 0.7 T, the TiO It is clear that the capture selectivity of single wires is not so sensitive to the variations in the magnetic induction after it reached 0.7 T, as that of real matrix; namely, the single wires maintain high capture selectivity even under strong magnetic inductions. In a pulsating HGMS process, the feed velocity and the pulsating frequency of slurry in the separating zone of the separator determine the hydrodynamic drag acting upon a magnetic particle, thereby generating their effects on the capture selectivity. As shown in The hydrodynamic drag resulting from feed velocity in pulsating HGMS process is a competing force against the capture of magnetic particles by magnetic force, so that its variation changes the capture selectivity. It is sufficiently inferable from From  The cylindrical single wires have superior capture selectivity to the rectangular one, and this capture rule was reconfirmed in this investigation. The single wires and the real matrix follow the same capture selectivity trend when the key parameters of pulsating HGMS separator vary, but the single wires have a much higher capture selectivity than that of real matrix. Both the single magnetic wires and the real matrix have the most optimum values for the operating parameters of a HGMS process, to reach the highest capture selectivity. For the present ilmenite material, the single cylindrical and rectangular wires and the real matrix have basically the same optimum magnetic induction and feed velocity, but the real matrix requires a slightly smaller pulsating frequency than that of single wires.
