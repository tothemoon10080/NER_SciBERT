A computer code based on a Pitzer model has been developed for the comprehensive prediction of the thermodynamic properties of MgCl2–HCl aqueous solutions over a wide range of conditions from 25 to 120 °C and from 0–350 g L−1 chloride. This code was applied to the calculation of (i) water activities and mean ionic activity coefficients for mixed aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and magnesium chloride over a wide range of concentrations and to 100 °C, (ii) solubilities of MgCl2·6H2O in MgCl2–HCl solutions to 80 °C, (iii) partial pressures of HCl(g) and H2O(g) over MgCl2–HCl aqueous solutions at various temperatures and (iv) partial pressures of HCl(g) at the normal boiling point of these mixed electrolyte solutions. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data and confirm evidence from the literature that MgCl2(aq) and HCl(aq) mix almost ideally at constant water activity.The aim of this work is to consider the thermodynamic activities of chemical species in electrolyte solutions comprising mixtures in aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and magnesium chloride. This can assist in the development of high concentration chloride leaching processes ( Strong chloride brine chemistry, with emphasis on how to control water activity, hydrogen ion activity and chloride concentration has been shown to permit the selective leaching of nickel and cobalt from an iron–magnesium matrix ( There is a considerable body of experimental data and theoretical analysis reported in the chemical literature pertaining to the electrolyte solutions of interest in this work. More than a dozen papers have been located dealing specifically with HCl−MgCl Modern ideas of how activities vary in concentrated electrolyte solutions stem from the work on ionic hydration in 1948 of Stokes and Robinson ( In addition to hydration, Stokes and Robinson of course took account of the long-range electrostatic attractions between ions that had been characterized well beforehand for dilute solutions by Debye and Hückel. However, several other factors affecting activities in concentrated electrolyte solutions, which are now clearly recognised as important, were not included by them. In particular, there are phenomena associated with the physical size of ions which influence both the long-range Debye–Hückel attractions and the short-range repulsions arising as the bulk solvent progressively disappears and the ions become forced physically to pack together. Consequently, the hydration equations of Stokes and Robinson have proved inadequate for describing activity coefficient change in electrolyte solutions. Hence, various approaches to modelling the thermodynamic behaviour of concentrated aqueous electrolyte solutions have superseded that of Stokes and Robinson ( Despite the widespread application of these various equations, they all exhibit certain significant weaknesses. Primarily this is because they are empirical in nature, essentially requiring that their parameters be determined by regression of measured data. Being without sound underlying fundamental constraints, these models are highly susceptible to parameter correlation and consequent error propagation. Extrapolations beyond the range of data used in their parameterization must accordingly be made with considerable caution. Nevertheless, of the modern approaches that might be used, the Pitzer equations unquestionably constitute the method of choice for modelling the As far as the effects of temperature variation are concerned, there are sound reasons for thinking that this will not be problematic in the present context. Good evidence in the literature ( Ionic hydration and activities in electrolyte solutions, including HCl and MgCl Jansz provides a comparison of hydration numbers at infinite dilution (and 25 °C) as follows: In a comprehensive study of the mean activity coefficients of alkali halides at higher temperatures ( It is evident from these reports that there is no consensus. Difficulties are compounded further by differences arising from the nature of the experimental technique employed ( Moreover, as the paper by Jansz himself makes clear ( On the other hand, hydration Hydration theory, in particular, provides a fundamentally sound approach towards the partitioning of thermodynamic activity between ionic species ( The effect in general of added electrolyte on the activity coefficient of HCl is clearly demonstrated by an early study of Harned who investigated mixtures with LiCl, NaCl and KCl. As the ability of the electrolytes to sequester water decreases (relative to HCl itself), the activity coefficient falls. It is interesting that LiCl has the least effect, which can be interpreted as meaning that solvent water is approximately as tightly bound to Li A key insight in the present context is that  Zdanovskii's rule is important because it provides a criterion for ideal mixing, i.e. the apparent lack of interaction (other than through changes in solvation) between the component electrolytes ( For example, for mixtures involving HCl, NaCl, KCl, MgCl As a further example, consider the solubility of MgCl The activity coefficient data for hydrochloric acid solutions have been reviewed and re-evaluated recently ( HCl is one of the most well studied electrolytes in aqueous solution, being experimentally easy and precise to determine, by potentiometric and other methods, achieving results with an exceptionally high general consistency. Many reliable studies have been performed at 25 °C on solutions up to 2 mol kg At other temperatures, the number of useful values is “much smaller”; nevertheless, multiple, independent measurements of high quality have been made, particularly for dilute solutions, and there is satisfactory agreement between different experimental techniques. A selection of the recommended data ( The available data for HCl(aq) at higher concentrations and temperatures are more limited ( The quality and range of these data for hydrochloric acid make a detailed consideration of the primary literature in this area unnecessary. Suffice it to say that there are hundreds of such papers. A few of the most important and dealing solely with HCl ( Aqueous solutions of magnesium chloride have received much attention, both experimentally and in the development of theory. Measurements of current interest include: Activity and osmotic coefficients at 25 °C ( Enthalpies of dilution ( Heat capacities of solutions from 80 to 200 °C ( Volumes (densities) at various temperatures ( Although modelling the thermodynamic properties of these MgCl Lietzke and Stoughton provide a simple equation for the calculation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for MgCl Pitzer equations for MgCl A general, three-parameter model has been used, apparently with good success ( Activity coefficients of various mixed electrolytes in water, including HCl, have been studied for many years ( Activity coefficients at different temperatures have been published subsequently on a good number of occasions ( There are even some data for the thermodynamic properties of the quaternary solution mixtures HCl− NaCl−MgCl It can be concluded that the osmotic properties of HCl−MgCl There is accordingly no plausible evidence to quantify the formation of any complex or ion pair in these solutions. Changing the relative amounts of each component electrolyte at constant water activity causes only a linear change in the Gibbs energy of the system. Despite the difference in ionic charge between H Solutions in which HCl and MgCl For example, activity coefficients for the system NaCl−MgCl Some other relevant reports include: Studies of magnesium chloride solutions with sodium chloride ( Studies of hydrochloric acid and other electrolytes ( Some reported enthalpies of mixing ( A recent comparison ( Pertinent to the above discussion of the apparent absence of ion pair formation, the difficulties of characterising weak chloro complex formation, in this case by copper(II), have been described ( It is known that first row transition metal ions such as nickel(II), cobalt(II) and iron(II) form double salts from aqueous solutions of alkali metal chlorides ( Various hydrated forms of magnesium chloride are known to exist. For the conditions of interest to this study, only MgCl The most comprehensive Pitzer models for the two binary aqueous systems (comprising one electrolyte and the solvent) of relevance to this study have been derived by researchers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The ORNL HCl(aq) models ( Standard Pitzer model, valid from 273–523 K and 0–7 mol kg Pitzer model with fourth virial coefficient, valid from 273–523 K and 0–16 mol kg Pitzer model with a non-zero value of The models calculate thermodynamic properties in a consistent way; only volumes (densities) are not treated explicitly ( Model (a) has been used for the following calculations, as significant additional coding is required to implement model (b). Model (c) is not needed for temperatures below 250 °C. The choice of model (a) leads to small inaccuracies at HCl molalities greater than 7 mol kg A model describing volumes and heat capacities of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid at temperatures from 298.15 to 623 K and pressures up to 28 MPa has been reported ( Three versions of Pitzer models have been proposed. The ORNL group has derived Pitzer models for alkaline earth metal chloride solutions ( Other authors ( Wang et al. have derived an extended Pitzer model of aqueous magnesium chloride based on experimental data from 240 to 627 K at pressures to 100 MPa and molalities to 25 mol kg Model (a) was implemented as it had been established in test calculations that it reproduces water activities accurately to 5.5 mol kg Pitzer mixing parameters θ To calculate liquid–vapour equilibria, thermodynamic data for HCl(g) were implemented in the final model. The vapour phase is modelled as nonideal gas; however, deviations from ideality are small for the conditions of this study. The mixing parameter For the calculation of solubilities, thermodynamic data for MgCl Since calculated solubilities in mixed electrolyte solutions are particularly sensitive to the mixing parameters The present Pitzer model predicts compositions of ternary HCl–MgCl These graphs show the water activity, The calculated variation of log γ(MgCl Water activities and mean activity coefficients vary only slightly with composition when the total chloride molality is kept constant ( Note that the water activities and activity coefficients for the pure components (HCl and MgCl Predicted values refer to the normal boiling points at a pressure of 1 atm (shown in The HCl mole fractions in the gas phase increase with MgCl The volatility of hydrochloric acid is likely to be of practical consequence at superambient temperatures. The partitioning of HCl between liquid and vapour phases from 50–350 °C has been well characterised ( A literature review has shown that for mixed aqueous solutions of HCl and MgCl
