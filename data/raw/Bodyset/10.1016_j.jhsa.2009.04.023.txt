Fracture–dislocations in the small joints of the fingers are challenging injuries. The surgeon must choose an appropriate treatment based on fracture pattern, joint stability, and injury chronicity. Fracture–dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint are notoriously unforgiving, with potential long-term sequelae of residual pain and stiffness. Similar injuries in the distal interphalangeal joint are more tolerant of fracture displacement and even joint subluxation. Dorsal dislocations of the metacarpophalangeal joint may be associated with shearing fractures of the metacarpal head but are most notable for the volar plate interposition that may block closed reduction.
