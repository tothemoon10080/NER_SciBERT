ZrB2-based ultra-high temperature composites reinforced with SiC and nano-ZrO2 particles were hot pressed. Taguchi method was used in order to investigate the effect of ZrO2/SiC volume ratio as well as the hot pressing parameters on the mechanical behavior of the composites. The significance of each parameter over the relative density and Vickers hardness of the hot pressed composites and also, optimum conditions to get a composite with maximum relative density and hardness were estimated according to the statistical analyses. The highest Vickers hardness of ~15.4GPa was achieved for the composite with ZrO2/SiC ratio of 0.2 hot pressed at 1850Â°C for 90min under 12MPa. Mentioned parameters were found to be the optimum condition for the Vickers hardness proposed by Taguchi method. A fracture toughness of 6.7MPam2 was also measured for the mentioned composite which was nearly fully densified (98% relative density) at optimum conditions. Crack deflection, crack branching, microcracking and crack arresting were found to be the dominant toughening mechanisms contributing in the fracture toughness enhancement.Zirconium diboride (ZrB In conclusion, it should be noted that sintering aids are usually used to enhance the densification and sometimes boost the sintering process (by reactive sintering mechanism). However, they may lead to a decrease in some mechanical properties such as fracture toughness, especially when cause liquid phase formation at interfaces which may intensify the grain coarsening It has been reported that in hot pressing of ZrB Hot pressing of ZrB According to the measured amounts of the fracture toughness which are presented in It has been reported that although ZrO Whereas the effect of zirconia on the densification behavior of ZrB Nowadays, to study the effect of different parameters with a variety of levels on the properties and characterization of the materials or composites produced by different processes, statistical design of the experiment is an advantageous technique compared to the classic methods. Statistical design of the experiment predicts the optimal conditions to achieve the composite with desired characteristics and properties Commercially available ZrB Scanning electron microscope (Czech Republic, Mira3 Tescan) equipped with Energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS, DXP-X10P Digital X-Ray Processor) and X-ray diffraction analysis (Siemens D5000: Cu lamp, Vickers hardness test equipment (ZHV 10, Zwick Roell, Germany) was used (using a load of 49 Fracture toughness ( where In which As it (was) mentioned in Part I of this research SEM micrograph of a polished surface of the sample E3 is presented in The mean relative density and Vickers hardness values for all nine Taguchi-proposed samples ( Statistical analysis of the measured relative densities was carried out by Qualitek-4 software in order to get the main effect plot of each parameter. Main effect plot of each parameter, which specifies the changes in S/N ratio for relative density, are depicted in The influence of parameters (significances) on the relative density as an output characteristic is calculated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and summarized at According to the S/N analysis of measured values for Vickers hardness, the main effect plot for each parameter is obtained and depicted in Based on the average analysis of the measured Vickers hardness values, the contribution of each parameter over the hardness of the composites at the optimal condition were calculated and are shown in Surprisingly, the predicted optimal conditions matched the processing parameters of sample 9. Therefore, the anticipated hardness value by Taguchi method at optimal conditions can be verified by the experimental measurements of sample 9. As the predicted and experimentally measured values of hardness are 15.35 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate the influence of parameters on the Vickers hardness of the hot pressed composites; the results are presented in In this study, only specimen 9 (the optimum sample) reached a high relative density (~98%) and the amounts of residual pores in the microstructure of other specimens were significant. Hence, due to the presence of porosity in the polished surfaces of porous samples, the indentation-induced cracks were not simply perceivable. Therefore, such measurements were not reliable because of the interactions between the cracks and the pores. The indentation method was only performed for specimen 9, which was hot pressed at 1850 The SEM micrographs of crack propagating paths, initiated from the corners of Vickers indentation on the polished surface of specimen 9, are shown in Supplementally, the enhanced fracture toughness value of specimen 9 indicates that SiC particulates can also play an effective role in crack branching as a result of the thermal expansion mismatch between SiC and both of ZrB In this research, mechanical behavior of hot pressed ZrB The authors would like to thank the Advanced Ceramic Research Group (ACRG), University of Tabriz, Iran and Arta Pajouhesh Kaveh Engineering Co. for their supports.
