In this paper, the current status of the modeling, simulation and control of the copper leaching, solvent-extraction and electrowinmng process (LX/SX/EW) is reviewed. A prototype of a novel process monitoring system, based on copper solvent extraction steady-state mass balances, is described as the first step of an advanced process control system development. An implementation is also presented. Finally, the off-line testing results obtained with actual plant data are presented and discussed.
