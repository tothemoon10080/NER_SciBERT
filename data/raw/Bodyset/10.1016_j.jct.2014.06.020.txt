(2010) [29] using the same calorimeter, but this method has the advantage that measurements could be made at much lower concentrations in the presence of an excess concentration of ligand. To our knowledge, these are the first standard partial molar heat capacities measured under hydrothermal conditions by the integral heat of solution method in a commercial calorimeter to be reported in the literature.The thermodynamic properties of aqueous metal complexes under hydrothermal conditions are required to model mass transport and corrosion in a variety of areas, including geochemistry, hydrometallurgy, electric power cycle chemistry, and many industrial processes. Many of these applications rely on semi-empirical models, such as the on the HKF equations developed by Helgeson and co-workers Calorimetric methods for measuring the apparent molar heat capacities of aqueous solutes, An alternative approach, developed by Criss and Cobble The purpose of the present research is to explore the use of a commercial Tian–Calvet calorimeter for determining standard partial molar heat capacities under hydrothermal conditions by the integral heat of solution method. The aqueous aluminate ion, Al(OH) This paper reports values for the standard partial molar heat capacity of Al(OH) MilliQ nanopure water with an electrical resistivity of 18.2 A Setaram Model C-80 calorimeter was used for our calorimetric measurements. The calorimeter has been designed for operation at high pressures (up to 10 The Setaram C-80 heat flow calorimeter is made of two identical tubular wells, symmetrically located about the center line in an accurately thermostated aluminum block. Each well is surrounded by a thermopile (fluxmeter), which measures the heat flux between to or from the aluminum block. The two fluxmeters are designed identically and are connected in opposition to give a differential thermopile output. This differential arrangement is designed to compensate for the influence of the surroundings on the experiments. Two cells, identical in design, are made to fit snugly into the wells. One cell acts as a sample/measurement cell and the other as a reference cell. Hence, a caloric effect inside the cell results in a heat flow between the cell and the thermopile, thus leading to a time-dependent thermoelectric voltage signal proportional to the heat transferred between the cell and the thermocouple. The temperature of the calorimeter was calibrated by measuring the temperatures of fusion of indium (DSC Calibration Standard, NIST SRM 2232) and tin (mass fraction purity 0.99998, Aldrich) for scan rates of (0.05, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) The high pressure “batch” cells, used in this study, were hastelloy C-276 cylinders with threaded top caps, supplied by Setaram. Each cell could be securely closed and sealed with a nickel ring supplied by Setaram, using a torque wrench (35 An ampoule-breaking system was used to initiate the heat of solution reaction.
