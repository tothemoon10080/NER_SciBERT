Flotation is a difficult process to run efficiently. One way to make flotation performance better is to improve cell level control. However, controlling pulp levels in flotation cells is a complex control task because of strong interactions between the levels in flotation cells. Therefore advanced controllers are needed to give good level control. This paper deals with a model of six flotation cells in series. Simulations are performed to compare different control strategies. Four control strategies are considered: one SISO controller and three different MIMO controllers. It is shown that level control performances of the MIMO controllers are significantly better than that of the classical SISO controller.
