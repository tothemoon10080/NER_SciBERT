                      alloys, where x ranges from 0 to 100, prepared by a combination of aqueous and solid-state reduction processes have been studied vis-à-vis their microstructure. The microstructural studies indicate the formation of near-equilibrium phases in the alloys with crystallite size in the range 20–40nm. The crystallite size in the case of pure Fe and Ni, however, is in the range 40–80nm. The electrical transport in the temperature range 20–300K exhibits a typical ferromagnetic metallic behavior in all the cases and the absolute resistivity of nanocrystalline Fe100−

                      alloys decreases monotonically with increasing Ni content. The saturation magnetization of the alloys on the other hand decreases progressively with Ni addition towards that of pure Ni value. The coercivity of alloys is found to be independent of temperature in the range 5–300K except in the case of pure Ni wherein it increases from 30Oe at 300K to 65Oe at 5K. The electrical and magnetic properties of the nanocrystaline Fe–Ni alloys do not follow the predictions of simple itinerant band model for alloys. The temperature dependence of saturation magnetization in all the cases has a T

Gaps appear in the electron density of states leading to quantization, which affects the electronic behavior when the size is reduced to tens of nanometers in semiconductors while in the case of metals the size limit to observe such effects is much lower. Hence the transport behavior of nanosized metals, excluding clusters, is never investigated in detail and conventional scattering theories are used to analyze the transport behavior. The combination of nanosize and alloying on the other hand can change the transport behavior and a study of this phenomenon forms one of the objectives of this work. The macroscopic magnetic behavior of transition metals, however, undergoes continuous changes as a function of physical size. A typical ferromagnetic material undergoes a magnetic phase transition to superparamagnetism when the size is reduced and this critical size varies between 10 and 100 The Fe–Ni alloys belong to a technologically important class of alloy systems called permalloys because of their soft magnetic properties which can be varied by varying the alloy composition in the range 50–80 The nanocrystalline pure metal and alloy powders, Fe The structural characterization, phase identification, grain size determination and compositional analysis were done by a combination of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the alloys given in The X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from the Fe It is interesting to observe that alloy formation takes place as per the equilibrium phase diagram The temperature dependence of the resistivity in the range 20–300 The magnetization of nanocrystalline alloys, Fe and Ni, was studied as a function of external field The electrical transport behavior of ferromagnetic metals and alloys below the Curie temperature The absolute value of resistivity is found to decrease monotonically with addition of Ni to Fe. This can be understood in the context of band formation in Fe–Ni alloys. In the case of pure Ni the Fermi energy lies exclusively in the minority spin band, whereas in the case of Fe it cuts across both the majority and minority spin bands The magnetic hysteresis loops show clearly the ferromagnetic nature of all the alloys below 300 The magnetization of ferromagnetic metals and alloys depends on the band structure and hence the composition of the alloys. The main contribution to magnetic behavior therefore is by the 3d electrons and a change in composition, which changes the 3d electron population, will result in a change in magnetic behavior. The band structure of ferromagnetic transition metal alloys is generally understood within the framework of itinerant electrons model.
