Nanofibers as niche-biomimetic scaffolds hold promise in guided bone regeneration (GBR). Here we fabricated poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/poly(caprolactone) (PCL)-doped octacalcium phosphate (OCP) nanofiber membranes via electrospinning and investigated the osteogenic behavior of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the membranes. By adjusting different ratio of OCP to PLGA/PCL, three hybrid stents including PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP, PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP were successfully prepared. The PLGA/PCL/OCP membranes showed a decrease in fiber diameter compared with PLGA/PCL, leading to enhanced mechanical strength. In-vitro studies showed that PLGA/PCL/OCP membranes better supported cell adhesion, spreading and proliferation than PLGA/PCL. The incorporation of OCP via electrospinning also endowed the membranes with osteoinductive capacity, as evidenced by activation of ALP activity, increased gene expression of bone specific markers (such as Runx2, ALP, Col 1a1, OPN, OCN, BMP2), and mineral nodules formation compared to PLGA/PCL. Comparatively, PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP showed better mechanical and biological performance than PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP, demonstrating the role of OCP in nanofiber membranes. Thus, the electrospun PLGA/PCL/OCP nanofiber membranes can be potentially developed as a promising hybrid stent for GBR.Nanofibers which are generally accepted as niche-biomimetic scaffolds hold promise in guided bone regeneration (GBR). Numerous biodegradable polymers have been used for fabrication of nanofibers. Among various polymers, PLGA that has excellent biodegradability and minimal cytotoxicity, and has been certified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the medical field, received much attention [ Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) has been demonstrated as a nucleus for initiating bone deposition, which promotes osteoblastic differentiation in the early stage [ In this study, we fabricated PLGA/PCL/OCP nanofiber membranes by electrospinning for guided bone regeneration. OCP-HFIP solution was mixed with PLGA/PCL (7:3, w/w)-HFIP solution at the ratio of 0:100, 2:98, 4:96, forming three different nanofibers membranes via electrospinning, which was PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP and PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP. We then examined the mechanical and biological properties of electrospinning PLGA/PCL/OCP scaffolds by SEM, FTIR, XRD, CCK8, Flow Apoptosis detections. Further, osteogenic potential of the nanofiber membranes was also investigated. These nanofiber membranes may be potentially developed as regenerative materials for GBR. Electrospun PLGA/PCL nanofibers (7:3, w/w) were prepared based on the previous research [ Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of electrospinning nanofibers. All membranes were sputtered with gold layer and then analyzed by SEM (Zeiss, SIGMA 500/VP, Germany). The average diameter of the fibers was also determined based on the SEM image and at least 50 fiber diameters were measured using Image J software. To observe fine structure characterization, fibers were sprayed onto a copper grid for transmission electron microscope (TEM, LVEM5B) detection. The nanofibers (PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP, PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mechanical properties. For FTIR measurements, the samples (PLGA, PCL, OCP, PLGA/PCL nanofibers, and PLGA/PCL/OCP nanofibers) were tested by a spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Spectrum100, USA) within the range of 400–4000 cm In the degradation tests, the fiber membranes were initially measured for the original weight, and then added into a closed vial containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a weight ratio of 1:1000. All the samples in vials were subjected to a horizontal shaker set at 100 rpm and incubated at 37 °C up to 30 days. Three samples were taken every week, washed three times with deionized water and then freeze dried. The membranes after different periods of incubation were calculated for the residual weight. All experiments involved with animals were performed following the Animal Ethics Committee standards of the Guangxi Medical University. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (approximately 3-5 days) were provided by Animal Experimental Center of Guangxi Medical University. The marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) rats were isolated from Sprague-Dawley (SD) based on the previous research [ Before seeding, nanofiber membranes were tailored into discs with a diameter of 15 mm and placed into 24-well culture plates. Then the nanofiber membranes were sterilized in 75% ethanol for 2 h and PBS supplied with 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 4 h. After dried, the samples were sterilized under UV irradiation for another 6 h. The MSCs were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 Cell activity was detected using Live-Dead Cell Staining Kit (Invitrogen, USA). MSCs- membranes were incubated with a 1 μM calcein-AM and 1 μM PI for 5 min in dark box following the manufacturer's instructions. Washed with PBS three times later, the samples were observed and captured images by Fluorescence imaging microscope (Olympus BX53, Japan). The cell morphology and spreading, as well as cell interaction with the nanofiber membranes were observed using SEM after cultured for 3 days. For detection of cell apoptosis, the MSCs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 To investigate the osteogenic induction of the hybrid stent, the MSCs were seeded on nanofibers scaffolds and cultured in SD Rat Mesenchymal Stem Cell Osteogenic Differentiation Medium (Cyagen, Guangzhou, China) for 3, 7 and 14 days. The expression of osteogenic related genes including runt-related transcription factor 2 ( The quantification of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was tested by ELISA assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The OD values of each sample were measured by a microplate reader at 520 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To evaluated mineralization, the MSCs were cultured on nanofiber scaffolds and collected after a week for SEM and Alizarin Red S detection. The samples were washed with PBS, fixed with glutaraldehyde for 2 h, and then washed with PBS for three times. After a gradient series of ethanol (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%) dehydration and dry by vacuum, the samples were coated with gold and observed by SEM (TESCAN, VEGA3) and EDC (EDAX, GENESIS Apex Apollo). In Alizarin Red S staining, the cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 30 mins, then stained with 1.0% Alizarin Red S solution (Sorlaibio, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer instructions and incubated for 5 mins. After the removal of Alizarin Red S solution, the samples were washed three times with PBS and then imaging was performed. All data were analyzed with the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical differences were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A value of The PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2%OCP, PLGA/PCL/4%OCP nanofiber scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning. As shown in the SEM images in FTIR and XRD were used to measure the nanofibrous samples to further confirm the chemical constitute of the nanofibrous scaffolds. As is shown in The XRD spectra of the electrospun nanofibrous are shown in The degeneration assays ( The mechanical properties of PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP, PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP nanofibrous scaffolds were tested and the results were listed in The proliferation and cytotoxicity of nanofibrous scaffolds on MSCs was measured by CCK-8 assay. The MSCs were cultured on nanofibrous scaffolds for 3 days. As showed in To further evaluate cell apoptosis on the nanofibrous scaffolds, flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic MSCs. As shown in The activity of MSCs seeded on the nanofiber membranes, viable cells and dead cells were determined based on FDA/PI staining. As shown in The cell morphology and spreading, as well as cell interaction with the electrospun fibrous scaffolds were observed using SEM ( To investigate the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on the nanofibrous scaffolds, qRT-PCR was performed to determine the gene expression levels of Mineralization of MSCs on PLGA/PCL, PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP and PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP scaffolds was investigated by SEM. As shown in To verify the formation and nature of the crystals, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the mineral elements of PLGA/PCL/OCP nanofiber scaffolds was tested. As showed in The ALP activity of MSCs that cultured on various scaffolds was shown in Alizarin Red S staining was used to detect mineral nodule formation of MSCs cultured on different nanofiber scaffolds. As shown in In this study, we fabricated a nanofiber PLGA/PCL/OCP membrane for GBR by electrospinning, which showed excellent mechanical strength and favorable biocompatibility for MSCs. The in vitro experiments demonstrated the PLGA/PCL/OCP facilitated cell adhesion, proliferation of MSCs and differentiation towards the osteoblastic lineage without the addition of pro-osteogenic growth factors or cytokines. The incorporation of OCP in PLGA/PCL effectively increased mechanical properties of the membrane. Compared with PLGA/PCL, decrease of the fiber diameter in PLGA/PCL/OCP ( Besides of superior mechanical properties, the PLGA/PCL/OCP nanofiber membrane exhibited favorable biocompatibility and affinity to MSCs, as demonstrated by the low cytotoxicity, decreased apoptosis and high cell viability ( Osteoinduction capacity of PLGA/PCL/OCP membranes was also superior to PLGA/PCL scaffolds, which was confirmed by the higher gene expression of bone-related markers ( In summary, OCP-incorporated PLGA/PCL nanofiber membranes fabricated by electrospinning exhibited favorable mechanical properties and biological performance, facilitating osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of MSCs. Comparatively, PLGA/PCL/4wt%OCP showed better mechanical and biological performance than PLGA/PCL/2 wt%OCP, verifying the role of OCP in nanofiber membranes.
