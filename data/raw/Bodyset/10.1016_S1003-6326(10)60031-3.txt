The waste water system generated in the process of production of cuprous chloride was studied. The existing forms of copper in the system and the influence of temperature and pH on the existing forms of copper ion were analyzed and determined through calculating the coefficients of copper complex distribution. In the waste water system, the main forms of copper are CuSO4, Cu2+, CuCl+, CuCl2
                     −, and CuCl3
                     2−. Temperature has little influence on the distribution coefficient of Cu(II), but has significant influence on distribution coefficient of Cu(I). With the increase of temperature, the distribution coefficient of CuCl2
                     −, increases significantly while the distribution coefficient of CuCl3
                     2− decreases. The pH has nearly no influence on the distribution coefficients of various Cu(I)-compounds, but has sizable influence on the distribution coefficients of Cu(II)-compounds. With the increase of pH, the distribution coefficient of CuSO4(aq) increases while the distribution coefficients of Cu2+ and CuCl+ decrease. According to these results, the anion resin of 201×7 OH− and the cation resin of 732 Na were chosen to dispose the waste water solution of cuprous chloride. Finally, 97.9% copper in the waste water is recovered.
