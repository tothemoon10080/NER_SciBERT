A study has been conducted on Au-bearing complex sulfide ore feed and autoclave tailings from the Getchell mine, Nevada. In this study products at different stages of an autoclave process were studied and identification of the source of low recovery in some Au-bearing sulfide ores located. All samples were studied to assess the occurrence of gold and to identify poor performance ores under the standard operating conditions of the autoclave mill.
                  The results show that in the high recovery samples, gold occurs predominately as chemically included atoms within arsenian pyrite. This pyrite is exposed on crushing and oxidises almost completely within the autoclave. Typically recoveries are above 90% for such ore.
                  Where poor recovery is observed, two modes of occurrence are observed in the feed that may prevent complete oxidation of the arsenian pyrite:

                           Arsenian pyrite occurs as fine inclusions (<40μm in size) within quartz and illite, even with fine grinding it appears from residues. Such pyrite is not exposed and thus does not get oxidised.

In the extraction of precious metals from complex sulfide ores the mineral host for the precious metal can often be a sulfide or metal alloy phase in which the precious metal occurs as a trace constituent (Chryssoulis et al., 1987; Traditionally, complex selective extraction or diagnostic leaching protocols have been developed in an attempt to overcome this problem ( In an attempt to overcome these problems a method of quantified mineral balance for precious metals has been developed that relies on conventional mineralogical analysis coupled with the use of laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LAICPMS, To investigate problems of gold recovery from different ores at the Getchell mine, Nevada, a mineralogical and mineral chemistry study of ore types, mill feed and products from the Autoclave gold processing operation has been undertaken. The motivation for such a study is to identify the major hosts for gold so as to explain variations associated with gold recovery. Samples were collected from underground exposures, drill core, and ore feed material at Getchell mill and analysed (discussed in detail in All samples were analysed by X-ray Diffraction for bulk mineralogy estimates using a Phillips PW1390 fitted with PC IDENT software.

Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry for trace element determination (discussed below). Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LAICPMS) has been applied to the in situ analysis of minerals in this study by ablation using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 The size of the beam is typically 5–10 At this beam size diameter the detection of gold may indicate the presence of particulate gold (typically <1 Gold grade was determined by standard fire assay and atomic absorption analysis after MIBK pre-concentration. Mass balance calculation of gold occurrence in head samples and residue solids using the methodology of Native gold observed in Getchell sulfide ores is generally in the range of <1–20 Gold was identified by LAICPMS in several minerals ( Quartz has also been found to host sub-micron gold which has been identified by LAICPMS in levels from <1–215 From this study a major host for gold in the Getchell orebodies has been clearly identified as fine grained arsenian pyrite as indicated from early experimental work ( Higher Au concentrations were observed for fine grained and fractured pyrite grains ( The mineralogy of the test autoclave samples is shown in The presence of calcite and gypsum in the tailings samples from these indicate that hydration and carbonation of anhydrite (that forms in the autoclave) has occurred indicating atmospheric alteration of the samples. However this is believed to have little effect on any significant gold host within the sample material. The feed sample (Rho D, 97 67/1) is a fairly typical black shale ore with a relatively simple mineralogy of quartz with accessory pyrite and trace clay minerals. Arsenian pyrite is the only gold-bearing phase in the sample and hosts up to 350 The tailings comprise of quartz with anhydrite and gypsum with minor calcite, hematite, kaolinite and scorodite. An interesting observation of the autoclave residues is that scorodite has only been observed in the two samples associated with high gold recoveries (Rho D and Sigma W), and within these two samples no pyrite was observed and the only other iron phase is hematite indicating complete oxidation. Elsewhere arsenic is still present as precursor arsenian pyrite and realgar or as other arsenates (mainly amorphous) or associated with goethite and jarosite. Possibly for these latter poor-recovery samples incomplete autoclave oxidation took place, hence lower recoveries. Realgar and scorodite in the sample contained only trace gold (maximum of 5 analyses out of 30 with 5–10 The sample 9767/2 and associated tails, 2267 (Rho B) are also a black shale ore from the same hole as Rho D. However the mineralogy is more complex with free carbon and complex clays such as montmorillionite present as well. The only gold bearing phase recognised in this sample is arsenian pyrite of the size fraction <1–46 The tailings sample contains 0.111 opt Au but no native gold or gold amalgam was observed in the section. Arsenian pyrite, included within montmorillonite and quartz however, showed high gold values, up to 5 As with Rho D, the sample (Sigma W, feed 9787/1 and tailings 2807T) was a fairly simple quartz-pyrite-illite composite. The only gold bearing phase observed was arsenian pyrite and this hosted 230 The tailings sample contains trace amounts of arsenian pyrite encapsulated within quartz and illite. Gold is largely associated with pyrite or quartz and there is some encapsulation of either native gold or gold-bearing arsenian pyrite. Trace amounts of gold were recorded by LAICPMS analysis of mixed layer clays, illite and carbon. The Sigma Y (9782/2 feed and 2800 tailings) sample represents material from the same hole as Sigma W. This material came from a low angle shear zone approximately 200 Tailings sample, 2800T from the autoclave oxidation of Sigma Y, shows a high concentration of gypsum with trace anhydrite and calcite indicating marked post-testwork alteration of the sample. Additionally goethite and jarosite are present with less hematite than observed with Sigma W indicating either post testwork alteration or incomplete oxidation during the autoclave testing. Gold was observed in the section as a single 40 Sigma G (feed 97102 and tailings 2361T) sample was run at full density and triplicate testing gave recoveries of 39–47%. The feed has a complex mineralogy with abundant mixed layer clays (illite and montmorillionite). The sample also has trace amorphous carbon. Gold occurs in the sample again largely as arsenian pyrite although more gold than in previous samples appears to be associated with clay and carbon (see below). The tails sample contains mainly quartz with post-testwork alteration products of calcite and gypsum. Only trace amounts of relic anhydrite is left. Additionally jarosite is also present. Associated with this is the mineral phase, bukovskyite (Fe The BBT feed showed reasonable recovery and the mineralogy would suggest this with a dominantly quartz-illite-pyrite mineralogy with accessory realgar and kaolinite, and trace carbon, calcite and stibnite. Gold is associated largely with arsenian pyrite in this sample although trace amounts are observed with clays and carbon. G5 is a BBT tails that used 30% solids as a baseline test. Within the tailings, the gold that is present is associated largely with quartz but also clay and carbon as well. The only difference between this and G-24A is the addition of 1.5 Using the mineralogy and LAICPMS data quoting mean values for each phase, the gold mass balance for minerals within each material has been calculated. In most cases, there is less than 20% variance between calculated and measured gold concentration. Samples in which the variance is under the measured value by more than 10% reflect the occurrence of finely disseminated gold within other mineral phases such as hematite, scorodite and in minerals below the effective detection limit of LAICPMS (3 Where the variance shows an over-estimate by more than 10% this reflects that gold determinations within one or more mineral groups for that sample have a skewed mean, possibly due to a nugget effect. This skews the arithmetic mean such that it is not representative of the population and possibly the median value would have been more applicable in that instance. Other all values are within ±25% of the measured value. Given that analytical error for fire assay is ±15% and for LAICPMS ±10% then these results show remarkable agreement. This is considered a validation for this approach in determining the mineral host both within the ore feed and in the autoclave residue. In the feed sample for Rho D (9767/1) almost all gold is associated with arsenian pyrite with only trace amounts associated as sub-micron inclusions in quartz. Testwork shows the potential to recover 94% of the gold. Of the 6% that is left in the residue (2278T), the majority (84%) is present in quartz as sub-micron grains and trace amounts in clay. In the high recovery Sigma W, gold is essentially hosted within arsenian pyrite although 12% is also hosted by quartz. The remaining 6–7% of gold not recovered from Sigma W is hosted wither by quartz (as sub-micron gold) or in arsenian pyrite that is occluded within quartz or illite. Additionally trace amounts of gold occurs as sub-micron inclusions within clay. By comparison to Rho D, the feed for Rho B (9767/2) shows more gold within the feed associated with carbon (9%) and clay (12%). Gold recovery from tailings (2267T) is 44.9%, the reminder of the gold is hosted with quartz, clay and carbon with the only gold that appears to be recovered is from arsenian pyrite. Sigma Y is a poor recovery ore and the feed gold balance reflects this with ∼12% gold associated with quartz, 8% with clay and 7% with carbon. Additionally although 73% occurs in arsenian pyrite much of this is present only as arsenian pyrite occluded in quartz so consequently is not sufficiently exposed for gold leaching. The tails, 2800T, not only contains gold as sub-micron inclusions in quartz but also with clay and carbon as well as 0.03 opt Au in arsenian pyrite occluded in illite and quartz. As with Sigma Y, Sigma G contains a significant portion of gold as sub-micron grains within quartz, carbon and clay (21%) as well as gold-bearing arsenian pyrite occluded within quartz and illite. Poor autoclave testing appears to have occurred with 97/102 and this is reflected in the apparent preservation of gold-bearing arsenian pyrite as free grains within the tailings sample, 2361T. Less than 40% of the gold has been leached from the sample with the majority of gold remaining being in gold-bearing arsenian pyrite that is encapsulated within illite and quartz. LAICPMS analysis revealed that gold within the BBT feed ore occurs essentially within arsenian pyrite (92%) with trace amounts of sub-micron gold within carbon, illite and pyrite. Within the baseline testing tailings (G-5), that gave 74% recovery, the majority of gold remaining is still within arsenian pyrite. Optical examination revealed that the majority of this gold is occluded within illite. Additionally encapsulated sub-micron gold within quartz is also a source of un-recovered gold. The sample G-24A differs from G-5 in that 1.5 The improvement in recovery from arsenian pyrite and carbon is possibly related to enhanced oxidation in the presence of MnO. As to the improvement with respect to clay this could either be a function of errors in mineralogical balance or possibly due to the influence of MnO on gold-chloride de-stabilization. This study was initiated as an assessment of whether improvements could be made in recovery from the different ores at Getchell. The dominant form of gold appears to be as sub-micron to micron sized arsenian pyrite grains within quartz and late-stage silica overgrowths (∼60%), sulfides dominantly pyrite (∼30%) and other minerals (carbonates, aluminosilicates and amorphous carbon). Whilst the majority of this gold is invisible even with an electron microscope, it’s presence is indicated by LAICPMS analysis. In the autoclave and tailings samples the presence of gold grains still visible at the micron scale within silica clearly suggests that this is a major source of gold loss from the mill. Chemically held gold in sulfides should be almost entirely recoverable after sulfide oxidation. However sulfide oxidation is not one hundred percent complete with some fine pyrite observed encapsulated in quartz. Additionally the presence of micron or less sized gold within hematite and Fe–Ni-oxides observed in autoclave products may tie up some of the gold after autoclave oxidation. These are further indication of the need for additional grinding to recover gold. The consequence of the mode of occurrence of the gold at Getchell is that chemical or thermal pre-treatment is required for the Au-bearing pyrite ores to improve Au recovery. However, because much of the Au is in the rims and between grains, only partial oxidation is required. The most common problem with the ores is the fine grain size that leads to the potential encapsulation of Au and Au-bearing pyrite within fine grained quartz. Ore zones rich in silica therefore require more grinding to liberate fine grained particulate Au. The mineralogy and gold trace element chemistry for 14 samples of ore, autoclave feed and test residue samples has been reported. Gold is present in arsenian pyrite, most likely concentrated in the outer rims of the grains. Native gold grains are observed rarely and then generally within the arsenian pyrite, most likely the result of exsolution after deposition and/or electrochemical precipitation onto the surfaces of As-rich pyrite. Detailed mineralogical assessment of Au occurrence in the ores has been beneficial in identifying the source of gold recovery problems. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry has proved to be an invaluable tool in determining gold speciation. In the high recovery ore feeds, arsenian pyrite is exposed on crushing and oxidises almost completely within the autoclave. Typically recoveries are above 90% for such ore. Where poor recovery is observed, two modes of occurrence are observed in the feed that may prevent complete oxidation of the arsenian pyrite: Arsenian pyrite occurs as fine inclusions (<40 Trace amounts of gold observed by LAICPMS with a mixed illite/smectite clay, montmorillonite and free carbon indicating potential for preg-robbing by clays (particularly the high exchange capacity smectite group clays) and carbon. To overcome these problems, the options include: Fine grinding would release the gold-bearing pyrite, although create obvious problems with tailings. Oxidant addition such as MnO may remove carbon or Surface suppressant addition to the ore to depress surface cation exchange capacity on clays and carbon may remove problems of preg-robbing. The test sample in which MnO was added showed an improvement of >13% in gold recovery from a carbon-rich sample.
