The AO/ASIF Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN) has been used to treat unstable peri-trochanteric fractures since 1997 with encouraging results. The aim of this study is to analyse the PFNs performed in our institute that needed a revision surgery between 2000 and 2006. Patients case notes, X-ray films and theatre documentation were analysed. Two hundred and fifty six patients with peri-trochanteric fractures were treated with PFN fixations in 6 years. Thirteen (5.08%) PFNs performed needed revision surgery. Out the 13, 9 PFNs were inserted for traumatic fractures (69.2%), 3 for pathological fractures (23.1%) and 1 for prophylactic stabilisation due to malignant depositions (7.7%). Closed reduction was performed in 240 PFNs out of the 256 while 16 needed an open reduction and fixation with cables. In the group that needed open reduction and stabilisation with cerclage cables, 5 nails needed revision of which 2 were due to deep infection of the metal work. One nail needed revision due to deep infection in the group that was reduced using a closed method while 10 were revised due to other causes ( Forty-four patients among the 256 patients who had a PFN inserted were osteoporotic. Of which 9 of them suffered from a failed PFN ( Technical factors were the leading cause of revision with a significant tendency of these needing early revisions ( Total hip replacements and exchange to long PFNs with cerclage cabling and bone grafting were the commonest revision procedures. Poorly reduced peri-trochanteric fractures fixed with PFN have a high risk of failing especially in reveres oblique subtrochanteric fractures and those with unreduced medial comminution. PFNs inserted in osteoporotic patients have a higher risk of failure, however technical factors and infection remains the most important preventable causes of failure.
