Immersed cylinder piles are usually modelled as immersed cantilever cylinder columns carrying a tip mass and rotary moment of inertia. In this paper, the equations of motion of an immersed cylinder pile along transversal modes of vibration are developed. Compressibility of water and structural damping are included in the formulation. Natural frequencies of the immersed pile are obtained from the developed equations using harmonic sweep frequency response analyses. The proposed method is applied to numerical examples, and the results obtained are shown satisfactory when compared to other numerical solutions in the literature, or to finite element solutions and experimental data.
