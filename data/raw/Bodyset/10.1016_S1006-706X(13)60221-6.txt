The relationship of hydrogen, GBF (granular bright facet) and very high cycle fatigue properties of high strength spring steels 60Si2CrV with three different hydrogen contents were studied using hydrogen thermal desorption analysis and ultrasonic fatigue test. The results showed that the influence of hydrogen on the relationship between fatigue life and the ratio of GBF to inclusion size
