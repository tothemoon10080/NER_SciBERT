Inhibitor and corrosion protection of mild steel specimens immersed in 3.5% NaCl solution was investigated using weight loss, polarization measurements and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR - SEM). Ferrous gluconate in different concentrations was used as inhibitor. A decrease in the reactions of active corrosion behaviour of the mild steel test specimen in the sodium chloride solution was obtained with the addition of different concentrations of the ferrous gluconate. The inhibiting effect of ferrous gluconate on mild steel surface was attributed to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The obtained results showed that ferrous gluconate provides a good protection for mild steel against corrosion in sodium chloride solution for the greater part of the experimental period.
