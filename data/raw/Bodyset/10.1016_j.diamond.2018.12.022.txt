Synthetic diamond has excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, which makes it an ideal material in a wide range applications from abrasive grinding tools to modern electronic devices. Hence, understanding the wettability of metals on the synthetic diamond is of great importance for the development of diamond-related materials and devices. In this study, the wettability and spreading kinetics of binary SnCr alloy on chemical vapour deposed (CVD) polycrystalline diamond compacts were investigated using a sessile drop method. In situ observation of contact angle at elevating temperatures indicated trace addition of Cr dramatically improved the wettability of Sn on CVD diamond, and the SnCr alloy started to wet CVD diamond at approximately 750 °C. Isothermal spreading kinetic analysis revealed that the spreading of SnCr alloy on CVD diamond was controlled by the kinetics of chemical reaction at advancing triple line. Microstructure characterization indicated that the formation of nano-sized scallop-like Cr7C3 grains was responsible for the improved wettability of SnCr alloy on CVD diamond substrate. The wetting temperature was found to play a determinant role in the interfacial carbide formation, and hence the reactive wetting of SnCr alloy on CVD diamond at temperatures from 700 to 900 °C.Due to its ultra-high hardness, synthetic diamond has been used as cutting abrasives for decades [ Previous studies focused more on the wettability indicated by equilibrium contact angles [ In this work, the reactive wetting of the Sn Polycrystalline CVD diamond compacts (supplied by Suzhou Jiaozuan Superhard Nanocoatings Co. Ltd., China), prepared by chemical vapour depositing a CVD diamond film of about 10 μm thick on a tungsten carbide (WC) substrate with a dimension of 15 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness, were used as the substrate. According to the XRD pattern and SEM micrograph of the CVD diamond in  From the wetting results obtained at elevating temperatures, 2 wt% addition of Cr into Sn is sufficient to well wet CVD diamond, without remarkable formation of Cr-rich solid particles in solidified Sn To examine the phase formation and the morphology of the interfacial chromium carbides formed between Sn   It can be clearly seen from the XRD and SEM results shown in Assuming the activity of C in diamond as constant and the interfacial chromium as a pure substance, the changes in the Gibbs free energy of the At the advancing triple line of a reactive wetting system, the growth kinetics of interface product could control the spreading kinetics of a droplet [ Based on the thermodynamic and spreading kinetic analysis, the reactive wetting behaviour of the Sn In this study, the reactive wetting behaviour of binary Sn The addition of 1 wt% Cr into Sn substantially improved the wettability of Sn on CVD diamond. The minimum final contact angle after wetting at 950 °C was achieved for the Sn The wetting temperature played a dominant role in the wettability of Sn A layer of nano-sized Cr The authors would like to thank the financial support from
