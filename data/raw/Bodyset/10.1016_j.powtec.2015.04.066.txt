Particulates may experience dynamic compression loading during materials handling and processing, which in turn can lead to fracture of the particles. In this study, the dynamic fracture behavior of microspherical particles of soda lime glass (SLG), polycrystalline silica, polycrystalline silicon, barium titanate glass (BTG) and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was characterized with high speed, in situ X-ray phase-contrast imaging to examine the failure mechanisms in situ for spheroidal particles with diameters (d) from 600 to 2000μm under dynamic compression. Nanoindentation was used to measure the hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E), and microindentation was used to measure the fracture toughness (T) of the materials. Based on the experimental results, a new pulverization parameter was proposed to predict the failure mechanism of the materials given by:

                        =Hd/TE5/3
                     . The results showed that high

                      values are associated with comminution failure, low 
                        P
                      values are associated with single cracking failure, and intermediate 
                        P
                      values reflect failure modes in between these two extremes.Particles or granular solids of brittle materials are subjected to self-impact loading during materials processing, transportation, drilling, blasting, and rapid penetration loading such as ballistic impact. The resulting dynamic compressive loading can lead to a wide range of deformation and fracture behaviors in the particles. The integrity of the granular solid after compression plays a significant role in both the subsequent processing and the energy absorption capabilities of the material. There are established methods in the literature to analyze the fracture energy distribution of particles using quasi-static single particle tests (crushing tests) and to study the breakage of hard particles under controlled loading conditions The behavior of spherical particles under impact loading has been studied using various experimental methods. In several studies, a spherical particle was impacted against a rigid target at a high velocity The aforementioned single particle experiments cannot account for the effects of particle–particle contacts which are prevalent in granular solids. Also, it has been impossible to observe the While identifying failure modes using both In this paper the fracture behavior of micro-spherical particles made up of polycrystalline silica, soda lime glass (SLG), polycrystalline silicon, barium titanate glass (BTG) and yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) under dynamic compression is discussed. Nanoindentation and microindentation were used to study the quasi-static mechanical properties, while the failure mechanisms under dynamic compression were investigated using high speed X-ray PCI. Using these complementary techniques a new pulverization model is proposed to better describe the fracture behavior of granular solids under self-impact loading. Nominally spherical particles composed of five different brittle materials were chosen for this study. Materials were selected to provide a range of materials properties as well as variations in particle size. Material, size and the vendor for each type of particle are summarized in The specimens used for measuring the mechanical properties of individual spherical particles were prepared using conventional grinding and polishing methods. The granular particles were mounted in epoxy and ground with 350 to 1200 grit silicon carbide abrasive paper, and then polished using diamond paste from 6 to 0.5 The high speed impact experiments were performed on specimens with no prior sample preparation. In all cases the peak to valley roughness of the surface of the spheroidal particles was much less than (< The hardness ( The quasi-static toughness was determined using a Vickers microhardness test, where loads between 0.49 and 4.9 The failure mechanisms of the particles under dynamic compression were investigated using a combination of a modified Kolsky bar setup and high speed synchrotron X-ray PCI at Advanced Photon Source (APS) beam line 32-ID-B at Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. This experimental method has been used to study the failure mechanisms in various materials including bone–tissue interfaces, polymer fibers, concrete and rocks, and glass plates The Kolsky bar experiments are commonly used to characterize material properties at strain rates on the order of 10 Two spherical particles were constrained in a custom made aluminum sample holder with the compression loading imposed on the particles using a flat faced steel gage pin. To prevent the interaction of the particles with holder wall, the aluminum holder was machined with a slightly larger inner diameter than the nominal diameter of the particles. The experimental sequence started with a manual start signal that launched the striker bar towards the incident bar. The impact of the striker with the incident bar generated a compressive stress wave in the incident bar. The compressive wave was sensed by the strain gauges on the incident bar that subsequently triggered the camera. The stress wave continued to propagate to the end of the incident bar where it pushed the steel pin onto two contacting particles at a constant speed of 4.9–5.1 The aspect ratio of the particles was measured to better identify their shapes. This ratio was identified as the ratio of the largest projected diameter to the smallest projected diameter of the particle that could be imaged using scanning electron microscopy of at least 5 representative particles. SLG and YSZ have aspect ratios that range between 1.00 and 1.05; they are effectively spherical. However, the aspect ratios of silicon & silica can reach up to 1.21, showing a larger deviation which may be present in the projected x-ray imaging used to examine Both hardness and elastic modulus of each material did not vary significantly within a batch; the values are listed in The high speed X-ray PCI technique was used to identify the failure modes in different particles. The scintillator-high speed camera setup captured the images in 16-bit greyscale format. The raw images were adjusted for the contrast and brightness such that cracks can be easily identified using ImageJ software  Both polycrystalline silicon and BTG particles showed a markedly different failure behavior. The failure process for silicon particles is presented in YSZ particles displayed a remarkably different behavior than the other particles examined in this study ( As described in the previous section, different particles display widely different failure mechanisms under similar compressive loading. Here we propose an analytical approach to express the relationship between the properties measured using quasi-static indentation techniques (Hardness, modulus, and toughness) and the dynamic compression experiments (failure mechanism). This approach is similar to the brittleness index ( Although these parameters can accurately predict the propensity for particle failure in particulate materials, they are unable to predict the failure modes observed in this study. The brittleness index and Ghadiri and Zhang's dimensionless attrition parameter (η) for the particles used in this study are plotted in To properly explain the observed trend in comminution behavior across material type, a modified attrition propensity parameter, defined here as the pulverization parameter ( Similarly, when The strain energy that is added to the particle is proportional to The relative displacement between the centers of two particles is related to the contact area and the particle radius using standard Hertzian contact mechanics, where the contact area is inversely proportional to the maximum pressure Finally, we must consider the method by which the test was run. As this testing geometry is effectively a displacement imposed test with fixed grips (the test is not load controlled; in the impact conditions here, we assume there is overly sufficient loading capability present and the particles deform in a fixed grips condition to conform to the motion of the striker plate) the maximum pressure within a particle should scale with the particle diameter. The diameter of each tested particle was measured and The mean pressure ( Combining Eqs. (7) to (11), the pulverization parameter is defined as: The results of calculation by Eqs. The new pulverization model gives a better understanding for the fracture behavior of different materials under compression tests. SLG that has the highest pulverization parameter  The importance of this new pulverization model is to address the influence of strain energy added to the system as particles compress, along with the hardness and toughness of the material on the overall particle failure morphology. The pulverization parameter values that have been shown in this study do not match with the calculations based on the other published parameters nor the mean pressure at failure; therefore, it would not be possible to predict the observed varied failure mechanisms based on the previously published parameters. Combining indentation techniques and dynamic compression experiments to develop this new model is a valuable way to classify different materials for design and application purposes; this is a phenomenological model that can be exercised for other brittle spherical particles systems. The transition from major cracking failure to single cracking failure is clearly observed in the In this study, a new attrition model was proposed to better describe the morphological fracture mechanisms and failure behavior of brittle microspheres under high strain rate dynamic loading. This phenomenological model is represented by a pulverization parameter ( Three different failure mechanisms have been identified based on the relationship between the dynamic compression experiments and the indentation measurements.
