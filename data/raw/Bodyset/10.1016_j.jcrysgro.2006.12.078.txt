The carboxyl group interacts strongly with calcium ions, indicating that the hydrophilic polymers with the functional groups of –COOH should exert a great impact on the crystal design of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In this paper, three copolymers were synthesized and subsequently used as additives to control the crystallization and aggregation behaviors of CaCO3. The results show that: (1) the hard-segmented copolymer could be employed as a crystal modifier of calcite; and (2) the introduction of soft segments into the hard-segmented backbone could prohibit the phase transformation of vaterite to calcite, depending upon the structure and the concentration of the synthesized copolymers. The relationship between the properties of the dispersed copolymers and the polymorphism of CaCO3 has also been discussed.The controlled growth of crystals with respect to size, shape and crystal structure of material (in case where more than one modification exists), the so-called “crystal design”, is a key aspect of modern material sciences. This has been widely used in the fields of catalysis, medicine, electronics, ceramics, pigments, and cosmetics Calcium carbonate (CaCO Recently, a new series of crystal modifiers, the double-hydrophilic block copolymers Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG; According to the literatures   Doubly deionized water was used to prepare aqueous solutions of CaCl All samples were Au-coated prior to examination by a Hitachi S-4300 scanning electron microscope (SEM), fitted with a field emission source and operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 Molar masses were characterized using gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent (flow rate=1.0 It has been reported that the analogous copolymer, composed of polyether soft segment and a dissocyanate-based hard segment, has been described as a two-phase morphology In the presence of 1000 It was supposed that the stirring shear, together with the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds and the electrostatic interactions between –COOH groups and Ca Generally, active sites for the nucleation of inorganic particles increase with the increasing concentration of functional groups, which is easier for organic templates to modulate the aggregation behavior of nanosized particles Another routine could also be used to support the template effect of Polymer I, shown in When soft segments (PEG) are connected with hard segments (backbones of Polymer I) by cross-linking method, the segmented copolymers (Polymers II and III) were obtained. The introduction of different amount of soft segments into polymer backbones exerted different impacts on the polymorphism and the morphology of CaCO  When 50% molar ratio of soft segments was introduced in polymer backbone (i.e., Polymer III), the resulted CaCO From the viewpoint of crystal design, the size, shape and crystal structure of the inorganic materials depend upon the structural properties of additives It should also be mentioned that the increase of Polymer II concentration caused the weight fraction of vaterite to decrease (shown in Regarding the classical crystallization habit of CaCO After directly mixing aqueous solutions of equal molarity CaCl It has been reported that biological macromolecules can successfully be used to control the polymorphism and architectural crystal assembly of CaCO According to Ueyame's results The above results indicate that the segmented copolymers can be used as organic additives for the crystal design of CaCO In summary, the strong dependence of the mineralized particles on the structure of a segmented copolymer makes it necessary to find modular synthesis strategies for well-defined polymers. The optimum structure of the segmented copolymer for crystal design and the aggregation mechanism of nanocrystallites open a new filed for future studies.
