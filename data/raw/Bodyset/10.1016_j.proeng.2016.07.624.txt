The research work topicality is based on necessity of beryllium production from fluorine containing raw materials technology optimization, beryllium losses minimization and environmental impact decrease by beryllium and materials based on beryllium production. The goal of research is identification of beryllium containing solutions produced in the result of beryllium concentrate fluorineammonium processing purification possibility (clarification of iron, aluminum, calcium and silicon) and conditions provided maximum impurity removal from solution, which do not cause beryllium hydrolysis.
