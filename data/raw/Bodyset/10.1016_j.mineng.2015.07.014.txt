Cationic flotation is a promising method for separating scheelite from calcite at room temperature, because of the significant difference between their surface charges. Three quaternary ammonium salts, i.e., didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), trioctylmethylammonium chloride (TOAC), and dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), were investigated as cationic collectors in the flotation of scheelite from calcite. The flotation behaviors of scheelite and calcite with the three quaternary ammonium salts were studied using single-mineral and mixed-mineral flotations; flotation with oleate was used for comparison. The results show that flotation of scheelite from calcite was possible around pH 8 with DDAC and TOAC as collectors. The collecting powers and selectivities of these compounds for scheelite were higher than those of oleate. The molecular structures, Fourier-transform infrared spectra, and zeta potentials indicated that when quaternary ammonium salts are used as collectors, electrostatic interactions play a primary role in the flotation of scheelite from calcite. The adsorptions of the three quaternary ammonium salts fitted a general adsorption isotherm well, but the Langmuir isotherm only fitted the adsorption of DDAC well. It can be concluded from the adsorption isotherm parameters that the role of van der Waals forces is as significant as that of electrostatic forces in the interactions of quaternary ammonium salts with the two minerals, and that the selectivities of the quaternary ammonium salts for scheelite result from their large van der Waals forces, as well as the opposite charges on scheelite and calcite. The van der Waals forces of quaternary ammonium salts significantly affect the adsorption processes and consequently the isotherm plots.Scheelite is generally recovered by flotation, because of its friability, fine mineralization, and complex associations. A silicate–sodium oleate–sodium carbonate system is usually used in the flotation of scheelite ( Research on overcoming this problem has mostly focused on anionic flotation processes, using different combinations of anionic collectors or regulators, although there is a clear difference between the surface electrical properties of scheelite and those of calcareous gangue minerals. The isoelectric point of scheelite occurs at about pH 2, whereas those of calcite and fluorite occur at pH 8.2 and 9–10, respectively ( In this study, quaternary ammonium salts were investigated as cationic collectors for scheelite. Quaternary ammonium salts (also called quaternary ammonium compounds, QACs) are usually halide salts with four alkyl groups attached to a central cationic nitrogen atom (R Quaternary ammonium salts have been used in flotation. Handpicked, high-purity scheelite and calcite, from Shizhuyuan, Hunan, China, were ground using a porcelain mill. The ground samples were wet-sieved and the fraction with particles of size less than 74 The three quaternary ammonium salts were provided by the Xirun Chemical Engineering and Technology Corporation (Shanghai, China). Sodium oleate, which was used as a collector for comparison, was provided by the Tianyu Oleo Chemical Corporation (Sichuan, China). Analytical-grade HCl and NaOH were used as pH modifiers. Distilled water was used in all experiments, unless otherwise stated. Micro-flotation tests were conducted using individual and artificially mixed minerals. The mixed minerals contained equal amounts of scheelite and calcite by weight. A mineral suspension was prepared by adding 2.0      FTIR spectroscopy was used to characterize the surface species on the treated mineral particles. The samples were prepared as follows. Mineral samples of particle size less than 38 Zeta potentials were measured using a Bechman Coulter DELSA-440SX zeta potential analyzer. All measurements were conducted in a 0.1 For the adsorption tests, mineral powder (2 The flotation behaviors of scheelite and calcite with quaternary ammonium salts and oleate as collectors were first investigated using single-mineral flotation tests. Oleate was used for comparison. The results are shown in     As shown in In summary, the flotation performances of DDAC and TOAC were similar; the maximum scheelite recovery was 95% around pH 8, whereas that of calcite was only 30%. The collecting power of DDAC is slightly stronger than that of TOAC, whereas the selectivity of TOAC is higher than that of DDAC. In contrast, when oleate was used as the collector, the maximum recovery of scheelite was 80%, lower than that of calcite, which was almost 100%. DDAC and TOAC are therefore superior to oleate as scheelite collectors in terms of collecting power and selectivity. However, the collecting power of DTAC is significantly weaker than those of the other two quaternary ammonium salts, and gave a maximum scheelite recovery of only 40%. The flotation tests showed that it is possible to separate scheelite from calcite using DDAC and TOAC at concentrations of 1 Micro-flotation tests of artificially mixed minerals (scheelite to calcite mass ratio of one) were conducted to investigate the flotation performances of the three quaternary ammonium salts further. Because of the presence of calcite, the pulp pH ranged from 6 to 12.  Although the maximum scheelite recovery with oleate as the collector was 100% above pH 11, scheelite was not separated from calcite, and the grade was almost the same before and after flotation, i.e., about 40.3%. As in the case of single-mineral flotation, mixed-mineral flotation indicated that DDAC and TOAC have strong collecting powers and high selectivities for scheelite, and were superior to the anionic collector oleate in the flotation of scheelite from calcite. DTAC is inferior to DDAC and TOAC in scheelite flotation because of its weak collecting power. Quaternary ammonium salts are halide compounds of positively charged polyatomic ions with the structure NR The central nitrogen atom is the active center of the quaternary ammonium salt during flotation. The nitrogen atom contains five valence electrons, two of which occupy the 2s orbital and the other three of which each occupy a 3p orbital. The central nitrogen atom in a quaternary ammonium salt loses a valence electron; the remaining four are hybridized, and each resides in one of the four hybrid orbitals and forms a covalent bond with a carbon atom of each of the four alkyl substituents. Consequently, the central nitrogen atom of a quaternary ammonium salt can neither donate valence electrons nor provide empty orbitals to form covalent bonds with atoms on the surfaces of calcium-containing minerals under flotation conditions. This means that quaternary ammonium salts are not chemically adsorbed on the surfaces of scheelite and calcite. Furthermore, the steric hindrance of the central nitrogen atom of the quaternary ammonium salt interacting with mineral surfaces is large, because it is surrounded by four alkyl substituents; this is also unfavorable for chemical adsorption of quaternary ammonium salts on the mineral surfaces. It is therefore probable that physical interactions lead to scheelite flotation by quaternary ammonium salts. FTIR spectroscopy was performed to clarify the adsorption mechanism of quaternary ammonium salts on the surfaces of scheelite and calcite. The three quaternary ammonium salts have the same functional group, and therefore they interact with minerals in the same manner; the FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the interactions of quaternary ammonium salts with scheelite and calcite was therefore performed using DDAC as an example. The FTIR spectra of scheelite and calcite before and after conditioning with 2  Structural and FTIR spectroscopic analyses excluded the possibility of chemical adsorption of quaternary ammonium salts on the surfaces of scheelite and calcite. Electrostatic interactions, which are major physical interactions, were therefore investigated using zeta potential measurements. The surface zeta potentials of scheelite and calcite in the absence of collectors, and the results for mixed-mineral flotation, are shown in  The zeta potential–pH curve of calcite also shifted positively when the concentration of DDAC increased, but with a smaller magnitude than in the case of scheelite. This suggests that DDAC was adsorbed on the calcite surface, but the adsorbed amount was smaller than that on scheelite. No characteristic band for DDAC was therefore observed in the FTIR spectrum of calcite treated with DDAC solution, because the adsorption of DDAC on calcite was so weak that the DDAC was washed away during sample preparation. The difference between the adsorption behaviors of DDAC on scheelite and calcite can therefore be explained by the difference between the surface charges on the minerals. Scheelite was more negatively charged than calcite; therefore the electrostatic interactions between DDAC and scheelite were stronger, and more DDAC was adsorbed on scheelite. Furthermore, the positive shift of the zeta potential–pH curve of calcite occurred even in the pH range at which calcite was positively charged. As shown in  The critical micelle concentration (CMC), an important parameter for surfactants, is the concentration at which a surfactant solution begins to form large amounts of micelles; this is an indication of the surface activity of the surfactant. In flotation, the CMC is usually used to measure the collector hydrophobicity ( The free energy of micellization can be calculated from the CMC using Eq. The free energy of micellization indicates the strength of the hydrophobic association of a surfactant. The lower the free energy of micellization is, the stronger the hydrophobic association. The order of the association strengths was DDAC An adsorption isotherm is a mathematical expression that relates the concentration of an adsorbate at the interface to its equilibrium concentration in the liquid phase. Isotherm measurements are commonly used to investigate adsorption at a liquid/solid interface. In this study, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and a general adsorption isotherm ( The Langmuir adsorption isotherm (     The Langmuir isotherm model assumes uniform energies of adsorption onto the adsorbent surface. It is based on the assumption of monolayer adsorption onto a completely homogeneous surface with a finite number of identical sites, and with negligible interactions between adsorbed molecules. However, many surfactant solutions show Langmuir-type behavior even when these restrictions are not met ( In terms of plot shape, surfactant adsorption isotherms can be divided into three types: L-type, S-type, and two-plateau or LS-type (        The values of   The adsorption mechanisms of quaternary ammonium salts on scheelite and calcite were further studied by fitting the adsorption data to both the Langmuir and general adsorption isotherms. In the fitting to the Langmuir model, the correlation coefficients ( For fitting to the general adsorption model, the adsorption data were first divided into two parts, i.e., low-concentration and high-concentration parts. The two parts were then fitted by two equations transformed from the general adsorption model at low and high concentrations, respectively. No correlation coefficients were obtained for the overall fitting to the general adsorption model. However, from the variations between the graphical and analytical solutions shown in The derivation of the general adsorption isotherm equation implies that the parameters The data in The differences among the shapes of the adsorption isotherms clearly results from different adsorption processes. The relationships among them were clarified by dividing the active sites on the surface into three classes, i.e., sites with adsorbed monomers, sites with adsorbed micelles, and unoccupied sites. The isotherm of the sites with adsorbed monomers was derived from the corresponding general adsorption isotherm. The fraction of sites with adsorbed monomers was calculated as         The relationships were similar for scheelite and calcite; therefore only isotherms of the fractions for scheelite are shown in  It can be seen from For the same quaternary ammonium salt, the difference between the  Three quaternary ammonium salts (DDAC, TOAC, and DTAC) were investigated as cationic collectors in the flotation of scheelite from calcite. Single-mineral and mixed-mineral flotations indicated that DDAC and TOAC were superior to oleate as collectors for scheelite with respect to collecting power and selectivity. It was possible to separate scheelite from calcite using DDAC or TOAC at concentrations of 1 Based on the molecular structures and FTIR spectra, we excluded the possibility of chemical adsorption of the quaternary ammonium salts on scheelite and calcite surfaces. Zeta potential measurements indicated that electrostatic interactions played a primary role in the flotation separation of scheelite from calcite with quaternary ammonium salts. Adsorption isotherm analysis showed that van der Waals forces also played an important role in the interactions of quaternary ammonium salts with scheelite and calcite. The quaternary ammonium salts showed selectivities not only because scheelite and calcite were oppositely charged, but also because of the large van der Waals forces of the collectors. Zeta potential and adsorption measurements indicated that two steps were involved in the adsorption of quaternary ammonium salts on scheelite and calcite, i.e., monomer adsorption through direct interactions between surfactants and solids in the first step, and hemimicelle adsorption through lateral hydrophobic associations between surfactants in the second step. The adsorption on calcite was much weaker than that on scheelite. A two-step adsorption isotherm fitted the adsorption of all three quaternary ammonium salts well, but the Langmuir adsorption isotherm only fitted DDAC well. It was concluded from analysis of the isotherms that the van der Waals forces of the quaternary ammonium salts determined the adsorption processes, and therefore the plots of their isotherms. DDAC had the highest van der Waals forces; therefore the second step, i.e., micelle adsorption, occurred early, before the first step, i.e., monomer adsorption, reached saturation, and consequently its isotherm was L type.
