Present experiments and computational simulations furnish a fundamental background to the understanding of plastic flow across sample sizes. It is shown that self-organized criticality (SOC) governs the size distribution of dislocation avalanches in micrometer-sized sample dimensions. Onset of SOC denotes inception of a dislocation network so that dislocation avalanches occur at constant criticality level irrespectively of the applied stress. In these microcrystals, we find that the ratio between the characteristic sample dimension and the mean free path traveled by the mobile dislocations,

                     , rules the onset of strain hardening. This index simultaneously accounts for the role of loading orientation and dislocation density upon microscale plasticity. It is shown that strain-hardening emerges for

                     , where surface dislocation annihilations are inconsequential to network development and the flow stress scales with dislocation density. This regime naturally evolves toward bulk plasticity at increasing sample sizes. Conversely, strain hardening is suppressed when confining sample dimensions dominate plastic flow for

                     . Confining microscale plasticity is characterized by a significant increase in the size of dislocation avalanches under a stagnant dislocation network.Strain hardening is a distinctive feature in crystal plasticity, where the flow stress increases during load application due to the development of an entangled dislocation network A central aspect in the understanding of crystal plasticity concerns assessment of the transition between confining and bulk plastic flow The fundamental discreteness of crystal plasticity is due to the onset of dislocation avalanches. Mean-field statistical analyses indicate that the probability density of dislocation avalanche slips fulfills a universal power-law (scale-invariant) form similar to that describing other physical instabilities such as earthquakes in fault systems The following are the main purposes for this investigation. First, we seek to provide a thorough analysis to the emergence of strain hardening in small sample dimensions. Mean-field (continuum) crystal plasticity is central to this work, as the behavior of a random dislocation population is averaged using uniform dislocation densities. Whereas a preconceived idea appears to be that such analyses may not hold in microscopic crystals Present investigation comprises 40 The load–displacement curves were recorded using an in-house system operating in true displacement (strain) control inside the chamber of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). This allows for unique assessments of dislocation avalanches. The imposed displacement rate was set to 2 Plastic intermittencies produced at an externally applied strain-rate of ≈4  Experimental fluctuations during testing translate into an uncertainty of Δ Continuum descriptions of crystal plasticity allow prediction of the stress–strain curves in bulk single crystals. Advanced models are based on the detailed knowledge of short-range stresses that govern junction formation The essential strain hardening mechanism elucidated from DDD simulations in pure crystals is that a dislocation lying in slip system Coarse-graining of DDD simulations has recently provided a detailed model for the evolution of the mean free path length In Eq. Notice that the above model exclusively relies on the fundamentals of junction zipping and unzipping phenomena from DDD simulations. It is therefore explicitly assumed that strain hardening is not affected by the onset of substructural dislocation arrangements or patterning. This simplification is supported by Ref. Under the framework of continuum crystal plasticity Mean-field analyses indicate that the probability density A corollary from Eq. In addition to the above analyses, the following relation has been used to model the distribution of slips with characteristic maximum size The conception in that The experimentally measured stress–strain curves in For 〈1 From the above, it stems that dislocation storage during generalized plastic flow necessarily requires the onset of a dense dislocation network within the incipient plasticity stage ( This section describes a method to assess slip system activity in micropillar compression experiments. The method employs EBSD measurements of the plastic distortion in the top surface of compressed micropillars ( For a given micropillar orientation, we start by assuming a fixed d In uniaxial compression of 〈1  This section describes strategies for the computation of the stress–strain curves in strain-hardening micropillars using the mean-field background in Section Generalized plastic flow at The second dislocation configuration C Given the present experimental variability ( The above results indicate that the concept of spatially uniform dislocation densities – underlying present continuum mechanics framework – applies to strain-hardening micropillars. Moreover, the finite element (FE) simulations ( The following discusses experimental evidence of dislocation storage from the literature in light of the present strain hardening predictions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses of (269)-oriented nickel micropillars with Further experimental evidence of dislocation storage during incipient plasticity is provided in Dislocation density measurements in a (3–15)-oriented gold micropillar with Stress-integrated complementary cumulative distributions Directing attention to With further decreasing pillar size ( Section In the transition between microscale strain-hardening and confining (exhaustion hardening) plasticity regimes, it is recognized that the pinning action of dislocation junctions is reduced with decreasing Our results for 〈0 Ratio The present experiments provide access to plastic intermittencies occurring in the active slip systems of crystals loaded in stress and strain control. As shown in Following The above results represent convincing evidence in that it is the entanglement of the dislocation network occurring at the incipient plasticity stage that governs the slip distribution of dislocation avalanches. The development of heavily entangled dislocation networks thus reduces the size of dislocation avalanches through junction zipping and unzipping processes, so that the slip distributions become a fingerprint of the active plasticity regime ( The above fundamental interpretation holds irrespectively of the effect of pillar size upon the magnitude Δ Measured slip distributions indicate that while the number of dislocations The present findings unravel the statistical features of dislocation avalanches in crystal plasticity. In this sense, recent experimental results have demonstrated that plasticity in submicrometer-sized crystals adheres to the principle of STC, where the crystal responds with greater avalanches when the applied stress approaches  The development of a dense dislocation network during an incipient plasticity stage characterizes plastic flow in micrometer-sized samples. We show that the combined role of sample size, loading orientation and dislocation density upon the onset of strain hardening can be assessed through a mean-field dimensionless index. Microscale strain hardening plasticity thus emerges when the ratio between the characteristic sample size and the mean free path traveled by the mobile dislocations, The statistical description of dislocation avalanches in micrometer-sized crystals is in accordance with the paradigm of self-organized criticality (SOC), where the size of such plastic intermittencies is a function of the strain hardening behavior irrespectively of the applied stress level. There is therefore a fundamental distinction between the dislocation avalanche statistics that apply to samples with micrometer and submicrometer sizes, as criticality is tuned by stress in the latter. Our results are all consistent in that the inception of a dislocation network under multiple-glide is the essential feature leading to SOC. The size of the dislocation avalanches is reduced under the highly entangled dislocation networks characterizing microscale strain-hardening plasticity. This is a direct consequence of junction zipping processes between the mobile dislocations in the avalanche and the forest dislocations in the interacting slip systems at Continuum crystal plasticity is instrumental in the modeling of strain hardening at the microscale. The key parameters governing plastic flow are the forest dislocation density The framework of continuum crystal plasticity has been used to evaluate slip system activity in micropillar compression experiments. The devised analytical procedure employs Eq. The authors acknowledge insightful discussions with L. Kubin.
