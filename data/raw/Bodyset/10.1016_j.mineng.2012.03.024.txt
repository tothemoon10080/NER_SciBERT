 This was the 3rd MEI Computational Modelling conference, the previous two being held in Cape Town, but the number of participants has always been roughly the same. Because of its highly specialised nature, this will always be a small, but highly focused event, attended by highly motivated specialists. There were 41 delegates at Computational Modelling â€™11, representing 12 countries. This special issue contains selected papers from the conference. Authors were invited to submit final papers after the event, in order to give them the opportunity of taking into account discussions at the meeting when editing their final work. All papers accepted for this special issue have been peer-reviewed before publication. A full report on the conference can be found at
