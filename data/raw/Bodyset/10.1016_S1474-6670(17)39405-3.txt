Agricultural wastes both woody and herbaceous, are excellent raw materials for biomass to be burnt in small boiler furnaces. This biomass can be produced on the field by some special grinding technology called disintegrating and discussed in this paper. Disintegrating is comminution of some material by collision and disintegrator is a refining machine, carrying out this principle, providing the right particle size of the biomass and even distribution of the output in a transporter with required bulk density. The paper discusses some problems of mechanics and dynamics of disintegrating technology together with reference of those to the construction of the machine. The pilot biomass disintegrator DSA-600 passed the manufacturer's tests successfully and goes through field tests now.
