 Anterior circumflex humeral Arcuate artery Ascending branch of anterior circumflex humeral artery Medial capsular arterial branches Posterior circumflex humeral artery  Avascular necrosis of the head is inevitable Hemiarthroplasty has been shown to be the best treatment If anatomically reduced, avascular necrosis is not likely to occur Nonunion of the fracture will occur in more than 90% after plate fixation The risk of avascular necrosis and nonunion is similar even if bleeding occurs  1 week after injury 3 weeks after injury 6 weeks after injury 3 months after injury No difference, whenever rehabilitation begins  Head shaft angle 100°, 10° retroversion Head shaft angle 130°, 10° retroversion Head shaft angle 130°, 30° retroversion Head shaft angle 100°, 50° retroversion Head shaft angle 150°, 50° retroversion  Absence of bleeding from fracture surfaces at operation Complete loss of flow to head from nutrient artery of shaft Dislocation associated with two part fracture Posteromedial fracture extension with loss of the medial hinge Valgus impacted fracture pattern  Distance from tips of screws to joint line less than 5 mm Female sex Increasing age Low local bone mineral density Varus displacement  Avascular collapse requiring hemiarthroplasty Displacement of greater tuberosity Infection Removal of metalwork for impingement after union Screw penetration into joint  Damage to the rotator cuff can be a source of postoperative pain Impingement syndrome is a common complication Medial metaphyseal comminution is associated with a poorer prognosis Use of a nail prevents medialization of the shaft with respect to the head Varus alignment of the head after fixation is associated with a poor outcome  90% 60% 40% 30% 20%  8 mm anterior to bicipital groove 8 mm posterior to bicipital groove Directly anterior in line with the forearm when elbow flexed 90° In line with bicipital groove Pointing 30° lateral to the forearm axis when elbow flexed 90°  49 57 65 73 81  Infection Heterotopic ossification Nerve injury Proximal migration of prosthesis Tuberosity nonunion
