The excavation process for a tunnel changes in terms of its service requirements, ground conditions and the stability of surface buildings in urban areas. When a tunnel is excavated, there will be settlement, which may cause damage to surface structures. To control and limit the settlement caused by tunnelling operations, there have been many tunnelling techniques proposed. Thus, in this paper, a number of Finite Element Method analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of different patterns for advancing the tunnel face on the settlement. The Heathrow Express Trial tunnel was constructed in accordance with the principles of the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM). The settlement measurements taken during its construction were used to validate the results from the analyses undertaken. Three different face advance techniques were used during the construction of the Heathrow Express Trial tunnel viz. Twin sidewall excavation (TS1), single sidewall excavation (TS2), and Crown, Bench and Invert excavation (TS3). As the trial work proved that TS2 produced the minimum settlement above tunnel centreline, only TS2 was subjected to the FEM analysis in this research. In order to simulate TS2 correctly three types of excavation models were devised and the results compared to field measurements of TS2. For the FEM analysis the Hypothetical Modulus of Elasticity (HME) soft lining approach was used and a practical method to estimate HME is proposed for when it is used for different face advance sequences. Results proved that when the excavation pattern was changed, the HME value was also changed and settlement over the tunnel centreline changed in terms of the face advance pattern adopted.The use of numerical methods to analyse tunnels, ground–lining interaction and settlement is becoming widespread. Using this type of analysis often predicts the general consequences and the potential dangers for the tunnelling process without using any macro analysis techniques such as trial tunnels. However, any prediction from numerical analysis is highly dependent on the model adopted for modelling the soil behaviour.    In light of this research, it is proposed to optimise and adopt the best possible model that could simulate NATM excavation regarding different excavation sequences and provide close agreement for the pattern of surface settlement observed at the Heathrow Trial Tunnel. Thus, to validate the FEM calculations, available field data from the Heathrow Trial Tunnel ( As shown with trial tunnels and many other NATM tunnels, the construction sequence and the excavation geometry have a critical influence on the settlement. In order to predict the effects of various excavation sequences on settlement without the need for large-scale trials, this paper aims to achieve this goal via numerical modelling. It is proposed that an NATM designer will be able to determine the best excavation sequences and patterns by using the proposed model for an NATM tunnel with similar geology to that in which the Heathrow Express Trial tunnel was excavated. Furthermore, the settlement above the tunnel centreline as well as the HME values in accordance with the excavation sequence could be calculated by this method of analysis. The Heathrow Express Trial Tunnel excavation was undertaken as part of the Heathrow Express Rail Link, which provides a 15-min high-speed rail service between Paddington Railway Station in central London and Heathrow Airport. The main concern of the trial was to investigate the ability of NATM to control and limit settlement in London Clay. Thus, to establish the feasibility of NATM in London Clay, three different types of excavation and installation of lining were investigated with this trial tunnel. The Trial tunnel contract consisted of a 10.65-m-internal diameter×25-m-deep access shaft, and 100 m long having 7.9 m high and 9.2 m wide running tunnel as shown in After completion of the three different types of excavation sequences, the measured data proved that the maximum settlement occurred over the tunnel centre line. For TS1, TS2 and TS3 this was 27.9 mm, 26.8 mm, and 40.3 mm, respectively ( The materials encountered at the site, from which soil samples were taken from a vertical borehole 20 m away from the access shaft, consisted of London clay at a depth of 4.2 m overlain by coarse gravel, with 0.3 m of cement-stabilised material and above this, a bitumen-covered car park on made ground ( The FE analyses were conducted using Equivalent pressure stress, The water table is assumed to be 2 m below the ground surface. Total stress analysis using undrained material properties of London Clay were used in the analyses. The Modified Cam clay parameters adopted were based on the oedometer tests and back analysis of consolidated undrained triaxial test, which were reported by In The bulk moduli of London clay represented in Shotcrete used as a preliminary support measure in the trial tunnel has been modelled using elastic beam elements in the FEM analysis. The properties of the shotcrete adopted for the model are given in This technique was applied to the Heathrow Express tunnel design at Terminal 4 by Finite Element analyses was conducted using the In order to estimate the surface settlement, the Hypothetical Modulus of Elasticity (HME) soft lining approach has been used due to its flexibility when applied to multistage tunnel excavations. The approach takes account for 3-D tunnelling effects and deformations prior to shotcrete installation in 2-D FE analysis, The analyses have been carried out in three models with regards sequential excavation model (SEM), two-stage excavation model (TSM) and finally, the full-face excavation model (FFM). Each model represents the Trial tunnel type-2 geometry, though the excavation sequences have been modified to investigate settlement effects. Three different HME values in accordance with the specified models have been applied to each model so that the best value can be set. Initial effective stress conditions in the ground representing a stage prior to excavation are a function of overburden, i.e. a function of the earth pressure at rest, and any additional surcharge (80 kPa) because of the existing car park over the tunnel. Thus, initial geostatic stresses in all the analyses were calculated in terms of the above parameters and was input to the analyses. Details of the methods of analysis applied to each model will be given in the next sections. Finally, measured and calculated results will be compared to verify the method of analysis employed. In this analysis, tunnel excavation has been carried out in nine steps. the initial condition for each step in          Tunnel excavation has been simulated in five steps for the two-stage excavation model. The model geometry used in this analysis was the same as the model used for the sequential excavation method. However, the excavation stages consisted of two sequences. Firstly, the left sidewall drift has been excavated followed by activation of the lining elements. Secondly, the remainder of the tunnel was excavated. The analysis procedures employed during the two-stage excavation model (TSM) are summarised as follows:      The full-face excavation analysis, the last method for the analyses, has been carried out using the same finite element model geometry. Although the excavation stages have only been conducted in one step, the static analysis consisted of three steps. The tunnel geometry and the continuum elements for this model were selected to be the same as the previous models. The lining elements were reduced to 30 joint curved beam elements in total by removing such lining elements that represented the inner lining. The HME values ranged from 0.40 GPa, 0.20 GPa, and 0.15 GPa to consider the 3-D tunnelling problem for each full-face excavation model. Therefore, three separate full-face excavation models have been analysed to investigate tunnelling process. The procedure for these models is as follows:    After completion of the analyses, vertical displacement data corresponding to completion of the left sidewall drift and the completion of the entire tunnel were examined and compared with the field measurements for all models. Comparison of the results has been carried out in accordance with the short-term measurement data because the model does not consider consolidation analysis in the long term. Transverse settlement profiles for SEM, TSM and FFM models with various HME values applied to the lining are illustrated in In light of these results from the above analysis, relationships were developed to serve to predict the HME value for adoption in numerical analysis for different face advance excavation sequences. These relations are shown in Transverse surface settlements predicted by SEM, TSM and FFM models corresponding to HME values of 0.40 GPa, 0.15 GPa, and 0.20 GPa, respectively, are illustrated in In accordance with the Sequential Excavation Model calculation, it is proposed that this should be used for tunnels that involve multiple stage excavation. It was also proved that the HME value is sufficient to account for the 3-D tunnelling effect, and the power relation given in The Trial tunnel works have shown that adopting different methods for advancing the tunnel face lead to different settlement profiles. Considering the safety of the surface structures, settlement that occurs due to tunnelling especially in urban areas, can be destructive when settlement exceeds allowable limits. According to the results taken from these analyses, the following conclusions are made. The sequential excavation model predicted the settlement profiles in close agreement with the field measurements when compared with other models. This proves that the closer the modelling of the excavation sequences is to the actual NATM excavation process, the better the predictions obtained. Therefore, any tunnelling process that involves multiple stage excavations should not be treated as a single stage excavation model in any numerical analysis. The modified Cam-clay model with non-linear porous elasticity adopted throughout these numerical analyses, verified that when an appropriate approximation was made for considering the 3-D tunnelling effect and by modelling the excavation processes as closely as possible to the field sequence, this non-linear elasto-plasticity model is capable of simulating accurately NATM tunnelling. The full-face and two-stage excavation model showed that closing the support ring in soft ground must be done in fewer steps. Delaying the ring closure results in large deformations and settlements. The HME value varied according to ground strength, shape, and size of the area to be excavated, and the number of excavation stages to close the support ring.
