The scapular girdle is an osteoligamentous ring formed by the sternoclavicular joint (SC), the clavicle, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint and the scapula. It supports and connects the upper limb to the upper body and it therefore sometimes called the shoulder superior suspensory system.
               Two main mechanisms of injury are encountered: a fall on the shoulder with an impact on the side or on the tip of the shoulder, or a fall on the outstretched hand
               Damaging forces propagate all along the girdle and several different structures of the girdle can be simultaneous injured. Therefore, injuries range from a benign AC sprain to the severe omoscapulothoracic syndrome (or side impact syndrome) that combines injuries of the scapula, clavicle and chest wall/lung due to a severe side impact. Injury to the coracoid process is rarely isolated, and a look for associated injuries (AC joint, SC joint, glenohumeral joint) is mandatory.Anatomy Mechanisms of injury Fall on the tip of the shoulder Fall on the outstretched hand and arm Lateral impaction syndrome Sternoclavicular joint dislocation Anatomy Anterior dislocation Posterior dislocation Imaging Clavicle fractures Anatomy Mechanisms of injury Classification and imaging Acromioclavicular dislocation Anatomy of AC joint Patterns of AC injury Imaging Classification Scapula fracture Anatomy Mechanism of injury Classification Fracture of the glenoid Fracture of the scapular body and neck Floating shoulder concept Fracture of the acromion Fracture of the coracoid process Scapulothoracic dissociation Definition Imaging References The scapular girdle is composed of the sternoclavicular (SC) joint, the clavicle, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint and the scapula ( As it connects the upper limb to the rest of the body, the girdle is often conceptualized as the “superior shoulder suspensory complex” (SSSC) and consists of ( two struts: the clavicle and the lateral portion of the scapular body linked by an osseous-ligamentous ring: coracoid process, coracoclavicular ligaments, distal clavicle, acromioclavicular ligaments and acromion. The SSSC can be divided into three subunits the clavicular-AC joint-acromial strut, the clavicular-coracoclavicular ligament-coracoid (C-4) linkage, the three-process scapular body junction (the junction of the glenoid, coracoid, and acromion with the scapular body). In an analogy to the pelvic ring, disruption of this complex at two sites leads to severe dysfunction/instability (“floating shoulder”) of the upper extremity and requires surgical management Such double disruptions can be two fractures, two ligamentous injuries or a combination of both. Floating shoulder is for example seen in fracture of ipsilateral glenoid surgical neck and midshaft clavicle, or in scapulothoracic dislocation Three common mechanisms of injury of the scapular girdle are reported ( A fall on the tip of the shoulder seems to be the prevalent circumstance of scapular girdle injury ( Subjects fall on an outstretched hand with usually an adducted and outstretched arm as well ( As the force propagates proximally, the humeral head can be driven into the inferior aspect of acromion, clavicle or AC joint Lateral impaction syndrome of the shoulder, also called scapular (omo)-clavicular-thoracic syndrome, is a severe injury that associates fractures of the scapula, clavicle and ribs [ A high-energy trauma to the lateral shoulder with the arm in adduction drives the proximal humerus against the scapular girdle and the chest wall ( Depending on the orientation of the force and the rotation of the humerus at the time of impact, various injuries of the scapula, acromion, AC joint, clavicle, SC joint and chest wall can be encountered An evocative pattern of lateral impaction syndrome is the association of a fracture of the base of the coracoid process and fractures of ribs. The SC joint is a synovial saddle joint that unites the proximal clavicle and the manubrium of the sternum at the level of the suprasternal notch The SC joint is intrinsically unstable and its integrity relies mostly on ligaments: costoclavicular ligament (primary stabilizer) articular fibrocartilaginous disc capsule and sternoclavicular (anterior and posterior) ligaments interclavicular ligament Anterior dislocation is the most common: the proximal end of the clavicle is displaced anterosuperiorly or, less commonly, anteriorly to the anterior aspect of the sternum ( Posterior dislocations are much more uncommon. The proximal end of the clavicle is displaced posteriorly relative to the posterior aspect of the sternum ( Besides the usual AP view, several dedicated radiographic views (Heinig view, Hobbs view, Serendipity view, Rockwood) have been proposed to visualize the relationship between the clavicle and the sternum. Nevertheless, those particular views are challenging to realize in the acute phase. The best approach is probably to perform an enhanced chest CT in any suspicious cases On radiographs, the diagnosis of SC dislocation can be challenging as the relationship of the proximal clavicle with the sternum can be difficult to assess [ in anterior dislocations, the clavicle is driven forward: it will appear shortened on an AP view with a proximal end moving laterally ( in posterior dislocations, the clavicle is driven backward and usually upward as well. The clavicle seems to lengthen on the AP view and overlaps the projections of the thoracic spine pedicles ( The diagnosis of SC dislocation is usually obvious on CT The clavicle is a long horizontal bone, which serves as a strut between the sternum and the shoulder The clavicle has insertion sites for several muscles and ligaments. Notably, the coracoclavicular ligament, a primary stabilizer of the clavicle, inserts on its inferior aspect and runs to the coracoid process Clavicle fractures are reported to occur after a direct blow on the shoulder [ Several classifications have attempted to describe clavicle fractures. Still, the most convenient way remains to divide fractures as involving the proximal third (rare), the middle third (most common, around 80% of cases) or the distal third (15–20%) [ Fractures of the mid shaft and distal clavicle are usually evident on radiographs because of the absence of superimposition ( Fracture of the proximal third can be difficult to detect because of the superimposition with the chest wall ( The AC joint is a diarthrodial joint between the medial margin of the acromion and the lateral end of the clavicle a fibrocartilaginous disk the AC ligaments (anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior ligaments) the coracoclavicular (CC) ligament (with two components: the conoid and the trapezoid ligaments), a strong ligament that runs from the inferior surface of the clavicle to the base of the coracoid process During an impact on the top and side of the shoulder, AC injuries progress through a given pattern [ 1) disruption of the AC ligaments 2) disruption of the CC ligaments 3) disruption of the deltoid and trapezius fascia overlying the clavicle Injury to the AC joint is clinically confirmed if there is (clinical triad): point tenderness at the level of the AC joint pain exacerbation during cross-arm adduction relief of symptoms by the injection of a local anaesthetic agent Once the CC ligaments are torn, the upper limb has lost most of its suspensory support, and glenohumeral joint can move caudally under gravity action With the usual AP projection of the shoulder, the distal clavicle and acromion are superimposed over the spine of the scapula. Additional views are sometimes needed to assess the SC joint: AP view with 10–15° cephalad tilt (Zanca view) axillary lateral view Two measurements are clinically useful to evaluate the extent of injury: displacement of distal clavicle above the acromion (percentage of clavicle width) distance from undersurface of clavicle to superior cortex of the coracoid process (coracoclavicular space) The most commonly used classification was proposed by Rockwood Radiographs are normal, with no widening or displacement. MR can nevertheless demonstrate strain with an increased signal of the capsule and ligaments [ AC joint is widened in the frontal plane, but no superior clavicle displacement is seen as CC ligaments remain continuous (unchanged CC space) The lateral end of the clavicle is displaced above the superior border of the acromion, the CC interspace is greater than in the normal shoulder ( The clavicle is displaced superiorly and posteriorly. Manual reduction is not possible. Extremely rare, the clavicle is displaced inferiorly of the distal clavicle and lies behind the coracobrachialis and biceps tendons The scapula is a flat bone with a triangular body, its superior and inferior aspects forming two primary struts The scapular spine is a prominent ridge that raises on the posterosuperior aspect of the scapular body. Laterally, the body of the scapula widens to form the glenoid fossa, which is the articular surface for the humeral head. The glenoid fossa is circumferentially surrounded by the glenoid rim. The connection of the medial border of the scapular body and of the scapular spine is called the spinomedial angle The acromion is a posterolateral process formed by the flat end of the scapular spine lying anterolaterally to the glenoid fossa. It articulates with the distal clavicle at the level of the AC joint The coracoid process is an anterolateral process with three segments [ a base: usually involved in lateral impaction by the humeral head an ascending section where the CC ligaments insert a horizontal section where several muscles anchor (pectoralis minor, brachialis, short head of the biceps) Three mechanisms are generally encountered in scapula fractures a direct blow to the scapula (body, acromion) an impact by the humeral head (glenoid fossa, neck, processes) associated or not to a glenohumeral dislocation an avulsion of muscles (horizontal section of coracoid) or ligaments (vertical section of coracoid) Several classifications of scapular fractures exist. Again, to ease description, fractures of the scapula can be schematically divided into 4 categories ( articular, involving the glenoid surface scapular neck scapular body acromion and coracoid processes (fractures of upper scapula) In the vast majority of cases, fractures of the glenoid result from an impaction from the humeral head, usually in the circumstances of a glenohumeral dislocation Most fractures, therefore, involve the anteroinferior quadrant of the glenoid ( Fractures of the scapular body and neck result from high energy trauma Then, it can run: horizontally through the scapular body, to exit at the level of the medial angle vertically, to separate the neck from the body. Fractures of the neck and body can be challenging to detect on radiographs because of the superimposition with the chest wall, the thinness of the scapular body and the usual absence of displacement CT is recommended as it usually confirms the fracture, and volume rendering technique eases injury evaluation and surgical planning [ The glenopolar angle (GPA) is the angle formed by two lines: one connecting the glenoid most cranial and caudal points of and the other connecting the most cranial point of the glenoid with the most caudal end of the scapula. The normal GPA ranges between 30° and 45°; it is reduced in fractures of the scapula body/neck as the fragments of the lateral border of the scapula are translated medially ( If fractures of the scapular neck are associated with a fracture of the ipsilateral clavicle, it results in the “floating shoulder”, an unstable condition that commonly requires surgical management ( Fractures of the acromion can be isolated, but are more commonly associated with an injury of the AC joint ( A common pitfall of acromion fracture is the os acromiale, an accessory bone present at the distal extremity of the acromion ( Fractures of the coracoid process can involve: the base: impaction injury by the humeral head ( the vertical section: avulsion by the CC ligaments the horizontal section: avulsion of coracobrachialis/biceps muscle insertion ( Scapulothoracic dissociation is a traumatic separation of the scapula and upper extremity from the thorax Soft tissue injuries involve several muscles (trapezius, deltoid, pectoralis minor, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid, levator scapulae), axillar artery and brachial plexus The lateral displacement of both scapulae is compared on both sides by measuring the distance between the line of thoracic spinous processes and the medial border of the scapula. Are considered consistent with scapulothoracic dissociation until proven otherwise [ a scapular index >1.29 a difference >1 cm The shoulder girdle is disrupted by a clavicle fracture a high-grade AC dissociation a SC dislocation Increased soft-tissue density can be seen around the scapula, indicating a hematoma from muscular and vascular injury. Angiograms can reveal arterial disruption (
