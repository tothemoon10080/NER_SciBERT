An offline simulation tool for silicon refining is extended with an improved model for skull formation. In this model, skulls are seen as highly viscous slag with droplets of refined silicon trapped within. Since slag viscosity depends strongly on its lime content, the degree of skull formation varies with how much calcium is removed from the melt. The skulls influence the geometry of the ladle as well as the heat balance, and accumulate from tap to tap. It is seen that the simulation results reflect data from normal operation.
