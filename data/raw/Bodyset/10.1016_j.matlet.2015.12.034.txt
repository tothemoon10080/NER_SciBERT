A new method is reported for fast fabrication of W–Cr alloys by combustion synthesis under Ar gas pressure of 2MPa. The W–Cr alloy with W/Cr=1 in atomic ratio shows a hierarchical microstructure consisting of both micro- and nano-sized grains, which is proposed to be produced by spinodal decomposition. The hierarchical microstructure contributes to an improved hardness of 9.6GPa, which is about 50% higher than that of W–Cr alloys prepared by conventional powder sintering.Tungsten (W) is considered as a promising material for high temperature applications because of its high melting point Because the inter-diffusion in the W–Cr system is very slow, it is difficult to prepare dense W–Cr alloys by powder sintering, which usually requires the addition of appropriate sintering aids In this paper, we report an alternative method to prepare W–Cr alloys by combustion synthesis. By this method, dense W–Cr alloys are produced by melt solidification instead of powder sintering. The prepared W–Cr alloys show a hierarchical microstructure and much improved hardness. Combustion synthesis may offer a more efficient way to produce W–Cr alloys with reduced time and energy consumption. The starting reactant was prepared by mixing commercial powders of Al, Cr The bulk density of the W–Cr alloys was measured according to the Archimedes principle. The Vickers hardness was measured by the indentation method with a load of 98 The reaction of (2+4 For the compositions of W and Cr belong to the same group in the element periodical table, and have the same body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure. According to the W–Cr binary phase diagram (  The density and hardness of the CrW This paper reports a new method for fast preparation of W–Cr alloys by combustion synthesis.
