This chapter discusses the ARBRE project. It examines the new business opportunity being created in the biomass sector of the United Kingdom's renewable energy program. First Renewables Ltd (FRL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Kelda Group develops, constructs, and operates renewable energy projectsâ€”currently wind and biomass, including the world's first ARBRE project. ARBRE provide sufficient electricity for the domestic needs of 33,500 people through gasification and combustion of wood fuel provided from the management of new willow coppices and existing forestry residues. European and national studies to determine the potential for renewable energies have confirmed that the biomass sector is of political, economic, environmental, and social importance, and has a large and essentially under-developed potential. The main driving forces to the successful commercial development of biomass on the global stage: the potential scale, nature of likely participants and its contribution within the renewable energy mix will also be discussed. The opportunity exists now to translate political and environmental targets into a successful business sector within the timeframe needed to fulfill the Kyoto obligations. Recently, the United Kingdom Government announcements are encouraging, but further urgent work is required on the detailed implementation plans for the potential to be realized.
