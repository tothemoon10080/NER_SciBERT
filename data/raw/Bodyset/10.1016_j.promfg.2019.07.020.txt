Iron ore is one of the major raw materials required to produce iron and steel products. However, there is a need to characterise the iron ore to determine their grade based on the iron and other mineral contents before usage. In this study, iron ores from Jaruwa and Agbaja deposits were characterised using X-ray diffractometer, X-ray florescence spectrometer, scanning electron microscope and petrographic microscope. Phase identification and chemical compositions revealed that the iron ore content of the Jaruwa deposit is higher (68%) than that of the Agbaja deposit (53%). The phosphorus contents of both deposits are higher than 0.04% recommended for high grade iron ore. Iron ore from Agbaja deposit contains more silica and alumina than Jaruwa deposit. A spherical ooids (concentric layer) that shows partial and whole replacement by hematite (iron precipitates around a nucleus) was observed on the petrograph of Agbaja ore as against the more dark areas which signified more iron contents in Jaruwa iron ore. Based on the findings, Jaruwa deposit can be classified as high grade hematite iron ore while Agbaja deposit can be classified as lean grade, although both can serve as feedstock for production of iron through direct reduction route.
