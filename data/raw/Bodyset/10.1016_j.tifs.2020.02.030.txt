Background
                  Marine Enteromorpha polysaccharides (EPPs) have been reported to present various physiological and bioactivities based on their specific chemical structures, such as monosaccharide compositions and glycosidic linkages.
               
                  Scope and approach
                  However, the structure-activity relationship of Enteromorpha polysaccharides is mostly unknown. This review aims to provide a brief summary of structural, functional, and chemical characteristics of Enteromorpha polysaccharides.
               
                  Key findings and conclusions
                  Modified Enteromorpha polysaccharides have several powerful bioactive functions. Sulfated EPPs with lower molecular weights were found to exhibit excellent immune-relevant and antioxidant activities. Carboxymethylated, hydroxamated, phthaloyl, and acetylated derivatives also showed significantly enhanced antioxidant and antibacterial activities as well as moisture absorbing capacities. EPPs were considered as novel natural agents, exhibiting outstanding druggable effects compared with ordinary drugs. However, the structure-function relationships of them are yet to be clearly established. The purpose of this overview is focusing on the current advances in the structural characterization, biological activities and mechanisms of action of Enteromorpha polysaccharides.Green algae have attracted increasing attention for their important functional properties and potential biological applications (  The monosaccharide compositions of EPPs have been analyzed by hydrolysis, derivatization, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detection ( Molecular weight (MW) is a key factor to influence antioxidant and immune activities. The MWs of EPPs are closely correlated with their functional bioactivities and mostly range from 10 The methods adopted to investigate the structures of polysaccharides include high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, methylation analyses, high-performance gel-permeation chromatography, gas chromatography, and infrared spectroscopy ( It has been reported that sulfation and its position in the polysaccharides enhanced their antioxidant, anti-coagulant, and antiviral properties ( Polysaccharides in plant, fungi, and alga have immunomodulatory activities and regulate the innate immune functions. The immune system includes nonspecific and specific immunity. Nonspecific immunity can immediately respond to invaders without encountering previous pathogen, and gives signals to subsequently activate adaptive specific immunity ( Glucans having β-1,3- linkages and β-1,6- linkages were significant for the cell immune function ( Free radicals/reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate cell growth Chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments for cancer and malignant tumor are widely used, with many side effects such as injury of normal cells ( Due to the occurrence of bacterial resistance against commercial antibiotics, the discovery of novel natural antibiotics has become a global public health issue ( Human gut microbiota encode the abundance and variety of carbohydrate-active enzymes degrading and fermenting the polysaccharides of plant origin to oligosaccharides, which are absorbed into body easily, producing significant therapeutic effects ( Hyperlipidemia, as a common endocrine disease, induces cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and atherosclerosis ( Some anticoagulants used in clinical treatment, such as heparin sodium, have side effects such as bleeding, causing thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis syndrome ( EPPs have shown various biological activities and potential health benefits, such as respiratory burst activities, anti-virus, and anti-cancer. They have also been treated as iron fortifiers and mutant inhibitors. In addition, In this review, recent advances in the study of the composition and biological activities of In conclusion, a significant interest has been generated over This work was jointly supported by
