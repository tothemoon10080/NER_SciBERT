The kinetics of forward extraction of boric acid from salt lake brine by 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol in toluene was investigated using the single drop technique. The factors affecting the extraction rate include interfacial area between aqueous phase and organic phase, initial concentration of boric acid in aqueous phase, initial concentration of 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol in organic phase, and extraction temperature. The experimental results show that the extraction rate increases with the increase of the initial concentration of boric acid and 2-ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, interfacial area of two phases, and temperature. With the temperature-dependence study, it is showed that the extraction is a diffusion-controlled process. The kinetic equation is presented for pH 1.0 in the aqueous phase and temperature of 318 K.
