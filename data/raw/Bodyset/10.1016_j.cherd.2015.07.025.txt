CHEMECA is a regional chemical engineering conference held annually in a capital or major city in Australia or New Zealand. CHEMECA 2014 was held in Perth from 28 September to 1 October 2014. In terms of the number of delegates, the high quality of the research works presented and the financial returns, the conference was an outstanding success. More than 350 delegates attended and, of these, approximately one hundred were from countries as widespread as Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, UAE, Qatar, United Kingdom and USA. About 350 oral and poster presentations were given during this two and half day conference. Over 150 full papers were submitted for review to be included in the proceedings and the papers accepted covered a range of areas: oil and gas processing, mineral processing and particle technology, pharmaceuticals and food processing, rheology, nanotechnology, catalysis, waste processing and pollution, separation processes, heat transfer, education and others. Chemical Engineering Research and Design was one of two journals producing a special CHEMECA 2014 issue of selected papers. A number of papers were selected for this journal and each paper's author was invited to submit an extended version of their paper to be considered for journal publication. As the technical co-chairs of CHEMECA 2014, we are thankful to have been invited to be the guest editors of this special issue and we also wish to thank each reviewer for their work reviewing these papers.
