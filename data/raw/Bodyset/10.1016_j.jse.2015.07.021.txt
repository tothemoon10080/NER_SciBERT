Prospective, randomized studies are welcome in the orthopedic literature. The primary management of the displaced midshaft clavicle fracture has been the subject of several recent prospective studies. The study by Melean et al aimed to examine union rates, functional outcome, and return to work of those treated with primary open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) vs. nonoperative management. Despite randomization, the authors failed to achieve balance between groups in fracture comminution, a potential confounding variable. The rate of nonunion requiring surgery in the conservatively managed group was 4 of 41 (11.7%). This suggests that if primary ORIF were to be offered to this group, 88.3% of surgery would be unnecessary. Therefore, the relative rate of total surgical procedures in the surgical intervention group compared with nonintervention was 10.3 (95% confidence interval, 4.0-27.0; The authors have measured and compared functional outcome using the Constant score. They report a statistically significant difference between surgical and conservatively managed groups at 6 months (4 points) and 12 months (6 points). These differences fall short of previously used minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs). The effect was also exaggerated by the choice of y-axis scale in their Figure 2. Sufficient high-quality evidence already exists to counsel patients about the rate of nonunion with nonoperative vs. operative management. Yours sincerely,
