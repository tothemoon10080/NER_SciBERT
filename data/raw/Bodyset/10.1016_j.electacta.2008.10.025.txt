The acid corrosion inhibition process of mild steel in 1M HCl by 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (BMIC) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIM]HSO4) has been investigated using electrochemical impedance, potentiodynamic polarization and weight loss measurements. Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicate the studied inhibitors are mixed type inhibitors. For both inhibitors, the inhibition efficiency increased with increase in the concentration of the inhibitor and the effectiveness of the two inhibitors are in the order [BMIM]HSO4
                     >BMIC. The adsorption of the inhibitors on mild steel surface obeyed the Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. The effect of temperature on the corrosion behavior in the presence of 5×10−3

Because of the general aggressively of acid solutions, inhibitors are commonly used to reduce the corrosive attack on metallic materials.
