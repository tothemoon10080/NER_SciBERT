Increasing effectiveness of flotation regulation is reached at the expense of simultaneous control of parameters of solid and liquid phases of pulp and using regulation methods, based on physic-chemical models of the process. The system of automatic regulation of flotation process RA-931 . meets in a large degree requirements, imposed on such systems. Increasing effectiveness of flotation process control with the use of combined systems of pulp parameters control is possible on the basis of modem control algorithms with the use of optimization program (computer code) ADDEFLOT, realized at automated flotation facility. Thus, applying the system of automatic control and the adaptation-determination method of regulation allows to optimize conditions of flotation process and, on this basis, both increase recovery of valuable components by 1-2% and increase cost of the recovered components by 2-3%.
