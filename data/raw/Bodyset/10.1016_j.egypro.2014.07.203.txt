Green rubber composites can be tailored made to suit applications with desired properties by incorporating particulate natural fibers into a rubber matrix. The effect of fibers content filled in natural rubber (NR) green composite on mechanical properties has been studied. The jute fiber loading in natural rubber were 0, 10, 20 and 40 wt%. The rubber green composite compounding was prepared by using two roll mills and then molded by hot compression molding technique. The resulted suggested that increasing filler content tended to increased modulus and hardness but decreased Tensile strength of the composite. Compared between NR/Jute-untreated and NR/jute treated. The results showed that NR/jute untreated can improve mechanical properties of composite more than NR/jute treated HANR. This may be due to distribution of fiber may effect to improve mechanical properties of composite in this study.
