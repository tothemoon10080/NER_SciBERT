The hypocentres of intermediate-depth earthquakes have been shown to overlap with the regions in subducting slabs that contain high abundances of hydrous minerals. This relationship was initially revealed using geophysical and numerical modelling and until recently has lacked corroboration from direct field-based research. We evaluated the relationship of the coincidence of intermediate-depth earthquakes with hydrous minerals in the slab by undertaking detailed geochemical analyses of blueschist to lawsonite to eclogite facies pseudotachylytes and their hostrocks located within an exhumed ophiolite, the Eocene Schistes Lustres Complex in Corsica. These units comprise incompletely metamorphosed metagabbro and peridotite. The wallrocks of the pseudotachylytes contain variable amounts of hydrous minerals: tremolite, Mg-hornblende, glaucophane in the metagabbro, and serpentine, tremolite and chlorite in the peridotite. Back-scatter-electron images show that the hydrous minerals entrained in the melt undergo fusion rather than dehydration. Vesicular and H2O-rich melt veins are observed cross-cutting partially molten pseudotachylyte fault veins and show evidence of H2O exsolution during melt solidification. The crystallisation products of these melts indicate formation under high temperature, high pressure conditions (1400–1700°C; 1.5GPa). The peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes crystallised olivine, orthopyroxene and diopside, which are surrounded by interstitial Al- and H2O-rich glass. The metagabbro pseudotachylyte is dominated by Al-rich omphacite, ilmenite and high-Fe anorthite. XRF bulk analyses of the wallrock of the pseudotachylyte and electron microprobe analyses of the pseudotachylyte matrix, entrained survivor clasts and the crystallisation products show that near-total disequilibrium melting took place. The peridotite-hosted pseudotachylyte composition is skewed strongly towards chlorite; however, the preservation of delicate dendritic diopside and olivine hopper crystals suggests that the pseudotachylyte is unaltered, indicating that preferential fusion of chlorite took place. The metagabbro-hosted pseudotachylyte matrix composition is very similar to the bulk wallrock composition but slightly skewed by the preferential melting of Mg-hornblende and tremolite. Not all the pseudotachylytes are hydrous as the H2O content of the melts is highly variable; the metagabbro–pseudotachylyte ranges from 0 to 4wt.% and the peridotite–pseudotachylyte ranges from 0 to 14wt.%. The range in H2O content of the pseudotachylytes has lead us to conclude that the localised dehydration of hydrous minerals may be a second order factor in initiating intermediate-depth seismicity. However, we have observed that the pseudotachylytes with the most chaotic vein networks, thickest fault veins and most comminuted material have the highest abundances of hydrous wallrock minerals, possibly owing to repeated fluid ingress in between pseudotachylyte-generating events. This implies that free fluids enhance pseudotachylyte generation and possibly seismicity, but are not a first order requirement. Microtextural and geochemical results from this study suggest that the presence of abundant H2O-rich minerals in the slab exerts a strong rheological control during high strain-rate deformation, facilitating thermally-triggered localising shear instabilities. These field-based observations allow us to explore the assumption of the causal link between slab hydration and earthquake nucleation, and offer fresh insight into the debate of how intermediate-depth earthquakes take place.Intermediate-depth earthquakes occur in subduction zones at depths of 50–300 By analysing the fault rocks of intermediate-depth earthquakes directly we can evaluate the proposed importance of hydrous minerals in generating these phenomena. Do they facilitate dehydration embrittlement, weakening in wallrock or does the H High pressure pseudotachylytes from various localities (Blue Ridge Province, North Carolina; the Ivrea-Verbano zone, Italy; the Krakeneset gabbro, Norway) have been studied on a number of scales and from various aspects in order to ascertain the mechanism by which they form ( Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain intermediate-depth seismicity and associated pseudotachylyte generation under blueschist and eclogite facies conditions. These mechanisms encompass a range between two end-member processes, which will be discussed in more detail: dehydration embrittlement and a-thermally induced shear instability end-member (TSI). The hypothesis tested in this study is that a form of TSI is the initiating process of intermediate-depth seismicity and associated PST generation, as implicated by the observations discussed in this paper. The principles of these two mechanisms are summarised briefly below. Dehydration embrittlement is based on experimental observations that show that rock materials become weak and brittle upon dehydration of their hydrous minerals, facilitating unstable faulting and inducing seismic failure ( To date there are several models of how high pressure pseudotachylytes might form, all of which are based on thermally-activated shear instabilities ( Unlike dehydration embrittlement, TSI is a process by which coseismic shear heating under high differential stresses induces localised viscous deformation, in a visco-elastic material, such as silicate rocks ( At such high strain rates (> There may be several alternatives for precisely how TSI is initiated, but current experimental research and numerical modelling suggest that as rocks are heterogeneous materials, the stress imposed will be concentrated in minute domains where the effective viscosity in the rock is locally greatly decreased and acts as strain concentrators ( The study area is located on the SSW side of Cima di Gratera in Cape Corse, northern Corsica ( The studied metagabbros are compositionally uniform, but display a range of igneous textures marked by changes in grain size and igneous layering; interfingering of irregularly shaped textural domains is common ( In outcrop the pseudotachylytes typically have a positive relief with respect to the hostrocks. The veins weather to a rust-red colour (in the peridotite) or to a navy blue-black (in the metagabbro), but on fresh surfaces the pseudotachylytes are black-grey and aphanitic ( Detailed thin section petrography and back-scatter electron (BSE) imaging for mineral identification and microtextural analyses were performed on both gabbro- and peridotite-hosted PST. Electron microprobe analyses were done on a Cameca SX-100 instrument housed at Spectrau Laboratory, University of Johannesburg, South Africa. Analyses include bulk matrix (wide beam), wallrock, entrained minerals as well as crystallisation products (glass and crystallites). The beam current was reduced so as to minimise Na loss on glass, but tests on higher currents (> Detailed petrographic and microtextural analyses were carried out on both metagabbro- and peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes. The results following from those analyses were published in a separate paper ( The metagabbro hostrock has a bimodal grain size distribution, with metre wide irregular domains of very coarse-grained (maximum grain diameter up to 15 The igneous mineralogy of the metagabbro that hosts the pseudotachylytes is partially preserved and consists of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and minor ilmenite ( The early greenschist to upper greenschist metamorphism of the hostrock may be associated with sea floor hydration and/or hydration-associated fracturing in the slab bend, as well as earlier hydration associated with pre-Alpine extensional tectonics ( The peridotite hostrocks show gradational transitions from fine- to coarse-grained varieties (< Hydrous minerals are present in irregular patches in both the peridotite and metagabbro wallrocks and in proximity to the boundaries of pseudotachylyte veins. The abundance of hydrous minerals in both wallrock lithologies does not have a spatial relationship with the pseudotachylytes (e.g. increasing towards vein boundaries) and appears incidental. Hydrous minerals show evidence of having formed prior to, after and in between pseudotachylyte-forming events ( As mentioned previously, the detailed petrographic analyses have already been published in a separate paper ( Fault and injection veins of pristine pseudotachylytes from both hostrock lithologies were analysed using detailed thin section petrography followed by analysis of the same samples by electron microprobe (EPMA). Fault veins are classified as those that form parallel to displacement orientation; injection veins are secondary and originate at parent fault veins and extend into the adjacent wallrock. For all vein types the boundary between the vein and the wallrock is always sharp. Fault vein boundaries are commonly marked by the presence of gouge, approximately 50 BSE imaging of the pseudotachylytes reveals the presence of fluid/melt-bearing vesicles ( Crosscutting pseudotachylytes with matrices that contain clasts of comminuted and sheared out pseudotachylytes are indicative of multiple generations of pseudotachylyte that have formed along the same fault planes ( Within the peridotite hostrock, there are fault veins derived from older pseudotachylytes that have recrystallised and annealed back to a fine-grained (5–30 Ternary diagrams of wallrock minerals and the pseudotachylyte matrix for both metagabbro- and peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes are plotted ( The microlite assemblages for both the metagabbro and peridotite pseudotachylytes have been divided into two groups: a high temperature quench mineralogy and a low temperature recrystallization/devitrification assemblage. The former assemblage constitutes those minerals crystallised immediately after the pseudotachylyte was generated, at temperatures much higher (> The crystallisation products of the metagabbro-hosted pseudotachylytes comprise a consistent, but unusual mineralogy of Al-rich omphacite and Fe-rich plagioclase, with minor accessory ilmenite. This Al-rich omphacite was previously classified as fassaite by The high temperature crystallisation products of peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes comprise clinopyroxene, olivine and orthopyroxene, with interstitial glass ( The composition diagrams of the metagabbro and peridotite pseudotachylytes show wallrock compositions that overlie the bulk pseudotachylyte compositions ( SE imaging and BSE imaging of the coarse- and fine-grained peridotite-hosted pseudotachylyte fault veins reveal that both inter-granular syndeformational faulting and intra-granular syndeformational faulting took place ( Melt and fluids escaping the pseudotachylyte fault veins have exploited pre-existing intragranular fractures and induced localised melting ( Possible reasons for these observations are that the Corsican PST evolved from mafic bulk rocks (metagabbro and peridotite) where deformation is controlled by olivine and pyroxene flow laws, and the rate of change in strain rate during the seismic cycle ( In the fine-grained peridotite-hosted PST, strained olivine neoblasts may have contained significant amounts of intra-granular H Low totals for EPMA of bulk pseudotachylyte matrices have been confirmed for both the metagabbro- and the peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes; these, combined with the associated BSE images of areas analysed, have been interpreted to indicate the presence of water in these melts ( The exsolution of such fluids into the pseudotachylytic matrix implies that at some point after fusion of minerals and prior to the total solidification of the melt, fluids (and some melt) reached supersaturation. This is in agreement with observations made in a high pressure melting experiment by Comparatively, the peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes have more H The EPMA analyses of the metagabbro omphacite microlites show the minerals to be unusually enriched in Al A recent high resolution tomographic study of intermediate-depth earthquakes in Hokkaido, Japan ( The observations made in this study are in broad agreement with the results of Curiously, despite the presence of serpentine in the hostrocks, in this case study, chlorite and tremolite/actinolite, and not serpentine, are the principal hydrous minerals participating in the seismic generation of high pressure peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes. This is likely due to the composition of the peridotite hostrock, a plagioclase-spinel lherzolite, dominated by clinopyroxene, which alters more readily to chlorite and amphibole than serpentine. The intercalation of comminuted and altered wallrock and old PST with younger PST in coarse-grained peridotite-hosted pseudotachylytes indicates that the fault zone has been repeatedly reactivated. Altered and hydrated PST cut by younger pristine PST suggests that between periods of seismicity the fault zone was exposed to fluid influx. This characteristic is only observed in the coarse-grained peridotite PST, where the thickest veins (up to 30 Energy budget and source parameter modelling of recent magnitude 4–5 earthquakes in the Bucaramanga Nest, Colombia have been studied as analogues of intermediate-depth earthquakes ( Intracrystalline H It has been assumed that intermediate-depth earthquakes and the presence of high abundances of hydrous minerals in the subducting slab are causally linked ( With regard to the mechanism that produces high pressure pseudotachylytes, we are increasingly observing that the rheological behaviour of the deforming bulk rock may be the principal control ( In order to better understand the role of water in intermediate-depth earthquakes we performed a detailed geochemical, mineralogical and micro-textural analysis of high-pressure pseudotachylytes reported as relicts of such events. We suggest that the studied seismic rupture events took place along the lower plane (intra-plate position) of a double seismic subduction zone. From this study we conclude that: There is no indication that free water was present prior to generation of pseudotachylytes, suggesting that the abundant water dissolved in the pseudotachylyte melts (up to 14 Fluids were present in the hostrocks as hydroxyl ions in water-bearing minerals and as intracrystalline impurities but not chemically-bound water in anhydrous wallrock minerals. Evidence for prograde metamorphic dehydration reactions has not been observed. Increasing amounts of water present in the pseudotachylyte melts correspond with increasing fault-vein complexity, vein thicknesses and the thickness of the fault damage zones. This is exemplified by the comparison of peridotite and metagabbro fault-veins, where the ultramafic pseudotachylytes are both more complex, show more cataclastic deformation features and have higher water contents. Relative fracture toughness and melting/breaking temperature of wallrock minerals influence the bulk composition of PST. Presence of water in rocks that otherwise are dominated by coarse-grained anhydrous minerals (olivine, pyroxenes) is a fundamental facilitator in generating pseudotachylytes through the preferential melting of hydrous wall-rock minerals, as well as by the hydrolytic weakening of dissolved water in anhydrous minerals. Fault vein orientation at nucleation sites in fine-grained examples suggests a crystallographic control on fault propagation. In the case of the peridotitic pseudotachylytes, olivine as the most abundant and toughest mineral in the rock assemblage is likely to exert a principal control on the orientation of pseudotachylyte fault and associated injection veins. Al-rich omphacite microlites that crystallised directly from mafic pseudotachylytes in metagabbro provide additional evidence to quantify the thermal excursion (1400–1700 This work is supported by The following are the supplementary data related to this article.
