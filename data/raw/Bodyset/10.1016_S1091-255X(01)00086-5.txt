This prospective study evaluated bone changes after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) consisting of a distal gastrectomy, a 250 cm alimentary channel, and a 50 cm common channel. Thirty-three consecutive patients had clinical, biochemical, and bone mineral density analysis before surgery and 4 and 10 years after surgery. Iliac crest bone biopsies and special tests including parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-OH2-D), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin were obtained at surgery and 4 years postoperatively. Over the years, with close metabolic surveillance, additional calcium and vitamin D were given as indicated. After BPD, serum levels of calcium and vitamin D were decreased and serum levels of PTH, BAP, and osteocalcin were increased. Bone turnover and mineralization were both increased. Mean osteoid volume (P < 0.0007) and bone formation rate in relation to bone volume (P < 0.02) were increased. Static measures of bone were altered as follows: cortical thickness decreased (P < 0.01) and trabecular bone volume increased (P < 0.01). Ten years after surgery, overall bone mineral density was unchanged at the hip and was decreased by 4% at the lumbar spine. Overall fracture risk, based on the Z score, was unchanged. Preoperative factors predicting bone loss included menopause, smoking, and preexisting osteopenia. An elevated level of 1,25-OH2-D was also found to be a predictor of future bone loss (r = 0.40; P < 0.002). After surgery, a greater increase in bone markers and bone turnover was associated with an increased risk of bone loss. Although elevated osteocalcin levels were associated with overall bone loss (r = 0.52; P < 0.002), lower albumin levels were associated only with bone loss at hip level (r = 0.44; P < 0.02), whereas lower calcium levels were associated only with the loss at the lumbar spine (r = 0.39; P < 0.02). Ten years after surgery, bone loss at the hip continued to depend on albumin levels (r = 0.37; P < 0.03). We concluded that bone was relatively tolerant to the metabolic changes due to BPD. Provided that there is close surveillance for metabolic disturbances, the use of appropriate supplements, and the avoidance of malnutrition, the beneficial effects of surgery far outweigh the risk of postoperative bone disease.
