The equilibrium solubility is the basis for purification and further theoretical studies of o-vanillin. In this paper, the solubility data of o-vanillin in three pure solvents, including water, ethanol, n-propanol, and two binary solvents of water + ethanol and water + n-propanol has been experimented under atmospheric pressure (p = 0.1 MPa) in the temperature range from 273.15 K to 303.15 K. The experimental results proved that the rising temperature leads to increased solubility of o-vanillin in all selected solvents. All the solubility data in different pure and binary solvents was correlated by the modified Apelblat equation. The computational values were in good agreement with the experimental results according to the calculations. In addition, some thermodynamic parameters of o-vanillin including dissolution enthalpy (

The mass fraction purity of o-vanillin was greater than 0.999, the detection conditions are as follows: injection temperature 250 °C, column temperature 180 °C, FID temperature 280 °C, residence time 10 min, on a GC 9720 gas chromatography (Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instruments, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a SE-54 column (i.d. 0.32 mm, length 30 m, film thickness 0.25 μm). The result of GC analysis was presented in To identify the crystal polymorphism, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was used to analyse o-vanillin of the raw material and the o-vanillin solids in equilibrium with the saturated solution during the solubility experiments. The data were obtained using a Brucker D8 advance (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a Cu Kα target radiation ( In this experiment, an isothermal saturation method was used to determine the solute solubility at the temperature range from 273.15 K to 303.15 K After the vessels were continuously agitated for 24 h at a constant temperature, it can be confirmed that the (solid + liquid) equilibrium was reached, which has been proved in preliminary experiments. Then the agitation was stopped and the solid-liquid mixture was kept stagnant for 4 h at the constant temperature to guarantee that the undissolved particles had settled. Then preheated/cooled syringes and syringe filters (0.22 μm, Shanghai Titan Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used to take liquid samples from the upper clear saturated solution, respectively. Each of the experiments was repeated three times and the arithmetic average value was used as the final result. The equilibrium liquids were analysed by HPLC machine (Dionex UltiMate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) with a reverse phase column (C18 column, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, Shimadzu, Japan). The temperature of the phase column box was set at 298.15 K. The wavelength of the UV detector was 220 nm. The mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (30:70, volume ratio) was utilized as the mobile phase; the flow rate was 1.0 mL·min The saturated mole fraction solubility of o-vanillin ( The binary solvents mixtures were prepared by mass quantities of 40.00 g with the electronic analytical balance.
