Current magnetic separators are only able to split the feed into three different streams. In this work we simulate the behavior of different particles in a new magnetic-classifier, named MAGCLA™, which is capable to separate and classify particles according to their magnetic susceptibilities. In this first part of the work the results for a blank simulation are reported. This study is the mandatory basis of comparison for the assessment of the influence of the process variables in the outcome results. These comparative studies will be reported in future works.acceleration of the particle (m/s acceleration in the tangential acceleration of the particle (m/s total acceleration (m/s acceleration in the acceleration on the cross-sectional area of the particle (m drag coefficient friction force (N) centrifugal force (N) drag force (N) magnetic force (N) gravity acceleration (m/s height of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier (m) initial height of the fed particles (m) overall current intensity flowing in the superconducting cable (A) mass of the particle (kg) number of turns given by the particles in the surface of the device reaction of the surface (N) weight (N) radial distance between the particle and the geometrical center (m) radius of the cylindrical part of the body of the separator–classifier (m) external radius of the central collector (m) internal radius of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier (m) initial radius of the fed particles (m) radius at which magnetic particles depart towards the center (m) radius of the particle (m) fictitious radius to account for the deviations to ideality (m) radius of the superconducting magnet plus cryostat system (m) time (s) time of arrival of the magnetic particles at the central collector (s) theoretical adimensional parameters that measure the disparities between theory and practice time of arrival of the magnetic particles at the largest radius of the trunk ( time at which magnetic particles depart towards the central collector (s) velocity of the particle in the direction of the movement (m/s) velocity of the particle in the tangential direction of the circular movement (m/s) velocity in the velocity of the magnetic particles in the velocity of particle in the total velocity of the particle in the total velocity of the particle (m/s) total velocity of the particle at the moment of arrival at the central collector (m/s) velocity of particle in the total velocity of particle at the moment when the magnetic particles depart towards the central collector (m/s) velocity in the velocity of particle in the velocity of particle in the velocity of the particle in the the velocity of the particle in the the volume of the particles (m height displacement (m) height of arrival of the magnetic particles in the central collector (m) height at which magnetic particles depart towards the central collector (m) angle between the body of the separator–classifier and the horizontal (°) angle between the total velocity and the radial velocity (third part of the movement) (°) angle between the total velocity and the radial velocity, at the moment of arrival of the magnetic particles in the central collector (°) magnetic susceptibility of the particle (m lowest value of the magnetic susceptibility that the magnetic particles must possess in order to depart towards the central collector (thus being classified) before reaching radius highest value of the magnetic susceptibility that the magnetic particles must possess in order to be classified at the central collector, as all the particles presenting a magnetic susceptibility value higher than lowest value of the magnetic susceptibility that the magnetic particles must possess in order to be separated from the non-magnetic ones at the feeding radius (m angle between the total velocity and the rotational axis (°) angle between the total velocity and the rotational axis, at the moment when the particles depart towards the central collector (°) friction coefficient for the surface of the separator–classifier on the tangential direction friction coefficient in the friction coefficient in the vacuum permeability (T rotational displacement (°) rotational displacement, at the moment when the particles depart towards the central collector (°) density of the fluid (kg/m density of the particle (kg/m angular velocity of the body of the MAGCLA™ (rad/s) Although traditionally considered a minerals processing technique, magnetic separation is very often applied to several other areas of science and technology (e.g., chemical engineering In this work the behavior for a specific system will be simulated in order to establish a blank test that will be used as basis for comparison in subsequent papers. To reach this goal, the supporting theory of MAGCLA™ Detailed descriptions of the new apparatus working principles can be found in previous works The discrepancies between the real and the theoretical behavior of the particles have been taken in account by two coefficients – In order to determine the influence of each processing parameter in the magnetic classification and separation process outcomes, the parameter under study was varied while keeping constant all the other parameters. The ideal procedure was to be able to vary all the parameters simultaneously, but this is a very complicated situation, if not impossible, to analyze. In fact, the optimization-goal varies from case to case, depending exclusively upon the choice of the operator. Thus, we consider that the methodology followed not only allows the analysis of the influence of each variable, but also to obtain the spectrum of values advisable for an optimum performance of the separator–classifier. The six parameters considered in this study are: the angle between the body of the separator–classifier and the horizontal line, The optimization-goal (although it varies from case to case) was generically considered (only for comparison purposes) as the separation and classification of the largest possible spectrum of magnetic susceptibilities. It was also considered as optimization-goal, in what concerns magnetic particles, the separation and classification of wolframite particles present in the feed with 100% purity. The friction coefficient in the rotational direction ( For each variable study and for the blank simulation we only present in this papers the final results obtained for the values considered for the processing variable under analysis and for the values considered in the case of the blank simulation; the detailed partial results may be found in Ref. For a better comparison of the results of the simulations we have always considered a typical separation process, the blank simulation, which will be used in future works. For this blank simulation we have considered that our feed was only constituted by generical non-magnetic particles and by wolframite particles 100% pure. As the first optimization-goal of this blank simulation we have considered the separation between the non-magnetic particles and the particles of wolframite 100% pure, and as the second optimization-goal we have considered that after the initial separation the wolframite particles would descend on the surface of the trunk of the MAGCLA™ for a while, and at a certain radius ( The main characteristics of the particles (magnetic and non-magnetic) considered were typical ones (and are presented in The results were divided into two main categories: non-magnetic and magnetic particles. Bearing in mind the magnetic particles, the results obtained for the two main stages of the movement were also presented: movement of the particles upon the surface of the body of the separator–classifier and movement of the particles in flight towards the central collector. The values in percentage refer to the degree of purity of the wolframite particles – typical case – which are separated considering the values of the processing variables in question. This percentage was computed considering that the magnetic susceptibility of pure wolframite particles (100% pure) is 12 The trajectories followed by the non-magnetic particles, obtained by simulation considering the parameters given in  In the case of magnetic particles is important to define the following variables (see  Regarding the results present in That with the values chosen for the processing variables, the lowest value of the magnetic susceptibility which the magnetic particles must possess in order to be separated from the non-magnetic ones at the feeding radius, corresponds to 8.753 The low value of the lift-off time of the magnetic particles (during the trajectory supported upon the trunk), and the moderately high velocities and deflection angle they present at the radius of “lift-off” ( The very low value of the flight time of the magnetic particles (from the moment they lift-off from the trunk until they reach the central collector), and the moderately high velocities they present in the arrival at the central collector. The detaching path that the magnetic particles follow in the second part of their movement, and the height at which they are collected. These results show that the second and part of the first optimization-goals were achieved, and as before (in the non-magnetic case) they indicate that the values chosen for the parameters and variables are appropriate for a blank simulation, has they induce that there is enough margin to vary the processing variables in future works (in order to determine the influence of the processing variables in MAGCLA™ performance), and that the blank simulation represents a good comparison case. In this part of the work we report the results obtained for the blank simulation, which will be the basis of comparison in future parts of this work, when we will analyze the influence of the main processing variables on the performance of the new magnetic separator and classifier—MAGCLA™. The values of the parameters and processing variables for the blank simulation appear to have been well chosen, as the trajectories obtained are clearly within what was expected, and there seems to be enough margin to vary the processing variables widely enough to determine their influence. The values obtained for the exit times of the non-magnetic particles and for the times of collection, in the central collector, of the magnetic particles are low, and their velocity is not too high, which is due to a speed of rotation moderately high and to a high electrical current density (which creates a magnetic force density profile quite high). These results are beneficial when separation–classification of the particles is desired. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia is acknowledged for its Post-Doc grant SFRH/BPD/6964/2001 (P.A.
