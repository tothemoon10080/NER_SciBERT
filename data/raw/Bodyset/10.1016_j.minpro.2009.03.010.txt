Some principal and typographical errors are found in the paper “Concha F., 2008. Settling velocities of particulate systems 15: Velocities in turbulent Newtonian flows. Int. J. Miner. Process. 88 (2008) 89–93”, and corrections and related comments now are to be submitted. Note that,  Φ(Re) can be neglected as Note that Rao and Kumar used Darcy-Weisbach coefficient of hydraulics resistance λ, and connection with Fanning coefficient is λ Further, Concha gives term (5.8506/Re Further To avoid any misunderstandings log(=)log
