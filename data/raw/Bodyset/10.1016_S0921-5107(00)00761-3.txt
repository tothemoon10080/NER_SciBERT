We reveal the existence of interfacial, epitaxial, Pd grains in an as-deposited Pd film evaporated on GaN (0001) at room temperature. The origin of the Pd epitaxy was attributed to 6/7 matched interface structure. The Pd film was completely transformed to Ga2Pd5 and Ga5Pd gallides in epitaxial relationships with GaN at an annealing temperature of 700째C.Gallium nitride (GaN) is a direct wide-band-gap semiconductor and has attracted considerable interests in high-temperature and high-power applications Despite the increasing importance of Pd/GaN system, the detailed microstructure of the Pd layer and its high-temperature behavior are not well known. Although Pd (111) films have been shown to grow epitaxially on GaN (0001) The Mg-doped  As the Pd film was annealed to 700째C, the Pd (111) reflection completely disappeared and two new Bragg reflections at  As illustrated in the inset (upper right) of The degree of layer alignment in the surface normal (in-plane) direction can be indicated by the FWHM values of the rocking curves (phi scans) near the Pd (111) [the Pd In conclusion, we have investigated the details of the structural evolution of the Pd films on GaN (000l) during the annealing process. We revealed the existence of interfacial, epitaxial, Pd grains in the as-deposited Pd films that were evaporated on GaN (000l) at room temperature. The crystallization of the remnant, disordered Pd was mostly caused by the growth of the interfacial grains during annealing up to 600째C. The epitaxial Pd films were better aligned in the surface normal direction than in the in-plane direction. The origin of the Pd epitaxy on GaN (0001) was attributed to 6/7 matched interface structure, wherein six-Ga atomic distances match seven-Pd atomic distances. However, at an annealing temperature of 700째C, Pd was completely transformed to two kinds of epitaxial Pd gallides, Ga
