Fractures of the talus are uncommon. Fracture of the lateral process of the talus may result from snow boarding and skateboarding. An indirect mechanism through inversion and dorsiflexion is the most common. CT-scan confirms the lesion and reveals an articular incongruence which determines the need for open reduction and internal fixation. A 24-year-old female was admitted to the emergency department following a snowboarding accident with eversion and dorsiflexion of the foot. Examination showed swelling of the area under the lateral malleolar with bruising. Movement of the ankle was painful and inversion and eversion movements were limited by pain. Palpation of the subtalar joint reproduced her pain. Radiography of the ankle ( Fractures of the lateral process of the talus are unusual; its incidence has increased with the sport of snowboarding The displacement and comminution determine the indication for surgery The submalleolar approach allows anatomical reduction of the fragment and restoration of articular congruence by fixation with a screw
