Separation can be classified into the separation of homogeneous mixtures and the separation of heterogeneous systems. Mass transfer separation of homogeneous mixtures in liquid phases is a typical unit operation in chemical engineering, whereas the separation processes of heterogeneous systems involving solid particles suspended in the liquid phases are more commonly encountered everywhere in the industrial practice as well as in nature. Separation methods can also be categorized according to the separation work principles. Heterogeneous particles, which are suspended in a liquid phase, may be separated into individual groups of the constituent homogeneous particles in terms of the differences in the physical or physico-chemical properties of the particles, such as particle size, density, magnetic or electrical properties, surface wettability, or even the solubility of particles. Magnetic separation is a separation method based on the difference in the specific magnetic susceptibility of particles.
