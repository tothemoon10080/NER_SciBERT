Time-dependent deformation (creep) behaviors of piezoelectric microactuators have been investigated. Position (or gap height) drift of microbridged actuator beam and its displacement amplitude change with time could be attributed to the anelastic behavior of the driving unit itself based on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in the actuator, and as well as to the mechanical stress states established in the microactuator beam after the surface release of the micromachined actuator structure. From creep analyses of a simple microcantilever and microbridge beam structures, it was turned out that the overall creep behavior in microbridged piezoactuator structure was mainly dependent on the actuator beam initial deflection configuration governed both by residual stress of the actuating part Pt/PZT/Pt stack and the stress gradient through the silicon nitride (SiNx) microbridge beam.MEMS devices have found a wide range of applications in the field of spatial light modulators like digital micro-mirror device (DMD) and grating light valve (GLV). Mostly their mechanical motions are generated by the electrostatic actuation requiring moderate high voltages. Among the various actuator principles, the piezoelectric mechanism is promising because of its low actuation voltage, large force generation, and an operation frequency of several hundreds of kilohertz. Spatial optical modulator (SOM) device, which is composed of a one-dimensional linear array of unimorph PZT piezoelectric actuators attached on both ends of silicon nitride support beam ( Among the common mechanical failure modes such as fracture, creep, fatigue, stiction, friction and wear, the most inevitable reliability problem in piezoelectric microactuators is the time-dependent deformation behavior, so-called, the creep which is affected by piezoelectric material, fabrication process, micromechanical design and actuation duty ratio. In this paper, to separate the effects of the extrinsic PZT deformation drift and the induced stresses by micromechanical bridged structures on the creep evolution, simple free-standing microcantilevers, in which the residual stresses are easily relievable, were characterized using undoped and La Sol–gel technique was adopted to prepare undoped and La Target stoichiometries of the precursor solutions were based on Pb Both undoped and La The thicknesses and phase structure of the thin PZT films were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Standard surface micromachining processes Electrical properties of PZT thin films were evaluated using a circular capacitor structure, Pt/PZT/Pt, in which the top Pt electrodes of diameter 200 All measurements were done at room temperature and each sample or device, before each experiment monitoring, was poled for 15  Generally, as is reported in the literature  As disseminated in the literature The charge hopping conduction could be considered as a potential model in controlling dielectric relaxation current, in ferroelectric materials, for a time lasting over several decades if a combination of dipole orientations and charge hopping are considered as discussed by Schumacher and Waser According to this mechanism involving charged defect center-domain wall interaction in the control of ferroelectric domain reorientation, the different slopes determined from charging current–time evolution for undoped PZT and PLZT Under the sub-switching field (Eac The weaker dependence of Rayleigh coefficient  Accordingly, the relaxation, that corresponds to the free deflection of the microcantilever tip recorded with time immediately after turning off the applied ac voltage at the end of creep measurement, showed ( Drift of gap height with time can be fitted very well by five-parameter model containing two Voigt units   The actual micromechanical state established in the system, after micromachining and surface release around the microbridge beam, has a direct effect on the initial gap height GH On the other hand, it is demonstrated experimentally by varying the tensile stresses in the Pt/PZT/Pt (PPP) layers, on different starting prepared wafers before patterning and surface release, by annealing the deposited PPP layers at different anneal temperatures and then deducting the average stress state after each thermal treatment from the wafer curvatures by using Stoney equation Moreover, it is found that there is an inverse relationship between the creep rate Regarding the microbridge beam displacement amplitude which showed a continuous decrease with time, except at the early operating stage ( As has been generally experimented in different works in the literature, the variation of the initial residual stress in PZT thin film has a direct effect on change of PZT piezoelectric properties and electromechanical response due to the consequent reorientation of perovskite ferroelectric domains Finally, the overall creep reliability of microbridged piezoactuator was demonstrated to be controlled both by PZT properties and an additional micromechanical structure effect that is less active in the microcantilever creep (simple free end standing structure) than that one in the microbridge (complex embedded beam end structure). In this later, the creep was substantially attenuated when the microbridged actuator was less buckled. The creep behavior of PZT microactuators has been investigated. Microcantilever and microbridged actuators are fabricated using undoped PZT and PLZT
