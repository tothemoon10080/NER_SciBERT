Terpolymers prepared by condensation of 4-hydroxyacetophenone and biuret with formaldehyde in presence of acid catalyst (2M HCl) proved to be selective chelating ion exchange resins for certain metal ions. Chelation ion exchange properties of these terpolymers were studied for Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions. A batch equilibrium method was employed in the study of the selectivity of metal ion uptake involving the measurements of distribution of a given metal ion between the polymer sample and a solution containing the metal ion. The study was carried out over a wide pH range and in media of various ionic strengths. The terpolymers showed a higher selectivity for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ ions than for Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions.
