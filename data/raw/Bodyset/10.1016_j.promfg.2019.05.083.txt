Feminine hygiene products are becoming increasingly expensive due to a shifting focus, by manufacturers, from cost effective products to more convenient and aesthetically pleasing products. To shift the focus back to producing cost effective products, various materials and configuration options were explored to produce a disposable sanitary pad prototype. A three-layer (permeable top sheet, absorbent core and impermeable back sheet) and four-layer model (permeable top sheet, transfer layer, absorbent core and impermeable back sheet) were explored for the prototype. Prototypes A and B had four and three layers respectively with a cotton inner core, while prototype C had three layers and a recycled paper inner core. Upon applying a scoring system that ranks the padsâ€™ performance from best to worst in terms of absorbency per amount of money it costs, it was found that the three-layer model performed best. Using the scoring system, it was found that the best performing prototype was C, with a score of 2.33/ZAR whereas Prototypes A and C had scores of 0.36/ZAR and 2.09/ZAR respectively. Prototype C did not, however, maintain integrity when wet and presented problems in terms of comfort, deeming Prototype B as the best option for a cheap biodegradable sanitary pad. All the prototypes had a similar quality to their commercial counterparts but were slightly more expensive due to the high cost of producing bioplastic. This shows that it is possible to produce a pad that matches present day standards and expectations, but there will often be a trade-off between environmentally friendly products and the cost thereof.
