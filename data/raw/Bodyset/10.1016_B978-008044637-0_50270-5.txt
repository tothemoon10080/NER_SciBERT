The chapter explores tests to examine the effects of axial compression on the rotation capacity of square hollow sections (SHS). It is generally acknowledged that the rotation capacity of beams limited by web local hollow sections is reduced with increasing compression due to the change in stress distribution. However, the stress distribution in a compact flange is same for both bending alone and combined bending and compression. Hence it is usually assumed that the rotation capacity will be the same. However the strains under combined bending and compression are greater than for bending alone. Some unusual results are obtained where the rotation capacity under almost zero axial force is lower than that for higher values of compression.
