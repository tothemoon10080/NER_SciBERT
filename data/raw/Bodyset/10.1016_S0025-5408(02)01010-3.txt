                     CoO2 was synthesized by preliminary mechanochemical activation of precursor oxide mixture powders, followed by thermal treatment at 800°C for 5h. The effects of the molar ratio of Li/Co on the electrochemical behavior were examined. The Li

                     CoO2 at Li/Co=1.07 showed superior cycling stability to the Li/Co=1.0 sample. This is attributed to the disappearance of a phase transition related to monoclinic distortion and the relatively lowered transport resistance in Li/Co=1.07 sample.LiCoO In order to improve the structural stability of LiCoO The electrochemical performance of the oxide materials like LiCoO In this study, we investigated the electrochemical properties of Li Li Phase analysis and change of lattice parameters have been performed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to obtain the morphology of the particles. Electrochemical studies were carried out using a coin cell (2016 type). The cell comprised a lithium metal electrode and Li The structural evolution after mechanical activation and thermal treatment was followed by XRD. In  To examine the effect of the phase transition on the cycling stability, the charge and discharge was carried out in the range of 4.05–2.5 Li This work was supported by the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology through the research program for “National Research Laboratory”.
