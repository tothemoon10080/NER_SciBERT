Pb–Ag–PbO2 composite anodes with different mass fractions (1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%) of β-PbO2 were prepared by powder-pressed (PP) method. The galvanostatic polarization curves, Tafel curves and anodic polarization curves were tested in sulfuric acid solution. The morphologies and phase compositions of the anodic layers formed after galvanostatic polarization were investigated by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD), respectively. The results showed that β-PbO2 can improve the electrocatalytic activity of anodic oxide. The anode containing 3% β-PbO2 had the lowest overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the best corrosion resistance. The morphologies of the anode surfaces were gradually transformed from regular crystals to amorphous ones as the content of β-PbO2 increased in anodes.
