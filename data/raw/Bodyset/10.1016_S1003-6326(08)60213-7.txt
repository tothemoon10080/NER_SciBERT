The effects of the concentration of Lix 984N, phase ratio, initial pH value of aqueous phase and extraction time on the extraction of copper and iron under the condition of low Cu2+/Fe3+ ratio in dump bioleaching solution of Dexing Copper Mine were explored. The optimal conditions of extraction are as follows: the concentration of Lix 984N 10%; the phase ratio (O/A) 1:1; the initial pH value of aqueous phase 1.5 and the mixing time 2 min. The stripping experiments show that H2SO4 solution could efficiently recover copper from the organic phase under the optimal conditions.
