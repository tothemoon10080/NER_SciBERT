 To further investigate the implication of PiT1 in bone growth, we performed a histomorphometric and histological characterization of mice femurs from male and female mice, divided into 4 different age groups (15, 30, 90 and 300 Our preliminary results show that an Despite the fact that they only express 15% of PiT1, serum analyses of hypomorphic mice indicate that they exhibit a normophosphatemia, suggesting that PiT1 is not essential for a normal renal Pi reabsorption. However, young hypomorphic mice display a hyperphosphaturia which could be related to an impaired bone mineralization. This hypothesis will be paid attention in further experiments. The whole of these results suggest that a reduction of PiT1 expression
