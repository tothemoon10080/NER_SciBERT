Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are broadly distributed among living organisms and play crucial roles in natural product biosynthesis, degradation of xenobiotics, steroid biosynthesis, and drug metabolism. P450s are considered as the most versatile biocatalysts in nature because of the vast variety of substrate structures and the types of reactions they catalyze. In particular, P450s can catalyze regio- and stereoselective oxidations of nonactivated C–H bonds in complex organic molecules under mild conditions, making P450s useful biocatalysts in the production of commodity pharmaceuticals, fine or bulk chemicals, bioremediation agents, flavors, and fragrances. Major efforts have been made in engineering improved P450 systems that overcome the inherent limitations of the native enzymes. In this review, we focus on recent progress of different strategies, including protein engineering, redox-partner engineering, substrate engineering, electron source engineering, and P450-mediated metabolic engineering, in efforts to more efficiently produce pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. We also discuss future opportunities for engineering and applications of the P450 systems.Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) cytochrome P450 ferredoxin reductase ferredoxin adrenodoxin adrenodoxin reductase cytochrome P450 reductase I, and II, compound 0, I, and II error-prone polymerase chain reaction 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D Protein Data Bank substrate recognition site. Since the first discovery of P450 as a pigment (the P denoting “pigment”) in rat liver microsomes in 1958 ( Among diverse functionalities, the most important is that P450s are capable of catalyzing the regio- and stereoselective oxidation of inert C–H bonds in complex molecular scaffolds under mild conditions, making them superior to many chemical catalysts and of great interest for pharmaceutical, chemical, and biotechnological applications. However, the narrow substrate scope of some P450s, low catalytic efficiency, low stability, dependence on redox partners, high cost of cofactors, and electron uncoupling have limited the industrial applications of P450s ( Several excellent reviews have covered the diversity, functions, novel chemistry, and applications of P450s ( In general, a P450 catalytic system includes four components: the substrate, a P450 enzyme for substrate binding and oxidative catalysis, the redox partner(s) that functions as an electron transfer shuttle, and the cofactor (NAD(P)H), which provides the reducing equivalents. Most P450s share a common sophisticated catalytic cycle ( It is worth noting that some P450s are capable of directly utilizing H Maintenance of the P450 catalytic cycle relies on continuous electron transport to the heme-iron by redox partners, which are complicated electron-transfer systems. Based on the types of redox partners and the P450-redox partner interaction relationships, P450 systems can be divided into five main classes ( The incomparable diversity of P450s regarding substrates and reaction types provides nearly limitless application potential for production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals ( Genome mining and high-throughput screening of P450s have proven to be effective and successful strategies for seeking suitable and robust biocatalysts in industry. P450sca-2 (CYP105A3), screened from P450 protein engineering has been playing a vital role in developing biocatalysts for industrial applications, as exemplified by the heterologous production of artemisinic acid ( The P450 systems have also been engineered for the fragrance production. For instance, the oxidation of sesquiterpene (+)-valencene to high value-added flavor (+)-nootkatone with P450 enzymes was first accomplished in the Wong group by rationally designed mutants of P450 Although P450s have demonstrated amazing catalytic diversities and great prospects for application, the aforementioned limitations in industrial applications of P450s are also significant. To overcome these limitations, versatile engineering strategies have been proposed and developed to satisfy different application requirements, including protein engineering of P450s and redox partners, substrate engineering, cofactor regeneration, and P450-related metabolic engineering ( Protein engineering involves modification of the residues based on the folding principles and molecular structure of proteins, with the goal of obtaining the desired mutated proteins with enhanced properties to compensate for the poor stability, low selectivity, slow catalytic rates, and limited application space of the native proteins ( Directed evolution has been widely applied to engineer P450s, the structures of which are often unknown, for desired properties under artificial selective pressure, including random mutagenesis and screening ( Reetz and co-workers ( Directed evolution of P450s has also been applied in the generation of drug metabolites as an effective strategy for further pharmaceutical studies. Here, the strategy is to use the bacterial P450s to generate larger amounts of drug metabolites to facilitate structural analysis of the small quantities of drug metabolites, which is a regulatory requirement for further drug development. Arnold and associates ( The Guengerich laboratory screened a series of CYP1A2 mutants generated by random mutagenesis at six substrate recognition sites (SRSs), and the obtained variants had 2–4-fold increases in The protein stability of P450s, another important factor for practical applications to enhance the total turnover numbers, can also be improved via directed evolution, as exemplified by solvent tolerance optimization of the P450 Major disadvantages of directed evolution include the dependence on a high-throughput screening method, which is not always available, the requirement of automated instruments, and high cost. Rational or semi-rational design, based on the well-characterized protein tertiary structure and the mechanistic understanding of structure-activity relationships, is regarded as an effective alternate strategy. Generally (but not always), “hot spot” residues for rational and semi-rational design are usually located within the SRS, the substrate access channel, and the P450-redox partner interaction sites ( CYP105AS1 (from CYP105A1 ( The co-crystal structures of multifunctional P450 PikC (PDB entries The availability of a tertiary protein structure is considered to be a major limitation in rational and semi-rational design, in that experimental structural information is not often available for the >370,000 P450 sequences. Homology modeling has often been used to bridge the “structure knowledge gap,” based on the general observation that proteins with homologous sequences share similar structures ( Most P450s require redox partner proteins to sequentially transfer two electrons from NAD(P)H to the heme-iron reactive center to activate O A comprehensive screening of redox partners to identify the best electron transport pathway for supporting the CYP105D5 activity was done in the Guengerich laboratory ( Adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase (Adx/AdR) were characterized as optimal redox partners in supporting the To determine whether there are any principles for guiding the screening of optimal redox partners for a given Class I bacterial P450, Zhang Notably, the protein pair In addition to the screening and prediction of optimal redox partners, optimization of interaction modes between P450s and redox partners through redox partner engineering provides another effective strategy for P450 activity improvement. The residues located at the P450-Fdx (Fdx directly interacts with P450) interaction interface play important roles in affecting the catalytic activity of a P450. Screening of Adx derivatives modified at N-terminal or C-terminal polypeptide sequences led to the finding that Adx(4–108) truncated at N-terminal amino acids 1–3 and C-terminal amino acids 109–128 supported the 11β-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol by CYP11B1 with a higher electron transfer rate, and the specificity constant ( Inspired by the paradigm of self-sufficient P450 enzymes (Class III and IV) that contain both P450 and redox partner domains in one polypeptide chain, the construction of “unnatural” self-sufficient enzymes by making variant versions of P450-redox partner fusion proteins has been pursued ( Other chimeras have been made with diverse P450s from mammals, plants, and bacteria, including P450 A change of redox partners may not only influence catalytic efficiency and product distribution ( Limited substrate scope is a general problem with biocatalysts. The eukaryotic Class II P450s, with high substrate promiscuity, are generally not particularly suitable for synthetic and biotechnological applications due to their membrane-bound nature. To expand the substrate repertoire of prokaryotic soluble P450s, the strategy of “substrate engineering” has been practiced more often in recent years ( Typical substrate engineering is aimed toward modification of a nonnative substrate by covalently linking an anchoring/directing group to enable the productive binding of the engineered substrate. Some pioneering work on P450 substrate engineering involved PikC, based on extensive structural studies ( Recently, based on the understanding of the structural basis for substrate recognition in 4-cresol biodegradation by Distinct from typical substrate engineering using chemically or biologically modified substrates, Watanabe and his associates have systematically developed an atypical substrate engineering strategy, “decoy” substrate engineering, in which an inactive “dummy” substrate (decoy molecule) is used to trigger the P450-catalyzed reaction on the real nonnative substrate ( Recently, a class of dual-functional small molecules containing an anchoring group for binding to the P450 and a basic group for H As an alternative strategy to protein engineering, the observed exquisite specificity and selectivity introduced by substrate engineering of P450 enzymes has highlighted the profound influence of the substrate-anchoring groups on the functional plasticity of P450s ( Almost all natural P450s are cofactor-dependent enzymes, which are often expensive and must be recycled or circumvented from a process engineering perspective. To resolve this problem, several methods have been established on a laboratory scale over several decades, including cofactor regeneration systems, peroxide replacement, electrochemical approaches, and light-activated systems ( NAD(P)H regeneration is a popular method in cell-free biocatalysis and biotransformation, in which constant supply of reducing equivalents is achieved by introducing a second reaction system to reduce NAD(P) The “peroxide shunt pathway” ( Electrochemical reductions have been used to circumvent the requirement for redox partners in shuttling electrons from NADPH to P450, with the electrode being the source of reducing equivalents. Progress with electrode-adsorbed/immobilization of P450 enzymes on various electrodes has been accomplished by engineering of both electrodes and enzymes, including layer-by-layer films with polyions ( Systems have been developed by utilizing energy from light to drive the P450 catalytic cycle. Three main pathways have been designed based on the catalytic nature of P450 enzymes. The first takes advantage of the peroxide shunt pathway, with controlled generation of the reactive oxygen species Readers are referred to details in the individual research and reviewed publications regarding enzymatic regeneration systems ( Rapid development of synthetic biology has led to more and more P450-related metabolic engineering work that has integrated protein, substrate, and cofactor engineering of P450 systems. These efforts have enabled cost-effective bioproduction of many commercial compounds as “natural” products for variant purposes. As some of the most important enzymes in natural product biosynthesis, numerous natural and engineered P450s have already been included in the metabolic engineering toolbox. For example, the aforementioned CYP71AV1 has been used for bioproduction of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid ( P450 SalSyn from Szczebara Optimization of redox partners Distinct from the Cofactor regeneration and cofactor-free P450 systems have also found applications in whole-cell biocatalysts. Watanabe and associates developed Compared with some robust and widely applied commercial enzymes ( Exciting new biotechnology approaches have contributed to breakthroughs in P450 system engineering for practical catalysis in the past decade ( Versatile P450s are vital elements in the enzyme toolbox gifted from nature, and they will become much more powerful in the era of synthetic biology. In the future, we envision that functional mining of new P450s, construction of systematic libraries of P450s and redox partners, design of new electron-sourcing systems, the development of stable and highly efficient redox partner–independent P450 systems, and perhaps even the We thank Dr. Stella A.
