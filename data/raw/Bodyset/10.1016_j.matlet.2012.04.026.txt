The phase transformations occurring in mechanically milled and annealed triclinic Al3Ca8 intermetallic compound have been studied. The Al3Ca8 phase transforms initially to the nanostructured monoclinic Al14Ca13 intermetallic during milling. The Al14Ca13 phase is metastable and transforms back to the Al3Ca8 compound during subsequent heating. The transformation starts at low temperature with the grain coarsening of the Al14Ca13 phase. At intermediate temperatures, the transformation from Al14Ca13 to Al3Ca8 occurs. The sequence is completed at high temperatures with the grain coarsening of the Al3Ca8 phase.Recently, nanocrystalline intermetallics have attracted considerable attention because of their potential applications as lightweight structural materials In this work, the Al A pre-alloyed ingot with nominal composition Ca The XRD patterns of the initial pre-alloyed Ca  In order to understand the implications of the exothermic signals in The pattern of the as-milled powder (RT) reveals the formation of the nanoscale Al The Al During heating, the metastable Al The synthesis of the monoclinic Al The support of ESRF through the experiment HD 482 is acknowledged.
