This article describes a technique, developed at the UNESCO Centre for Membrane Science & Technology, for continuous, in situ direct observation through the membrane of the particle deposition. Using this technique it is possible to gain a better understanding of the fundamental phenomena of particle deposition, adhesion and possible re-dispersion on microfiltration membranes as a function of flux, tangential shear (or cross-flow), particle size and the nature of the feed.
