The adsorption of O2 on a sphalerite surface with vacancies and impurities is investigated through first-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). The calculated results show that O2 adsorption is unavailable on perfect sphalerite surfaces, while the presence of vacancies (e.g., Zn-vacancy and S-vacancy) and impurity atoms (such as Fe, Mn, Cu and Cd) energetically favors the adsorption of O2.
                  The results show that the adsorption energy of O2 on a S-vacancy surface is −408.25kJ/mol, which is stronger than that of a Zn-vacancy surface at −218.55kJ/mol. For a Zn-vacancy surface, the O 2p orbital interacts strongly with the S 3p orbital, and electrons transfer from the S atom to the O atom, which results in the oxidation of S. For the S-vacancy, the O 2p orbital interacts strongly with the Zn 3d orbital, and electrons transfer from the Zn atom to the O atom, which results in the oxidation of Zn.
                  The adsorption energies of O2 on the sphalerite surface with Fe, Mn, Cu and Cd impurities are −181.40kJ/mol, −146.66kJ/mol, −95.53kJ/mol and −55.96kJ/mol, respectively, which indicates that Fe-bearing sphalerite is easily oxidized, while Cd-bearing sphalerite is not easily oxidized. The oxygen molecule dissociates on Fe-, Mn- and Cd-bearing sphalerite surfaces, while oxygen does not dissociate on the Cu-bearing surface. The 3p orbital of S and the 3d orbital of Fe, Mn and Cu atoms donate electrons to the antibonding orbital

                      of the O atom, which enhances the bonding of oxygen with the sphalerite surface. However, the 4d orbital of the Cd atom donates fewer electrons, which weakens the bonding of oxygen with the surface.Flotation is the most important mineral processing technique; it is used to separate a target mineral from complex ores Sphalerite of different deposits and even of different deposit sites may differ in composition and flotation behavior essentially due to distinctions related to defects and impurities in the crystal lattice. It has been increasing acknowledged that the oxidation of sulfide minerals themselves is fundamentally significant during flotation Perfect zinc sulfide is a semiconductor with a wide band-gap and low conductivity; the adsorption of oxygen on a perfect sphalerite may not occur Natural sphalerite from the deposit is commonly non-stoichiometric, and vacancy defects and impurities, such as when Fe, Cd, Mn or Cu atoms are substituted for Zn atoms, are widely found in the lattice of sphalerite To ascertain the influence of vacancy defects and impurities on O The calculations were performed using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) developed by Payne et al.
