                     /238U ratio of fine particles can record the time since their separation from bed rock because of the disruption of uranium series equilibrium introduced by the recoil of daughter 234Th nuclei (precursor of 234U) out of particle surfaces during the decay of 238U. Application of the uranium comminution age method, which has great potential in tracing production and transportation of sediments is however complicated by the weathering dissolution of

                     . Here we minimize these complications by using a newly developed precise size separation using electroformed sieve, and a chemical protocol that involves reductive and oxidative leaching. Eolian deposits collected from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) were used to test the validity of our method. Possible effects of weathering dissolution were also evaluated by comparing samples with different weathering intensities. The results show decreasing 234U/238U ratios in fine eolian particles with increasing sedimentation age, agreeing well with the theoretical prediction of the comminution age model. This successful application of the uranium comminution age approach to the eolian deposits on the CLP is also aided by a stable dust source, the low weathering intensity, the lack of consolidation, and the well-defined age model of the deposits.

The eolian sequences on the CLP have a reliable age model that has been constrained by paleo-magnetic reversals and orbital tuning (e.g., Samples of eolian deposits covering the past ∼3 Ma were collected from the Xifeng ( Both glacial samples (loess layers) with low magnetic susceptibility and interglacial samples (paleosol layers) with high magnetic susceptibility were collected in the two sections (Supplementary Fig. 1). The resolution of the samples (Table S1) is designed to decrease with increasing age considering the decreasing rate of change in ( Three old loess samples were collected from the Qin'an section ( Grains of different sizes were separated by sieving the dispersed samples after removal of carbonate minerals. Electroformed sieves were used instead of traditional nylon net sieves because the shape of the nylon net is readily deformed during sieving. More importantly, the accuracy of electroformed sieves can be as good as A set of experiments has been conducted to establish the chemical procedure to clean the authigenic phases. The optimized procedure involves three steps. The first step is to remove carbonate minerals using diluted acetic acid (0.5 mol/L) at room temperature for 2 h ( The second step is to remove Fe–Mn oxides through reductive leaching using the CBD method slightly modified from The final step is to remove organic matter by bathing the sample in 5% hydrogen peroxide at 85 °C for 1 h. After removal of organic matter the samples show lower ( One loess sample (>1 Ma) is repeatedly processed in every batch to check the uncertainty of the whole procedure, which results in a ( BET surface area was measured for both the sieved and cleaned samples (with all authigenic phases removed) and the sieved but uncleaned samples (with carbonate minerals removed but not the Fe–Mn oxides and organic matter). Nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 77 K was applied to the samples, with surface area evaluated by the single point BET method.
