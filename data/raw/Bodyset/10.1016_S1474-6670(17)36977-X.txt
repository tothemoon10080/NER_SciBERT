Improvements brought about by new control strategies are commonly evaluated by comparing plant data before and after implementation of a new strategy. This can be a very inaccurate method to evaluate controller performance as the two sets of input data often differ significantly, causing biased results. A method is suggested to ensure accurate evaluation of control strategies under noisy operating conditions.
