Diminished bone health and increased risk of fracture is increasingly recognised as a complication of diabetes mellitus and even as a consequence of its management. We read with interest the recently published review by Starup-Linde and Vestergaard In mineralizing tissues, the group of BALP isoforms and other phosphatases function in the early stages of mineralization An under-mineralized matrix could well lead to attenuation of the feedback signal that “turns off” BALP expression; hence bone cells would express more BALP to achieve greater local mineralization. This process is nicely illustrated in cases of childhood rickets and osteomalacia where a poorly mineralized bone is associated with markedly elevated circulating BALP levels that decrease during bone healing As suggested in the review by Starup-Linde and Vestergaard The authors have no conflict to disclose.
