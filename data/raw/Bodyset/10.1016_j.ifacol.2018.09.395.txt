The energy consumption for zinc hydrometallurgy is high in the process of electrowinning. The operating parameters, which include the current density, the zinc iron concentration and sulphuric acid concentration, influence the energy consumption and the cost of electrical power. In order to reduce the cost of electrical power in zinc electrowinning process, an optimization method based on finite element model and kriging model is proposed in this paper. The finite element model calculates the current efficiency and cell voltage. The kringing surrogate model is used to approximately construct the relationship among the current density efficiency, cell voltage and the operating parameters which include the current density, the concentration of zinc and sulphuric acid, replacing the time-consuming finite element analysis in optimization. Besides, the genetic algorithm is used to find the global optimal solution effectively. The simulation results have shown the reliability of the proposed method.
