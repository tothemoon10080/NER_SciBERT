We read with interest the article “Open reduction and internal fixation of capitellar fracture through anterolateral approach with headless double-threaded compression screws: a series of 16 patients,” The authors have used the approach to fix 10 type 1, 5 type 2 and 1 type 4 fractures. For type 2 fractures, what was the fixation method chosen (other than headless compression screw), if any excision of capitular fragment was done? Because the trochlear component is the guide to reduction in type 4 fractures and the retraction of soft tissue and implant placement is more medial, Capitellar fractures are often associated with lateral epicondyle/lateral condyle or lateral collateral ligament injuries. The extensor lag reported in the extensile lateral approach ranges from 14.5° to 17.5° in various series. The capitellar fracture is usually devoid of soft tissue attachments, and in many series, débridement of the fractured part on table is described with excellent results in follow-up.
