Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell has immerged popular candidate as a cost-effective alternative for conventional silicon-based solar cells owing to its excellent optoelectronic properties and better thermo-chemical stability. Non-vacuum process for the preparation of CIGS absorber is always preferred for its economical benefits over the vacuum based process. In this regard, we present solution processed development of CIGS absorber layer involving pristine thin film by spray casting of nanoparticulate ink followed by photonic flash light sintering post-treatment. Influence of flash light post-treatment on structural, morphological, optical and photovoltaic properties of CIGS thin film absorber layer is presented. A simple sonochemical route was used to prepare CIGS NPs discussed in detail elsewhere [ Flash Light (FL) post-treatment was conducted on CIGS NPs precursor sprayed on Mo/SLG by variable FL conditions such as power, pulse width to achieve uniform treatment over the entire coating. Pulse widths of 30 ms were expected to be suitable for 2 μm thickness of precursor films based on thermal diffusivity of CIGS. The XRD patterns of the as precursor CIGS thin films obtained before and after FL treatment are shown in Raman analysis was carried out to investigate the presence of binary phases if any in CIGS absorber layer in case of flash light post-treated samples as seen from Surface morphology images of as sprayed CIGS NPs precursors and FL post-treated CIGS thin films are shown in The Band-gap of as-sprayed pristine CIGS thin films measured was 1.4 eV ( To understand the influence of FL post-treatment on CIGS thin-film absorber layer, device fabrication was carried out using configuration Al:ZnO/i:ZnO/CdS/CIGS/Mo/SLG stack. Dark and photo curve data for both samples are shown in Photo-active CIGS thin-film absorber layer was realized by simple, scalable, safe flash light post-treatment of CIGS nanoparticles laid on Mo-coated SLG substrate by spray casting. Flash light induced improvement in crystallinity and morphology of pristine CIGS thin films is realized through improvement in structural, morphological and optical properties leading to CIGS thin film absorber based solar cell device with photoconversion efficiency 0.20%.
