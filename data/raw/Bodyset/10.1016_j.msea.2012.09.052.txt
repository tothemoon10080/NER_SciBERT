A systematic study has been made of the effect of grain size on the tensile and creep properties of Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn–xZr (in wt%) alloys (ML10 or ZM6) at 250°C, the maximum long-service temperature for these alloys. Grain sizes ranging from 102 to 920μm were produced in the T6 state after grain refinement with Zr. The sand cast Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn alloy solidified as largely columnar grains (900±430μm). An addition of 1.8% Zr reduced the grain size to 84μm but most grains were still irregular rather than equiaxed. The grain size increased linearly with 1/Q (Q: growth restriction factor) calculated from the soluble Zr content only. Significant grain hexagonalization occurred during solid solution treatment at 530°C (720min). Both the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength at 250°C followed the Hall–Petch relationship while the ductility increased linearly with decreasing grain size. The steady-state creep rate at 250°C increased significantly with decreasing grain size but followed the general power law at each stress level evaluated (50–90MPa). The effect of grain size on creep is related to the applied stress where the grain size effect exponent p showed a linear dependency on applied stress. To satisfy the requirements for both the tensile and creep properties at 250°C, the T6 grain size of these alloys should be limited to about 174μm. However, when the T6 grain size is <100μm, it may result in a significant increase in the steady-state creep rate.MgNdZnZr based alloys in the composition ranges of (2.0–2.8)% Nd, (0.2–0.7)% Zn and (0.4–1.0)% Zr (in wt%) are commercially important creep resistant Mg alloys The main role of each alloying element in the ML10 or ZM6 alloys can be summarized below. Nd is the prime strengthening element which forms fine Mg The room temperature and elevated temperature (up to 300 The purposes of this study are threefold: to assess the effect of grain size on the tensile and creep properties of Mg–2.65Nd–0.30Zn– Melting and alloying were conducted in a mild steel crucible placed in an electric resistance furnace. A melt with a nominal composition of Mg–2.65Nd–0.30Zn was prepared from pure Mg (99.8%), Zn (99.9%), and a Mg-30% Nd master alloy at 720 The final alloy composition obtained was Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn– Following commercial practice Tensile and creep testing was focused on 250 Although grain refinement of ML10 or ZM6 alloys with Zr is established commercial practice, little information is available about their grain-refining characteristics as a function of the soluble Zr content. The Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn alloy without Zr solidified as largely columnar grains in the size range of 900±430 Zr not only reduces the grain size but also the range of variations, for example, from 900±430 Despite the refinement from 900 The intermetallic phase observed in the as-cast microstructure was confirmed to be Mg     The creep tests were focused on three grain sizes, 102  A uniform equiaxed grain structure is important because it offers reliability and consistency in performance.

The creep behavior of a metallic material can be described in general by the power law The creep data of ML10 or ZM6 at 250 The stress exponent The effect of the grain size on creep is associated with the applied stress.  Sand cast Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn alloy without grain refinement by Zr solidifies as largely columnar grains in the size range of 900±430 Substantial grain hexagonalization occurs during the solid solution treatment of the alloy at 530 The ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and ductility at 250 The creep resistance of the Mg–2.6Nd–0.35Zn– To satisfy the design criteria for the tensile properties of these alloys for long-term service at 250 °C the maximum grain size in the T6 state should be limited to about 174 μm.
