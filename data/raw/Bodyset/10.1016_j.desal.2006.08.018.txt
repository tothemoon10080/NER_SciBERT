The transport of iodine through a bulk liquid membrane containing kerosene as solvent and alkaline sodium sulfite solution as receiving phase in a bench scale system was studied. It was found that the pH of feed solution has a major effect on the extraction rate. On the other hand, the concentration of the receiving phase has an important role on the stripping efficiency. Using proper conditions for extraction and stripping, the system is able to extract 82.5% of iodine present in the feed solution within 8.5 hours and 98.83% within 28.5 hours. At the same time, the stripping efficiencies are 71.8% and 85.12% at 8.5 and 28.5 hours, respectively.
