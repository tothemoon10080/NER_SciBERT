Directional solidification of eutectic alloys attracts considerable attention because of microhardness, tensile strength, and electrical resistivity influenced by eutectic structures. In this research, we examined processing of Al–Ni–Fe (Al–6.5wt.%Ni–1.5wt.%Fe) eutectic by directional solidification. The alloy was prepared by vacuum furnace and directionally solidified in Bridgman-type equipment. During the directional solidification process, the growth rates utilized varied from 8.25 μm/s to 164.80 μm/s. The Al–Ni–Fe system showed a eutectic transformation, which resulted in the matrix Al, rod Al3Ni, and plates Al9NiFe phases. The eutectic spacing between

                     was measured. Additionally, the microhardness, tensile strength, and electrical resistivity of the alloy were determined using directionally solidified samples. The effects of growth rates on microhardness, tensile strength, and electrical resistivity for directionally solidified Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy were investigated, and the relationships between them were experimentally obtained. It was found that the microhardness, tensile strength, and electrical resistivity were affected by both eutectic spacing and the solidification parameter.Aluminum and aluminum alloys are used in industry because of their resistance characteristics, corrosion resistance, low specific weight, conductance of electricity, and heat and flexibility. These properties make them valuable for use in various industrial applications, and researchers have been actively exploring new application for these alloys The most prominent feature of aluminum in engineering applications and everyday life is its lightness. In addition, alloying elements in aluminum improve its strength and stiffness, properties which are superior compared to other metals. The alloying of iron into aluminum is especially effective at improving its strength and stiffness properties. Another important element in aluminum alloys is nickel. Alloying nickel in aluminum improves its high temperature mechanical strength and increases its modulus of elasticity. For these reasons, research studies on Al–Ni, Al–Fe, and Al–Ni–Fe alloys are of great interest In the literature, there are many studies on eutectic composition The mechanical and thermo physical properties of a material depend on not only the selection of alloying elements but also the production technique employed. The directional solidification technique by Bridgman-type equipment is one of the most important techniques for producing crystal growth that is widely utilized in engineering. Aluminum and aluminum alloys, more so than other alloys, are prone to having possible casting errors, such as cracks and distortions, due to volume shrinkage depressions. These errors can be minimized by using Bridgman's technique as known The Controlled Solidification Technique. When eutectic alloys are directionally solidified in Bridgman-type equipment, the solidification results in two or more phases aligned in growth direction. This microstructure morphology of eutectic alloys affects their mechanical and thermo physical properties. In this study, the dependence of the eutectic spacing In the present work, the composition of the Al–Ni–Fe ternary alloy was chosen as Al–6.5wt.%Ni–1.5wt.%Fe to grow eutectic phases from ternary liquid. After sufficient homogenization, the melted Al–Ni–Fe alloy under the vacuum by using 99.99% pure aluminum, 99.95% pure nickel and 99.97% pure iron was poured into 10 graphite crucibles (200 mm in length 4 mm ID and 6.35 mm OD). Each sample was then positioned in a Bridgman type furnace. Solidification of the samples was carried out with different growth rates (V = 8.25–164.80 μm/s) at a constant temperature gradient (G = 4.48 K/mm) by synchronous motors running at different speeds. Details of the Bridgman–type directional solidification furnace and experimental procedures pertaining to it are given in References [ The quenched sample was removed from the graphite crucible and typically cut into lengths of 10 mm each. After smoothing each sample with SiC paper (180, 500, 1000, 2500 grit), we mounted them with epoxy–resin and polished them with diamond paste using a The microstructures of the samples were photographed in both transverse and longitudinal sections with a The temperature in the specimen was measured using three K–type 0.25 mm in diameter insulated thermocouples, which were positioned inside the sample with spacing of 10–20 mm. The cooling rates were recorded with a data–logger via computer during the solidification process. The temperature gradient (G = ΔT/ΔX) in the liquid phase and the value of the growth rate (V = ΔX/Δt) for each sample were determined using the measured values of ΔT, ΔX, and Δt. Details of the measurements of ΔT, ΔX, and Δt are given in References [ The values of eutectic spacing were measured with a linear intercept method using transverse sections of the samples One of the goals of this research was to learn the relationships between the solidification processing parameters and microhardness for directionally solidified Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy. Vickers microhardness measurements in this study were performed with a Uniaxial tensile tests were performed at room temperature at a strain rate of 10 Electrical measurements of the samples were taken using the four–point probe technique on samples with 4 mm diameter The Al–Ni–Fe alloy at eutectic composition indicates the existence of multiphase microstructure Al + Al Solid solubility of nickel in aluminum is very low and it is about 0.05% at the eutectic temperature (640 For eutectics with a small amount of ternary impurities, eutectic colonies form. The Al In this study, formations of the microstructures vary with the growth rates. As the growth rate is increased, the eutectic spacing decreases. The highest eutectic spacing was measured at the minimum growth rate and a constant temperature gradient (V = 8.25 μm/s, G = 4.48 K/mm), as shown in The variation of microstructure versus growth rate is essentially linear on the logarithmic scale. As shown in Values of the exponent relating to the growth rates obtained in this work 0.53 for Al Moreover, exponent values of 0.53 and 0.48 are consistent with the values of 0.53, 0.46 and 0.49 obtained by Engin et al. It can also be observed in Variations of microhardness in the Al–Ni–Fe alloy as a function of microstructure and growth rates are given using both linear regression analysis and Hall–Petch type correlations in  The exponent value 0.07 is in agreement with the exponent values of growth rate (0.07–0.11) obtained by various researchers Also the relationships between the microhardness and eutectic spacing and growth rate were obtained by using Hall–Petch type correlations analysis. From As can be seen from Equations In this paper, the obtained  Variations of tensile strength in Al–Ni–Fe alloy as a function microstructure and growth rate are given as both linear regression analysis and Hall–Petch type correlations and compared with the tensile strength of ternary Al–Si–Ni  Also the relationships between the tensile strength, eutectic spacing, and growth rate were obtained by using Hall–Petch type correlations analysis. As can be seen from As can be seen from Equations As can be seen in In the literature, there are numerous studies concerning on the dependence of temperature on electrical conductivity. However there is not sufficient study on the dependence of the electrical conductivity on growth rate and eutectic spacing. The dependence of the electrical resistivity on growth rate and eutectic spacing was determined by linear regression analysis and the relationship between them can be expressed as;  In present work obtained values of electrical resistivity for ternary Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy are higher than obtained of electrical resistivity for ternary Al–Ni This work focused on microstructures, microhardness, tensile strength, and electrical resistivity for unidirectionally solidified Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy. In order to detect the relationships between microstructures, microhardness, tensile strength, electrical resistivity, and growth rate, the Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy was solidified via Bridgman-type equipment. The Al–Ni–Fe eutectic alloy indicated nonvariant reactions. Even though the growth rate increased approximately twenty times, eutectic spacing between ( This project was supported by the Erciyes University Scientific Research Project Unit under Contract No: FBD–11–3667 and FBA-12-4016.
