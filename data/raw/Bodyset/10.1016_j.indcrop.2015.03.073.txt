In this study, ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment using choline acetate ([Cho][OAc]), which is a completely bioderived IL, for enhancing the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulose was investigated. To evaluate [Cho][OAc] IL pretreatment, its effects on sugarcane bagasse composition, its subsequent enzymatic saccharification, and the energy profit ratio (EPR) were compared with those of various pretreatments, such as comminution, microwave irradiation, and alkaline treatment. After 72h of enzymatic saccharification using bagasse pretreated with [Cho][OAc] at 110°C for 360min, 0.355g of glucose per 1g of raw bagasse was obtained (i.e., 98.7% of the cellulose content of the pretreated bagasse was converted into glucose), and maximum EPR was achieved in these pretreatment conditions.Lignocellulose is the most abundant organic material on earth, and it is expected as a feedstock in the production of useful materials, such as biofuels and bioplastics ( Studies of pretreatment using ionic liquids (IL) have continued to rise since midazolium ILs were discovered by In particular, imidazolium ILs have been widely studied, thereby demonstrating their powerful effects on enhanced enzymatic saccharification ( In the present study, the effects of IL pretreatment using [Cho][OAc] was compared with various methods, such as mechanical comminution, microwave irradiation, and alkaline treatment. To determine the most effective pretreatment method, component analysis of the pretreated lignocellulose, monitoring the subsequent enzymatic saccharification, and calculation of the energy profit ratio (EPR) with each different pretreatment were carried out. To calculate EPR, the theoretical ethanol yield was estimated based on the glucose yield obtained from enzymatic saccharification. Sugarcane bagasse was selected as the lignocellulosic material, which is an agricultural residue that is unutilized except for producing steam and electricity in sugarcane processing plants ( The sugarcane bagasse was kindly provided by Kyuyo Sugar Industry (Okinawa, Japan), and it was used as the lignocellulosic material. The raw bagasse was ground for 1 [Cho][OAc] with a melting point of 85°C was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Japan Co., LLC. (Osaka, Japan). 1.5 To calculate the energy requirement for pretreatment using [Cho][OAc], the specific heat capacity of [Cho][OAc] was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (DSC6220; Hitachi High-Tech Science Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The measurements were performed three times under identical conditions. The first measurement was performed with two empty crucibles, the second with the test sample ([Cho][OAc]) and the third with the reference substance (Al The measurements were performed using 3.5 A SAMPLE MILL (a rod mill with two pots (250 Microwave irradiation pretreatment was performed at 2.45 In this pretreatment, 1.5 The acid-soluble lignin (ASL), acid-insoluble lignin (AIL), cellulose, and hemicellulose contents of untreated and pretreated bagasse were determined as follows. First, 3 Untreated and pretreated bagasse were hydrolyzed enzymatically using Meicelase (derived from Assuming that all the glucose obtained by enzymatic saccharification was converted into ethanol, the energy production from 1 The energy requirements of various pretreatments were also calculated. For mechanical comminution, the energy required to treat 1 For the pretreatments using IL, microwave irradiation, and alkaline treatment, the energy required to treat 1 The energy required to heat 1 The EPR was calculated using these values as follows: To investigate the effects of the IL pretreatment with [Cho][OAc] and the other pretreatments, i.e., comminution, microwave irradiation, and alkaline treatment, on the composition of bagasse, the compositions of the untreated and pretreated bagasse were analyzed, and the results are shown in With the [Cho][OAc] pretreatment, the gravimetric recovery of bagasse decreased with the increasing severity of the treatment condition, i.e., the lowest recovery was 78.8% at 110 The reduction in AIL using the [Cho][OAc] pretreatment was lower than that with the alkaline treatment (8.4% at 0.5% of NaOH and 121 To optimize the amount of [Cho][OAc] for pretreatment, the pretreatment was performed using [Cho][OAc] (g)/bagasse (g) at ratios of 1–3 at the condition of 110°C for 180  Thus, it was demonstrated that [Cho][OAc] pretreatment and the other pretreatments enhanced the saccharification ratio significantly. However, pretreatment causes the loss of lignocellulose components, and the glucose yield after 72 A specific consideration of the EPR (  To evaluate the effectiveness of IL pretreatment using [Cho][OAc], the effects of pretreatment on the lignocellulose composition, subsequent enzymatic saccharification, and EPR using various pretreatments such as [Cho][OAc], comminution, microwave irradiation, and alkaline treatment were compared.
