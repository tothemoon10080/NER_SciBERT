The effect of various seawater electrolytes on the zeta potential and viscosity of silica suspensions has been studied as a function of electrolyte concentration, pH, flocculant and shear rate. Salts were alkali and alkaline-earth metal chlorides. The magnitude of the negative zeta potential of silica as a function of pH for monovalent cations follows Li+
                     >Na+
                     >K+
                     >Cs+ implying that adsorption follows Cs+
                     >K+
                     >Na+
                     >Li+. In the presence of divalent cations, the magnitude of the negative zeta potential as a function of pH decreases greatly following Mg2+
                     >Ca2+, implying that adsorption follows Ca2+
                     >Mg2+. Regarding the flocculant in solution, molecular simulations indicate that repulsion between anionic acrylate units causes the polymer to adopt expanded tertiary conformations, however with cations this repulsion is shielded causing the polymer to fold into balled-up conformations. The adsorption of cations on anionic flocculant chains follows inverse series than silica, i.e., Li+
                     >Na+
                     >K+
                     >Cs+ and Mg2+
                     <Ca2+. The different ability of silica and flocculant to adsorb cations leads to force fields that create three-dimensional networks of particles with resistance depending on the cation. The viscosity of silica suspensions formulated at 0.5M salt and pH 7 in anionic flocculant follows KI>KCl>NaCl>MgCl2
                     > water, and in cationic flocculant follows KI<KCl<NaCl<MgCl2
                     < water. In anionic flocculant, the counterion is the same for silica and flocculant leading to strong particle-flocculant interaction and suspensions with high viscosity. The resistance of the particle networks formed are weakened only slightly as the shear stress increases In cationic flocculant, the cation is the counterion of silica while the anion is the counterion of flocculant, their ionic atmospheres are different giving rise to weak particle-flocculant interaction and low viscosity suspensions. The resistance of such networks is increasingly weakened as the shear rate increases. The higher the pH, the higher the repulsion, and the lower the viscosities of the suspensions formulated with either flocculant.The use of seawater or partially desalinated seawater to process metal ores is becoming the only sustainable solution in regions with severe aridity The silica particles used in this study were ground quartz (Sigma Aldrich), about 99% pure, and particle size 0.5–10 The zeta potential measurements of silica suspensions in saline solutions were performed with a ZetaCompact Zeta9000 (CAD Instruments), a zetameter using the technique of micro-electrophoresis. The measurements were carried out according to the concentration and type of salt dissolved, at pH 7 and 9, with 0.05% by weight of silica. Salts used were MgCl Shear viscosity was measured with a Haake RV 20 viscometer with a cylindrical Searle type measuring device (Haake Co). The silica suspensions were formulated at 40% by weight with the addition of salt to a concentration of 0.5 The flocculant conformation was determined by light microscopy with a Motorized System Microscope BX61 (Olympus) in 50 Silica is a solid with uncharged silanol groups ( In the presence of alkaline-earth cations at low concentration (0.05 Another interesting result arises when comparing the changes in the zeta potential versus pH curve of silica suspensions measured in KCl and KI. The neutralizing cation is the same but the counter-ion atmosphere is different, either Cl Results in     In the presence of anionic flocculant the counterion is the same both for silica particles and for flocculant molecules and therefore their ionic atmospheres are similar giving rise to a very effective particle-cation-flocculant interaction that in turn gives rise to the formation of agglomerates resistant to deformation In the presence of cationic flocculant and electrolytes, the latter prevent the electrostatic interaction between anionic silica particles and cationic flocculant molecules, which in pure water is very strong. In such a case, the cation of the salt is the counterion of the silica particles while the anion of the salt is the counterion of the flocculant molecules and therefore the ionic atmospheres are different thus producing a relatively weak particle-flocculant interaction. It follows that a somewhat fragile particle network is formed since the viscosity in the presence of electrolytes is lower than in pure water. According to the results in In the presence of anionic flocculant the viscosity of the suspensions follows the order K In the presence of cationic flocculant and different chloride salts, there is a common factor, the Cl The detailed description above should not overlook the validity of the general rule of “like adsorbs like”, which once more is verified experimentally.  The different cation coverage of silica and flocculant in suspensions and the resulting incomplete surface charge screening produce force fields that push particles to form three dimensional networks with resistance depending on the type of cation and pH.
