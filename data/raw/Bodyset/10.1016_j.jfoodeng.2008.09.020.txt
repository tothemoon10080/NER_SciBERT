The adsorption of phosphorus (P) from rapeseed oil on acid-activated sepiolite (AAS) was investigated for different AAS dosages and bleaching temperatures. The P concentration in the oil was reduced from 29.7 to 1.11mg/kg at the optimal conditions: bleaching temperature −100°C, AAS dosage −1.5%. The adsorption capacity of AAS in relation to P and mean adsorption energy were calculated according to Langmuir and Freundlich models and the former was found to be better. The negative values of free energy of adsorption (

The division of phospholipids and phosphates between external surface and micropores of the sepiolite is suggested.equilibrium (residual) concentration of phosphorus in the oil (mg/kg) equilibrium concentration of phosphorus on the AAS (mg/g) initial concentration of phosphorus (mg/kg) monolayer capacity of adsorbent in relation to phosphorus (mg/g) Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant (kg/mg) mass of the oil (g) mass of the adsorbent (g) free energy of adsorption (kJ/mol) enthalpy of adsorption (kJ/mol) entropy adsorption (kJ/mol distribution constant of phosphorus between the oil and AAS gas constant (8.31 absolute temperature (K) The term bleaching was used originally for the reduction of the coloured pigments. However, nowadays it is related to the removal or conversion of the undesired by-products from fats and oils. There are seven major clay groups and at least 33 different specific clay minerals ( Apart from the colour, which is the important indicator of bleaching effectiveness, the changes in concentrations of the residual soaps, phosphorus, peroxide and anisidine are associated directly with the bleaching process. Sepiolite is the hydrated magnesium silicate [(Si The aim of the study is the description of phosphorus adsorption on AAS as a function of initial phosphorus concentration, bleaching temperature and sepiolite dosage. For the full evaluation of the adsorption mechanism, the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus are registered. The Sivrihisar Sepiolite was used in this study (Anadolu Industrial Minerals Co., Turkey) with 70% content of pure mineral. This clay, beige in colour, was crushed, ground to −75 The relevant data concerning the properties of original mineral and AAS are summarized in The pressed and filtered rapeseed oil (Bio-Ölwerk Magdeburg GmbH Magdeburg–Germany) was used in the experiments. To eliminate the influence of the different crude oil features on the bleaching process, experiments were carried out with the rapeseed oil, which was degummed with water and acid and dried at the end. The sample of 100 The phosphorus removal efficiency by AAS was evaluated based on standard bleaching test. 150 The phosphorus concentration in the oil before and after bleaching test was determined according to German Standard Method DFG C-VI 4(61) ( The acidity of AAS was based on the titration with 0.1 The BET surface area (m Zeta potential values of natural sepiolite and AAS in solid/water suspensions at different pH values (8.75 and 5.8) were measured using Zeta Meter 3.0, equipped with a microprocessor unit which allowed measurement of the average values and standard deviations. The results of phosphorus removal as a function of AAS dosage for the different temperatures are included in The Langmuir and Freundlich models were used for the evaluation of phosphorus adsorption on AAS: For the Freundlich model (Eq.  The values of essential characteristics of Langmuir isotherm can be expressed by dimensionless constant, known as equilibrium parameter ( The values of The thermodynamic parameters: The enthalpy and entropy changes can be found from: The values of It easy to notice from During the acid-activation of the sepiolite the dissolution of the magnesium octahedral sheet appears and as a result surface area and porosity of the adsorbent increase with simultaneous opening of the inaccessible sites and formation of longer channels within the clay structure ( The experimental data show, that the adsorption entropy changes It is rather improbable that such a spaciously extended in structure species like phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, the main constituents of phosphorus in rapeseed oil ( In turn the phosphate ions, the inorganic part of the total phosphorus, can be retained in the internal structure of the sepiolite, within the channels. The simplified way of the phosphorus adsorption, where the symbol P denotes the total phosphorus in the rapeseed oil, is shown in We cannot preclude that mono- or di-hydrogenphosphates can locate on silanols via hydrogen bonds formation ( It was established earlier, that chlorophyll-  The adsorption of phosphorus on the AAS is the effective way of its elimination from rapeseed oil. The result is important from practical viewpoint, because it is known that phosphorus affects the function of automobile catalytic converters ( There is positive influence of the temperature and adsorbent dosage on the phosphorus removal. The phosphorus adsorption on AAS is physical in nature, since the free energy and enthalpy changes of adsorption are low. The phosphorus in the form of phosholipids is probably located merely on the external surface of sepiolite, whereas phosphate ions interact with sepiolite silanols on the external surface and in the micropores of the structure.
