In the present work, incorporation of submicron barium sulphate (BaSO4) particles to a poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) matrix is explored as a strategy to improve the radiopacity and simultaneously enhance the toughness of the resulting composites. Accordingly, BaSO4 loaded PLLA composites were prepared via melt-blending and were fully characterized in terms of thermal transitions, mechanical properties, morphology and radiopacity. X-ray analysis confirmed the enhanced radiopacity of the BaSO4 filled composites with respect to their unfilled counterparts. Additionally, toughness of PLLA matrix was impressively improved when BaSO4 particles were added. As an illustration, incorporation of 10wt.% of BaSO4 particles resulted in a 1647 and 3338% increase in toughness and elongation of PLLA matrix, respectively.Polylactides (PLAs) have been widely employed in the biomedical field for several applications (e.g., sutures, tissue engineering scaffolds, drug delivery devices, implants, etc.) due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability Although alternative radiopacifiers have been proposed in bibliography The fracture properties of these materials play a key role in the long-term survival and, accordingly, in the success of the implant. In fact, the brittleness associated to poly( In the present work, a strategy to overcome the drawbacks associated to PLLA by the incorporation of BaSO Commercial PLLA (100,000 PLLA samples containing 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0 Thermal transitions of the samples were determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry on a DSC 2920 (TA instruments), whereas the amount of BaSO  Thermal transitions of unfilled and BaSO  However, the incorporation of BaSO PLLA/BaSO In In the present work, an impressive improvement in toughness was observed in PLLA/BaSO Incorporation of BaSO In the present paper it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of finely dispersed BaSO Authors are thankful for funds of
