A new improved method for the treatment of molybdenum sulfide concentrates by water vapor is developed, which ensures high level of the extraction of molybdenum (in the form of technical molybdenum trioxide) with 98.5% recovery together with rhenium (90%), selenium (90%), tellurium (90%), and sulfur (in the form of sodium sulfide or elemental sulfur) with 99.5% recovery. The developed technology provides a successful solution of problems associated with the comprehensive, environmentally safe and highly efficient processing of molybdenum and other metal concentrates. Particularly the desulphurization problem is solved. The design of the pilot plant, control of optimal operation regimes and processing parameters are presented in the paper.
