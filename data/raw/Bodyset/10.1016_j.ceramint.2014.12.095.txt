An experimental study was conducted on the preparation and characterization of nanocrystalline niobium boride and carbide composite (NbB2–NbC) in the Mg–B2O3–Nb–C system via mechanochemical method. The thermodynamic appraisal indicated that the reduction and synthesis reactions were highly exothermic and should be self-sustaining. According to the differential thermal analysis (DTA) results, a pre-milling treatment of powder mixture up to 2h not only reduced the reaction temperature, but also induced a different reaction path. In addition, the amount of Mg3(BO3)2, as a major by-product of the thermal synthesis, was significantly decreased by applying adequate mechanical activation. The phase analysis revealed that the NbB2 phase was achieved after 3h high energy ball milling in self-stunning mode; meanwhile, the formation of NbC was progressively completed after a longer period of milling up to 7h. According to the morphological evolutions, the range of particle size was within 100nm.NbC and NbB At present, many processes are available for the synthesis of NbC and NbB Due to the formation of various by-products and some general restrictions in conventional techniques such as high temperature operation, grain growth, non-uniform phase and so on, it is necessary to find an effective technique that could overcome these limitations. Mechanochemical activation as a type of in-situ method is a solid state powder process which involves inducing chemical reactions in a mixture of as-received powders at room temperature or at least much lower than synthesis temperature. An increase in the kinetics of reactions during high energy milling can be resulted from microstructural refinement, repeated cold deformation and fracture of particles In this work, the simultaneous mechanosynthesis of nanocrystalline NbC and NbB The precursor materials were magnesium (Merck, 99.7% purity, particles size 40±5 The precursor materials were milled in a planetary ball mill for various durations at room temperature. Details of the ball mill machine and the milling conditions are given in In this study, amounts of the remained B XRD analysis was carried out using Cu-Kα radiation to identify different phases of the starting powders and mechanically alloyed powders. The diffractometer (Philips X-ray diffractometer) was operated at 40 The crystallite size and the lattice strain of the samples are calculated by using the Williamson–Hall method The reaction process and features were also investigated by thermal analyses (DTA; model BÄHR 503). A small amount of the reactants weighing about 50±5 The morphology and the agglomerate size distribution of the milled powders were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi 4160, 15 Although the interpretation on thermodynamic behavior of in situ solid state reactions such as mechanical activation is not completely studied, using some usual thermodynamic relations could help to know the fundamental information about reactions and to estimate their behavior during the process. Niobium boride and carbide (NbB In the next stage, the heat generated from the reduction reaction provides energy for reacting the produced elemental boron with the niobium and forming NbB The value of Based on thermodynamic data ( In order to identify reactions׳ sequence in the Mg–B Although the information obtained from the DTA experiment is valuable in unraveling the reaction mechanism, it may not be fully reliable since the experimental conditions differ considerably in the DTA and mechanochemical processes, which could have significant influence on the reaction kinetics and mechanism The XRD trace of 2 TG curves of the unmilled sample and the powder milled for 2 It should be stated that the incomplete synthesis reaction and the formation of large value of magnesium borate are two parameters which restrict the use of thermal synthesis for the preparation of NbB  Unlike the thermal behavior of the Mg–B Since the phase constitution and transformation characteristics appear to be critically dependent on crystallite size and lattice strain, the measurement of these structural features in the mechanically alloyed powders is very important In this case, the system involved two ductile (Mg, Nb) and brittle powders (C and B  Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the mechanochemical method is a useful process to synthesize NbC–NbB High energy ball milling technique was successfully applied for the mechanosynthesis of NbB According to the thermal analysis of the unmilled sample, the magnesiothermic reduction was started after melting of Mg powder. During the thermal process, a large amount of Mg The phase detection illustrated that the NbB According to the morphology evolutions, the powder particles showed a homogeneous distribution and the average of particle size was below 100
