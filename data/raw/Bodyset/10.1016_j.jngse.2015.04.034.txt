Mineral matter is widely accepts as one of the important factors influencing the gas sorption capacity of coal. By analyzing ash content and Langmuir volume of coals, studies have reported positive, negative, and poor impacts of mineral matter on sorption capacity without convincing reasons explaining the contradictory results. This paper proposes a new analysis method to correlate minerals and gas sorption capacity by connecting the mineral matter compositions to sorption capacity through the variations in the microstructure. In addition to mineral content, mineral occurrence modes and compositions were also studied to investigate their relations with gas sorption capacity.
                  A total of 22 coal samples are used to interpret the characterization of minerals, including mineral content by proximate analysis, mineral occurrence mode by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) analyses, and mineral compositions by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and high pressure methane adsorption analyses of selected samples are applied to characterize microstructure and gas adsorption capacity.
                  We found that mineral content, occurrence mode, and composition are three controlling factors that together determined the influence of mineral matter on gas sorption capacity. In fact, some factors have potential for both positive and negative influence. This is why both negative and positive influences have been previously observed. The direction and magnitude of influence depends on the relative weights of the driving factors. For samples in this study, clay mineral content showed the strongest positive relation to S

                      is weak. The final result indicated that mineral matter had a positive influence on gas sorption capacity.Coalbed Methane (CBM) is labeled as an unconventional natural gas due to its unique storage and flow mechanisms. Gas stored in coal seams occurs dominantly in an adsorbed state on the internal pore surfaces of coal, which can as account for as much as 95% of total gas content ( Various studies have reported that the gas sorption capacity of coal is affected by mineral matter. By comparing ash content to Langmuir Volume, a negative correlation was commonly observed and accepted ( Studies on mineral occurrence in coal have mainly utilized qualitative analysis, and the studies have been focused on the pore and cleat-fill mineralogy as well as discussing their influence on CBM generation and production ( In this study, we primarily analyze the features of mineral material (including mineral content, mineral occurrence, and mineral composition) to elucidate their influence on gas sorption capacity. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are used to reveal the characteristics of mineral occurrence and composition. Attributes of microstructure and gas sorption capacity also are evaluated including surface area, pore structure, Langmuir volume, and Langmuir pressure. Then, we use statistical methods to clarify the relationships among minerals, microstructure, and gas sorption capacity. Finally, we try to explain the contradicting results in the literature regarding the influence of minerals on the gas sorption capacity of coal. This study will lead to a better understanding of the way minerals effects gas sorption capacity, and hence it can act as a foundation for the prediction of gas accumulation and production. A total of 22 coal samples were chosen from five different basins in north China. The samples consisted of large cubic blocks, 30 × 30 × 30 cm The geographical locations for all 22 samples are shown in Proximate analysis was initially performed to set up a baseline for further investigations. The SEM and XRD analyses were then applied to identify, observe, and quantify the mineral matter. Based on prior results, fourteen samples were selected for low-temperature nitrogen (N A 5E-MAC III infrared fast coal analyzer was used to determine the moisture, volatile matter, ash yield, and fixed carbon content of 22 coal samples. The tests were performed in accordance with standard procedures ( Two or three small pieces were cut from each of the 22 coal samples so that each piece had one face with an area of approximately 1 × 1 cm The remaining material of the 22 coal samples were pulverized down below 200 The 14 samples chosen for further testing were pulverized to 100 The Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) theoretical framework ( High-pressure methane isotherms were obtained by a static volumetric adsorption apparatus similar to designs reported by many researchers ( Before starting the experiment, the void volume of the sample container was estimated by helium expansion. The methane was then injected in step-wise manner to the reference cell, and subsequently the valve between the reference cell and sample cell was opened to allow gas to flow into sample cell. A high resolution data acquisition system (DAS) was used to record the pressure data at half-hour intervals. When the pressure readings were constant and identical in both reference and sample cells for a period of more than 2 h, it was believed that the sorption equilibrium had been reached. This normally took 24 h for each pressure step and total pressure changed in a range of 0.2–6.5Mpa. The water bath temperature was 23 °C for this methane isotherms measurement. The Langmuir sorption model was employed to describe the sorption capacity ( Coal samples vary markedly in their moisture, fixed carbon (Fix C), ash, and volatile matter (VM), and therefore they can exhibit a wide range of compositions. Based on the coal rank shown in SEM analysis was performed to observe minerals and their occurrence modes in all coal samples. Numerous well-crystallized or particularly shaped mineral particles and aggregates were easily observed ( Distributed on surface of matrix, filled in fractures, and filled in pores are three typical occurrence modes of minerals in coal. Minerals with well-developed morphologies were mainly observed on the matrix surface in all coal samples, which decreases the chance of contact between gas and porous organic constituents ( Mineral infillings observed in micro-fractures and pores were mainly non-crystalline mineral detritus ( In general, minerals that fill or partially fill gaps are undesirable for gas sorption capacity because they decrease the pore volume and internal surface area. However, we found evidence that may support an opposite impact of mineral infillings on gas sorption capacity. As shown in the rectangle in Traditionally, the low temperature ash (LTA) of coal was initially obtained to eliminate the organic matter effects on the XRD analysis, and then LTA was used for XRD scanning. However, with the advancement of XRD technology, it is now possible to directly scan the raw coal for determination of major/minor mineral phases ( The mineral species and composition ratios in coal samples are presented in The clay mineral group comprises the main minerals in all types of coal. Clay minerals typically account for over 50% of total minerals and can approach 90% in some cases. Kaolinite is the most widespread mineral according to SEM and EDX analyses, occurring mainly as dispersed inclusions on the surface of maceral. Clay minerals have non-negligible surface area which could adsorb gas to some degree ( The minerals in the carbonate group are the second most abundant in samples, generally accounting for over 10% of the total with a maximum of 40%. In this group, calcite and dolomite are widespread in low rank coals, aragonite is common in high rank coals, and siderite is fairly abundant in both coals. Calcite frequently occurs in veins or as well-crystallized aggregates. Sulfide minerals are the third most abundant in high rank coal samples, normally making up approximately 6% of the total with the maximum at 15%. Pyrite and marcasite are the most common sulfide minerals, and they occur as veins, cleat coatings, and infillings or replacements of some plant textures. Sulfate minerals and quartz are the third most abundant minerals in low rank coals. Sulfate minerals can be detected in 40% of the low rank coal samples with contents ranging from 4 to 25%. Gypsum is the most widespread of the sulfate minerals. Quartz can be detected in 70% of the low rank coal samples with content ranging from 3.9 to 46.1%. Quartz in coal has different states and shapes, such as euhedral crystals, nodules, framboids, veins, cleat coatings, and infillings or replacements of some plant textures. Although most minerals have no potential to adsorb gas, some minerals possess relatively high hardness and brittleness such as carbonate minerals and quartz. Strong minerals deposited within fractures could keep them open, hence may have potential to increase the rate of gas flow ( In the previous sections, we studied characteristics of minerals occurrence and composition, and discussed their relation to microstructure. Minerals on the matrix surface or in pores and fractures decreased the surface area, furthermore, mineral infillings also decreased the pore volume. However, some interspaces between minerals and the stimulation of new micro-fractures may increase flow network connectivity and could even connect some dead end pores to increase surface area and pore volume. Additionally, clay minerals have notable surface area. Thus, the surface area and pore volume of coal need to be evaluated to reveal their relationships with minerals.  Both the Minimal or none existent surface area for gas adsorption is the important and commonly accepted explanation for the negative influence of minerals. However, there is almost no research to support this explanation that quantitatively analyzes how microstructure mediates the effect of minerals on gas sorption. Hence, our aim is to establish the correlation between microstructure and gas sorption capacity via quantitative analysis. We selected 8 coal samples with similar coal rank ( Based on the features of N Four samples were classified as type A, and three of them have high sorption capacity and low average pore size. The relatively low sorption capacity of the one sample is due to its low micropore ratio, surface area, and pore volume ( Three samples are classified into type B, which is represented by D9 ( Type C is similar to type B in the configuration of isotherm curves, but the adsorption amount grows at an insignificant rate when  There are no noticeable trends found when comparing sorption capacity with total minerals and brittle minerals ( However, a fair positive trend could be observed after excluding sample D11, which has extremely high ash content ( The negative correlation between minerals and V Furthermore, all three types of minerals have more notable positive trends with microstructure than with gas sorption capacity ( Additionally, it should be pointed out that samples used for correlating the minerals to microstructure or gas sorption capacity are relatively low rank coals. Their mineral contents are generally lower than middle–high rank coals. This positive correlation is not generalizable to all types of coals. In fact, the positive or negative correlation depends on which of the influences contributes more significantly. In this study, we found a positive influence of mineral matter on microstructure and gas sorption capacity. It is reasonable because mineral content is relative low will make the influence of mineral occurrence and composition to play a more significant role. SEM, EDX, and XRD analyses allowed for the characterization of minerals in coal including morphology, occurrence modes, composition, and content. Low temperature N Mineral content was smaller in low rank coals than in middle–high rank coals in this study. In low rank coal, minerals commonly occurred as well as crystallized mineral particles and aggregates infilling in the cell cavities or dispersing on the surface. However, these substances were predominately dispersed on the surface in high rank coals. The group of clay minerals was the main minerals in all kinds of coal. Clay minerals generally made up over 50% of the total with a few samples approaching 90%. The group of carbonate minerals was the second most abundant. Sulfate minerals and quartz were the third most abundant minerals in low rank coals and sulfide minerals were the third most abundant in high rank coals. Mineral occurrence mode has impacts on microstructure and gas sorption capacity. Minerals on the matrix surface or filled in pores and fractures decreased the surface area, furthermore, mineral infillings also decreased the pore volume. However, some interspaces between minerals and the stimulation of new micro-fractures may increase flow network connectivity or even connect some dead end pores to increase surface area and pore volume. The decreased or increased surface area or pore volume will reduce or enhance the gas sorption capacity. Mineral composition has impacts on microstructure and gas sorption capacity. We found that clay mineral content has the strongest positive relation to Mineral content, mineral occurrence and mineral composition are three controlling factors that together determined the influence of mineral matter on gas sorption capacity. Some factors have the potential for both positive and negative influence. This explains why negative and positive influences of mineral matter on gas sorption capacity have been found. In fact, the magnitude and direction of influence depends on the relative weight of factors. In this study, we found a positive influence of mineral matter on microstructure and gas sorption capacity. The authors acknowledge financial support from the various funding agencies including the
