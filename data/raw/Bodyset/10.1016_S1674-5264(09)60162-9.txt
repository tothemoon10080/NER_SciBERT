We present the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the prediction of blast induced ground vibration by taking into consideration of maximum charge per delay and distance between blast face to monitoring point. To investigate the suitability of this approach, the predictions by SVM have been compared with conventional predictor equations. Blast vibration study was carried out at Magnesite mine of Pithoragarh, India. Total 170 blast vibrations data sets were recorded at different strategic and vulnerable locations in and around to mine. Out of 170 data sets, 150 were used for the training of the SVM network as well as to determine site constants of different conventional predictor equations, whereas, 20 new randomly selected data sets were used to compare the prediction capability of SVM network with conventional predictor equations. Results were compared based on Coefficient of Determination (CoD) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between monitored and predicted values of Peak Particle Velocity (PPV). It was found that SVM gives closer values of predicted PPV as compared to conventional predictor equations. The coefficient of determination between measured and predicted PPV by SVM was 0.955, whereas it was 0.262, 0.163, 0.337 and 0.232 by USBM, Langefors-Kihlstrom, Ambraseys-Hendron and Bureau of Indian Standard equations, respectively. The MAE for PPV was 11.13 by SVM, whereas it was 0.973, 1.088, 0.939 and 1.292 by USBM, Langefors-Kihlstrom, Ambraseys-Hendron and Bureau of Indian Standard equations respectively.
