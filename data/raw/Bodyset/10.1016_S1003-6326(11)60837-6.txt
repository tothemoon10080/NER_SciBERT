The depression of pyrite in marmatite flotation by sodium glycerine-xanthate (SGX) was investigated through microflotation, zeta potential and adsorption measurements. The flotation tests of mineral show that in the presence of SGX, marmatite can be activated by Cu2+ and shows good flotability, while pyrite cannot be activated and therefore shows poor flotability. At the pH value range from 4 to 11, the flotation selectivity between marmatite and pyrite is obvious when the SGX concentration is below 50 mg/L. The depression mechanism of SGX on sulfide minerals is discussed based on zeta potential and adsorption isotherm. Zeta potential measurement demonstrates that in the presence of Cu2+, SGX can strongly adsorb on the surface of pyrite, while it cannot adsorb on the surface of marmatite. The results of adsorption isotherms show that the adsorption density of SGX on pyrite is greater.
