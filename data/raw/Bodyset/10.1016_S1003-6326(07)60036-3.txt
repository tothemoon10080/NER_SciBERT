A new process for extracting indium from indium-zinc concentrates was proposed. The process can directly extract indium from removed copper solution by D2EHPA, and cancel the stage of removing iron in the traditional process because of using iron and part of zinc in the In-Zn concentrates for direct preparing high quality Mn-Zn soft magnetic ferrites. The technologies in the processes, such as leaching the neutral leached residues with high concentrated acid at high temperature, reduction ferric and removing copper, and extracting indium, were investigated. The results show that total recovery ratio of indium is increased from less than 70% in the traditional process to more than 95%. This process has the advantages of largely simplifying the procedure of indium extraction, zero draining off of iron residue and zero emitting of SO2. So this is a clean production process.
