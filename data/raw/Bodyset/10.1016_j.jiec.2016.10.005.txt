Ionic liquids are considered as a potential electrolyte for rechargeable zinc–air battery due to non-volatility, high ionic conductivity, and so on. Electrochemical measurements are conducted to investigate the redox behavior of zinc electrode in 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMPyr] [NTf2]) ionic liquid and the effect of water in the ionic liquid is also studied. Cyclic voltammetry of zinc electrode in [BMPyr] [NTf2] shows a reversible redox peak, and the presence of water gives significant effects particularly on the cathodic current of zinc electrode. Different surface reaction mechanism on zinc electrode depending on the presence of water in ionic liquid is suggested.Metal–air battery is a promising energy storage device that could be a candidate to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand in modern world. The utilization of oxygen gas as cathodic reactant from the atmosphere gives advantages of high specific energy density and relatively uncomplicated structure compared to other types of batteries. To date, only primary zinc–air battery has been available commercially. Other types of metal–air batteries such as magnesium–air, aluminum–air, and lithium–air are still under enormous research to overcome barriers for the commercialization. The idea of having low cost, high energy density, and environmentally friendly battery for electric propulsion as well as renewable energy storage has attracted people to investigate the possibility of making rechargeable metal–air battery. Current technology only enables zinc–air, magnesium–air, and aluminum–air batteries to be mechanically recharged, which means discharged anode and spent electrolyte should be replaced with fresh metal and electrolyte Zinc–air battery is preferable due to abundance, low cost, constant discharge voltage, and low redox potential of zinc metal A comprehensive perspective by Kar et al. Some ionic liquids have been proven to support quasi-reversible oxygen reduction reaction and limited oxygen evolution reaction It is believed that ionic liquid/metal interfaces are totally different from common aqueous solution/metal interfaces. Zinc oxide, zinc hydroxide, and hydrozincite (Zn [BMPyr] [NTf Zinc foil (0.1 Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 10 The galvanostatic of zinc electrode in [BMPyr] [NTf To investigate the anodic and cathodic reactions of zinc electrode in [BMPyr] [NTf After the first cycle, cyclic voltammetry was conducted in a narrower potential range to avoid the decomposition of ionic liquid and to focus on zinc electrode oxidation-reduction reaction, which is shown in The observed zinc oxidation-reduction peaks are in accordance with the results from Xu et al., where platinum was used as a working electrode and zinc was introduced into electrolyte in a salt form Meanwhile, we observed that the A* peak in XPS spectra of zinc electrodes potentiostatically held at A Deconvolution of F 1s spectra of zinc electrode after potentiostatically held at the A In addition, the Zn 2p scan of zinc electrode at the A* peak in The oxidation and reduction reactions of zinc electrode in [BMPyr] [NTf This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the
