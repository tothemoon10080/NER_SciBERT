Gas-slag-metal equilibrium calculations are performed to investigate the transfer of Ti and O to submerged arc welded metals with increasing TiO2 addition in basic-fluoride fluxes. The results indicate that activities of TiO2 and Ti2O3 considering slag-metal reactions alone do not account for Ti transfer behaviors since TiF3 gas tends to form and reduce Ti-oxide activities. Thermodynamic simulation indicates that consideration of gases is essential to improve the prediction accuracy of Ti and O concentrations.Submerged arc welding (SAW) is an automatic welding process during which the weld pool and the tip of the electrode are shielded under a mound of finely granulated flux and molten slag [ In SAW, to improve the mechanical properties of the weldments, TiO Transfer behaviors of Ti and O from TiO As for SAW engineering, basicity index ( Chemical reactions between certain types of oxides and CaF Under the presence of the welding arc with high temperature, oxides in the flux tend to decompose and release O When TiO Due to high temperature and surface-to-volume ratios in SAW, thermodynamic equilibrium considerations can be applied to constrain the chemical reactions as equilibrium is attained in SAW, at least within confined volumes [ EH36 shipbuilding steel, a typical low carbon low alloy steel grade, was selected as the base metal (BM). Butt joint with V-type groove was prepared before welding, as schematically shown in X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF, S4 Explorer) was employed to determine the chemical compositions of the fluxes [ FactSage 6.4 (Equilib Module) was employed to simulate the thermochemical gas-slag-metal and slag-metal equilibrium using FToxid, Fstel, and FactPS databases [ The dilution value of BM is the ratio of the amount of the BM melted to the total amount of the WM [ FactSage is used in this work because of its widely proven successful application in steelmaking equilibrium calculations [  FactSage output of gas component vol pct values are summarized in Consequently, the addition of excessive quantities of TiO Although Ti is added to the basic-fluoride flux as TiO Chai et al. [ However, it is widely accepted that CaF The possibility of TiO The calculated gas-slag-metal equilibrium partial pressures of TiF Partial pressures of TiF As is reported by Mitra et al. [ The equilibrium activities of TiO It is well known that the activities of TiO In short, TiO It is seen from However, when the gas phase is excluded from the equilibrium calculations, the predicted Ti composition in the WM illustrates an increasing trend up to 11 wt pct TiO The differences between real WM Ti content and the calculated gas-slag-metal equilibrium Ti levels at 11 and 16 wt pct TiO It has been shown that the ionic speciation of Ti in silicate slags (Ti As is seen from Si, Mn, and Al are basic alloy elements in the WM [ As shown in In summary, thermochemical calculations indicate that Ti transfer from TiO The level of CaF TiO The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
