Bone materials are characterized by an astonishing variability and diversity. Still, because of ‘architectural constraints’ due to once chosen material constituents and their physical interaction, the fundamental hierarchical organization or basic building plans of bone materials remain largely unchanged during biological evolution. Such universal patterns of microstructural organization govern the mechanical interaction of the elementary components of bone (hydroxyapatite, collagen, water; with directly measurable tissue-independent elastic properties), which are here quantified through a multiscale homogenization scheme delivering effective elastic properties of bone materials: at a scale of 10nm, long cylindrical collagen molecules, attached to each other at their ends by

                     , the extracellular solid bone matrix is represented as collagen fibril inclusions embedded in a foam of largely disordered (extrafibrillar) mineral crystals. At a scale above the ultrastructure, where lacunae are embedded in extracellular bone matrix, the extravascular bone material is observed. Model estimates predicted from tissue-specific composition data gained from a multitude of chemical and physical tests agree remarkably well with corresponding acoustic stiffness experiments across a variety of cortical and trabecular, extracellular and extravascular materials. Besides from reconciling the well-documented, seemingly opposed concepts of ‘mineral-reinforced collagen matrix’ and ‘collagen-reinforced mineral matrix’ for bone ultrastructure, this approach opens new possibilities in the exploitation of computer tomographic data for nano-to-macro mechanics of bone organs.Bone materials are characterized by an astonishing variability and diversity. Their hierarchical organizations are often well suited and seemingly optimized to fulfill specific mechanical functions. This has motivated research in the fields of bionics and biomimetics. The aforementioned optimization is primarily driven by selection during the biological evolution process. However, apart from the fact that selection is quite unlikely to push bone skeletal and material design to a well-defined optimum ( The macrostructure at an observation scale of several mm to cm, where cortical (or compact) bone and trabecular (or spongy) bone can be distinguished [Fig. The microstructure at an observation scale of several The ultrastructure (or extracellular solid bone matrix) at an observation scale of several Within the ultrastructure, collagen-rich domains [light areas in Finally, at an observation scale of several ten nanometers, the so-called elementary components of mineralized tissues can be distinguished. These are: Plate-shaped mineral crystals consisting of impure hydroxyapatite (HA; Long cylindrically shaped collagen molecules with a diameter of about 1.2 Different non-collagenous organic molecules, predominantly lipids and proteins ( Water. The collagen matrix introduced in the first concept does not refer to molecular collagen with a stiffness of several GPa ( As regards the second concept, recent research work strongly suggests the ‘mineral matrix’ to be a mineral foam or porous polycrystal with typically several nm-sized water-filled ‘nano-pores’. This recent research work comprises material science contributions ( A central issue of this paper is that probably both concepts are relevant for the mineral–collagen interaction in the bone ultrastructure, but clearly at For relating the aforementioned vision of ultrastructural organization to effective elastic properties, we rely on homogenization theory (continuum micromechanics, In continuum micromechanics ( This leads to a multistep homogenization scheme. Such a procedure will be applied to mammalian cortical and trabecular bone materials in the sequel. Across the hierarchical organization of bone materials, the following ‘universal’ microstructural patterns are considered in the framework of a multistep homogenization scheme (Fig. Within an RVE Within an RVE Within an RVE Within an RVE Within an RVE In the line of Popper, who stated that a theory—as long as it has not been falsified—will be ‘the more satisfactory the greater the severity of independent tests it survives’, cited from Concerning the tissue-independent (‘universal’) phase properties, being the same for all tissues discussed herein, we consider the following experiments: Tests with an ultrasonic interferometer coupled with a solid media pressure apparatus ( Experimental validation of the five-step homogenization procedure [Eq. As concerns the extravascular scale [Fig. Evaluation of the image shown in One may sum up Determination of the ultrastructural volume fractions of mineral and collagen, It is interesting to note that the dehydration–demineralization tests of Combination of The ‘stoichiometric’ functions The ultrastructural volume fraction of the fibrils and the extrafibrillar space, The volume fractions for scales below the ultrastructure can be derived directly from Within the fibril, comprising the phases hydroxyapatite and wet collagen, the volume fraction of the latter reads as Ultrasonic experiments are based on the measurements of velocities of plane waves. If the waves travel along the principal material directions of an orthotropic material, through a 3D medium, the wave propagation velocities allow for determination of the material stiffness constants, according to the theory of elastic waves ( A typical device for the transmission of an elastic wave through a bone sample can be sketched as follows: a transmitter excites a specimen surface by a short impulse (signal) ( In terms of micromechanics (see In the ultrasonic tests of In the ultrasonic tests performed by    Also The stiffness values at the extracellular (ultrastructural) and extravascular scale predicted by the five-step homogenization scheme (Fig. Evaluation of data for various mammals (columns 3–6 of Evaluation of data for equine cortical bone (columns 1 and 2 of Evaluation of data for human and bovine trabecular bone material (column 3 of Evaluation of data for a typical human femur tissue (Table This contribution aimed at quantification of the mechanical effects of universal patterns across different extravascular and extracellular cortical and trabecular bone materials. Such patterns have been identified across the hierarchical organization of bone materials; from typical pore shapes in the micrometer to millimeter regime down to the level of the elementary constituents of bone, namely mineral crystals, collagen molecules, and water. Collagen molecules self-assemble into staggered schemes called fibrils, held together by crosslinks. Impure hydroxyapatite crystals precipitate inside these fibrils (intrafibrillar bone mineral) and between these fibrils (interfibrillar mineral). We have modeled the mechanical effects of these arrangements by means of a micromechanical representation comprising three homogenization steps [Fig. This representation deserves a discussion with respect to the pertinent literature on the topic: All three steps are in agreement with well-documented ideas; namely those of (i) collagen molecules forming a contiguous matrix ( Apart from the appealing feature that none of the above referenced, well-argued ideas on mineral–collagen interaction has to be rejected in the present approach, there is a strong quantitative argument for it: the low relative errors between stiffness experiments at different observation scales and corresponding stiffness predictions by a model which is based on measured tissue-independent stiffnesses of the elementary constituents of bone (collagen, hydroxyapatite, water), on their tissue-dependent experimentally determined dosages, and their ‘universal’ interaction patterns; notably, the model does not involve material parameters which need to be guessed or back-analysed. If these low prediction errors undercut the ones of any other model having undergone a comparably strict validation procedure, then the present model is superior to those other strictly validated models, such as the recent proposals of This motivates a short re-consideration of typical dimensions of collagen molecules, mineral crystals, collagen and mineral assemblies, and mineralized fibrils: In fact, the thickness of hydroxyapatite crystals, recently given as 2 The large amounts of hydroxyapatite present Throughout our herein presented developments, we consider parallel-oriented collagen fibrils: We first introduce this orientation within an RVE of The deviation of fibrillar orientation from the anatomical axis is often referred to in the context of concentric layers (lamellae) forming a secondary osteon around a Haversian canal. Numerous authors agree that the appearance of these lamellae in a cross section seen under polarized light microscopy (PLM) indicates the fibrillar orientation within these layers ( Herein, we limit our presentation to observation scales of at most We have provided evidence for common (‘universal’) mechanical interaction patterns in a variety of bone materials, through development of a multiscale material law and its validation by independent experimental sets at the extracellular and extravascular observation scales: Tissue-specific stiffness values predicted by the micromechanical model on the basis of tissue-independent (‘universal’) stiffnesses of the elementary components (mineral, collagen, water), for tissue-specific composition data (volume fractions) were compared to corresponding experimentally determined tissue-specific stiffness values. Mean relative errors between stiffness experiments and model estimates did not exceed 10%, which reflects a predictive precision which—to the knowledge of the authors—has never been attained so far. Thanks to these characteristics, the model allows for translation of non-invasively accessible composition data obtainable from computer tomography (CT), such as volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) ( This work was supported in part by the EU Network of Excellence project Knowledge-based Multicomponent Materials for Durable and Safe Performance (KMM-NoE) under the contract no.
