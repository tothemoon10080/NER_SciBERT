In this paper, a comprehensive approach for modelling, parameter estimation and global simulation of the grinding circuit of the Kolwezi Concentrator is presented. This process can be described by a nonlinear distributed parameter system. To differentiate between wet and dry grinding, the derived model takes into account the increase of the specific rate of breakage in the wet grinding process. In order to determine material transport dynamics within the mills, a new experimental method has been developed. Due to the lack of a colorant or a radioactive sensor, this procedure is based on the use of the G41 foaming as tracer. Both steady-state and dynamic simulation results are discussed and are shown to be in agreement with the experimental data.
