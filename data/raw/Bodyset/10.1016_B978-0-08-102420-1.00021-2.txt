During the past few decades, a remarkable advancement has been evidenced in terms of developing drug deliveries to the bone. To treat different bone disorders like osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, osseous cancers, etc., prolonged systemic drug therapies are usually applied. However, the localized delivery of different drugs from the bone-implantable systems presents extensive benefits by producing effectual drug concentrations at the diseased and/or infected bone sites with the limitation of various systemic side effects over the conventional drug therapy. The current chapter describes the implantable devices for drug delivery to bone to treat various bone disorders. Bone implants are currently positioned as the largest segment of implantable devices in the biomedical market ( Bone is one of the important parts of the body and plays vital roles in imparting shape and protection, muscular attachments, hematopoiesis, and leverage for motion ( The bone regeneration process can be classified into four different steps. The initial step is the formation of a hematoma because of the disruption of the tissue integrity and the disintegration of blood vessels ( Natural polymers possess certain favorable properties like ready availability in nature, lower extraction expenses, biocompatibility, biodegradability, nonirritancy, etc. ( Chitosan is a cationic natural polysaccharide produced by the alkaline-mediated deacetylation of chitin (  In research by Alginate is a popular marine-derived biomedical biopolymeric group having biocompatibility as well as biodegradability (   Gelatin is a protein-based natural multifunctional biopolymer with good biocompatibility as well as biodegradability ( Collagen is a fibrous protein widely available in animals and the human body ( Due to the bone regeneration capacity of collagen, collagen-gentamicin sponge materials have been developed and tested over the last few decades for the localized  Hyaluronic acid, also called hyaluronate or hyaluronan, is a linear macromolecular material of the ECM in most of the connective tissues ( In research, Besides the natural occurring polymers, a variety of synthetic polymers (both nonbiodegradable as well as biodegradable polymers) were employed to formulate implantable devices for the use in bone drug delivery to treat various bone disorders ( PMMA is the synthetic polymer of nonbiodegradable system. The most commonly utilized PMMA-based system for the bone drug delivery is drug-coated/loaded PMMA cement beads ( Decreased biocompatibility with the musculoskeletal tissues Slower residual releasing of antibiotics for undefined time and shorter duration of drug releasing Drug resistance risks Only thermostable drugs are suitable because of the higher setting temperature of the process for PMMA polymerization PMMA matrices can create a physical barrier, which prevents the new bone growth into the bone defects Second stage surgical operation is needed for the removal of nonbiodegradable PMMA bead cement materials PMMA cement beads are available both noncommercially as well as commercially ( In a study by Poly α-hydroxy acids like PLA and its related copolymers like PLGA have been extensively investigated in the orthopedic applications due to some important characteristics such as good biodegradability, enhanced biocompatibility, appreciable safety profile (disease transmission possibilities), absence of any immunological reactions, etc. (  In research, PCL is a category of synthetic polymer, which has been already investigated for bone and cartilage repair applications as a consequence of the stability as well as the longer degradation period (  There are some other synthetic biodegradable polymers that are used for their applications in bone regeneration such as polypropylene fumarate (PPF), polyanhydrides, Ceramics are inorganic nonmetallic materials. These are a complex group, which includes calcium sulfate, various calcium phosphates such as biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), mono-calcium phosphate (MCP), di-calcium phosphate (DCP), β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), octacalcium phosphate (OCP), HAp, silica-based bioactive glasses (Bioglass), and inert ceramics, like alumina, zirconia, silicon carbides, etc. ( Since 18th century, calcium sulfate dihydrate and hemihydrate have been used as bone graft substitutes (  Various calcium phosphate materials such as BCP, MCP, DCP, β-TCP, OCP, HAp, etc., were extensively researched because of their high biocompatibility, bioactivity, and osteoconductivity (  Among various calcium phosphates, HAp is extensively utilized as a ceramic biomaterial in orthopedic regenerative medicine. Recently, synthetic HAp (through chemical routes) has been used to develop ceramic bone-implantable systems as it possesses osteoconductive property. A study of HAp-based drug delivery system by wet Silica-based bioactive glasses are usually noncrystalline compounds that comprise fine ceramic crystallites in a glassy matrix ( In recent years, the bioactive glasses were successfully used as a promising synthetic bone-grafting material ( In recent times, a variety of polymeric-inorganic implantable systems were researched for use as bone drug delivery matrices to treat different bone disorders (  During the past few decades, numerous bone-implantable delivery systems were developed and evaluated for use in localized therapeutics in the management of different bone disorders like osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, osseous cancers, etc., and bone regeneration in the diseased bone sites. The localized delivery of different drugs through the bone-implantable systems of different kinds (polymeric systems, inorganic systems, and polymeric-inorganic systems) presents extensive benefits by producing effectual drug concentrations at the diseased and/or infected bone site with the limitation of systemic side effects over conventional drug therapy. However, the optimization of therapeutics by the already-developed bone-implantable drug delivery systems necessitates expertise from the viewpoints of both pharmaceutical technology as well as biomaterial engineering fields, which have traditionally been apart. The multidisciplinary endeavors concerning the production of bone substitute materials and the know-how of the pharmaceutical sectors are the decisive point to ease the clinical applications of various new bone-implantable systems for localized bone drug delivery, and thus, the patient community can get advantages from these. Furthermore, the bone-implantable drug delivery systems are considered kind of combined systems comprising orthopedic biomaterials and drugs or other therapeutic biomolecules (like hormones, proteins, enzymes, cells, etc.), which necessitates a longer registration procedure by the US FDA and/or other regulatory bodies as compared to that for the conventional bone-implantable systems hindering the clinical applications.
