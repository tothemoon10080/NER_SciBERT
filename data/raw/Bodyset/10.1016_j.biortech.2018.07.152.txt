In this study, organic acid could be used as co-catalyst for assisting solid acid SO4
                     2−/SnO2-argil to convert hemicellulose-derived D-xylose into furfural. The relationship between pKa of organic acid and turnover frequency (TOF) of co-catalysis with organic acid plus SO4
                     2−/SnO2-argil was explored on the conversion of D-xylose to furfural. Oxalic acid (pKa = 1.25) (0.35 wt%) was found to be the optimum co-catalyst for assisting SO4
                     2−/SnO2-argil (3.6 wt%) to synthesize furfural from D-xylose (20 g/L) at 180 °C for 20 min, and the furfural yield and TOF could be obtained at 57.07% and 6.26 h−1, respectively. Finally, the obtained furfural (107.6 mM) could be completely biotransformed to furfuralcohol by recombinant Escherichia coli CCZU-K14 whole-cells at 30 °C and pH 6.5 in the presence of 1.5 mol glucose/mol furfural and 400 mM D-xylose. Clearly, this strategy shows high potential application for the effective synthesis of furfuralcohol from biomass-derived D-xylose.Furfuralcohol (FOL) is known as an important industrial chemical, which has been widely used for the production of such as vitamin C, lysine, plasticizer, adhesives, cements, fiber glass, furan resins, lubricant, polymer concrete, etc. ( In recent years, biocatalytic synthesis of FOL from FAL is gaining great attention due to its highly selective reactions, energy-saving operation and environmentally friendly process (  Recently, various homogeneous Brönsted acids including formic acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, HCl, and H In this study, a newly prepared solid acid SO Argil was purchased from Zhanteng mineral processing factory (Hebei, P.R. China). SnCl After the mixture containing 1.4 g SnCl To test the effects of organic acid on the catalytic activity of SO Recombinant To investigate the effects of substrate FAL concentrations on the reductase stability based on the above optimization results, 0–400 mM commercial FAL were mixed with To biotransform FAL liquor obtained from the dehydration of Activity of NADH-dependent reductase CmCR was measured by monitoring the absorbance decrease of NADH at 340 nm using FAL as substrate, which was carried out as the previous procedure ( Fourier transform infrared spectrums (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Raman spectra of SO Using BET to examine the surface area changes of SO In this study, various low loading of organic acids including oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, glyoxylic acid, Furthermore, the effects of oxalic acid concentration (0.1–0.7 wt%) were investigated on the conversion of Various dehydration reaction parameters including solid acid catalyst loading (0.6–6.0 wt%), reaction temperature (150–190 °C), reaction time (10–40 min), and substrate Using the commercially available FAL as substrate, various parameters (e.g., cosubstrate, precursors, reaction temperature, reaction pH, metal ion and substrate concentration) which could promote the biocatalytic activity were optimized. Cosubstrate glucose could be used to achieve cofactor regeneration ( FAL is one of key chemicals for the production of FOL, 2-methylfuran, tetrahydrofuran, furan-2-acrolein, 3-(furan-2-yl-)-2-methylacryaldehyde, succinic acid, maleic acid ( It is of great interest to effectively convert biomass-derived Mass balance analysis of dehydration of The relationship between pKa of organic acid and TOF of co-catalysis with organic acid plus SO The authors declare no conflict of interest.
