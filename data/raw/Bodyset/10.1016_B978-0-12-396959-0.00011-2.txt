Solid-liquid separation is not usually considered a “high-tech” operation. Much equipment for the separation of liquids and finely divided solids was invented independently in a number of industries and is of diverse character. These developments have occurred without the benefit of any but the most general theoretical considerations. Even at present, the selection of equipment for specific solid-liquid separation applications is largely a process of scale-up based on direct experimentation with the process material. The nature and sizing of equipment depends on the economic values and proportions of the phases as well as certain physical properties that influence relative movements of liquids and particles. Pressure often is the main operating variable so its effect on physical properties should be known. Whenever feasible, solids are settled out by gravity or with the aid of centrifugation. In dense media separation, like ore separations, an essentially homogeneous liquid phase is made by mixing in finely divided solids (less than 100 mesh) of high density; specific gravity of 2.5 can be attained with magnetite and 3.3 with ferrosilicon. Valuable ores and coal are floated away from gangue by such means. In flotation, surface active agents induce valuable solids to adhere to gas bubbles which are skimmed off. Magnetic separation also is practiced when feasible. Thickeners are vessels that provide sufficient residence time for settling to take place. Classifiers incorporate a mild raking action to prevent the entrapment of fine particles by the coarser ones that are to be settled out. Classification also is accomplished in hydrocyclones with moderate centrifugal action. Freely draining solids may be filtered by gravity with horizontal screens, but often filtration requires a substantial pressure difference across a filtering surface. An indication of the kind of equipment that may be suitable can be obtained by observations of sedimentation behavior or of rates of filtration in laboratory vacuum equipment. Characteristics of the performance of the main types of commercial SLS equipment are summarized in Final selection of filtering equipment is inadvisable without some testing in the laboratory and pilot plant. A few details of such work are mentioned later in this chapter. Flowsketch of the process of which the filtration is a part, with the expected qualities and quantities of the filtrate and cake. Properties of the feed: amounts, size distribution, densities and chemical analyses. Laboratory observations of sedimentation and leaf filtering rates. Pretreatment options that may be used. Washing and blowing requirements. Materials of construction. As a first step, it is essential to know the characteristics of the particles as well as the liquids in a separation process. Most of these data are not found in handbooks or in the open literature. There is a need that the characteristics of both phases must be determined. What may be disturbing is that these properties might be time dependent, being affected by upstream conditions and the aging of the materials ( The size of the particle is the most important separation variable because it affects the particle filterability and its settling rate. The smaller the particles, the more difficult it is to separate from the liquid. So the first step is to determine the particle size. Some of the equipment for particle measurement is a microscope, light-scattering size analyzers, and particle counters. The microscope permits a true image of the particles; it is inexpensive and easy to use. The other methods require a certain amount of experience or the results might be meaningless. Often, it is better to outsource particle size determination to a company that has performed these determinations. Another important consideration is solids concentration, since this affects the type of separator to be used. In applications with low solids concentration (e.g., less than 50 ppm), sand filters or cartridge filters may be suitable. If the solids concentration is high, then cake filters are used. Electrical charges on particles affect the agglomeration of particles. Zeta potential measurements may be made but the results are unreliable and have not been used industrially. The viscosity of the liquid phase is an important consideration. It is a known fact that the sedimentation velocity and the filtration rate vary inversely as the viscosity of the suspending liquid. Temperature, purity, and the amount of dissolved solids materially affect the viscosity value; therefore, it is essential that direct measurement of viscosity be made on the solid-liquid system. Further, toxicity, volatility, and corrosiveness must be taken into account for environmental and safety reasons. Last, the particle shape and particle strength can be significant when considering the type of equipment to be specified. Filterability of slurries depends so markedly on small and unidentified differences in conditions of formation and aging that no correlations of this behavior have been made. In fact, the situation is so discouraging that some practitioners have dismissed existing filtration theory as virtually worthless for representing filtration behavior. Qualitatively, however, simple filtration theory is directionally valid for modest scale-up and may provide a structure on which more complete theory and data can be assembled in the future. As filtration proceeds, a porous cake of solid particles is built up on a porous medium, usually a supported cloth. Because of the fineness of the pores the flow of liquid is laminar so it is represented by the equation α = specific resistance of the cake (m/kg)         At constant rate of filtration, After the constants have been determined,  Filtration tests were performed on a CaCO   When the filtrate contains dissolved substances that should not remain in the filter cake, the occluded filtrate is blown out; then the cake is washed by pumping water through it. Theoretically, an amount of wash equal to the volume of the pores should be sufficient, even without blowing with air. In practice, however, only 30–85% of the retained filtrate has been found removed by one-displacement wash. The equations of this section are applied in Resistivity of filter cakes depends on the conditions of formation of which the pressure is the major one that has been investigated at length. The background of this topic is discussed in Since the drag pressure acting on the particles of the cake varies from zero at the face to the full hydraulic pressure at the filter cloth, the resistivity as a function of pressure likewise varies along the cake. A mean value is defined by With A filter press with a surface of 50 m  A TiO Comparing With a peripheral speed of 60 m/hr If the peripheral speed were made 1.22 m/min, a drum 1.0 m dia would meet the requirements with Δ The mean resistivity at a particular pressure difference can be evaluated from a constant pressure run. From three such runs— Δ The filtration equation In practice, a measured Data for some filter media are shown in A kaolin slurry has the properties Filtration will proceed at a constant rate for 15 min, the pressure will rise to 8 bar and filtration will continue at this pressure until the end of the operation. Filter cloth resistance is  Find the maximum daily production of filtrate. The filtrate will be blown and then washed with a volume of water equal to the pore space of the cake. Find the maximum daily production of filtrate under these conditions. Basis 1 m      A fundamental relation for the flow resistance of a bed of particles is due to At increasing pressures, the particles or aggregates may be distorted and brought closer together. The rate of flow also may affect the structure of a cake: at low rates a loose structure is formed, at higher ones fine particles are dragged into the previously formed bed. The drag pressure at a point in a cake is the difference between the pressure at the filter medium and the pressure loss due to friction up to that point. As the drag pressure at a distance from the filter cloth increases, even at constant filtering pressure, the porosity and resistance adjust themselves continuously. The probable success of correlation of cake resistivity in terms of all the factors that have been mentioned has not been great enough to have induced any serious attempts of this nature, but the effect of pressure has been explored. Although the Since the drag pressure varies along the cake as a result of friction, porosity and resistivity also will vary with position.  Since the sizes of particles and agglomerates of the slurry are a main determinant of a rate of filtration, any methods of influencing these sizes are of great practical value. For example, When dilute slurries are encountered on a large scale, it is more economical to concentrate them before filtering. This is accomplished by sedimentation or thickening in tanks for an appropriate period. Typical designs of thickeners are sketched in The expecting filtering area is expected to be substantial, measured in tens of m Cake washing is critical. Cake drying is critical. Cake removal may be a problem. Precoating may be needed. Laboratory filtration investigations are of three main kinds: observation of sedimentation rates; with small vacuum or pressure leaf filters; with pilot plant equipment of the types expected to be suitable for the plant. Vacuum and pressure laboratory filtration assemblies are shown in Before any SLS equipment of substantial size is finally selected, it is essential to use the results of pilot plant tests for guidance. Although many vendors are in a position to do such work, pilot equipment should be used at the plant site where the slurry is made. Because slurries often are unstable, tests on shipments of slurry to the vendor's pilot plant may give misleading results. It may be possible to condition a test slurry to have a maximum possible resistivity, but a plant design based on such data will have an unknown safety factor and may prove uneconomical. Such equipment consists of a hollow cylinder fitted with a permeable bottom and a permeable piston under controlled pressure. Slurry is charged to the CP cell, cake is formed with gentle suction, and the piston is lowered to the cake level. The rate of flow of filtrate at low head through the compressed cake is measured at a series of pressures on the piston. From the results the resistivity of the cake becomes known as a function of pressure. The data of There is much evidence, however, that the resistivity behavior of a cake under filtration conditions may be different from that measured in a CP cell. The literature is reviewed by No serious attempt has yet been made to standardize filtration tests and to categorize filtration behavior in generally accepted terms. A possibly useful measure of filterability, however, has been proposed by Full scale filtration equipment requirements can be estimated quickly in terms of Sizing of full-scale equipment on the basis of small-scale tests requires a consideration of possible ranges of at least the following variables: filterability as measured by cake and medium resistivity; feed rate and concentration; operating conditions, particularly pressure and high initial rates; behavior of the filter cloth with time. The performance of solid-liquid separation equipment is difficult to predict by the engineer without some specific experience in this area. Unfortunately, it must be again recommended that the advice of experienced vendors should be sought, as well as that of expert consultants. Equipment for solid-liquid separation is available commercially from many sources. Classifications of vendors with respect to the kind of equipment are also given in The variety of solid-liquid separation equipment is so great that only a brief selection can be presented here. The most extensive illustrations are in the book of  Clarification of a large variety of liquids is accomplished with cartridge filters which come in a large variety of designs. Usually the cartridges are small, but there are designs for liquid rates in excess of 5000 gpm. The filtering surface may be a fine metal screen or an assembly of closely spaced disks whose edge face functions as the filtering surface, or woven or matted fibers. The operation is intermittent, with either flushing back of the accumulated solids or replacement of the filtering elements in the body of the cartridge, or in some instances the solids are scraped off the filtering surface with a built-in mechanism and then flushed out in concentrated form.      Cake removal usually is with a scraper into a screw or belt conveyor, but The double drum filter of   The trend in filtration is to improve the filtration step so that it is performed quickly, effectively, and efficiently. Vendors have developed innovations that save users money, increase production capacity and include self-cleaning capabilities without interrupting flow through the filter units. In water treatment applications, the emphasis has been on advancing membrane technology with ever-increasing membrane area, lower pressure drop, and designs that use smaller pumps, less piping, and fewer filters. One innovation has been the introduction of rugged filter membranes that are self supporting and withstand many more filtration/cleaning cycles ( Hydroclones were introduced in 1891 to remove sand from water. They function like a gas-solid cyclone, have no moving parts, and rely on centrifugal force for separation, clarification, and dewatering processes. Hydroclones find use in concentrating slurries, in classifying solids in liquid suspensions, and in washing solids. They may be used alone or in conjunction with clarifiers, thickeners, or filters ( A conventional hydroclone consists of a cylindrical section joined to a conical section. The technology uses centrifugal force created by the incoming slurry feed stream to separate solids and liquids. The powerful forces generated in the inlet and conical section forces the solids to the wall. Cleaned liquid flows out the top and the solids move to the wall and downward to the lower cone discharge. Hydrocyclones generate their own, mild centrifugal forces. Since the acceleration drops off rapidly with diameter, hydrocyclones are made only a few inches in diameter. For large capacities, many units are used in parallel. The flow pattern is shown schematically in There are certain parameters that influence the ability of a hydroclone to perform a separation. These are particle size, particle shape, solids loading, inlet velocity, the split desired between underflow (solids discharge) and overflow (liquid discharge), density of solids and liquid, as well as liquid viscosity. The characteristic diameter of the product is taken as In units, Data of commercially available sizes of filtration equipment, typical applications, and specific performances are available only to a limited extent in the general literature, but more complete in manufacturers’ literature. Representative data are collected in this section and summarized in tabular form. One of the reasons why more performance data have not been published is the difficulty of describing each system concisely in adequate detail. Nevertheless, the limited listings here should afford some perspective of the nature and magnitude of some actual and possibly potential applications. A hydrocyclone assembly is required to handle 10,000 gpm of slurries of a solid with specific gravity 2.9 with a cutoff point of The corresponding capacity Performance often is improved by appropriate pretreatment of the slurry with flocculants or other means. An operating practice that is receiving increased acceptance is the delaying of cake deposition by some mechanical means such as scraping, brushing, severe agitation, or vibration. In these ways most of the filtrate is expelled before the bulk of the cake is deposited. Moreover, when the cake is finally deposited from a thickened slurry, it does so with an open structure that allows rapid filtration. A similar factor is operative in belt or top feed drum filters in which the coarse particles drop out first and thus form the desirable open structure. A review of such methods of enhancement of filtration rates is by The relative suitability of the common kinds of solid-liquid separation applications is summarized in Representative commercial sizes of some types of pressure filters for operation in batch modes are reported in Cycle times, air rates, and minimum cake thicknesses in operation of rotary drum filters are stated in The applications listed in Sedimentation equipment is employed on a large scale for mineral and ore processing. These and other applications are listed in Clarification of a great variety of industrial liquids is accomplished on smaller scales than in tank clarifiers by application of cartridge filters; some of these applications are listed in Centrifuges are classified as filtration or sedimentation types. Filtration machines use centrifugal force to collect solids as a cake on a screen or cloth. Examples of this type unit are basket, peeler, and pusher types as shown in Characteristics of centrifugal filters and sedimentation centrifuges are in When selecting a centrifuge, it is easy to be overwhelmed by the many different styles and sizes of equipment available. Physical properties of the materials must be known, e.g. the specific gravity of the liquids and solids. Performance criteria like liquid clarity, solids recovery, solids dryness and product purity must be known. Process requirements such as batch or continuous operation must be specified. In batch operation, process conditions like separation of multiple products, handling process variations, achieving a clean separation, minimizing particle degradation, and choice of materials of construction are required. In continuous operation, such variables as where the centrifuge is located in the process, pressure and temperature of the operation, solids loading, and solids concentration must be known. These variables should be investigated for a specific application but there are no hard and fast rules concerning which centrifuge is best. Once the above information is obtained, it is wise to discuss the requirements with a manufacturer's representative because there are many options. It may also be necessary to perform pilot plant tests to narrow equipment choices (
