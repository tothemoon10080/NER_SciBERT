Injuries to the tarsometatarsal joint complex lead to significant morbidity if anatomical reduction is not achieved. Restoring and maintaining the length of the lateral column should be part of this reduction. We present the use of monolateral fixators as definitive treatment for tarsometatarsal injuries with lateral column shortening. Although use of external fixation techniques have been described as an intra-operative aid to reduction of the lateral column, there is sparse literature acknowledging their use in maintaining this reduction until union. Traditionally, fusion of the lateral column or k-wire fixation has been advocated, but these methods are associated with stiffness and instability, respectively. Four patients presented with closed, isolated injuries to the tarsometatarsal joint complex, all with lateral column shortening owing to comminution of the cuboid, with midfoot abduction instability. Three patients also had medial column instability. In each case, a monolateral fixator was applied to the lateral column with pins in the os calcis and fourth and fifth metatarsals. Medial column instability was treated with screw fixation. All patients remained non-weight bearing for 6 weeks, and the external fixator was removed between 6 and 8 weeks. All patients were walking unaided at latest follow-up, ranging from 7 to 22 months (mean 16.5 months). Modified AOFAS score ranged from 58 to 100 (mean score 75). Three patients had normal or near normal gaits at latest follow-up. The monolateral external fixator allows quick and accurate reduction of the lateral column using fluoroscopy. The soft tissues are preserved and appropriate stability is provided. It can be removed without general anaesthetic. We conclude that the use of lateral column monolateral fixators as an adjunct to internal fixation in tarsometatarsal injuries with lateral column instability is a convenient, safe and reliable treatment method.
