This investigation reports the dissolution kinetics of Na-As, K-As and NH4-As jarosites in a sulfuric acid medium. The effects of the pH, temperature (T), particle size (d0), and structure substituents (especially in the M and Z positions of the general formula of jarosite-type compounds, MFe3(ZO4)(OH)6) were investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that the temperature is the variable with the most significant effect on the dissolution rate, followed by the pH and particle size. In addition, it was observed that the type of substituent does not affect the dissolution rates in the acid medium. These results are reasonably consistent with the shrinking core model of chemical control for the dissolution of jarosite-type compounds under extreme pH conditions (≤1.0) and control by mass transfer at intermediate pH conditions (>1.0). The results obtained were compared with those of other investigations, and it was observed that the dissolution of jarosite-type compounds could have important implications on the recovery of metal values. Finally, a kinetic model is proposed to describe the dissolution process of jarosite-type compounds in the acid medium.The hydrometallurgical processing of zinc calcine by the conventional roasting-leaching-electrowinning process leads to the formation of leaching residues that consist primarily of sulfates. These residues may contain significant amounts of Zn as well as other metal values, such as Pb, Cu, Ag and Cd, which have to be recovered to obtain an additional economic value ( Although alkalis are usually added to initiate the jarosite precipitation, an excess of ferric ions is sometimes added to the sulfate solution to precipitate the excess alkalis ( The production of zinc involves the generation of large amounts of jarosite-type compounds (namely ammonium jarosite and sodium jarosite), which represents a potential environmental problem considering the massive increase in iron residues and the presence of toxic elements (i.e., As, Cd, Pb). On the other hand, it is noteworthy that these residues may have considerable economic value and therefore, the recovery of metals from the wasted of zinc production represents an attractive research area to reduce the environmental harm and produce new resources ( According to However, due to the increasing interest in recovering valuable metals from industrial residues, several leaching agents (e.g., hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, lye, brine, ammonia, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride and some carboxylic acids) have been used as attractive alternatives in the recovery process. Among them, sulfuric acid has attracted the most attention ( Because most of the studies on the dissolution of jarosite-type compounds have been conducted under alkaline media and the effects of sulfuric acid on the dissolution kinetics of Na-As, K-As and NH The jarosite-type compounds were synthetized by using the following reagents: iron(III) sulfate n-hydrate, anhydrous sodium sulfate, anhydrous potassium sulfate, anhydrous ammonium sulfate, arsenic pentoxide and sulfuric acid (97.9%), which were purchased as reagent-grade chemicals from J.T. Baker. The chemical analysis and monitoring of reactions was performed by using standards (PerkimElmer Pure) of Fe, Na, K and As. All of the experiments were performed with ultrapure deionized water with a resistivity of ≈ Samples of the K-As, Na-As and NH The chemical composition of the compounds was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Here, 1 The kinetics and the stages that control the rate of a solid/fluid reaction can be established by monitoring the conversion of solid particles and determining the influence of the particle size, temperature, concentration of the acid medium and reaction time on the conversion. The conversion X represents the amount of the reacted substance and can be calculated as follows: It is well known that the leaching rate increases as the liquid-solid ratio increases in the system, which is related to the formation of a more homogeneous dispersion of the jarosite-type compound as the amount of the liquid increases, as was reported by It is noteworthy that the synthesized solids exhibit a yellow-brownish color, which is typical of the jarosite-type compounds. SEM analysis shows that the solids are spherical aggregates with diameters ranging from 40 to 90  The results of the FT-IR analysis are shown in To obtain the concentration profiles during the dissolution process of the jarosite-type compounds, several Na-As jarosite samples were treated with H On the other hand, it is observed that during the dissolution of Na-As-jarosite (  To determine the kinetic model and establish the controlling stage that best describes the dissolution behavior of jarosite-type compounds in the H For the shrinking core model, three stages can control the reaction rate: the mass transfer in the fluid layer that surrounds the particle (Eq. Therefore, the shrinking core model was selected, with the chemical reaction as the controlling stage in the dissolution experiments at extreme pH conditions (≤ The behavior of the curve shown in The results of The results of the dissolution experiments of Na-As, K-As, NH These results were compared with those obtained in a previous work ( From the results of X, k The pH value at which there would be an instant dissolution of the jarosite-type compounds, without an induction period, t The variation of the dissolution rate with temperature is given by the Arrhenius equation ( The overlapping of the regression lines observed in To determine the effect of particle size on the dissolution rate of M-As jarosites, experiments were performed at a constant [H The particular kinetic models for each dissolution stage (induction and progressive conversion) were established by considering the calculated kinetic parameters and the shrinking core model for spherical particles, as follows: For the progressive conversion stage, the kinetics can be described according to the following equation: Eq.  Several studies have been conducted to investigate the dissolution rates of jarosite-type compounds ( These studies report that the dissolution process of jarosite-type compounds in alkaline media generally occurs in three stages: an induction period followed by a progressive conversion period up to when equilibrium is reached, which is a similar behavior to the one observed under acidic conditions. The first stage is associated with the initial surface of the particles, which decreases exponentially with the increase of T and [OH  Regarding the dissolutions performed in the CaO medium, which is one of the most popular compounds used in industry to modify pH, all of the studies similarly report the selective dissolution of M and Z sites according to the general formula presented. As a result of the CaCO  From the results obtained in this study and the data reported on the dissolution of jarosite-type compounds, it is possible to determine that their dissolution is independent of the species substituted in the M position of the structure. For example, the dissolutions rates of the Ag, Na-Ag, K-Ag, NH As was mentioned above, low concentrations of Ag and Pb are commonly present in industrial hydrometallurgical residues; however, there is not information available regarding the dissolution of these species from jarosite-type compounds in acidic media. Nevertheless, because Ag and Pb are present in the same position in the structure of jarosite-type compounds as Na On the other hand, it was found that the presence of some species in the structure of these compounds can have important implications on the dissolution rate; for instance, the reaction does not depend on pH in the presence of As(V) in the Z position (mainly for pH Therefore, it is possible to recover Ag from industrial jarosites by employing a leaching process in alkaline or acidic media. For example, higher dissolution rates are observed during dissolutions in alkaline medium, but the solid Fe(OH) The results of the dissolution experiments of jarosite-type compounds with and without As(V) in H The diffusion through the solid layer is the controlling stage at intermediate pH conditions (> The dissolution rates of Na-As, K-As and NH All of the solids used in the dissolution experiments have iron in the Y-site. Since the chemical reaction (breaking of the Fe The dissolution kinetic parameters in an acid medium obtained in this work are similar to those reported for alkaline media, although the reactions are slightly faster in the latter. The presence of species such as As(V) has important implications on the dissolution rate since it significantly affects the dissolution rate in alkaline medium under slightly alkaline conditions (reaction orders of n The authors thank the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Autonomous University of the State of Hidalgo (UAEH), and the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi (UASLP) for all the facilities used to carry out the experimental work.
