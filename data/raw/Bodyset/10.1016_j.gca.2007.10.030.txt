The organic horizon (the mor layer) of podzolized boreal forest soils has accumulated atmospheric fallout of mercury and lead over centuries, resulting in current concentrations close to levels where negative effects on soil biota are thought to occur. To what extent the pollution history is preserved in the stratigraphy of this horizon is not well known. In this study we asses whether the chronology of a large historic pulse of atmospheric pollution emitted from the Rönnskär smelter in northern Sweden, particularly between 1950 and 1980, is preserved within the stratigraphy of the mor layer, which is typically 5-cm thick. Vertical sub-sampling (⩽5mm) of five mor profiles sampled along a 100-km pollution gradient away from the smelter are analyzed for mercury and lead concentrations, spheroidal carbonaceous particles from fossil fuel combustion (SCPs) and stable lead isotopes (206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb). Their vertical distribution is compared with the temporal variations in atmospheric inputs reconstructed for the last ∼100 years from analyses of an ombrotrophic peat core and a varved lake sediment core sampled within a distance of 50km of the smelter. The mor profiles situated ⩽12km from the smelter record the pollution history of the smelter. There is a 20 to 40-times enrichment of Hg, Pb and SCP at the transition in the O-horizon from the F- to H-layer compared to the basal part and a distinct peak in the 206Pb/207Pb ratio (∼1.22) in the F-layer. The mor profiles situated outside the historical contamination range of the smelter (80 and 100km away) record no obvious influence from the Rönnskär smelter, instead their vertical 206Pb/207Pb profiles follow the general regional pollution history in northern Sweden. We conclude that the mor layer preserves a record of atmospheric Hg, Pb and SCP inputs and due to low leaching rates this organic horizon serves as a semi-archive of atmospheric Hg and Pb pollution. We stress the need of including this property in the existing ‘black-box’ models predicting the fate of Hg and Pb within contaminated boreal forest soils.The surface organic horizon of podzolized boreal forest soils (the O-horizon) is a major receptor of atmospheric fallout of metal contaminants such as mercury and lead. As a consequence, the concentrations of these two toxic metals in the boreal forest of Scandinavia are close to the levels where negative effects on soil biota are expected ( Most studies predicting the turnover of mercury and lead in boreal forest soils are derived from calculations assuming that the pool of these contaminants are homogenously mixed in the organic horizon ( The organic horizon of soils in the boreal coniferous forest, commonly referred to as the mor layer due to its specific humus form, has prerequisites for a well-developed stratigraphy due to a low activity of burrowing soil animals ( In this paper we evaluate to what extent the vertical variation of mercury, lead and spheroidal carbonaceous particles within the mor layer is due to variable historic atmospheric inputs, by comparing trends found with depth in the mor layer close to a local pollution source (the Rönnskär smelter) in northern Sweden with the trends found in an ombrothrophic peat bog and a varved lake sediment. The peat record is used as a reference of past atmospheric inputs, while the varved sediment is used for dating the observed trends. The Rönnskär smelter was established in 1930 to process copper from the Boliden ore, a Paleo-proterozoic sulphide deposit in the so-called ‘Skellefte district’ ( Soil profiles (<70-cm deep) were collected along a 100-km pollution gradient from the large Rönnskär smelter ( To reconstruct the temporal changes in the Soil and peat samples were freeze dried prior to analysis. Spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs) were counted in samples digested with hydrogen peroxide to remove organic matter, rinsed several times and then counted using a stereomicroscope (50× magnification) according to the technique described by The annual accumulation rate (A) of mercury, lead and SCP per square meter was calculated as: The results of the analysis of the Vorrmyran peat core are plotted against the cumulative mass of peat to circumvent the effect of compaction ( The net accumulation rates (Eq. The results of the analyses of the mor layer profiles are shown in The profile at 3 In the mor profiles ⩽60 The ombrotrophic peat at Vorrmyran ( Ombrotrophic peat is recognized as a potential archive of atmospheric deposition of mercury ( The calculated atmospheric deposition rate of mercury, lead and SCPs in the peat follows the pollution history of the smelter ( The estimated atmospheric deposition rate around 4 The changing Previous studies of lead concentrations and stable isotopes in peat profiles from southern Sweden as well as herbarium samples of forest mosses from northern Sweden show a common The isotopic trends in the mor profiles from soils situated ⩾80 In contrast to the mor profiles situated ⩾80 Clearly, the local signal of atmospheric deposition from the smelter is preserved in the stratigraphy of the mor to a distance of 12 The mor layer cannot be excepted to be a perfect, conservative archive of atmospheric metal pollution since both mercury and lead is continuously lost to the mineral soil along with organic matter transported downwards in percolating soil–water ( In The age of the atmospheric derived mercury or lead found at the lowest section of the H-layer will always be difficult to determine, since a chronological marker in this part of the mor profile only indicates that metals deposited at the same time as the marker has reached this level and thus gives no information about the potential presence of older atmospheric inputs. It is also reasonable to expect some initial penetration down into the L-layer when these metals are deposited, even though no obvious sign of this process is seen in the mor profiles in The preservation of an atmospheric input chronology in the stratigraphy of the mor suggests that the mor cannot be viewed as a ‘black-box’ consisting of a homogenous mixture of past atmospheric inputs, as commonly assumed when modelling mercury ( We thank Noelia Martı´n Chaves and Barbara Davo for field assistance.
