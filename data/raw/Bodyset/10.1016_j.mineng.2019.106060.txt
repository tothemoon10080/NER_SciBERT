A study on the selective solvent extraction (SX) of Molybdenum (Mo) and Rhenium (Re) from a synthetic pregnant leach solution (PLS) has been carried out using two diluents: kerosene and the ionic liquid (IL) 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsufonyl)imide ([omim][Tf2N]) and two extractants: di(ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and the IL trioctylmethylammonium bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphinate [TOMA][D2EHP].
                  It can be concluded that the D2EHPA extractant in kerosene achieved selective Mo-Re extractions, times was achieved when replacing kerosene with [omim][Tf2N], but this time with low extraction percentages.
                  This work shows how ionic liquids, as extractants or diluents, can improve the selective separations in industrial metal extractions.Molybdenum (Mo) and rhenium (Re) are highly valuable metal ions for industry because their alloys with other metals provide excellent properties such as high resistance to corrosion and elevated temperatures, hardness, weldability and toughness. Additionally, these metals are often used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry ( In common industrial applications, the commercial extractant Alamine 336 is used and it is dissolved in kerosene ( However, to achieve higher extraction percentages two options could be followed. First, hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) could be used as diluents. Besides showing negligible vapor pressure and, therefore, full recyclability that could allow the use of the IL for many extraction-stripping cycles, recent work has demonstrated that ILs improves the distribution ratios compared to the common organic diluents ( Recent work on selective Mo-Re separation can be found in the literature. Joo et al. ( Therefore, in the present paper, two approaches to evaluate selectivity in the SX of Mo(VI) and Re(VII) from a synthetic PLS are presented. First, extraction using the commercial organic extractant D2EHPA diluted in 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsufonyl)imide, [omim][Tf2N], as the diluent and, second, the use of the IL trioctylmethylammonium bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphinate [TOMA][D2EHP] as the extractant diluted in [omim][Tf2N]. Thus, selectivity will be evaluated as a function of industrial parameters such as initial pH, extractant concentration, and aqueous-organic (A/O) ratio. Finally, the SX using kerosene as diluent will be used as reference. For the preparation of the synthetic pregnant leach solution (PLS), both sodium molybdate dihydrate, with a purity higher than 99%, and potassium perrhenate, with a purity higher than 99%, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Iron trichloride hexahydrate, with a purity higher than 99% was obtained from Merck, and copper sulfate pentahydrate, with a purity higher than 98.9%, was purchased from Biopack. Sulfuric acid, with a purity higher than 99.8%, from J.T. Baker, was used to adjust the pH of the PLS. The extracting solution was prepared using bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid with a purity higher than 97% and 1-dodecanol with a purity higher than 98% obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The ionic liquids 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, with a purity higher than 98%, and methyltrioctylammonium chloride, with a purity higher than 97%, were purchased from Iolitec GmbH. Finally, kerosene was kindly provided by Minera Michilla Chile. The ionic liquid trioctylmethylammonium bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphinate was synthetized in our laboratory according to a scheme presented previously ( The synthetic pregnant leach solution (PLS) was prepared by weighing the above mentioned salts and diluted in milliQ water (18.2 MΩ.cm). The initial pH of the PLS was adjusted with a dilute solution of sulfuric acid. At the same time, the extracting solution was prepared by weighing an amount of extractant and diluent that can be either kerosene or [omim][Tf2N]. The liquid-liquid extractions were carried out at 25 °C in an open flask where 2 mL of the aqueous solution was mixed with 2 mL of extracting solution and stirred for 40 min. After this step, the mixture was centrifuged for another 40 min to assure complete phase separation. The pH of the aqueous PLS was monitored using a HANNA HI4212 pH meter with a microelectrode. Finally, the aqueous phase was withdrawn from the vial and the concentration of all remaining metal species in the PLS were quantified by ICP-AES. The liquid-liquid extraction tests were carried out in duplicate. The performance of the liquid-liquid extractions was determined by Eqs.  The first liquid-liquid extraction experiments were carried out using the extractant D2EHPA diluted in kerosene. This is the reference case because this extracting solution is used in industry to extract Mo(VI).  Then, kerosene was replaced by the IL [omim][Tf2N] to study the effect of the diluent on selectivity towards Mo(VI).  Finally, When using 10% (v/v) of the extractant in [omim][Tf2N], the selectivity increases around five times, and it is even higher at higher extractant concentrations, representing a real candidate for the replacement of kerosene in the hydrometallurgical recovery of Mo(VI) from molybdenite.  Previous results indicated that the use of [omim][Tf2N] improved the distribution ratios, especially those of Mo(VII), and therefore, the selectivity was also enhanced. Thus, from the industrial point of view, it is interesting to see the number of equilibrium stages necessary to recover Mo(VI) from the synthetic PLS.  Another important point to mention is that the viscosity of [omim][Tf2N] is 88.6 ± 0.37 mPa·s at 298.15 K ( Although in previous results the extraction percentages and selectivity obtained were promising, especially when using the IL [omim][Tf2N] as the diluent, the amount of solvent was still relatively high, 10% (v/v) in the diluent. With Alamine 336 in kerosene, a slightly higher performance has been obtained than the results of this work ( To understand if there would be selectivity when using this extractant, the extraction stoichiometry should be understood. At very low pH values, this IL extracts acid in a first extraction step ( This first step results in two reaction products: The first stoichiometry has already been demonstrated in a previous report ( In the slope analysis depicted in where one mole of [TOMA][D2EHP] extracts one mole of Re(VII). This result confirms the extraction of this last metal ion according to Eq. Although this IL could extract these metal species using low amounts of extractant, the analysis of these stoichiometries shows poor selectivity because both metal species will be extracted. However, as already noted, to extract Mo(VI) with D2EHPA, large amounts of extractant were needed, and on the other hand, one mole of In Another observation is that in It is worth noting that a selective extraction could be achieved by the use of another IL extractant according to the stoichiometry presented in Eqs. Finally, it is important to say that, after the extraction, the stripping of the metal species from the diluent is required. Previous works indicated that a solution of ammonium carbonate would be necessary the recover either Mo(VI) or Re(VII) back to the aqueous phase ( In this paper the selective extraction of Mo(VI) and Re(VII) from a low pH synthetic leach liquor was studied. Extractions with the commercial extractant D2EHPA in either kerosene or [omim][Tf2N] were performed where selective Mo-Re separations were achieved using kerosene as the diluent. Replacing kerosene with [omim][Tf2N] selectivity increases around five times at 10% (v/v) of the extractant. Three equilibrium stages were needed to achieve highly pure Mo(VI) from the synthetic PLS and a reduction in the diluent volume was observed when using [omim][Tf2N]. On the other hand, when using ionic liquid [TOMA][D2EHP] for the extractions, about 10 times less extractant was required to achieve high extraction percentages, but with poor Mo-Re selectivity. However, when using [TOMA][D2EHP] in [omim][Tf2N] a great increase in selectivity, around five times, was achieved, especially at low extractant concentrations. This study opens the possibility for selective Mo-Re separation in industry and also shows that ionic liquids are not only non-volatile, but are solvents that improve the separation performance in solvent extraction processes.
