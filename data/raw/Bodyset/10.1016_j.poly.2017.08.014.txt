N,N′-diisobutyloxycarbonyl-N″,N‴-(1,3-propylene)-bisthiourea (L) and its silver(I) and gold(I) complexes were designed and synthesized. Treatment of 1,3-propanediamine with the isothiocyanate iPrCH2OC(O)NCS yielded bisthiourea L with over 90% yield. Treatment of L with AgNO3 in CH3CN afforded coordination polymer {[Ag(L)(NO3)·CH3CN]}

Ligand L and complexes 1 and 2 were fully characterized by IR, 1H NMR, UV–Vis, cyclic voltammetry and element analysis. The X-ray diffraction analysis displays that the bisthiourea L behaves as sulfur donor to coordinate to Ag and Au atom with μ3-(S, μ2-S′,S′) and μ2-S, S′ coordination mode in 1 and 2, respectively.N,N′-disubstiuted thiourea, as valuable industrial material and organic intermediate, has expanded significantly due to its potential applications in metallurgical industry and medical field Solvents were purified, distilled and degassed prior to use.
