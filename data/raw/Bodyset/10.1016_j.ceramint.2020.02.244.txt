W2B5 powder was synthesized by the reaction between WO3 and amorphous B in NaCl/KCl flux. The results indicate that appropriate amount of NaCl/KCl flux significantly improved the completion of borothermal reduction reaction. When the weight of NaCl/KCl was 10 times that of WO3/B, pure phase W2B5 powder could be obtained at 1100 °C. The synthesized powder was composed of agglomerated nanosized particles. The oxidation resistance of the synthesized W2B5 powder was evaluated by a simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry technique.Transition metal borides are a class of refractory materials with excellent structural and functional characteristics, such as high melting point, high strength and hardness, outstanding thermal shock & oxidation resistance, and good electrical & thermal conductivity [ Recently, W Among the large family of transition metal borides, pure tungsten borides are more difficult to be synthesized because there are at least seven compounds in W–B system: W Herein, we report the synthesis of W Tungsten trioxide (WO Phases of the sample were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV, Rigaku Co., Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation ( W  The borothermal reduction of WO With the addition of NaCl/KCl flux during the borothermal reduction, NaCl/KCl served as a diluter and reduced the adiabatic temperature from 2369.8 °C (R = 0) to 1361.3 °C (R = 5) and 907.9 °C (R = 10), respectively. In this situation, SHS could not be activated. Moreover, a liquid circumstance was provided and the mass transfer was accelerated by the convection and diffusion [   The oxidation resistance of the synthesized W Because there are many compounds in W–B system, it is very difficult to synthesize pure phase tungsten boride powders.
