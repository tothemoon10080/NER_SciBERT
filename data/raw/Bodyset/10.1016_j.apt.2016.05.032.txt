Dry beneficiation of fine coal of +150–500μm in size was conducted using density-segregation in a gas–solid fluidized bed without any separation media. The coal particles in a cylindrical column (inner diameter=100mm and bed height=100mm) were fluidized at a given air velocity u
                     0/u
                     mf
                     =1.3–3.0 for thirty minutes where u
                     0 and u
                     mf are the superficial air velocity and the minimum fluidization air velocity, respectively. The bulk density of the coal particles in each layer 10mm in height (ten layers in total) was measured after the fluidization to investigate the segregation. It was found that the maximum segregation is produced at u
                     0/u
                     mf
                     =2.0; the segregation is less pronounced at smaller and larger air velocities investigated. The origin of the dependence of the segregation on the air velocity is related to the velocity relative to the minimum fluidization velocity, the size of the air bubbles moving up through the fluidized bed, particle movement and vertical mixing. The calorific value and ash content of the ten layers before and after the segregation were estimated by fitting the dependence of calorific value and ash content on the bulk density. If the top 7 layers after segregation are regarded as the product (70% yield), the calorific value is increased from 5063kcal/kg to 6067kcal/kg and the ash content is decreased from 34.0wt% to 22.4wt% at u
                     0/u
                     mf
                     =2.0, indicating that fine coal can be upgraded by the dry separation. The combustible recovery and ash reduction resulting from the segregation indicate that the upgrade is mainly caused by rejecting ash into the lower 8th to 10th layers.Gas–solid fluidized beds are a useful powder technology that can be applied to many industrial fields such as catalytic processes, thermal processes, drying, mixing and others because of the effective liquid-like property, high heat transfer rate and high mass transfer rate of the fluidized bed One of the reliable candidates for dry separation is the use of a gas–solid fluidized bed. An object placed on the top surface of a fluidized bed floats or sinks in it depending on the density of the object relative to the fluidized bed, so the fluidized particles can be utilized as the dense separation media. The dry float–sink separation has been applied to beneficiation of coal Density-segregation in a gas–solid fluidized bed of the material to be separated without use a dense medium is also used for dry separation. When a mixture of particles is fluidized without the separation media, lighter particles move up and heavier particles move down in the fluidized bed. Many researchers investigated the fundamentals of segregation in a fluidized bed Typical run-of-mine coarse coal, supplied by a Japanese mining company (Kushiro Coal Mine Co., Ltd.), was crushed using a jaw crusher. The fine coal of +150–500 The apparatus used previously The coal particles were put into the column to a depth of 100 From the view point of coal beneficiation, calorific value and ash content were also used to evaluate the segregation efficiency. The layered coal particles were chosen at random after the segregation experiments for the measurements of calorific value   Since the origin of the segregation-dependence on the air velocity was discussed in the previous literature As shown in The beneficiation of fine coal of +150–500 This study was supported by
