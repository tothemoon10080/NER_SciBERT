A theoretical energy–size reduction relationship is derived for tumbling ball mills based on a solution of the integro-differential equation of comminution kinetics, in which the proportional relationship is applied between the grinding rate constant and the net mill power. The derived formula is similar to an empirical energy law, dW ∝dx

                      is the particle size of product and the exponent i is shown to be a variable depending upon the ground material, the type of mill and the method to measure energy. Derived results are confirmed with reported data in reasonable agreement. Also, the Bond's energy law is examined and a method for the correction of the Bond work index is discussed.When designing mills, two relationships are normally used; one is between mill size and mill power drawn and the other is between energy input and fineness of ground material. The former has been investigated experimentally and theoretically In a previous paper As far as the energy–size reduction relationships are concerned, laws of Rittinger, Kick and Bond are notable. They are encompassed in a differential equation Of the three laws, the Bond's law called the Third Theory However, it is the fact that unreliability may exist in the Third Theory, particularly in the tendency of the Bond work index In 1957, Charles Based on a modified form of Kick's law, Holmes Charles Although the Holmes and Charles studies have clearly demonstrated that the exponent In Work or energy input to a machine is consumed in various ways e.g., motion and collisions of balls and material, breakage of material, machine friction, wear of machine parts and balls and so on. Here, two energies are considered, net and gross energies. The net energy is defined as energy consumed only by the mill charge composed of balls and material. It excludes energy dissipated in the power transmission elements such as mill bearings and gear pinion due to mechanical friction. The gross energy is defined as energy consumed not only by the mill charge but also by the power transmission elements and sometimes it includes energy consumed by classifiers attached One way to express the fineness of material is the mass fraction passing a reference size For batch grinding, the following equation is assumed to describe the size distribution history of ground material (see Concerning the rate constant Consider the size reduction in a batch mill from a value of Suppose two mill systems exhibit the same net grinding energy. Their gross energies measured may be different, as the gross energy depends on the type of the mill system and the way of measuring energy. It is very difficult to express The test procedure of the ball mill grindability One possible reason for this difference is due to the difference in the energy input, whether it is gross or net. The ones reported by Bond Eliminating Consequently, the present analysis has derived Eqs. Firstly, Eq. Next, Eq. As seen in In addition, Agar As already shown in Holmes The present study has derived a theoretical energy–size reduction relationship based upon the comminution kinetics. Consequently, the following items are elucidated. An empirical power law between energy input and size reduced is valid. The exponent of the energy–size reduction relationship The derived result has indicated the dependence of the product size on the Bond work index. In the use of the Third Theory, a theoretical background for the correction of the work index has been described. Quantitative confirmation of the theory with experiment is not fully made at present mainly because data associated with material strength properties are scanty. Also, the present analysis is made for batch grinding and plug flow is postulated, whereas size reduction in a continuous grinding is more or less affected by the flow or mixing behaviors of ground material in the mill. Clarifying such phenomena should be made in the near future based on the present treatment towards establishment of a sound theoretical procedure to design mills.  mass fraction undersize x obtained from primary breakage of size y (−). circulating load (−). constant defined by Eq. mass fraction passing x at time t (−). mass fraction passing mass fraction passing mass feed rate (kg ball mill grindability (kg exponent of energy–size reduction relationship (−). grinding rate constant (m proportionality constant (kg mass hold up of powder in closed circuit grinding (kg). mass of powder charged in batch grinding (kg). distribution factor of Gaudin–Schuhmann equation (−). number rate of mill revolution (s distribution factor of Rosin–Rammler equation (−). net mill power (J function of x (−). constant defined in Eq. exponent of Holmes energy–size reduction relationship (−). selection function (s time variable (s). apparent residence time in closed-circuit (s). gross work per unit mass of material for grinding (J gross work per unit mass of material to reduce from Bond work index (J Bond work index with respect to feed (J Holmes work index (J Bond work index with respect to product (J gross work per unit mass of material to reduce from infinite size to net work required per unit mass of material (J net work per unit mass of material to reduce theoretically derived net work index (J net work per unit mass of material to reduce from infinite size to particle size (m). particle size passing 100% of product (mesh size tested) (m). size modulus of Gaudin–Schuhmann type of size distribution (m). particle size passing 80% of feed (m). particle size passing 80% of product (m). particle size representing fineness of assembly (m). function of x (−). The size distribution history of ground material occurred in a batch mill is described by an integro-differential equation derived from the population balance using two probability functions Although no analytical solutions of Eq. With respect to the selection function, our previous work The Rosin–Rammler equation is rewritten as follows. Assuming The ball mill grindability After a certain mill revolutions in batch grinding, the material is screened at a certain mesh size (below 28 mesh). Only the oversize is returned to the mill and fresh feed (under 6 mesh) is added to bring its weight back to that of the original charge. Adjusting the number of mill revolution to produce a 250% circulating load, the grinding and screening cycles are continued until the net mass of the sieve undersize per mill revolution, being The test procedure simulates continuous operation in a closed circuit with an outer sieve. Then, Theoretically, simplifications for the test procedure are made that the mill is plug flow due to batch grinding and the screening with a sieve allows an ideal (clean-cut) classification. For a closed circuit plug flow mill with a clean-cut classifier, the product size distribution has been derived by Furuya et al.
