This study investigates the impact-based pulverisation of dried and screened Norway spruce (Picea abies) sawdust into a median particle size range of less than 100μm in an oscillatory ball mill. Pulverisation is studied by considering the effects of impact energy, the number of impact events and the amount of feed on the size and shape properties of the pulverised wood. The impact energy is treated as the kinetic energy of the grinding ball and the impact event is considered as a period during which the grinding ball travels from one end-wall of the grinding jar to the other. Given a certain number of impact events, the use of higher impact energy lowers the particle sizes of the wood particles until a minimum size is attained. The minimum value for the median particle size is found between 13μm and 20μm. In the pulverisation, the aspect ratios of the wood particles decrease with the use of a higher impact energy and larger number of end-wall collisions. Within a certain range, the changes in the size and shape properties can be predicted from the total impact energy available for the pulverisation when the energy efficiency of the pulverisation remains constant. The energy efficiency of the pulverisation process can be affected by varying the amount of the feed. The pulverisation of dried Norway spruce sawdust from a median size range of 1mm and 2mm down to a median size below 100μm is accomplished with the specific energy consumption of 0.36kJ/g (100kWh/t); reduction to a median size below 20μm is accomplished with the specific energy consumption of 1.4kJ/g (380kWh/t).Research of different applications considering fine or very fine wood powders has grown larger during recent decades. Wood powders or small fibres have been studied in the concepts of thermoplastics, pyrolysis, gasification, hot water treatment and wood powder burners Pulverisation of wood down to a size range below 100 Stress type, stress intensity and number of stress events are the main processing factors that affect the comminution phenomena along with the material properties In this research, the pulverisation of dried and screened Norway spruce ( An oscillatory ball mill is a vibrating ball mill that oscillates in a horizontal direction. Because there are no oscillations in the vertical direction, a two-dimensional view of the main part of an oscillatory ball mill can be considered in the xy-plane (Cartesian coordinate system) containing the arm and the grinding jar ( The oscillatory motion of the grinding jar influences the motion of a grinding ball inside the grinding jar. Chen et al. During the period During the period The period By applying a coordinate system that follows the movement of the grinding jar (see The impact energy During one end-wall collision period, a part of the impact energy Generally, the stress number (SN) has been evaluated as a value which considers how many stress events have occurred during the comminution process, but this study considers how many end-wall collision periods SN To gain information about the grinding efficiency, the total available impact energy can be divided by the mass of the material under grinding The raw material used in this study was Norway spruce ( Pulverisation experiments were carried out with a CryoMill (Retsch, Germany) oscillatory ball mill. Two different grinding balls made from stainless steel (diameter of 25.0 In the case of the setups A–E, the produced wood powder was diluted with deionised water to 0.2% consistency by weight. For the setups F and G, 1 The volumetric particle size distributions of the ground products were measured using the laser diffraction method (Beckmann Coulter LS 13320). The maximum size that can be measured with this technique is 2 The projected area‐based aspect ratio distribution of the powders produced with the setups A–D (see The minimum aspect ratio value (=    The size-reduction behaviour in an oscillatory ball mill operated in impact mode is best described with the Rittinger's model The inverse values of median sizes as a function of total available energy for the setups D–G are shown in  Generally, the energy consumption of the grinding devices accounts for several other energy losses in addition to the energy used in the comminution process, whereas the estimated SEC in this study considers only the impact energy available for the comminution events. On the other hand, the theoretical energy needed for the generation of new surfaces per mass can be considered lower than the estimated SEC. Only in the ideal case, where all available impact energies in the process are applied for the generation of a new surfaces, the estimated SEC is the same as the theoretical energy needed for the generation of the new surface area per mass. This kind of ideal situation never exists in the practical comminution and therefore the estimated SEC is always higher than the theoretical energy needed for the generation of the new surfaces. Because the estimated SEC provides better practical value for the energy consumption than what can be gained by calculating the theoretical energy for the generation of new surfaces it can be considered as a practical target for the optimisation of impact based mills involving grinding media.
