The influence of the partial substitution of Si by Ge (6 at.%) on the structure, crystallization kinetics and magnetic properties of Finemet-type alloys were studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and room-temperature hysteresis loops measurements. Amorphous ribbons were heat treated at different temperatures for 1 h in a vacuum furnace to induce nanocrystallization. It was found that a homogeneous structure of α-Fe3Si structure nanocrystals with a grain size less than 15 nm embedded in an amorphous matrix was obtained within the temperature range of 510–590 °C. The crystallization activation energies calculated using Kissinger model were 331 and 356 kJ/mol for the first and the second crystallizations, respectively. The saturation magnetization of the as-quenched amorphous ribbon is 138 Am2/kg and decreases gradually with the increase of annealing temperatures from 125 Am2/kg for 510 °C to 115 Am2/kg for 590 °C.Fe-based nanocrystalline alloy, with the typical composition of Fe The influence of the addition of Ge to Finemet-type alloy was thoroughly studied in the past years The master alloy ingot of amorphous Fe  The typical DSC spectra obtained from as as-quenched ribbons during continuous heating at different heating rates from 5 to 20 °C/min are shown in It is important to know the activation energy of the crystallization process. The activation energy generally defined as the threshold value of energy above which the energy fluctuation is sufficient for the elementary reaction to occur, and it should have a characteristic constant value for each particular reaction. The activation energy can be obtained from the DSC results using Kissinger equation  The influence of the partial substitution of Si by Ge (6 at.%) on the structure, crystallization kinetics and magnetic properties of Finemet-type alloys has been studied. Amorphous ribbons prepared by the standard single copper wheel melt spinning technique in the atmosphere were heat treated at different temperatures for 1 This work was funded by the
