This study investigated the growth and survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on minced and whole pieces of bison meat. Growth curves of native microflora, including Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were also generated. A marked E. coli O157:H7 strain was inoculated onto minced and whole pieces of bison meat at an initial level of 1.5log10
                     cfug−1. The inoculated meat was stored at either 5°C for 28 days or 10°C for 21 days. Survival, but no growth, of E. coli O157:H7 was observed on both forms of bison meat stored at 5°C, while significant growth of the organism was observed at 10°C. E. coli O157:H7 counts on whole pieces were generally higher than counts observed on minced bison meat, and reached their highest population by 14 days, with a total increase of 3.36log10
                     cfug−1 on whole pieces and 2.12log10
                     cfu g−1on minced bison meat stored at 10°C. Under the same storage temperature, Pseudomonas spp. and total counts displayed similar growth patterns on both pieces and minced bison meat, while the Enterobacteriaceae showed a slower growth rate. This study showed that the growth of E. coli O157:H7 on bison meat is similar to that observed in studies of beef. Bison meat is a low-fat, low-cholesterol and high-protein meat species ( To predict the growth and survival of So far, little information is known about the growth of  Bison striploins ( The protein and fat content of the meat were determined by the nutrition lab in NDSU's Department of Animal and Range Sciences using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists ( Samples of bison meat from each replicate were screened for the presence of naturally occurring The derived double antibiotic-resistant Bison meat pieces were inoculated by immersion in 500 At each sampling time (day 0, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for meat stored at 5 Elements of the spoilage flora were enumerated (as described above) by plating out the homogenate or serial dilutions in duplicate on the following media. The pH of the meat was also determined at each sampling interval. Briefly, a 1.0 Six independent replicates of the experiment were carried out, and each replicate examined two types of meat (pieces and minced) at each of two temperatures (5 In the present study, At 10  Under both storage temperatures, the population of total counts and A different growth pattern was observed for the Under both temperatures, only slight growth of the Nutrient analysis of the meat showed that the protein content of the bison meat samples tested ranged from 22.03% to 23.17%; the fat levels in the samples ranged from 1.48% to 2.88%. The initial pH values of bison meat ranged from 5.63 to 5.72. Within the first 4 days storage, only slight changes were observed, as the pH value ranged from 5.65 to 5.92. After 7 days, the pH value on meat stored at both temperatures increased rapidly. By day 21, the final sampling day for 10 Survival, but not growth, of Significant In the present study, it was noted that The initial pH value of bison samples ranged from 5.63 to 5.72, similar to that of beef reported in other studies ( Many studies have demonstrated that background flora can inhibit the growth of In the present study, The initial level of total bacteria counts, In summary, the growth and survival of The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the USDA CSREES NRICGP Grant #2002-35207-11574, and North Dakota State University Doctoral Fellowships fund for Qiongzhen Li.
