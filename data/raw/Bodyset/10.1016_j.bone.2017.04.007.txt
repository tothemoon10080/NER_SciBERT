Osteopontin (OPN) belongs to the SIBLING family (Small, Integrin-Binding LIgand N-linked Glycoproteins) of mineral-binding matrix proteins found in bones and teeth. OPN is a well-known inhibitor of matrix mineralization, and enzymatic modification of OPN can affect this inhibitory function. In bone, OPN exists both as a monomer and as a high-molecular-weight polymer – the latter is formed by transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking of glutamine and lysine residues in OPN to create homotypic protein assemblies. OPN can be covalently crosslinked by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and Factor XIII-A. Polymeric OPN has increased binding to collagen and promotes osteoblast adhesion, but despite these initial observations, its role in mineralization is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of polymerized OPN on mineralization using a hydroxyapatite crystal growth assay and mineralizing MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures. In the cultures, endogenous polymeric OPN was detected after mineralization occurred. In cell-free conditions, TG2 was used to crosslink bovine OPN into its polymeric form, and atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering revealed variably-sized, large branched aggregates ranging across hundreds of nanometers. These OPN polymers inhibited the growth of hydroxyapatite crystals in solution at concentrations similar to monomeric OPN, although the crosslinking slightly reduced its inhibitory potency. When added to MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures, this exogenous polymeric OPN essentially did not inhibit mineralization when given during the later mineralization stages of culture; however, cultures treated early and then continuously with polymeric OPN throughout both the matrix assembly and mineral deposition stages showed reduced mineralization. Immunoblotting of protein extracts from these continuously treated cultures revealed exogenous OPN polymers incorporated into mature matrix that had not yet mineralized. These results suggest that in bone, the increased size and branched structure of crosslinked inhibitory polymeric OPN near the mineralization front could hinder it from accessing focal mineralization sites in the dense collagen-rich matrix, suggesting that OPN-crosslinking into polymers may represent a way to fine-tune the inhibitory potency of OPN on bone mineralization.Osteopontin (OPN) is a well-known extracellular matrix protein belonging to the SIBLING subfamily (Small, Integrin-Binding LIgand N-linked Glycoprotein) of secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins Transglutaminases (TGs) are a family of nine known proteins that include TG1–7, Factor XIII-A and the catalytically inactive member erythrocyte band 4.2 TG2 catalyzes the intra- and/or intermolecular crosslinking of OPN at two major reactive glutamine residues (Gln50 and Gln52 in bovine OPN), and these residues are conserved across all mammalian OPN sequences While TG2-mediated crosslinking of OPN is able to substantially modify the functions of OPN, the effect of this on mineralization is not yet known. It has been postulated that the stabilization of extracellular matrix proteins can predispose matrix for mineralization, and that crosslinking of calcium-binding matrix proteins can create a clustering of anionic surface charge that promotes apatitic crystal nucleation and growth Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA), unless otherwise stated. MC3T3-E1 (subclone 14) pre-osteoblast cell cultures – a generous gift from Dr. R.T. Franceschi (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) – were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SH30396.02, Lot# AAF204951, Hyclone, Waltham, MA, USA), 0.225 Total matrix and cellular proteins were harvested from MC3T3-E1 mineralized cultures by washing cultures twice with phosphate-buffered saline before collecting the cell (and matrix) layer in 10 Purified bovine milk-derived OPN was kindly provided Dr. E.S. Sørensen (University of Aarhus, Denmark, and Arla Foods, Viby, Denmark) Monomeric and polymeric forms of OPN were visualized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). For this experiment, protein was adsorbed onto freshly cleaved muscovite mica substrates (1 Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed using a Protein Solutions DynaPro MSXTC DLS instrument equipped with Dynamics V6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The instrument used a semiconductor diode laser emitting at Solutions of 16 MC3T3-E1 osteoblast culture mineralization was detected by von Kossa staining and measured by calcium quantification of dissolved mineral from the samples. Von Kossa staining was performed by washing the cell layer with phosphate-buffered saline, fixing the cultures in 95% ethanol for 10 MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells were cultured on microtiter plates and cell proliferation was measured on days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 of culture. Cells were incubated with culture media containing 0.25 Osteoblast cultures were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with Bouin's fluid (70% saturated aqueous picric acid/9.25% formaldehyde/5% glacial acetic acid) for 1 Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested on ice in 10 RNA was extracted from mineralizing MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures using TRIzol® RNA Isolation reagent, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA preparations were treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and first-strand cDNA was generated using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Gene expression was analyzed with Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase using the following primer sequences: Statistical analyses of samples were compared by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and The major objective of this study was to investigate the effect of TG2-crosslinked OPN polymers on mineralization in osteoblast cultures, as well as measuring their inhibitory potential in a hydroxyapatite crystal growth assay. We first simply determined whether polymeric OPN was produced endogenously TG2-crosslinked OPN polymers have been previously characterized as a heterogeneous mixture of large-molecular-weight molecules having increased secondary structure conferred by the covalent crosslinking To study the direct effect of OPN monomers and polymers on the calcium-phosphate (apatitic) crystals that form in bone and in the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures, a cell-free crystal growth assay was developed to assess the effects of inhibitors on hydroxyapatite mineralization Previously we showed that monomeric OPN is a potent inhibitor of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell culture mineralization, when cell cultures were treated with OPN during their mineralization stage occurring at days 6–12 of culture For these mineralization experiments, osteoblast cell cultures were treated with 33.75 Since the crystal growth assay revealed that monomeric OPN was a slightly stronger mineralization inhibitor than polymeric OPN ( OPN in its monomeric state is a well-studied, potent inhibitor of mineralization that is abundant at sites of normal and pathologic mineralization. Crosslinked OPN polymers with high molecular weights are also abundantly found in demineralized fractions of bone extracts, and from extracts of pathologically mineralized arteries (from matrix gla protein-deficient mice), suggesting a role for polymeric OPN in regulating mineralization OPN has been previously characterized to be highly acidic, highly phosphorylated, and intrinsically disordered – properties of OPN integral to its function as a potent inhibitor of calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, and hydroxyapatite growth and formation The initial hypothesis for the role of TG-mediated crosslinking of calcium-binding matrix proteins in bone was linked to promotion of mineralization. It was postulated that the process may create anionic-dense regions that promote crystal nucleation and growth Despite observing strong inhibition of hydroxyapatite crystal growth by polymeric OPN in our crystal growth assay, and despite showing inhibition of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast culture mineralization after treatment with monomeric OPN Given the large sizes of exogenously added OPN polymer – with an average hydrodynamic radius In addition to having effects on mineralization between collagen fibrils, crosslinked OPN may also have implications related to intrafibrillar collagen mineralization, where monomeric OPN has been shown to promote mineral formation Although continuous treatment with polymeric OPN during all days 0–12 was able to reduce osteoblast culture mineralization, it was unable to completely inhibit mineralization at the same weight concentrations as monomeric OPN. AFM of polymeric OPN revealed large protein structures, but fewer net individual molecules than the monomeric OPN preparations, indicating that polymeric OPN would have a lower molarity (relative to an equal weight of monomeric OPN). A limitation of this study is that the polymers analyzed were highly heterogeneous in size, making it difficult to quantify an exact molarity; however, this heterogeneity is real OPN polymers have been isolated from both physiologic and pathologic sites of mineralization, yet the role of polymeric OPN at these sites is not fully understood Despite studies showing OPN as a potent inhibitor of mineralization We conclude that the polymeric form of OPN remains inhibitory to mineralization after TG2-mediated, covalent crosslinking. However, compared to monomeric OPN, polymeric OPN has a reduced inhibitory effect on hydroxyapatite crystal formation and growth, and on osteoblast cell culture mineralization. This reduced effect in the cultures may be attributable to an increase in secondary structure and an inability of the OPN polymers to fully permeate through the assembled (mature) matrix, an interpretation which necessarily postulates that OPN polymers in bone osteoid All authors state they have no conflict of interest.
