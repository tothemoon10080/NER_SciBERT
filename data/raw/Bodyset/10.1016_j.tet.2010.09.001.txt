The β-aryl–β-silyl and β,β-disilyl propionates have been synthesized from cinnamates and β-silyl acrylates by a regiospecific reductive C-silylation using Mg/silyl chloride/DMF system at room temperature. These reductive C-silylation conditions have also been applied to δ-aryl substituted dienoates wherein silylation took place at the δ-position leading to the synthesis of single regioisomeric allylsilanes with very high stereoselectivity.The unique properties of silicon Carbonyl compounds having a silyl group at β-position are popular targets because of their versatile nature Reductive silylation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds is known to be mediated by metals, notably by lithium, Prior to work with β-dimethyl(aryl)silylacrylates, we decided to find out suitable conditions for the reductive silylation of ethyl cinnamate as it is known As mentioned earlier, suitable substituents on silicon, especially aryl groups make the silyl group as a masked hydroxyl group. To generalize the Mg/TMSCl/DMF system for efficient reductive C-silylation at the β-position of ethyl cinnamates, reductive silylation with PhMe We next turned our attention to know the fate of β-silyl acrylates under these optimized reductive silylation conditions using Mg/chlorosilane/DMF system at 30 The reductive β C-silylation of cinnamate can occur by two pathways. The silyl chloride can react with magnesium metal to give intermediate silyl Grignard species, which then undergo 1,4-addition to cinnamate We turned our attention to study this reductive silylation on dienic esters because these substrates can react in different modes to produce regio-isomeric In conclusion, we have successfully developed a Mg/silyl chloride/DMF system for the reductive C-silylation at the β-position of β-aryl and β-silyl substituted enoates with very good yields. The C-silylation selectivity was very high over the reductive dimerization or the simple double bond reduction. The reductive silylation conditions are applicable to δ-aryl substituted dienoates wherein silylation took place at the δ-position leading to the synthesis of allylsilanes as single regioisomer and with very high stereoselectivity. The β-aryl–β-silyl and β,β-disilyl propionates can be considered as a ester homoenolate because tetrabutylammonium triphenyldifluorosilicate DMF was dried over CaH  Freshly distilled TMSCl (3.8 Yield 75%, colorless liquid; Yield 75%, colorless liquid; Yield 80%, colorless liquid; Yield 89%, colorless liquid; Yield 85%, colorless liquid; Yield 70%; colorless liquid; Yield 71%; colorless liquid; Yield 81%; colorless liquid; Yield 79%; colorless liquid; Yield 70%; colorless liquid; Yield 71%; colorless liquid; Yield 70%; colorless liquid; Yield 70%; colorless liquid; Yield 72%; colorless liquid; Yield 72%; colorless liquid; contains 14% of (3 Yield 70%; colorless liquid; contains 19% of (3  The following ZIP file contains the MOL files of the most important compounds referred to in this article.
