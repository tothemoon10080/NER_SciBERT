Nowadays the demand for hydroponically culturing techniques are increasing day by day. The quality and quantity of nutrients transferred through water for the plants is the most important factor in hydroponic cultivations systems. In this study, it was targeted to recruit the essential elements from organic materials. For this purpose, some of the bacteria which can fixate nitrogen and solve phosphate were used to provide nitrogen and phosphorous elements needed by the plants with processing organic matters found in the compost. Necessity of potassium of the seedlings was achieved by wood ashes. For this purpose, the compost samples were enriched by above mentioned microorganisms. Nitrate and phosphate ions increase in the compost specimens which are prepared in the enriched manner were followed up potentiometrically with the use of a lab developed nitrate-selective sensor and spectrophotometrically respectively for 20 days. When the result of crop raising study evaluated; it was shown that tomato crops that were nourished with microorganismsâ€™ added compost displayed considerably good growing. Consequently, increment in biomass production occurred without usage of any chemical supplement. In contrast, crops which were fed by conventional hydroponic solution exhibited a slow growth. The results suggest that the proposed method which contains processing of compost by nitrogen fixating bacteria, phosphate solubilizing bacteria and adding directly into the hydroponic solution is practical and appropriate.
