The present pilot scale study addresses the direct flotation route for the concentration of a phosphate ore bearing a silicate-carbonate gangue. The target was to selectively separate apatite from a phosphate ore bearing silicate/carbonate gangue using flotation columns. Based on the results of a previous laboratory scale investigation, a reagents scheme was selected and tested, using, under alkaline conditions, corn starch and a natural collector extracted from the distillation of coconut oil. An open rougher-cleaner circuit yielded a final concentrate reaching 30.5% P2O5 grade, at 80.8% recovery level.
