The Donggou Mo deposit in the eastern Qinling area, China, is a giant porphyry system discovered based on a targeting concept by using the tectonic model for collisional orogeny, metallogeny and fluid flow (CMF model). Mo mineralization is associated with the Donggou aluminous A-type granite porphyry and was formed during the Early Cretaceous in a tectonic regime of continental extension. The orebodies mainly occur as numerous veinlets in the host-rocks. Hydrothermal ore-forming processes include at least three stages, characterized by veinlets of (1) quartz+K-feldspar+minor molybdenite, (2) quartz+molybdenite±beryl and (3) quartz+carbonate+fluorite.
                  Three types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are distinguished in quartz and beryl in stages 1 and 2, i.e., aqueous (W-type), carbonic–aqueous (C-type) and solid-bearing (S-type), with only aqueous FIs observed in stage 3 minerals. S-type FIs contain variable daughter minerals including halite, chalcopyrite, calcite and an unidentified transparent crystal, but only halite can dissolve during heating. Halite-bearing S-type FIs are mainly homogenized by halite dissolution at 182–416°C, corresponding to salinities of 30.9–49.2wt.% NaCl equiv.; minor halite-bearing S-type FIs are homogenized to liquid at 190–360°C via vapor disappearance, with salinities of 29.1–36.2wt.% NaCl equiv. Other FIs in minerals of stages 1, 2 and 3 are homogenized at temperatures of 341–550°C, 220–440°C and 125–225°C, with salinities of 8.0–18.3, 5.3–16.8 and 0.5–7.3wt.% NaCl equiv., respectively. The estimated minimum trapping pressures are up to 141MPa in stage 1 and up to 81MPa in stage 2, respectively, corresponding to an initial mineralization depth of no less than 5km. The quartz in veinlets yields δ18O values of 8.5–10.0‰, corresponding to δ18OH2O values of −2.9 to 5.9‰, while the δDH2O values of fluid inclusions range from −59 to −82‰. These data suggest that the ore fluids forming the Donggou deposit changed from high-temperature, high-salinity, CO2-rich magmatic to low-temperature, low-salinity and CO2-poor meteoritic fluids via boiling and mixing, resembling those of other magmatic–hydrothermal systems in Qinling Orogen and Dabie Shan. This supports the notion that the porphyry systems generated in a post-collisional tectonic setting were initially CO2-rich, as indicated by abundant C-type and CO2-bearing S-type fluid inclusions.The Qinling Orogen in China, suturing the Yangtze and Sino-Korea cratonic blocks ( The eastern Qinling molybdenum belt (EQMB; The Donggou giant porphyry Mo deposit is located in Ruyang County, Henan Province, and is the largest Mo deposit found over the last decade in EQMB, with a proven reserve of 0.71 The Donggou deposit is well known in China for its huge reserve and unique characteristics, but geological studies are scarce and not published in English. Previous studies focused on the timing of the mineralization and related granitic porphyry ( In this contribution, we report the results obtained from our studies in geology, fluid inclusion and H–O isotope systematics, leading us to discuss the ore genesis, nature of the ore-forming fluids and evolution of the Donggou deposit, and also to compare it with other porphyry systems associated with post-collisional settings. The EQMB is bounded by the Shang–Dan Fault to the south and the San-Bao Fault to the north, comprising of the Precambrian Huaxiong block and the North Qinling Paleozoic accretionary belt, which are separated by the Luanchuan Fault ( The Donggou Mo deposit (No. 21 in The Early Cretaceous granitic batholiths and small-sized stocks, and the Mesoproterozoic quartz monzonites and quartz diorites are two types of intrusions in the area of interest ( The Early Cretaceous Taishanmiao batholith is exposed in an area of 290 The small-sized Early Cretaceous granitic stocks are usually associated with hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, and represented by the Donggou porphyry (see below). The Donggou Mo deposit is associated with the Donggou granite porphyry (also called Bamudi porphyry; The molybdenite separated from the Donggou porphyry Mo deposit yielded Re–Os ages of 114 to 116 The orebody occurs in the outer contact zones or the altered wall-rocks of the porphyry, with only a minor part of the ores within the altered porphyry ( Mineralization occurs as disseminations ( Hydrothermal alteration at the Donggou deposit includes: (1) potassic alteration, shown by the replacement of plagioclase by K-feldspar, and the formation of biotite ( Based on field investigations and petrographic observations, the hydrothermal alteration and mineralization are divided into 3 stages. Stage 1 is characterized by the assemblage K-feldspar Twenty four samples in this study were collected from the open pit and the underground tunnels, including various kinds of veinlets formed in different stages, and then doubly polished into thin sections (< Microthermometric measurements were performed using the Linkam THMSG600 heating–freezing stage and employing standard procedures, in the Fluid Inclusion Laboratory at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS). Stage calibration was carried out at − Phases that are present in individual FIs, including vapor, liquid and daughter minerals, were identified using Laser Raman spectroscopy in the Laboratory of Orogen and Crust Evolution, Peking University. An argon laser with a wave length of 514.5 Salinities of carbonic (CO Detailed petrographic studies are employed to decipher the complex relationships between fluid inclusions and the host minerals, and the chronology of fluid inclusions ( The carbonic–aqueous (C-type) FIs are two-phase (V The aqueous (W-type) FIs are two-phase (liquid and vapor water) NaCl–H The solid-bearing (S-type) inclusions refer to daughter mineral-bearing or multiphase FIs, consisting of one or more daughter minerals, with bubbles usually accounting for 10–40% in volume. They are ellipsoid, elongated, negative quartz crystals with irregular shapes, and 5 to 25 The relative abundances of fluid inclusions were investigated in samples of different stages ( Phases in representative FIs were measured using Laser Raman microspectroscopy to constrain their compositions. The vapor bubbles of the C-type FIs are dominated by CO The majority of S-type inclusions have vapor and liquid phases that are dominated by H The microthermometric data of FIs are summarized in In C-type fluid inclusions, the CO The W-type FIs in stage 1 quartz have vapor bubbles accounting for 30–80 A small number of S1-subtype FIs in quartz of stages 1 and 2 contain 20–55 The subtype S2 FIs contain 5–20 According to partial and total homogenization temperatures, and the ratios of vapor CO As a result of both repetitive fracture propagation and sealing, and reductions in confining pressure consequent upon surface degradation, the pressure of a porphyry fluid system frequently alternates between lithostatic (even supralithostatic) and hydrostatic ( The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes were analyzed in the Stable Isotope Laboratory of Mineral Resources Institute, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, using the Finnigan MAT253 mass spectrometer. Seven quartz samples from veins of different stages were analyzed. Oxygen was liberated from quartz by a reaction with BrF In general, the homogenization temperatures of FIs are lower than their trapping temperatures during crystallization, and consequently, we use the highest homogenization temperatures of FIs in each sample to calculate the δ The halite-bearing fluid inclusions (subtype S2) are generally observed in hydrothermal minerals of the porphyry deposits world-wide ( S2-subtype fluid inclusions are present in the Donggou porphyry Mo. In stage 1, they were all homogenized by mode C, with a wide T Primary FIs in the earliest hydrothermal minerals of a multistage hydrothermal system can well fingerprint the nature and origin of the initial fluids; and the magmatic–hydrothermal deposits generally have abundant S-type FIs ( The above-mentioned features of the ore-forming fluids at the Donggou deposit are common and shared by numerous magmatic–hydrothermal deposits formed in continental settings, which was well addressed in an overview of the magmatic–hydrothermal deposits in China ( As addressed by The porphyry stock at Donggou has a high content of SiO K-feldspathization consumed the heat energy and the activities of alkali ions and OH With the inflow of meteoric water, the fluids gradually became predominantly meteoric, cooled and diluted, as reflected by the absence of C- and S-type FIs in the minerals of stage 3. The stage 3 veinlets are composed of carbonate The orebodies of porphyry deposits are traditionally considered to occur in the causative porphyry stocks that generally originated from partial melting of crust–mantle mixture, subducted oceanic slab and subduction-resulted enriched mantle, and mixing of crust- and mantle-sourced magmas (e.g. Previous studies have classified porphyry Mo deposits into two types ( The Donggou Mo deposit does not fit into any of these two types. The common presence of fluorite suggests an affinity with rift- or Climax-type deposits, but the lower Mo grade and the external occurrence of orebodies remarkably differ from the rift-type. The deposit is located in a continental collision orogen and was formed in a postcollisional tectonism ( The abovementioned characteristics of the Donggou deposit are shared by other porphyry Mo deposits in collisional orogens, such as the porphyry Mo deposits at Qian'echong ( (1) The Donggou Mo deposit is a giant porphyry ore system in the eastern Qinling Mo belt in China. Molybdenum mineralization occurs as numerous veinlets in the altered wall-rocks instead of the causative porphyry stock. The alteration ranges outwardly from potassic and phyllic to propylitic alteration zones with an increasing distance from the intrusion. (2) The hydrothermal mineralization process includes three stages, characterized by K-feldspar (3) As indicated by microthermometric data and estimated minimum trapping pressures of fluid inclusions, as well as the H–O isotope systematics, the ore-forming fluid-system evolved from high-temperature, high-pressure and CO (4) The Donggou porphyry Mo deposit was formed in a continental collision orogen during post-collisional extension. The ore-forming fluids are rich in CO (5) Compared to the majority of porphyry deposits in the world, which are characterized by internal (in-porphyry and contact zones) mineralization, the Donggou deposit is unique for its external (out-porphyry) mineralization.
