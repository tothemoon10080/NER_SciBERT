Insights from the social identity approach can be useful in understanding the drivers of dysfunctional conflict in environmental and natural resources management (ENRM). Such conflicts tend to be shaped by multiple factors including: the governance arrangements that are in place and how deliberations are undertaken; the conduct and interactions of stakeholders and the wider citizenry; and the conflict legacy, which can perpetuate a ‘culture of conflict’ around particular issues. This paper presents an integrative conceptual model of the socio-political landscape of ENRM conflict, which draws these multiple factors together. The social identity approach is then introduced as an appropriate lens through which the drivers of conflict in ENRM can be further interrogated. Key social identity mechanisms are discussed along with their contribution to the proliferation of dysfunctional conflict in ENRM. Based on this analysis, it is found that the social identity approach presents a way to understand the subtle and sometimes invisible social structures which underlie ENRM, and that ENRM issues ought to be viewed as a series of conflict episodes connected across time and contexts by the conflict legacy. The conceptual model, and its interpretation through the social identity approach, raises a number of implications for the current theory, practice and institutions involved in the wicked socio-political landscape of ENRM. These implications are examined, followed by a discussion of some opportunities to address the impact of social identity on dysfunctional conflict drawn from empirical Australian and international examples in the literature.In environmental and natural resources management (ENRM), successful environmental outcomes are recognised as being inextricably linked with social acceptance and engagement ( The breadth of the social identity approach examines group norms and relationships between groups, offering implications for deliberations and decision-making, and insights into how people engage with an issue. As such, the application of the social identity approach to ENRM requires an integration of the core elements of conflict in ENRM: governance, stakeholders, the citizenry, and the conflictual social context. This paper presents a brief review of these elements of ENRM conflict, before presenting an integrative conceptual model for ENRM conflict which is based on four key theoretical perspectives. The conceptual model is then evaluated through the social identity lens, and insights and implications of the conceptual model and the social identity approach are discussed. We explore how this integrative social identity approach presents a way to understand the subtle and sometimes invisible social structures which underlie ENRM conflict, and how this approach opens the way for new ideas for adapting current ENRM practices in order to avoid dysfunctional conflict. Environmental and natural resources management (ENRM) in Australia, and similarly governed nations, functions within the bounds of the socio-political system of This transition from government to governance has been complex. While a greater range of non-traditional voices now have access to ENRM decision-making, the vestiges of traditional government processes have led to what has been described as ‘hybrid governance’ ( Deliberation serves as a process by which decision-making occurs in the ENRM governance system. Deliberation can be centred on specific decisions (e.g., the regulatory framework for minerals extraction), or broader policy agendas (e.g., the priority afforded to environmental protection). The rationale for deliberation is built on expectations for constructive and solutions-focused debate and exchange which negotiate the range of values being represented by the parties involved ( Governance, too, has provided a platform for the institutionalisation of not only civil engagement in decision-making in a general sense but also, more acutely, the embeddedness and professionalisation of particular actors in civil society ( commandeer the decision-making space for non-democratic ends by only pursuing the interests they represent, which may be proportionately smaller than the power they wield ( reinforce the position of particular groups with the power and skills to maintain their position, potentially at the expense of the access of others ( co-opt deliberative processes for the purposes of policy rent seeking with government ( cause a decentralisation of decision-making accountability from a government entity to a tapestry of civil parties, in effect privatising the process and obscuring the link between deliberations and public good outcomes ( Within the bounds of governance in a pluralistic society where interest groups pursue agendas through deliberations, conflict becomes institutionalised as these groups broadcast competing claims to vie for political traction and public acceptance ( The term ‘stakeholder’ is used regularly in the ENRM literature, though the meaning and impact of the term itself are rarely deconstructed and evaluated (with some notable exceptions, e.g., Stakeholder theory has since been adapted from the business context and applied in ENRM ( The literature presents a tendency toward repeated identification of the ‘usual suspects’ ( The reflections from the literature, and in particular these distinctions from The influence of stakeholders on the citizenry both within, and outside, the context of a distinct ENRM issue, can be examined through theoretical approaches to understanding support for social movements. Appreciating the social and systemic factors which contribute to dysfunctional conflict requires a whole-of-system perspective on ENRM. The brief review of governance and stakeholder literature above highlights four key facets which interact to form the socio-political landscape of ENRM: governance; stakeholders; the citizenry; and, the Environmental governance is the institution through which deliberations occur, and decisions are made, in ENRM. Reflecting the complexity of hybrid governance arrangements ( The conduct of, and mode through which, stakeholders, as formally affiliated groups with a collective interest ( The citizenry may represent movement supporters ( The The theoretical bases for these four elements of the ENRM socio-political landscape have been simplified and integrated to present a conceptual model of ENRM conflict ( Based on Construction of the conceptual model for the socio-political landscape of ENRM conflicts presents a helpful framework for interpreting and understanding the wicked interconnectedness of conflict episodes across time and contexts. However, greater depth of understanding of the subtle social dynamics which drive the The social identity approach is a “meta-theoretical perspective” ( In ENRM, some scholars have utilised social identity for understanding the social dimension of ENRM conflicts (e.g., Although there is widespread use and acceptance of the social identity approach, some critiques do exist, related most specifically to the conceptual areas which have not been captured by the theories. Based on a study of the social identity approach, and the work of As ENRM conflicts emerge from agitation among stakeholders and enter As the citizenry becomes aware of emergent ENRM conflicts, the relative standpoints of stakeholder groups present the templates for the citizenry’s own positioning. In this way, when a member of the citizenry interprets an emergent issue through observation of the positions of key stakeholder groups, the individual draws on their past experiences with aligning or opposing stakeholder groups, and will likely self-categorise into the group with which they share some identification ( Following the process of the citizenry engaging in self-categorisation and either becoming a member of a stakeholder group or offering their latent support for a stakeholder group’s agenda, de-categorisation or re-categorisation may occur. At this point, an individual who previously self-categorised into a stakeholder group may de-categorise as their interest in the issue declines (following One of the key social observations which drove development of the theory of social identity was favouritism toward in-groups, and hostility toward out-groups ( Consensus seeking behaviour occurs after an in-group has been established. Due to reinforcement of a shared social identity among group members, critical evaluation is traded off in favour of achieving consensus within the group ( Building accessibility is the process by which experiences in individuals’ life histories shape and reinforce the way future issues will be interpreted. Throughout the process of the citizenry observing inter-stakeholder conflict over an ENRM issue, the prototypical standpoints, values, agendas and conflict between groups become norms ( Perceiver readiness follows from accessibility being built, and is the affective interpretive frame through which individuals appraise future issues ( Following the apparent resolution of an ENRM issue, regardless of the outcome in terms of the stakeholders’ agendas, stakeholder groups continue to exist. This occurs outside the scope of the model of conflict escalation presented by The construction of a conceptual model of the socio-political landscape of ENRM conflict, and its subsequent analysis through the lens of the social identity approach, makes apparent several key processes which improve understanding of conflict and, more significantly, identify the temporally reinforcing nature of ENRM conflict through the The social identity approach to understanding the socio-political landscape of ENRM conflict suggests there may be a certain degree of path dependency in the social institutions of ENRM governance that promote future conflict. However, an understanding of the importance of, and role played by, social identity in ENRM issues may be an important step toward identifying opportunities for alleviating dysfunctional ENRM conflict. For example, in the United States, a seemingly intractable conflict between conservationists and the forestry sector was to some extent overcome by the formation of a new, superordinate identity based on a shared sense of place, and the willingness for cooperation from leadership of previously conflicting groups ( The social identity approach can also serve to provide understanding of the reasons for changing relationships between historically conflictual groups in ENRM. In Australia, during a programme of policy development for water quality in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, traditionally oppositional groups formed an alliance when faced with the threat of regulation from above ( Further, interventions which reframe socio-political contexts and serve as circuit-breakers for the Collaborative approaches to ENRM governance have also been found to yield successes in overcoming dysfunctional conflict. This approach is founded on construction of groups comprised of representatives of the whole range of sectors and interests relevant to the issue. Water policy in both Australia ( Significantly, the institutional processes within which ENRM conflict emerge are not simply organisational practices which can be changed through management intervention, regulation or litigation. These conflictual frames are both cultural and habitual, and changing the New approaches to sustainable development projects may also provide opportunities for alleviating dysfunctional conflict. Current proposals for land use change, for example the development of renewable energy resources, may trigger dysfunctional conflict due to the This paper has presented a conceptual model which integrates multi-disciplinary theoretical perspectives on key elements of dysfunctional conflict in ENRM—governance, stakeholders, the citizenry, and We wish to extend our appreciation to Simone Carr-Cornish and Bruce Taylor, both from The Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), for their constructive and helpful comments on an early draft of this manuscript.
