We propose a new spectral analysis method for accurate JRC determination. To do this, we first propose an average power index Pf to present the amplitude height of a rock joint profile, which considers both the low and high-frequency components of the profile. Secondly, the modified root mean square of the first deviation of the profile (

                     ) is adopted to better capture the effects of shear direction and the inclination angle of the profile on the rock joint's roughness. Finally, we propose a new roughness parameter, PZ, which combines the Pf and the

                     ; the PZ considers the shear direction, the inclination angle and the amplitude height of a rock joint profile simultaneously. We derived correlations with upper, suggested, and lower bounds between JRC and PZ using 102 rock joint profiles at the sampling interval of 0.4 mm, and compared them with Barton's 10 standard rock joint profiles. We analyzed five sandstone joints from the field to validate the proposed method: Both laser scanning and direct shear tests were conducted on the sandstone joints. Comparing the peak shear strength obtained from experimental tests, the proposed method, and the Z
                     2 method, verified that the proposed method can determine the JRC accurately. In addition, the shear direction influence and sampling interval effect on the rock joint roughness were discussed. The correlations between JRC and PZ were also derived at the sampling intervals of 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm.The shear strength of rock joints is a dominant factor determining the engineering stability of a rock mass, because the shear strength of rock joints is significantly lower than that of intact rocks. Among various parameters, such as rock type, stress state, joint roughness and water content, the joint roughness has a significant impact on the shear behavior of rock joints. The joint roughness coefficient (JRC), which was proposed by Barton's In order to obtain an accurate JRC value, the shear direction, the inclination angle and the amplitude height of the asperities in the rock joint profile should be all considered. In order to address those factors, some representative methods have been proposed by researchers. Tse and Cruden The commonly used statistical parameters such as the maximum amplitude height ( The rock joint profile consists of asperities displayed on kinds of scales, including the first -order and second-order. The Fourier transform method has been used successfully to decompose rock joint profiles into various harmonics. A natural rock joint can be regarded as the superposition of a series of simple sine and cosine waves, each having a definite frequency and amplitude. The amplitude height characteristics of a profile distributed in the frequency can be clearly presented with the help of the PSD. Then, the reason for the problem of low JRC values being larger than profiles with high JRC values, which the statistical parameters In this paper, the methodology of spectral analysis is first introduced; then, a new roughness parameter Although a natural rock joint's profile is complex and cannot be described with explicit mathematical equations, the spectral characteristic of the profile can be analyzed with the PSD function. Taking According to the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, According to Eqs. Eq. In order to calculate the PSD Before applying the method to natural rock joint profiles, two artificial rock joint profiles (see Both of the two simple profiles were analyzed with the sampling interval of 0.4 mm and their PSD We analyzed the PSD In order to explore why the two standard rock joint profiles with JRC = 10.8 and 14.5 have larger average power values than the roughest standard rock joint profile with JRC = 18.7, we analyzed the average power distribution characteristics of the three rock joint profiles with the JRC = 10.8, 14.5, and 18.7 by setting a threshold frequency The average power characteristics of the standard rock joint profiles with JRC = 10.8, 14.5, and 18.7 that have different threshold frequencies were plotted in The reason why the statistical parameters It is known from Eq. In order to consider the low-frequency components and high-frequency components of rock joint profiles, the frequency of each component should be accounted in the process of determining the average power. By taking the frequency as a weight factor on the average power contributed by the components in each frequency interval of the PSD The The statistical parameter However, the parameter According to the mathematical definitions of As the parameter A total number of 112 rock joint profiles that were studied by Li and Zhang Additionally, the ten standard rock joint profiles were plotted in In order to validate the proposed method, five well-matched sandstone joint samples (see Note that the horizon of the joint sample in the direct shear test should be placed parallelly with the shear plane, according to the ISRM suggested method for laboratory determination of the shear strength of rock joints. After scanning and encapsulating the sandstone joint samples, direct shear tests with a shear velocity of 0.4 mm/min were conducted on these joint samples. The results of the direct shear tests under different normal stresses are illustrated in In order to maintain consistency with the sampling interval (0.4 mm) of the 102 rock joint profiles used to derive the correlations between the JRC and the roughness parameter The roughness parameter For comparison, a correlation proposed by Li and Zhang We calculated the JRC value for each sandstone joint sample using the Based on Schmidt hammer rebound tests and direct shear tests, the JCS value is 45.9 MPa, and the Taking MJ1–5 as an example to investigate the influence of shear direction on the JRC, 2D rock joint profiles in different shear directions were extracted. As it can be seen in The JRC values for the rock joint profiles along various shear directions were then calculated by the proposed method and The natural rock joint profile is continuous; however, the digitized profile data are available only at a certain sampling interval. Three profiles, labeled profile a, profile b, and profile c, respectively, were extracted from the sandstone joint sample MJ1–5 to investigate the sampling interval effect. Taking the profile a as an example, it was plotted in In order to quantitatively analyze the sampling interval effect on the joint roughness, the parameters  Considering the correlations between JRC and The previous researchers Determining an accurate JRC is important for obtaining a better estimation of the shear strength of rock joints. To do this, we proposed a new spectral analysis using the PSD In order to consider the influence of both the high-frequency and low-frequency components on rock joint roughness, an average power index We proposed a new roughness parameter The influence of shear direction on the joint roughness characterization was discussed by analyzing JRC values for the rock joint profiles along various shear directions. The JRC values calculated by the proposed method and the In addition, the sampling interval effect was also discussed in this study. We suggested the maximum sampling interval used to digitize the laboratory scale (approximately 100mm) rock joint profiles should be smaller than 1.2 mm. However, it will consume too much time for scanning the rock joint surface when a very small sampling interval is adopted. Thus, the reasonable minimum sampling interval should be further studied.
