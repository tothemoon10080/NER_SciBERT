Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like chrysene in soil is difficult to remove because of insolubility in water well adsorbed in soil plus their persistence. They are well known for the health hazardous elements. Enhanced electrokinetic method could be used to desorb and destroy the pollutants. The main objective of this research was to investigate the technical feasibility of AC/Ultrasonic electrokinetic method in remediation of chrysene from contaminated soil.Three lab scale experiments including electrokinetic alone (EK), ultrasonic electrokinetic (EK-US) and AC-electrokinetic (EK-AC) were carried out to remove chrysene from artificially contaminated kaolin. There was increase in removal of chrysene by 3-4 % by enhanced electrokinetics using ultrasound and AC electricity. The technical feasibility of AC electrokinetic method in remediation of chrysene from the contaminated soil was investigated. The results suggest that the utilization of AC and US enhanced the electrokinetic removal of chrysene.
