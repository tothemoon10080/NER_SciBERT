Speciality metals development company Wolf Minerals Limited has authorised GR Engineering Services Limited (GRES) to begin construction of its Hemerdon tungsten and tin project in the southwest of England. GRES was awarded the £75 million fixed term EPC contract for the design, construction and commissioning of the tungsten and tin mineral processing plant plus associated infrastructure in June 2013. The plant will produce three million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) and first production is scheduled for mid-2015. “We have been focused on achieving the key milestones required to allow construction to commence at the Hemerdon project, and are delighted that these are now all in place and construction can commence,” said Wolf Minerals' MD, Russell Clark.  “The Wolf management team is established at its UK base and GRES is mobilising and will commence construction in the very near future. This is a very exciting time in the company's development and provides visible proof to the market that the project will be built and that Wolf will be the next significant producer of tungsten concentrate globally.”
