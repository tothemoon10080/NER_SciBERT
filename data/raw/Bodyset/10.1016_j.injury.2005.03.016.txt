We read with interest the case report of “Bilateral occipital condyle fractures leading to retropharyngeal haematoma and acute respiratory distress” by Freeman and Behensky. Fractures of the occipital condyle are not common. They were first documented by Bell in 1817. We would like to point out that, in the outcome of the presented case, the patient's airway obstruction due to the retropharyngeal haematoma would have been treated with intubation and ventilation in any case and that, from the fracture point of view, the hypoglossal nerve palsy persisted despite the relatively early diagnosis and treatment. The fracture described in this case report is minimally displaced and bilateral. The mechanism of the injury definitely fits in the Anderson-Montesano type I fracture category. The authors described there case as a comminuted fracture, but there is certainly no comminution. The fracture looks more like a type II fracture without the involvement of the skull base. In fact, recently we had a similar patient who was a motorcyclist in a similar, but much lower-speed, accident. In our case the fracture of the occipital condyle was again without comminution and without extension into the base of the skull. It appears that this is a peculiar pattern of fracture which was not mentioned in the original classification. Therefore, it may be better to define type I fractures as comminuted or simple fractures without extension to the base of the skull.
