With aging, there is a loss of skeletal mass in women and men, but the rate of loss accelerates in perimenopausal women. With the loss of bone mass there is increased risk for fracture in the axial and appendicular skeleton. The mandible and maxilla also experience age-related declines in some parameters of architecture and trabecular pattern, but those do not seem to be directly associated with fracture risk. Although the literature is controversial regarding the generalizability of the impact of systemic osteoporosis on the oral/maxillofacial patient, it is prudent to give consideration to an individual patient's osteoporosis status, risk, and anti-osteoporosis therapies when planning oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures.
