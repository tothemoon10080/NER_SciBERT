In this paper, a novel ionic liquid ([ACh][Tf2N]) was synthesized and applied for gold separation from secondary resources, which can be employed as both hydrophobic phase and extractant in the extraction process. By modulating various parameters, the extraction behavior of gold(III) under various conditions was investigated. The result shows that it is more suitable for gold(III) extraction with high salinity and lower acidity, whereas the extraction efficiency can reach 98.98% in 5 min. The anion exchange mechanism between [ACh][Tf2N] and gold(III) was proved by UV–vis, FT-IR, 13C NMR and quantum chemical calculations. The gold(III) in organic phase was easily stripped by 1 mL 0.05 M CS(NH2)2/0.1 M HCl. [ACh][Tf2N] also possesses excellent selectivity for gold(III) in the mixed metal solutions. Furthermore, its operating conditions combination: ionic liquid dosage, the concentration of HCl and NaCl were optimized to 0.55 g, 0.5 M and 2.5 M by response surface methodology (RSM), respectively. Hence, the [ACh][Tf2N] was regarded as a potential extractant for gold recovery from secondary resources.Gold has been widely used in the high-tech manufacturing and commercial trade, such as aerospace industry [ Liquid-liquid extraction has been considered as one of the most desired and efficient separation technology because of large processing capacity and large-scale continuous production [ RTILs were defined as organic salts, composed of organic cations and anions [ In this work, an amine-based ionic liquid acetylcholine ([ACh][Tf Acetylcholine chloride (ACh, A.R.) and Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (LiTf The The ionic liquid [ACh][Tf The maximum solubility of ionic liquid in the water and the water content in the ionic liquid were analyzed by cloud point titration. The experimental procedure was carried out according to the previous paper [ The solubility of ionic liquid in the aqueous phase was quantificationally determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [ The ionic liquid [ACh][Tf A certain dosage ionic liquid and 1 mL/5 M Au(III) chloride solution were shaken for 5 min by orbital shaker. Then, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min to achieve two phase complete separation. The concentration of Au(III) in raffinate was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The extraction efficiency (E%) and distribution ratio (D) were calculated by following eq. Based on the results of single factor experiments, according to the Box-Behnken design model [ The experiments were carried out under the following conditions: the concentration of Au(III) solution (985 mg·L The geometry of [ACh] The solubility of [ACh][Tf Effect of shaking time (varied from 1 to 30 min) on extraction efficiency ( To determine the maximum loading capacity of the [ACh][Tf To investigate the effect of the extractant dosage on extraction efficiency, the dosage of [ACh][Tf The effect of HCl and NaCl concentration on To further determine the effect of HCl or NaCl, the experiments were performed by varying H The results indicate that the effect of HCl concentration on UV–vis was performed to analyze the status of AuCl The FT-IR spectra of extractant and the extracted complex were characterized. As The For further supporting the above mechanism mentioned, the ESP map of [ACh] A series of experiments were performed to explore the effect of temperature on the extraction process. From the statistics in the According to the Van't Hoff equation, the relationship among enthalpy change (Δ The kinetics data were analyzed through pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order model. These two models are described by the Eqs. The stripping experiment was carried out to detect the reusability of [ACh][Tf In order to study the extraction selectivity of the [ACh][Tf The IL dosage(A), [HCl](B) and [NaCl](C) are the response variables, the extraction percentage(E%) is the index value (response value), and a response surface analysis experiment with three factors and three levels was designed. The regression fitting is performed on the experimental data to obtain the prediction model of the system: Details of ANOVA were shown in Table S2. The F-value is 35.8 and In order to investigate the influence of the three variable factors of gold extraction and determine the best process conditions, this paper draws the 3D response surface diagrams of extraction efficiency under the condition of two interactive factors, and were projected it onto the plane to obtain the corresponding contour plots. The influence of interaction between HCl concentration and IL dosage at a fixed NaCl concentration on E% is shown in In order to verify the applicability of the model and evaluate the optimized combination, the corresponding experiment was performed. The analysis software Design Expert (Version 8.0.6) gives the optimal operating combination of the model by optimization within the range of factors: the IL dosage = 0.55 g, [HCl] = 0.5 M, [NaCl] = 2.5 M. Under this condition, the predicted value of the E% is 98.38%. After three repeated experiments, the average E% is 98.89%, and the relative error from the predicted value is 0.51%. It shows that the model obtained by the RSM is reasonable and reliable. It can predict the extraction process of Au(III) using [ACh][Tf A novel amine-based ionic liquid [ACh][Tf  No conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript.
