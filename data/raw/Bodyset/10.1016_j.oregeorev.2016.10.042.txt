Our recent geochronological study on the Taldybulak Levoberezhny gold deposit in Kyrgyz Northern Tien Shan (KNTS) received critical comments by Boris Trifonov (2016) regarding the age of dikes and its relationship with gold mineralization at the deposit. In this contribution, based on a re-evaluation of our published data, together with new geochronological, geochemical and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic data, the age of gold mineralization, magmatic and tectonic events and the relationship between dikes and mineralization at the deposit, it is proposed that the Taldybulak Levoberezhny gold deposit is a product of long-lived magmatic-hydrothermal system with multiple stages of gold mineralization from Cambrian to late Carboniferous–early Permian.We welcome an opportunity to respond to the criticism and comments raised by Dr. Boris We agree with Our research group has conducted two field investigations at the deposit (in November 2011 and September 2013). The Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. has just acquired its interest in the Altyken LLC, operator of the mine, prior to our first visit in 2011, and thus few modern exploration or mining work has been undertaken. We conducted limited observation and collected ore samples from one of the preproduction test pits in the northwestern part of the Main orebody and one diorite dike sample from the western part of the main orebody ( Here, we furnish our new data on samples collected in 2013. We also integrated them with our published data (  However, previous description by It is beyond dispute that productive gold mineralization is related to the magmatic-hydrothermal processes that took place after emplacement of diorite–monzodiorite dike swarms; whereas most studies linked the productive mineralization to quartz–tourmaline alteration ( The Main orebody, located at the intersection between the ESE-trending fault and the Main Taldybulak zone ( Gold mineralization in the western part of the Main orebody (formed during the early stage) is mainly represented by native gold and occurs as inclusions in pyrite, fills an interstitial space and micro-fractures of quartz, forming mainly veinlet–disseminated low grade ores ( U–Pb dating of zircons from the diorite dike (intruding into andesite of the Lower Devonian Barkol Formation) in However, this interpretation is just a tentative proposal regarding the relationships between dikes and mineralization as we have no crucial conclusion on this important issue due to the limited data. It is also possible that the diorite dike might have sampled zircons with a wide range of ages from our Group B and C zircons. In Two east–west trending dikes (diorite and monzogranite) intruding metamorphic rocks in the Main Taldybulak zone ( Seven relatively fresh samples of each dike were collected for major and trace element studies. One sample from each dike (diorite, TL-27; monzogranite, TL-42) was used for U–Pb age dating and Hf isotopic analysis of zircons, and three of each were used for Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotopic studies. Detailed description and location of samples can be found in Zircon grains from diorite (TL-27) and monzogranite (TL-42) samples were separated using conventional heavy liquid and magnetic methods. Selected grains were mounted in an epoxy resin disk and polished to expose their cores. Transmitted and reflected light microscopy and cathodoluminescence (CL) images were taken in order to examine their internal structures and choose potential targets for analyses. Zircon U–Pb analyses were performed using a Neptune (Thermo Fisher) Multi-collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) with a 193-nm ArF-excimer laser system at the Isotope Laboratory, Tianjin Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, following the procedures described in A total of fourteen fresh rock chips of the dikes were crushed and ground into powder in an agate mill for bulk-rock analyses. Major and trace element analyses were carried out at the National Research Center for Geoanalysis, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences (CAGS), Beijing. Major elements were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and wet chemistry methods with analytical precision better than 1%. Trace elements (including rare earth elements) were determined by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The analytical uncertainties estimated from the analyses of standards (GSR1 and GSR2) are less than 5%. Six of the fourteen samples were selected for Sr–Nd isotope analyses, which were conducted using a Triton Plus MC-ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Beijing. The mass fractionation corrections for Zircon Lu–Hf isotopes were analyzed using a New-wave UP213 laser-ablation system equipped with a Neptune MC-ICP-MS at the Institute of Mineral Resources, CAGS, Beijing. Analyses were carried out on the same zircon grains, previously analyzed for U–Pb isotopes, with a beam diameter of 55 The CL images of representative zircon grains from the diorite and monzogranite samples are shown in Twenty-three zircon grains from the diorite sample (TL-27) yielded U and Th concentrations, ranging from 169 to 2514 Twenty-four zircon grains from the monzogranite sample (TL-42) yielded U and Th concentrations that range from 316 and 1291 Major element analyses of diorite samples reveal extremely high loss on ignition (LOI >7%; The diorite and monzogranite samples show similar primitive mantle normalized trace element patterns that are characterized by a strong enrichment of large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) relative to high field strength elements (HFSE) with positive anomalies of Th and negative anomalies of Nb, Ta, Ti and Sr ( The diorite and monzogranite samples have distinct Sr–Nd isotopic compositions ( Lu–Hf isotopes were analyzed in seven zircon grains, including one inherited Neoproterozoic zircon from the diorite sample (TL-27; The diorite and monzogranite dikes in this study have broadly similar normalized incompatible element and rare earth element patterns, including enrichment in light REE and negative anomalies of Nb, Ta and Ti ( The bulk-rock Nd isotopic data of our dated diorite are remarkably uniform with positive ε Our dated monzogranite samples are characterized by negative bulk-rock ε  Four pyrite samples from veinlet, disseminated, patchy and massive ores and two chalcopyrite samples from disseminated and veinlet ores from the Return Air Shaft 870 (42°39′39″N, 75°40′05″E) were collected at a depth of 51–60 Chemical compositions of pyrite and chalcopyrite from six representative ore samples of the main stage were analyzed by a JEOL JXA-8230 electron microprobe at the Institute of Mineral Resources, CAGS. The working conditions were 20 Pyrite and chalcopyrite separated from the ore samples were used for Re–Os age dating. Mineral separates were handpicked under a binocular microscope after crushing to assure purity better than 99%. Sulfide separates were then pulverized to <200 mesh and blended to insure homogeneity. Re–Os analyses were conducted on the negative thermal ionization mass spectrometer at the National Research Center of Geoanalysis, CAGS, Beijing, following the analytical protocol of EMP analyses of representative pyrite and chalcopyrite from the main stage ore samples yielded variable gold contents, 0.004–0.093 Pyrite and chalcopyrite grains in veinlet ore have relatively high gold contents (0.015–0.092 The four pyrite and two chalcopyrite separates from the main stage ore samples have low Re contents (0.270–1.492 The regression of Re–Os data for the four pyrite samples yields an imprecise age of 462  The cross-section B–B′ in our published paper in The Re–Os age of 434 Our geochronological data for two diorite dikes (ca. 435 The chondrite-like radiogenic Importantly, the sources of ore metals of the main stage mineralization (ca. 434 The majority of orebodies of the Taldybulak Levoberezhny gold deposit is hosted by the Main Taldybulak shear and thrust zone in granitic gneisses of the Neoproterozoic Aktyuz and Kemin complexes, with U–Pb ages of 778 During the late Cambrian to Early Ordovician, the accretion of the Dzhalair–Naiman oceanic basin in the Northern Tien Shan induced the convergence of the Aktyuz and Anrakhai terranes at 530–500 As a response, numerous diorite–monzodiorite dikes were emplaced along the shear and thrust zones in the Taldybulak Levoberezhny deposit between 435 and 414 It is worth noting that the late Carboniferous to early Permian magmatic-hydrothermal events represented by considerable amount of 312–283 In general, our new geochronological data in Although our current understanding of the Taldybulak Levoberezhny deposit might be incomplete, mineralization at the deposit is definitely a multi-stage system with several episodes of gold introduction, spanning from the Cambrian to the Permian. The Cambrian deformation and metamorphism (early stage), the Silurian (main stage) and the late Carboniferous–early Permian (late stage) magmatic-hydrothermal processes eventually resulted in the formation of the Taldybulak Levoberezhny deposit.
