Two thioamide derivatives, N-methyl-N-phenyl-octanthioamide (MPHTA) and N-methyl-N-cyclohexyl-octanthioamide (MCHTA), were synthesized from their amide analogues, adequately characterized, and systematically evaluated as extractants for palladium(II) from chloride media. In sequence of previous research, which revealed the adequacy of both compounds, when dissolved in toluene, to efficiently recover Pd(II) from a wide range of differently concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions, the Pd(II) solvent extraction performance of both MPHTA and MCHTA dissolved in commercial diluents is evaluated in this work. Additionally, results obtained on successive extraction–stripping cycles, involving thiourea as stripping agent, confirm the robustness and stability of these Pd(II) solvent extraction systems, even when commercial diluents are employed. Equilibrium extraction isotherms, obtained for both compounds in toluene, show a high Pd(II) loading capacity. Selectivity data has been collected for complex 4.0M and 6.0M HCl mixtures containing two, three, four or five metal ions — palladium(II), platinum(IV), rhodium(III), aluminum(III), and iron(III). Fe(III) is the only metal that affects Pd(II) extraction of both MPHTA and MCHTA, as Pd(II) distribution ratios are significantly reduced; on the other hand, the other metals are practically not extracted. These selectivity results are encouraging from a practical point of view, since both extractants may prove suitable to efficiently and selectively recover Pd(II) from hydrometallurgical solutions coming from the leaching of secondary raw material sources.The demand for palladium, platinum and related rare metals is increasing worldwide due to their growing application in several leading technological devices, namely in fuel cells, electronics, and as catalysts (in oil refining and fine chemistry processing, as well as in automotive catalytic converters, to mention only a few examples) ( The hydrometallurgical recovery of PGMs is typically carried out in aqueous chloride media; accordingly, solvent extraction (SX) is within the most successful operations involved in the separation of PGMs from chloride leach solutions ( In fact, several works appeared in literature, in the first ten years of the 21st century, reporting the development of amide compounds to efficiently and selectively recover Pd(II) and other PGMs from complex chloride aqueous matrices, for instance, like those coming from the leaching of spent autocatalysts. With this aim, some relevant extractants deserving mention are diglycolamide and thiodiglycolamide derivatives ( It is worth to point out that a similar application has been observed for a dithioether derivative, but the use of 1,2-dichlorobenzene as diluent, and extraction rates ranging from 50 to 500 The application of amide derivatives for the SX of PGMs from HCl solutions has been a research goal for this group. Hence, Taking into account the most recent research settled towards Pd(II) recovery involving compounds containing sulfur and/or amide groups, the testing of thioamide derivatives as PGM extractants came to mind, as two monoamides have already been produced in the laboratory ( The present article deepens the research about the SX properties of two new thioamide derivatives, namely FTIR spectra were recorded in a Satellite Mattson spectrophotometer, using NaCl cells.  MPHOA (2.04 FTIR (NaCl cells, cm   GC–MS: retention time FTIR (NaCl cells, cm   GC–MS: retention time The equilibria between Feed aqueous phases containing 100 For the selectivity experiments, 4.0 Extraction and stripping experiments were generally carried out by stirring equal volumes of aqueous and organic phases (A/O The determination of Pd(II) contents in single ion aqueous phases, before and after extraction, was performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS, novAA 350, Analytik Jena). For the analysis of the multi-metallic aqueous solutions, inductively coupled plasma — atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Horiba Jobin-Yvon, Ultima) was used instead. Metal ion concentrations in organic phases were calculated by mass balance. At least two replicates were considered for all the experiments, and the analysis of the aqueous solutions before and after extraction was systematically made in triplicate. The uncertainties determined for the extraction and stripping results do not exceed ± As previously reported, 100 Narita and co-workers proposed a 28% ammonia solution to recover Pd(II) from the sulfide-containing monoamides, claiming this to be more adequate than thiourea matrices from a practical point of view ( In order to evaluate the robustness and stability of both extraction systems to recover Pd(II) from concentrated HCl solutions, successive extraction–stripping cycles, applied to the same fraction of organic phase, were considered, and the overall performances of both MPHTA and MCHTA were screened for 1.5 Regarding MPHTA, it can be observed that the Pd(II) extraction performance of this compound is similar for both 1.5 The overall results collected for MCHTA indicate a better reutilization performance than that found for MPHTA. In fact, To appraise the capacity of both extractants to load Pd(II), 0.030 The Pd(II) saturation paths observed for both MPHTA and MCHTA can be considered quite elevated, since the molar proportions between the extractants and Pd(II) revealed a ratio of 1.7 for both cases. Furthermore, these results suggest that, at least for saturation conditions, 1:1 and 2:1 extractant:Pd(II) species do exist in the organic solutions, with a major contribution from the species with a 2:1 stoichiometry. The reproduction of the good Pd(II) extraction and stripping results when MPHTA and MCHTA are included in other diluents, instead of toluene, would be a value-adding, particularly from a practical point of view. With that objective in mind, some commercial diluents such as kerosene and Shellsol D70 (with low aromatic contents) and Solvesso 150 (totally aromatic) were considered. However, it was found that both MPHTA and MCHTA were not able to completely dissolve in kerosene and Shellsol D70 with the desired concentrations, only in Solvesso 150. Therefore, either kerosene or Shellsol D70 were mixed with 10% (v/v) of decan-1-ol, and the complete dissolution of both extractants in those modified diluents was finally achieved. Considering that HCl solutions above 3.0 Regarding MPHTA, the Pd(II) To further evaluate the Pd(II) SX behavior of both compounds when dissolved in commercial diluents, more sequential extraction–stripping experiments were carried out, involving Shellsol D70 for MPHTA and kerosene for MCHTA. As before, both diluents were modified with 10% (v/v) decan-1-ol, and initial Pd(II) solutions in 4.5 It can be observed that both systems show a quite good Pd(II) extraction performance, that does not suffer reduction upon reutilization. Stripping The selectivity shown for Pd(II) by both extractants is obviously a determinant key point that requires evaluation. Therefore, and again focusing the research on the use of HCl solutions with a more practical interest, 4.0 As expected, there are no significant differences between the data collected for the 4.0 For these experiments, the investigation of the influence that Fe(III) or Al(III) may have on the SX performance of both compounds towards the mixture of the three PGMs was sought. The overall results collected are summarized in As previously, the differences between the extraction behavior shown by MPHTA and MCHTA, in 4.0 It can then be concluded that, for both extraction systems, the contamination of the organic extracts with Fe(III) may be eliminated by an adequate scrubbing with water, a step that can be optimized. However, the serious drawback is the less efficient Pd(II) extraction observed for both MPHTA and MCHTA when Fe(III) is present. Equilibrium and spectroscopic data obtained for MPHTA and MCHTA so far ( For these five-metal mixtures, 100 Again, the extraction profiles observed for the 4.0 Finally, one may conclude that MPHTA is generally more selective for Pd(II) recovery than MCHTA, although less efficient, particularly when Fe(III) is present.
