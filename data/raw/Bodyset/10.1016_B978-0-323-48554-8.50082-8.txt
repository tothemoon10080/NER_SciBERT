  Type I: Avulsion fracture from tip of odontoid at insertion of alar ligament Usually stable injury Usually seen in conjunction with more extensive craniocervical injury Type II: Transverse fracture through base of odontoid Most likely to progress to nonunion without surgical fusion Type III: Oblique fracture extending from base of odontoid into body of C2  Direct visualization of fracture line on radiography Soft tissue swelling anterior to C2 in acute cases Displacement of dens, C1 on lateral film CT protocol: Thin-slice (1 mm or less) multidetector CT, fast scan time to minimize motion Sagittal and coronal reformatted images mandatory MR Effacement of thecal sac on MR due to displaced fracture Cord injury, if present, hyperintense on T2WI Fractures without compression &/or fractures with distraction do not reliably generate marrow edema and can lead to false-negative MR imaging  Os odontoideum Congenital variation: 3rd occipital condyle (condylus tertius) Rheumatoid arthritis: C1/C2 subluxation Pathologic C2 fracture Ossiculum terminale persistens  Osteoporosis in elderly predisposes to type II fracture and nonunion    Dens fracture  Type I: Avulsion fracture from tip of odontoid at insertion of alar ligament Type II: Transverse fracture through base of odontoid Type III: Oblique fracture extending from base of odontoid into body of C2  Best diagnostic clue Lateral radiograph: Anterior or posterior displacement of C1 arch vs. C2 with prevertebral soft tissue swelling Fracture visible on open mouth (dens) view  Radiography Type I: Oblique fracture fragment at rostral aspect of odontoid on frontal view Type II: Fracture line through base of odontoid Type III Fracture line through base of odontoid extending into C2 body Fracture may extend into superior articular surfaces of C2 All: Swelling of prevertebral soft tissues  NECT Soft tissue swelling anterior to C2 in acute cases Lucent fracture line through tip of odontoid (type I) or base of odontoid (type II) ± extent into C2 body (type III)  T1WI Abnormal low T1 marrow signal due to osseous edema Cortical disruption May directly appreciate cortical defect at fracture site Thickened prevertebral soft tissues T2WI Variable and inconsistent hyperintense signal in C2 marrow due to osseous edema Hyperintense soft tissue edema Effacement of thecal sac due to displaced fracture  Odontoid replaced by ossicle with no continuity to C2 body Corticated margins on radiography, CT No soft tissue swelling  Can produce pathologic odontoid fracture Metastases, infection, other inflammatory arthritidis  Laxity, subluxation  Nonfusion of ossiculum terminal (apical odontoid epiphysis) to body of dens beyond 12 years of age  Midline bony peg off anterior lip of foramen magnum may articulate to dens, simulate odontoid type I fracture  Anderson and D’Alonzo (1974) Type I fracture: Oblique fracture through upper portion of odontoid process Type II fracture: Fracture across base of odontoid process near junction with axis body Type III fracture: Fracture that includes odontoid and extends into axis body Hadley modification (1988) Type IIA: Comminuted fracture of base of odontoid with associated free fracture fragments Highly unstable Grauer modification (2005) Type IIA: Minimally/nondisplaced fracture with no comminution; treated with external immobilization Type IIB: Displaced odontoid fracture that extends from anterior-superior to posterior-inferior or transverse; treated with anterior screw fixation if reducible Type IIC: Fracture extending from anterior-inferior to posterior-superior or with significant comminution; considered for posterior internal fixation and fusion  Fusion produces stability Nonunion common in elderly without primary fusion May stabilize by fibrous union with prolonged immobilization  Fracture pattern dictates management Type I fracture Usually stable injury Treated with simple immobilization Type II fracture Most likely to progress to nonunion Type III fracture Nonunion uncommon after treatment with traction followed by bracing  STIR to show soft tissue edema in prevertebral space (missing in chronic nonunion) Marrow edema an unreliable sign for presence of fracture in distraction injuries Flexion/extension films or fluoroscopy for evaluating stability
