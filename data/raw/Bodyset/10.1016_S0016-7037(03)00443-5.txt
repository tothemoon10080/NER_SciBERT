 Enamel forms via a two stage process, first by apposition, in which apatite crystallites are seeded into an organic matrix, then by a series of maturation stages, in which crystals infill and coarsen (e.g., Many ungulate teeth that have been studied (e.g., cervids, bovids, equids, etc.) have ∼1-mm-thick enamel “sheaths,” which grow progressively from the occlusal, or wear surface towards the tooth root. Passey and Cerling show that l Fortunately, if the environmental signal is regular, and if the material that records it forms at a constant rate, then the wavelength of the environmental signal will be preserved in the isotopic record, regardless of the degree of damping (e.g., If the enamel maturation length scale is ∼25 mm for large ungulates (as determined for Clearly, enamel maturation warrants further investigation, in part because the length scale of maturation is known in only a few animals (e.g., Pennilyn Higgins and an anonymous reviewer are thanked for their helpful comments.
