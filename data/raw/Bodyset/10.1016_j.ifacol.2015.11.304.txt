This paper presents an updated and comprehensive description of offset-free MPC algorithms for nonlinear (and linear) discrete-time systems, with the intended objectives of clarifying the main concepts, showing new results, highlighting subtleties by means of challenging applications. First, the offset-free tracking problem for nonlinear systems is presented, putting a strong accent on the role of the disturbance model and observer, and then novel and stronger offset-free estimation results are presented. Next, recent advances in linear offset-free MPC are described, which show the equivalence of the velocity form algorithm (so far considered an alternative method) to a particular disturbance model and observer. Then, the concepts of offset-free estimation are exploited to design an offset-free economic MPC algorithm, which can asymptotically achieve the highest economic performance despite persistent
model errors and disturbances. Extensive application results are presented to show the benefits of offsetfree MPC algorithms over standard ones, and to clarify misconceptions and design errors that can prevent constraint satisfaction, closed-loop stability, and offset-free performance.
