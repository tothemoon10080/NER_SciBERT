The combined use of a rhamnolipid biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an enzyme pool produced by solid-state fermentation with Penicillium simplicissimum using babassu cake as culture medium in the anaerobic treatment of an effluent with a high fat content from a poultry processing plant was evaluated. Central composite rotatable design was used to evaluate the enzyme pool and biosurfactant concentrations and the treatment temperature of the effluent containing about 2400mg oil and grease per liter. The combination that yielded the highest specific methane production was 0.19% (w/v) enzyme pool and 114mg/L biosurfactant at 33°C. It could therefore be concluded that the combined use of a rhamnolipid biosurfactant with an enzyme preparation obtained from solid-state fermentation may enhance methane production and enable the use of anaerobic technology in this sector, eliminating the need for physicochemical processes or the addition of costly commercial enzymes.Poultry slaughterhouses produce large volumes of effluents containing high concentrations of biodegradable organic matter, especially lipids and proteins Lipids have a higher specific methane yield (STP 1.014 However, operational problems may occur during anaerobic treatments of effluents with a high fat content, such as the production of sludge with low methanogenic activity, enhanced foam formation, flotation and biomass washout An alternative to conventional pretreatments that is attracting growing interest is the use of enzymes, which significantly reduce the level of triglycerides in the effluent and thereby improve the performance of the microbial population at the later stages of biological treatment In the industry of interest in this study, the liquid effluent generated at an average flow of 750 The effluent was obtained from a poultry processing plant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was taken from the treatment plant before the flotation step. After it was collected and appropriately preserved, aliquots were taken to determine the characterization parameters; the rest was stored in a freezer until use. The effluent was characterized for its pH, COD, suspended solids (total, fixed and volatile), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and oil and grease, using standard procedures The sludge used in the anaerobic biodegradability tests was collected from a UASB bioreactor operating at the same plant. Therefore, although part of the microorganisms from the consortium could have come from the wastewater and fat, the vast majority of them are not endogenous, as they were added to the reactor when it was started up, upon which they adapted to the constituents parts of the wastewater and formed the established microbial population used as an inoculum in the experiments undertaken. This sludge was characterized for its total solids (26,525 The enzyme pool was produced by the solid-state fermentation of waste from babassu oil production (babassu cake) from The biosurfactant was produced using The experimental design used to evaluate the synergistic effect of the enzyme pool and biosurfactant on the pretreatment stage of a wastewater from a poultry processing plant was performed using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The experiments were conducted with 100 Preliminary anaerobic biodegradability tests were conducted using diluted raw effluent so the fat concentration would be low and there would be no interference in the degradation process. The first series of tests evaluated what effect increasing the enzyme pool concentration had on the activity of the microbial consortium used as an inoculum. The second series of tests was conducted using diluted raw effluent with biosurfactant added at three different concentrations: at the CMC (205 The separated and combined effects of the enzyme pool and biosurfactant on the anaerobic consortium were evaluated in the third series of anaerobic biodegradability tests conducted with the raw effluent without dilution (as collected from the plant). In this series of tests, the enzyme and biosurfactant concentrations were fixed by a central composite rotatable design (CCRD), which enabled the analysis to be planned and executed in an organized way with as few assays as possible. CCRD also demonstrates what effect the variables have on the response, both individually and in interaction, from which it is possible to identify which variables are most important for the process, evaluate the experimental and regression errors, and model the results empirically, depending on the variables selected, using statistical regression programs. In this series, enzyme (0.19 and 1.14%, w/v) and biosurfactant (114 and 315 All the tests were conducted in batch using 100 The raw effluent was diluted and supplemented with macronutrient solution Both fermentation processes – solid-state for enzyme production, and anaerobic for the degradation of the effluent constituents – were conducted at 30 Lipase and protease activity was determined as previously described The biogas composition was determined in a Varian Micro GC 4900 gas chromatograph employing 10 The mean values obtained in the characterization of the effluent collected before the flotation step are shown in  Up to an enzyme pool concentration of 0.5% (w/v), the COD removal efficiency and methane volume were higher than observed for the control, which was conducted only with diluted raw effluent. However, the use of 1.0% (w/v) pool resulted in a marked reduction in COD removal and methane production. This deleterious effect may have been caused by an increased release of long-chain fatty acids in the hydrolysis step, which are known inhibitors of anaerobic microorganisms  Nakhla et al. Pires In order to evaluate the synergistic effects of the enzyme pool and biosurfactant on the pretreatment step, two CCRD-type experimental designs were carried out. In the first stage, the influence of the pool and biosurfactant concentrations and the temperature on soluble COD (SCOD) was observed. Combining the action of the enzyme pool and the biosurfactant triggers two simultaneous processes: emulsification of fat particles and the activity of the lipases present in the pool, which catalyze the hydrolysis of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Thus, the combination of these bio-products should lead to an increased SCOD fraction in the effluent. Moreover, endogenous microorganisms from the effluent could also absorb emulsified fat and products from the enzymatic hydrolysis. However, considering the low microbial activity and short analysis time period (up to 6 As such, in order to harness the energy saving potential from the fact that the effluent from the poultry processing plant is produced at temperatures of around 33  Comparing the specific methane production values in Other assays will be performed with this composition in successive batches to monitor the drop in COD and biogas production with time. Once the sludge has been fully adapted, the minimum reaction time for efficient COD removal will be identified. Next, tests will be undertaken using continuous-feed bench-scale reactors with the hydraulic retention time identified in the assays using batch feeding.
