Nutritional rickets remains a global public health problem, despite effective and inexpensive means to prevent and treat the disease. It is most prevalent in the infant/toddler age groups and the adolescent, but vitamin D deficiency is also prevalent in women of child bearing age, resulting in babies being born with low vitamin D stores and the mothers having inadequate vitamin D in breast milk, thus exacerbating the risk for rickets in these infants. In a number of subtropical developing countries, rickets appears to be due to low-dietary calcium intakes (∼200mg/day) rather than vitamin D deficiency. Biochemically these children are differentiated from those with vitamin D deficiency by having markedly elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations and high fractional intestinal calcium absorption. Nutritional rickets represents the outcome of a spectrum of causes ranging from vitamin D deficiency on one hand to dietary calcium deficiency on the other, while in between low dietary intakes and vitamin D insufficiency combine to cause the disease.Introduction Historical Perspective The Epidemiology of Vitamin D Deficiency and Nutritional Rickets Clinical Presentation Biochemical Abnormalities Radiologic Changes The Growth Plate in Rickets Treatment and Prevention Treatment Prevention Dietary Calcium Deficiency The Pathogenetic Spectrum of Nutritional Rickets Conclusions References 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D International units nanogram/millilitre Parathyroid hormone Tubular maximum of phosphate/litre of glomerular filtrate Rickets is a clinical syndrome in children, resulting from failure of or delay in mineralization of the growth plate of growing bones. Of the numerous different causes, the majority can be grouped into three major categories: those which primarily result in a failure to maintain normal calcium homeostasis (calciopenic); those which primarily affect phosphate homeostasis (phosphopenic); and those which directly inhibit the mineralization process. Globally, rickets due to nutritional causes (which fall into the calciopenic group) remains the most frequent form of the disease. However, in a number of industrialized countries, such as the United States, the genetic forms of hypophosphatemic rickets are now probably more prevalent than nutritional causes outside the neonatal and infant periods, as a result of the fortification of foods with vitamin D and the use of vitamin D supplements in at-risk groups. Nevertheless, the last 30 or more years have seen a resurgence of nutritional rickets in dark-skinned minority communities in a number of developed countries. Although nutritional rickets is often considered to be a disease of industrialization, descriptions of rickets have been attributed to both Homer (900 BC) and Soranus Ephesius (AD 130). Of interest is the recent report of a Neolithic skeleton of A number of studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries documented the almost universal prevalence of rickets in young children in cities in northern Europe (for example, in Glasgow In the United Kingdom, a number of foods were fortified with vitamin D during the Second World War. This led to a rapid reduction in the number of children diagnosed with rickets, but in the following years the incidence of idiopathic hypercalcemia rose in infants which at the time was attributed to uncontrolled fortification of various foods (especially milk and cereals) leading to daily intakes of 100 In the United States of America, the universal fortification of milk with vitamin D at 400 Discussion and debate continue concerning the definition of vitamin D deficiency and the best methods for determining vitamin D status. Since the descriptions of the first assays to measure serum concentrations of vitamin D and/or its metabolites in the early 1970s, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has been the metabolite used to define vitamin D status, as its serum concentrations are relatively stable (half-life, 2–3 Vitamin D deficiency is a prerequisite for the development of nutritional rickets in the majority of children. Thus the disease is typically associated with a lack of UV light and inadequate dietary vitamin D. As commonly ingested foods are generally deficient in vitamin D, in the absence of food fortification with vitamin D, the normal diet contributes little to the vitamin D status of an individual Vitamin D deficiency rickets is most prevalent in children under 2 In a number of studies vitamin D deficiency rickets has been noted to occur more commonly in boys than girls Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene might play a role in predisposing infants and children to rickets. In a study of Turkish and Egyptian infants with rickets, the prevalence of the CYP2R1 is the major, but not exclusive, hepatic 25-hydroxylase responsible for the hydroxylation of parent vitamin D to 25(OH)D In the early literature, breast-feeding was reported to be protective against rickets In the breast-fed infant not receiving vitamin D supplements, the maintenance of an adequate vitamin D status is dependent mainly on the infant’s exposure to UV light Seasonal variations in serum 25(OH)D concentrations have also been documented in a number of countries in older children and adults Despite its near eradication, the prevalence of nutritional rickets is increasing in high-income countries, largely driven by an increased influx of immigrant and refugee children from parts of the world with a high prevalence of nutritional rickets In the United States, despite the almost complete eradication of vitamin D deficiency among Caucasian children, several studies have highlighted the resurgence of the problem in specific groups A similar pattern has also been documented in darker skinned immigrant populations in a number of European countries The risk of nutritional rickets is a function of both vitamin D status and calcium intake. Although rickets can result from either vitamin D deficiency or calcium deficiency, more commonly these two conditions interact to increase the risk of developing rickets ( The majority of clinical signs in children with rickets results from the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the mineralization process at the growth plate or on calcium homeostasis. Fraser and coworkers The early clinical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency (stage I) are related to hypocalcemia and are more commonly seen in young infants (less than 6 As the deficiency progresses, the classical features of rickets become apparent. Typically the infant or young child presents with a delay in motor milestones, hypotonia, and progressive deformities of the long bones Other skeletal abnormalities include a delay in the closure of the fontanelles, parietal, and frontal bossing (hot-cross bun appearance) and the presence of craniotabes A delay in tooth eruption is a feature of rickets in the young child and enamel hypoplasia of teeth may occur if rickets develops before the completion of enamel deposition. The latter has been reported in the primary dentition of infants born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient Hypotonia, decreased activity and a protuberant abdomen are characteristic features of advanced vitamin D deficiency rickets in the infant and young child. These signs are probably analogous to the proximal muscle weakness described in vitamin D deficient adolescents and adults Dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure Infants and young children with rickets are prone to an increased number and severity of infections A possibly associated abnormality is anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, myelocytosis, erythroblastosis, myelofibrosis The hallmark of vitamin D deficiency is a low circulating level of 25(OH)D. In healthy children and adults, a range of ∼12.5–50 The classical biochemical changes in vitamin D deficient children who have radiological changes of rickets are a combination of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase and PTH concentrations. In the early phase of vitamin D deficiency before the development of radiological signs (stage I), hypocalcemia may be the only biochemical abnormality The elegant studies conducted by Fraser and coworkers Evidence of end-organ resistance to PTH has been found in the young children with both mild and more severe radiological rickets Markers of bone turnover are typically elevated in nutritional rickets in response to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be within the normal range in stage I rickets, but is elevated in patients with radiologic rickets Osteocalcin is a noncollagenous bone matrix protein that binds to hydroxyapatite and is secreted by osteoblasts during mineralization In patients with vitamin D deficiency, serum 1,25(OH) A possible pathophysiological progression of vitamin D deficiency rickets in children may be described as follows It is during stage II that serum 1,25(OH) As 25(OH)D concentrations fall further, 1,25(OH) The typical radiologic changes associated with vitamin D deficiency rickets have been well described and are discussed in Chapter 54 (vol. 1 of this book). Stage I rickets characteristically shows few radiologic signs, although demineralization of the calvarium and loss of definition of the skull sutures have been described The early signs of rickets include widening of the epiphyseal plates and a loss of definition of the provisional zone of calcification at the metaphyses A widely used radiologic severity score has proven useful to quantify the severity of radiographic changes of rickets, based on wrist and knee radiographs The shafts of the long bones show features of both hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Osteopenia is a characteristic feature which in the so-called “atrophic” form of the disease may be very severe Enlargement and splaying of the costochondral junctions on the lateral radiographs of the chest have been used as a sign of rickets, however, in one study mild changes were found to be unreliable as their presence did not correlate with serum 25(OH)D concentrations or with other features of rickets at the distal radius and ulna Rickets during adolescence may be difficult to detect using the conventional radiographic sites of the wrist and knees as the epiphyseal plates narrow and epiphyses fuse. A radiograph of the pelvis may be useful in this situation as the secondary iliac and ischial ossification centers may be abnormally wide The sign of early healing of rickets is described as the appearance of broadened bands of increased density replacing the normal sharp metaphyseal lines ( The characteristic feature in all forms of rickets is the abnormality that occurs at the growth plate. The cartilaginous plate consists of resting, proliferating, and hypertrophic zones of chondrocytes, and in rickets it is the hypertrophic zone that is affected through widening and loss of organization of this zone. The widening is caused by marked impairment of apoptosis of the hypertrophied cells through an inhibition of the caspase-9-mediated mitochondrial pathway Vitamin D deficiency rickets can be effectively treated by the oral administration of small doses of either vitamin D More generally, however, doses of vitamin D between 2000 and 6000 A randomized clinical trial found that daily vitamin D In Central Europe, a single dose of 600,000 Besides ensuring an adequate vitamin D intake, the calcium content of the diet should be optimized (between 600 and 1000 As discussed in Thus, preventive strategies should be directed not only at breast-fed infants but also at pregnant and breast-feeding women and adolescents where appropriate North America and the United Kingdom recommend dietary intakes of between 400 and 350 Infants fed milk formulas or cow’s milk fortified with vitamin D do not require vitamin D supplements, as their intake of milk generally provides sufficient vitamin D to prevent deficiency As discussed earlier, high single dose therapy (stosstherapie) has been used with success in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency rickets in a number of countries. A similar dose has also been used on a regular intermittent basis of every 3–5 Following these results, a study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of vitamin D (600,000 The same group of researchers has also studied the use of intermittent vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D deficiency during the winter months in adolescents in northern France Vitamin D supplementation should be considered for all infants until they are ambulatory and are able to play outside In a number of countries, vitamin D deficiency is not just a disease of breast-fed infants and their mothers. Rickets has been described in adolescents of Indian and Pakistani descent in the United Kingdom and in the Middle East Besides the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among groups of adolescents, there is an increasing awareness of the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in many elderly subjects in Europe and North America Nutritional rickets and its consequences are preventable global public health problems Nutrient supplementation is the fastest way to improve the micronutrient status of individuals or targeted populations Food fortification is a universal strategy that impacts an entire population. Vitamin D is naturally found in only a limited number of foods, and apart from food fortification, dietary intakes have little impact on vitamin D status. Fortifying commonly consumed staple foods with vitamin D and calcium based on dietary patterns safely provides adequate intake to prevent deficiency at minimal cost. Food fortification effectively prevents nutritional rickets and improves the vitamin D status of children Although the untargeted fortification of foods other than milk and infant milk formulas has been used in the past, the problems of hypercalcemia experienced in the United Kingdom after the Second World War led to its falling into disfavor (cf. Low dairy product intake, a common situation in low-income countries, is a risk factor for nutritional rickets from inadequate dietary calcium in children over the age of 12 The effectiveness of public health interventions can be assessed by determining adherence to recommended vitamin D and calcium intakes and by case surveillance for nutritional rickets. Periodic nutrition surveys of dietary intakes and vitamin D status enable policymakers to assess the level of population risk for nutritional rickets. Conventional wisdom would have it that nutritional rickets is primarily due to vitamin D deficiency, although dietary calcium intake modulates the severity and rapidity of onset of the disease Isolated case reports of rickets developing in infants and toddlers, who were placed on very low-calcium diets, have been published More convincing evidence of dietary calcium deficiency as a cause for rickets in children comes from studies in South Africa In South Africa, the children typically come from rural areas and present with signs and symptoms of rickets between the ages of 4 and 15 Radiologically, the features are typical of calciopenic rickets with osteopenia and features of hyperparathyroidism being frequent findings ( The biochemical features are similar to those of other causes of calciopenic rickets. Hypocalcemia, low urinary calcium excretion, and elevated serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are characteristic, while serum phosphorus Iliac crest bone biopsies reveal evidence of osteomalacia and hyperparathyroidism in those children who have radiologic features of rickets In both the Nigerian and South African studies, clinical, biochemical, and radiologic healing has been achieved through increasing the calcium intake of the children to between 800 and 1500 The data available from epidemiologic studies conducted in a rural area in South Africa in which a number of the affected children live, suggest that asymptomatic dietary calcium deficiency is prevalent in school children living in that area. Some 13% of children between the ages of 7 and 12 Although dietary calcium intakes in children with biochemical changes suggestive of dietary calcium deficiency are very low, it is unclear what role the high phytate or oxalate contents of the diet play in aggravating the symptoms. Nevertheless, biochemical improvement can be achieved by supplementing the children with 500 Nutritional rickets has been viewed for some time as being due to an inadequate supply of vitamin D through either an inadequate dietary intake or insufficient skin exposure to UV radiation, or more recently due to low dietary calcium intake in the face of a normal vitamin D status. However, these pathogenetic concepts are too simplistic. Early studies by Mellanby The resurgence of rickets and osteomalacia in the Asian community in Great Britain provided the impetus for detailed studies into the pathogenesis of vitamin D deficiency and bone disease in that community. Although vitamin D deficiency as assessed by circulating 25(OH)D concentrations is the hallmark of the disease in Asians Over the past 25 Thus nutritional rickets has a spectrum of pathogenetic mechanisms ranging from pure vitamin D deficiency associated with adequate calcium intakes, as might occur in the breast-fed infant, at one end of the spectrum, to pure dietary calcium deficiency with an adequate vitamin D status, as documented in Nigerian and South African rural children, at the other end A number of studies have highlighted the complex interaction between vitamin D and calcium intakes in the pathogenesis of nutritional rickets in children. A review of 43 patents diagnosed as having nutritional rickets in New Haven, Connecticut, found low 25(OH)D levels in only 22%, and the majority of infants had been weaned onto diets with minimal dairy content Despite readily accessible and effective means to eradicate rickets globally, the disease remains a major public health problem in many countries, not only in temperate regions of the world but also in tropical and subtropical countries. In many developed countries, the promotion of exclusive breast-feeding during the first 6 There remains a need for international agencies to place the eradication of vitamin D deficiency among young children in many parts of the world as a priority. Nutritional rickets not only leads to an increased infant mortality but also has long-term sequelae.
