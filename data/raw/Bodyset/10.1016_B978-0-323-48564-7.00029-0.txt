Fractures of the scaphoid result in well-known predictive patterns of wrist arthritis. Slade and Geissler proposed a revised classification of scaphoid nonunions to match the healing potential of a scaphoid nonunion to a specific treatment algorithm. Utilizing this classification, type Iâ€“III scaphoid nonunions may be addressed with a headless cannulated screw and do not require bone grafting. Type IV scaphoid nonunions require some type of grafting, either demineralized bone matrix or cancellous cone. These surgeries may be performed purely arthroscopically or open surgery. In small proximal pole fractures where greater stability is desired, the midcarpal joint may be temporary locked to increase the stability to the small proximal pole fragment.
