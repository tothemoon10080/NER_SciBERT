The article describes main methods for regulation of the secondary voltage of furnace transformers (FT) of high-power arc steel furnaces (ASF), their advantages and drawbacks are outlined. Within consideration of the non-contact and high-speed regulation of FT voltage, the emphasis is put on using thyristor voltage regulator deployed in the intermediate circuit. The comparative evaluation of main energy indicators of the FT-ASF complex are given within using thyristor regulator of secondary FT voltage, and of traditional methods for controlling electric modes of ASFs by means of affecting the furnace transformed as the high-speed executive component of the regulation system. Main electric modes that can be obtained through using thyristor regulator of the furnace transformer in case of supporting the constant primary current in the FT, are considered. Results are obtained using a math model of the FT-ASF electrotechnical complex, developed in MATLAB Simulink package.
