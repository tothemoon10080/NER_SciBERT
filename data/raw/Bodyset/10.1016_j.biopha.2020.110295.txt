Background
                  The treatment of displaced calcaneal fractures is controversial.Open reduction and internal fixation are widely described as the gold standard in the literature,but these technique shave many complications,including skin necrosis,internal fixation leakage and deep infection and wound healing problems.Percutaneous reduction and unilateral external fixation have received increasing attention because they can provide a good, stable reduction and reduce the soft tissue complications caused by open surgery(such as deep infection and delayed wound healing).The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the reduction imaging and clinical results of calcaneus traction compressionwith orthopaedic compression reduction forceps combined with percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation for intra-articular calcaneal fractures.
               
                  Methods
                  This was a retrospective analysis. A total of 35 patients with unilateral calcaneal fractures were divided into two groups: 1) the open reduction, internal fixation group (19 feet)and 2) the percutaneous minimally invasive, closed reduction external fixation group (16 feet).Evaluation of the reduction include dimaging measurements of the calcaneus length,width,and height,and the Bohler angle and Gissane angle before and after surgery.Clinical outcomes included the time of surgery,length of hospital stay,operation time,wound-related complications,the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score,the visual analogue score for pain, and the SF-36 score.
               
                  Results
                  The average follow-up time was 25.52 ± 1.68 months.There was no significant difference in reduction between the open group and the closed group (P > 0.05).The operation time of the open group was significantly longer than that of the closed group(P = 0.0001).The length of hospitalization and waiting time for surgery in the open reduction group were significantly longer than those in the closed reduction group (P < 0.05).Incidence-related complications in the open group and closed group were 21.1 %(4/19) and 6.3 %(1/16),respectively (P = 0.0001).The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores in the open and closed groups were 81.35 ± 5.25 and 82.52 ± 4.78, respectively (P = 0.0875). The visual analogues cale (VAS) scores of the open group and the closed group were 1.81 ± 1.32 and 0.78 ± 0.91, respectively (P = 0.0412).The SF-36 scores were 80 ± 4.5 and 79 ± 4.2, respectively.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Our research shows that for various types of intra-articular calcaneal fractures compared with open reduction,internal plate fixation,calcaneus traction compression with orthopaedic reduction forceps combined with percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation is a simple and effective method for treating calcaneal fractures; not only can the calcaneus be corrected, but it can also provide notable imaging and clinical results.Calcaneal fractures are a common lower extremity injury, accounting for 2% of all fractures and 60 % of tarsal fractures [ To minimize the soft tissue complications caused by the lateral approach and to fully manage the displaced bone in the joint, minimally invasive techniques have become increasingly popular in recent studies.Minimally invasive methods and percutaneous techniques are designed to avoid these frequently occurring and recurring problems,ensure good reduction and reduce complications.Closed reduction or percutaneous reduction with external fixation is a minimally invasive technique.After preoperative CT scanning,most of the displaced joints are reset and stabilized,and the risk of open surgery is greatly reduced.A large number of preliminary studies have been conducted on the application of external fixation forcalcaneal fractures,which are generally accepted in rescue or open fracture repair [ We retrospectively studied 35 patients with new unilateral intra-articular calcaneal fractures admitted from January 2012 to December 2018,including 21 males and 14 females,with an average age of 42.8 years(20–65 years).Patients with closed,displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures were included before surgery.Patients with open calcaneal fractures,previous fractures or a surgical history of lower extremities, vascular disease,and neurological complications were excluded.The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the open reduction internal fixation group and the percutaneous minimally invasive closed-reduction external fixation group. The patient's age,sex,injury mechanism,waiting time for admission and follow-up time were recorded. These patients had standard X-ray and CT evidence of Sanders type II,type III or type IV fractures.The open reduction,internal plate fixation group included 19 foot fractures:9 cases of Sanders type II,8 cases of Sanders type III,and 2 cases of Sanders IV.In the closed reduction, external fixation group,16 feet were fractured,including 10 cases of Sanders type II,5 cases of Sanders type III,and 1 case of Sanders type IV.Based on the preoperative and postoperative calcaneal imaging measurements, the VAS scores,length of hospital stay, related complications,and the AOFAS hindfoot scores and SF-36 scores from the last follow-up after surgery and 3 days after surgery were recorded for clinical evaluation of the results.This study is a randomized controlled study based on the "CONSORT Statement" guidelines [ The patient lied on the side of the operative bed with the affected limb on the top.The tourniquet was placed,and the C-arm was correctly placed to obtain sagittal and axial X-rays.Open reduction,internal plate fixation involved selecting a calcaneus locking plate and useda lateral extension approach.In the percutaneous closure group,calcaneal traction compression with orthopaedic reduction forceps and a round bone needle were used to complete the fixed reduction ( Antibiotics(cefosporin sodium pentahydrate 1.0 g, intravenously) was used to prevent infection once within 24 h after surgery,and naltrexate calcium(4100 IU daily subcutaneous injection) was used as ananti coagulant until 35 days after surgery.The foot was elevated,and the root of the Kirschner wire was replaced with sterile alcohol gauze daily to prevent infection at the pinhole.The patient was allowed to walk on crutches on the second day after the operation,butweight-bearing onthe affected limb prohibited.Partial weight-bearing was performed at the 4th week after the operation, and outpatient removal was performed 6 weeks after external fixation without anaesthesia.Eight weeks after surgery,full weight bearing was allowed,and active and passive activities of the ankle and hip joints were performed immediately after surgery. X-rays and CT images were reviewed on the day after surgery to understand the fracture reduction and Kirschner wire position.Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed 4 weeks,8 weeks,6 months,and 12 months after surgery.All patients were followed up for more than 2years(average 25.52 ± 1.68 months (range from 12 to 34). Paired Student’s ttests were used to assess the reduction,length of stay,and scores for the different treatment groups.Chi-square tests were applied for the complication rates.Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.The SPSS statistical software package for Windows (22.0) was used for the statistical analysis. All patients in the two groups completed at least one year of follow-up, and we found that there were no significant differences in the basic characteristics between the treatment groups:sex,age, injury mechanism,Sanders classification of the calcaneal fractures and follow-up time ( The operation time forthe open reduction group was longer than that forthe percutaneous closed reduction group(90.21 ± 8.23 min and 65.55 ± 12.23 min, respectively,P = 0.0001).The hospital stays ofthe open group and closed group were 10.81 ± 2.52 and 7.56 ± 1.96 days, respectively (P = 0.0001).The waiting time from admission to surgery in the open group and closed group was 5.75 ± 1.71 and 3.12 ± 1.52 days, respectively (P = 0.0001), and the time from admission to operation in the closed reduction group was significantly shorter than that in the open reduction group (P < 0.05).The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the incision group and the closed group on the third day after surgery were 1.81 ± 1.32 and 0.78 ± 0.91, respectively (P = 0.0412).We found that the time required for patients to return to work wasvery different.Overall,the incidence of incision-related complications in the open and closed groups was 21.1 %(4/19) and 6.3 %(1/16), respectively (P = 0.0001).The AOFAS hindfoot scores in the open and closed groups were 81.35 ± 5.25 and 82.52 ± 4.78, respectively (P = 0.0875).The SF-36 scores of the open group and the closed group were 80 ± 4.5 and 79 ± 4.2, respectively (P = 0.0621).At the last follow-up,there was no significant difference in the AOFAS hindfoot score and SF-36 score between the two groups ( Calcaneal fractures account for 2% of all fractures,of which 80%–90% are found in young people [ The percutaneous external fixation technique is feasible for any type of intra-articular calcaneal fracture, especially those with severe soft tissue injuries [ This study also hassome limitations. First, the study cohort is relatively small,especially in terms of Sanders IV patients. Second, the follow-up time is short,and it takes a longer time to evaluate the changes in the subtalar joints. Finally, there is a lack of multicentre randomized controlled studies,which may lead to selection bias.There fore,randomized multicentre controlled clinical trials are still needed before implementation. The focus of this study wasto compare the curative effect of open reduction,internal plate fixation and the application of calcaneal traction compression with orthopaedic reduction forceps assisted by percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation to treat calcaneal fractures.Calcaneus traction compression with orthopaedic reduction forceps and auxiliary external fixation can complete aclosed reduction very well, and the reduction results are satisfactory. There was no significant difference between the incision group and the percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation group in terms of calcaneal length, width, height, Bohler angle or Gissane angle. Evaluation of the clinical results showed that there was no significant difference between the AOFAS and SF-36 scores. The percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation group's surgery, hospitalization, and hospitalization waiting times were better than those of the incision group. The VAS score and complication rate were lower 3 days after surgery, indicating the obvious advantages of the minimally invasive treatment. The results of this study confirm that for all types of intra-articular calcaneal fractures, the application of calcaneus traction compression with orthopaedic reduction forceps assistive technology and percutaneous minimally invasive external fixation is due to its wide range of surgical indications, not limited by the swelling of the skin and soft tissues and the exact reduction effect In addition to other advantages, it is an effective and reliable alternative treatment.
