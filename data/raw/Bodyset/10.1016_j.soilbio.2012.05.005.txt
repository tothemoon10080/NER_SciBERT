Rapid flooding of wetland soil promotes subsurface N2O production in the soil and potential emission to the atmosphere in distinctive emission pulses. Changes in flooding frequency of wetland soil following future climate change will likely affect the timing and magnitude of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the soil to the atmosphere. From October 2009 to October 2010, rapid flooding of a natural Danish wetland was observed twice in response to high precipitation events. A flooding-induced N2O emission pulse (delay ∼16 h; duration ∼12 h; total emission 1.83 mg N2O–N m−2, max. emissions ∼250 μg N2O–N m−2 h−1) was observed when the soil conditions in the top soil had been oxidized for more than 2–3 weeks prior to flooding. This flooding-induced N2O emission pulse constituted ∼2.5% of the annual net N2O emissions of 0.74 kg N2O–N ha−1 yr−1. A net uptake of atmospheric N2O was observed during mid-summer when the WL was at its seasonally lowest counterbalancing ∼6.4% of the total annual net N2O emission budget. Main surface emission periods of N2O were observed when the water level and associated peaks in subsurface N2O concentrations were gradually decreasing to soil depths down to 40 cm below the surface. These surface emission patterns are predominantly linked to variations in plant-mediated gas transport via Phalaris arundinacea and N2O producing/consuming processes in the root zone. Soil flooding experiments using high-resolution N2O microsensors demonstrate very large N2O production and consumption capacities where >500 nmol N2O cm−3 were sequentially produced and consumed in less than 24 h. It is concluded that a higher future frequency of flooding-induced N2O emissions will have a very limited effect on the net annual N2O emission budget as long as

At the selected study site, The water level (WL) was measured using a pressure sensor (PCR 1830 series, Druck; ThermX, San Diego, CA, USA) submerged in a 2 m long perforated plastic tube placed in a sand cast drill hole. The sensor was mounted on a horizontal bar attached to 3 m long stainless steel rods inserted into the underlying mineral soil, to avoid potential measurement errors caused by seasonal displacement of the surface following swelling and shrinkage of the peat soil.

The soil core was split, homogenized and passed through a 2 mm mesh to remove the aboveground vegetation roots larger than 2 mm. Two experimental columns were constructed from a heavy walled PVC tube (Inner diameter: 70 mm, outer diameter: 90 mm; height: 100 mm) and closed at the bottom with a butyl rubber plug (height: 30 mm) to avoid diffusive gas loss at the lower boundary.
