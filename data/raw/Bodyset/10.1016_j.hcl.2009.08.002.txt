No area of fracture management has had such a recent explosion of new treatment modalities as distal radius plating. This explosion has largely been implant- and industry-driven, with little evidence-based research guiding the way. A perceived difficulty with commonly used modalities by the orthopedic community has been enough to drive an entire new set of options for distal radius fixation. A drift from dorsal to volar plating has occurred that has been unexamined by randomized research. Segment specific fixation has been a new mindset that has resulted in a novel plate line and has caused other manufacturers to redesign their product lines. Other novel approaches for proposed problems include locking plates, nail-plate combinations, and others. This article outlines some of these options with a literature opinion and a clarification from the authors. A treatment plan for common fractures of the distal radius is also outlined.
