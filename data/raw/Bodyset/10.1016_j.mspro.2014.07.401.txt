In this work, the change in mechanical properties, microstructure and wear rate of high leaded tin bronze material was studied after multidirectional forging (MDF) process. The total equivalent strain of 0.75 was applied during MDF process result in the improvement of ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, hardness and wear rate along with maintained ductility with the increase in the number of MDF pass. The initial average grain size of 120nm was refined to the final grain size of 37nm. The transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope and optical microscope was used for the microstructure study of the undeformed, MDForged and wear worn surfaces.
