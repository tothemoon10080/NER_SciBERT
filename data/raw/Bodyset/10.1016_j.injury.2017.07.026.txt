Actually, pilon fractures are classified according to AO and Ruedi Allgower classification systems based on X-rays. These classifications are less reproducible and do not provide necessary information for proper surgical planning. Aim of the study is to (1) propose a new classification system based on CT scan; (2) to check the prognostic value of this classification and (3) to evaluate its reliability and (4) reproducibility.
                  We retrospectively reviewed 71 cases of pilon fracture. All fractures were classified according to AO, Ruedi Allgower and new proposed classification system by 5 surgeons. Clinical and radiographic evaluation were performed at a mean follow-up of 36 months. Cohen’s K value was calculated in order to evaluate the interobserver and intraobserver agreement.
                  Sixty-four of 71 fractures healed. Average AOFAS score was 91,7±7,8 in the Type I of new classification proposed, 87,7±7,8 in the Type II, 82±18,6 in type III, and 67,2±20,9 in type IV. Using the AO classification system the average K weighted value among the five reviewers was 0,51; using Ruedi Allgower classification it was 0,50 and using the new classification system it was 0,88 (p<0.0005).
                  This study demonstrated that the new classification system is prognostic, reliable and reproducible. Moreover it provides a new treatment-oriented classification for this challenging fracture which affect the quality of life of the patients more than chronic diseases like diabetes and coronaropathy or pelvic fractures.The ankle fractures that involve the weight-bearing articular surface of the distal tibia with proximal extension are known as pilon fractures These fractures are among the most complex injuries of the lower limb and their management is technically demanding Surgical treatment of these fractures is challenging, and creates several difficulties, both in restoration of the articular surface and axial alignment of the tibia and in management of the surrounding soft tissue. In order to obtain good results, a staged management protocol and a biological friendly surgical technique using a thoughtful CT scan-based plan are required. The importance of the pre-operative CT scan evaluation has been demonstrated in several studies These classifications are less reproducible and do not provide adequate information for proper surgical planning The study was approved by the local ethics committee and follows the Declaration of Helsinki for ethical principles for medical research involving humans. The new classification system is based on 4 labeling factors, evaluated on the CT-scan: (1) joint involvement of fracture, (2) the displacement and the number of articular fragments, (3) the plane along which the major fracture line lies at the joint level, and (4) areas of comminution. According to these findings the classification system is divided in four different types (         In order to estimate the prognostic value, the reliability and reproducibility of this classification we retrospectively reviewed the records of 71 cases of pilon fracture, treated in our Level I Trauma Center from January 2010 to December 2014. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. During this period 96 patients affected by pilon fracture were treated in our hospital. Twenty-three patients who presented one of the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) older than 75 years; (2) younger than 18 years; (3) lack of preoperative CT-scan; (4) neurological disorders. Two patients died before review, and three patients were lost during follow-up. At last 68 patients were included in the study, for a total of 71 pilon fractures enrolled (3 patients were bilateral) ( All documents including pre and post-operative clinical reports, X-rays and CT scans were evaluated. Clinical reports were examinated in order to check if the inclusion/exclusion criteria were met and to identify operative procedures, associated lesions and complications. At last available follow-up, radiographic and clinical evaluation using AOFAS score were performed All fractures were classified by 5 surgeons accordingly to the AO classification, Ruedi Allgower classification and the new system proposed. Among the 5 surgeons, one was senior surgeon with more than 20 years of experience in orthopaedics trauma surgery, 2 surgeons had more than 5 years of experience in orthopaedics trauma surgery and 2 were senior residents. All the authors repeated the classification session two times with at least one week between the repeated measurements. The Kendall Tau-B correlation between the AOFAS scores at the last follow-up and the new classification, the AO classification and the Ruedi Allgower classification, was used to assess the prognostic value of each types of fracture we evaluated. A multivariate analysis using the multiple regression with backward Wald method was then performed to detect factors (sex, age, associated lesions, type of surgery, etc.) other than classifications to predict AOFAS. The General Linear Model (GLM), with AOFAS as the dependent variable and the classifications as covariates, was finally performed to compare the prediction strength of each classification. The partial eta squared was used to measure the prediction strength. To investigate the reliability of the classification systems we evaluated the interobserver agreement for each method of classification using the weighted Kappa statistics described by Fleiss Data analysis was performed using SPSS The literature proposes the following classification for K value: less than 0.4 poor agreement, from 0.4 to 0.6 moderate agreement, from 0.6 to 0.8 good agreement and from 0.8 to 1 excellent agreement Sixty-four of 71 fractures healed. The mean follow up was 36 months (range 18–71 months). All the fractures are classified according AO, Ruedi Allgower and new classification system. Average The new classification showed a higher ordinal correlation with AOFAS score than AO and Ruedi Allgower classification. Tau B Kendall value was −0.389 for new classification system, −0,293 for AO classification and −0,293 for Ruedi Allgower classification. Then for each classification, a multivariate analysis using the multiple regression with backward Wald method was performed to detect factors other than the considered classification to predict AOFAS. The result of the analysis showed that no other factors besides the classifications influenced the AOFAS score. Finally, the General Linear Model (GLM), with AOFAS as the dependent variable and the three classifications as covariates, was performed to compare the prediction strength of each classification, the other two being equal. The result was that the new classification was the significant one and had a higher partial eta squared ( Using the AO classification system the average K weighted value among the five reviewers was 0,51; using Ruedi Allgower classification it was 0,50 and using the new classification system it was 0,88 (p Using the AO classification system the average K weighted value was 0,59; using the Ruedi Allgower classification was 0,56 and using the new classification proposed was 0,90 (p The new classification system has a significantly higher intra-observer agreement than the other two classifications (p An ideal fracture classification system should be simple, all inclusive, reliable and reproducible. Furthermore, a treatment oriented classification should provide prognostic information based on the outcome of different fracture patterns, in order to help the surgeon improving preoperative planning and treatment Currently the tibial pilon fractures are classified according to Ruedi Allgower and AO classification system These systems, are simple, all-inclusive and have a good prognostic value; however they do not provide accurate information on fracture morphology for preoperative planning and demonstrated fair to moderate interobserver reliability In this study we proposed a new classification system based on CT scan in order to be prognostic, reliable, reproducible and useful for preoperative planning and surgical management. The new classification system was simple, all inclusive and easily to remember. Like Neer classification for proximal humerus fractures, this classification divides the pilon fracture in 4 groups according to the number of the fragments at the joint level. Therefore, non-displaced fractures or extra-articular fractures (1 articular fragment) are included in group I. Two parts fractures are included in group II, 3 parts fractures in group III and 4 parts and comminuted fractures are included in group IV. In order to check the prognostic value of the proposed classification, the correlation between the different types of fracture and clinical outcomes were evaluated using the AOFAS scores. The new classification system showed a very good prognostic value with worse clinical results in type III and type IV fractures. Our study demonstrated as good prognostic value as reported in the literature for the AO and Ruedi Allgower classifications However, comparing the prognostic value among all 3 classification systems, the multivariate analysis showed a higher significant correlation between clinical results and the new classification system if compared to the other classifications. The main limitation of currently used classification systems (AO and Ruedi Allgower) for pilon fractures is that they have shown fair to moderate reliability and reproducibility This difference may be due to the use of a CT scan as a preoperative imaging modality, which permits a better identification of all articular fragments, their displacements and the areas of comminution. The importance of the CT scan was demonstrated in several studies. Tornetta e Gorup showed that, preoperative CT scan evaluation permits to obtain more useful information, like fragments invisible on radiographs, areas of comminution and the direction of the major fracture line in 82% of cases, and caused planning modification and eventually final treatment in 64% of cases Topliss et al. In conclusion, the new classification system is prognostic, reliable, reproducible and can become an useful instrument to adequately correlate the long term outcomes of these fractures. In our opinion, the new proposed classification system provides a better three dimensional evaluation of pilon fracture which can improve preoperative planning and subsequently surgical treatment of this challenging fracture which affect the quality of life more than chronic diseases like diabetes and coronaropathy or pelvic fracture The main limitations of this study are the intrinsic weakness of a retrospective study and the great variability of applied surgical techniques. With the aim to validate this classification system and to use it in a prognostic manner that can drive the surgical plan, a multicentric/cross cultural prospective study should be designed.
