Purpose
                  The existing classification systems of tibial plateau fracture (TPF) are suboptimal for clinical use and academic communication. A more comprehensive and universal classification system with the capability to analyze all patterns of TPF is urgently required to guide the clinical practice. This study aimed to analyze the incidence and fracture characteristics of TPF using a computed tomography-based “four-column and nine-segment” classification.
               
                  Methods
                  According to the differentiated morphological characteristics, tibial plateau and proximal fibula were divided into four columns, which were subdivided into nine segments. Tibia plateau injury index (TPII) was innovatively introduced to represent the extent of injury. A total of 698 consecutive adult patients with 704 affected knees were included (377 females, 321 males, mean age 51.6 ± 12.9 years). Fracture mapping was retrospectively analyzed according to the new-style classification system based on the CT imaging.
               
                  Results
                  371 (53.2%) left knees and 321 (46.0%) right knees were injured solely and 6 (0.9%) cases sustained bilateral injuries. The rates of one-column, two-column, three-column and all-four-column injuries were 30.5%, 31.5%, 28.0% and 9.9%, respectively. On average, 2.2 ± 1.0 columns and 3.6 ± 2.1 segments were involved, the mean TPII was 5.7 ± 3.0. The rates of mild, moderate and severe comminuted fractures were 50.0%, 37.5% and 12.5%. The most frequently affected columns were lateral column (572, 81.3%) and intermedial column (524, 74.4%), and the less frequently involved columns were the medial column (219, 31.1%) and fibular column (218, 31.0%). The most frequently affected segments were the posterolateral segment (465, 66.1%), anterolateral segment (453, 64.3%) and posteromedian segment (379, 53.8%). The least frequently involved segment was tubercle segment (85, 12.1%).
               
                  Conclusions
                  The novel “four-column and nine-segment” classification will be a beneficial classification system for clinical diagnosis, statistical analysis and prognostic judgment of tibial plateau fractures.Tibial plateau fracture (TPF) can be caused by high-energy mechanisms such as traffic accidents in young people, or by less violent trauma, like falling down in the elderly. Without meticulous management, there can be disastrous outcomes, resulting in severe disability [ Several studies had compared the reliability and reproducibility between the commonly used classification systems, but couldn’t reach agreement on the best choice for TPF [ A more comprehensive and universal classification system with the capability to analyze all patterns of TPF is urgently required to guide the clinical practice. We designed a CT-based “four-column and nine-segment classification”. The purpose of this study is to analyze the incidence and fracture characteristics of TPF using the new-style classification system. From December 2007 to May 2018, a total of 749 adult patients with TPF at the Affiliated People’s Hospital with Jiangsu University were enrolled. The patients with isolated avulsion fractures of anterior/posterior cruciate ligament (ACL/PCL) and patellar ligament (PL) were included. And 33 cases with insufficient CT information were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included bullet wounds, cutting, club violence, bone defects, pathological fractures and periprosthesic fractures, as well as congenital or acquired malformation of the tibial plateau and severe osteoporosis. Therefore, a total of 698 patients (377 males and 321 females) with 704 affected knees were included in this study. The work has been approved by the ethical committees of hospital. Different from previous reports, the authors defined the tibial plateau as an area from the superior tibial articular level surface to the bottom of inferior tibial tubercle ( The tibial plateau and proximal fibula were divided into four columns: medial, intermedial, lateral and fibular, which were further subdivided into nine segments. The upper articular surface covered by articular cartilage was marked as medial and lateral columns, while the area without the cartilage was defined as intermedial column. The medial and lateral columns were subdivided into four segments (segment a + b, g + h) by the connecting line between the most anterior rim of the fibular head and the center of the knee (midpoint of two tibial spines) ( The nine segments were: anteromedial segment (a), posteromedial segment (b, attached by MCL), tubercle segment (c, attached by PL), bare area (segment d, between the top level of the tubercle and the tibial insertion of ACL), median segment (e, attached by ACL), posteromedian segment (f, attached by PCL), anterolateral segment (g), posterolateral segment (h), and fibular segment (i, attached by LCL and other structure). General principle: The medial/lateral column was considered undamaged when the articular surface of this column was intact, no matter whether the inferolateral cortex was damaged or not. The injury types of the medial/lateral column were: type 0 - no fracture, type 1 - rim avulsion or rim depression, type 2 - pure depression of articular surface, type 3 - cleavage extending to homolateral cortex with or without articular surface depression, type 4 - cleavage extending to the diaphysis, type 5 - cleavage extending to the contralateral cortex, and type 6 - cleavage extending to the bilateral cortex simultaneously ( The injury types of the intermedial column (segments c, e, f) were: type 1 - cleavage without free fragment, type 2 - dissociative segmental fragments, and type 3 - comminuted fracture ( The special injury types of the bare area (segment d) were: type 1 - pure depression, type 2 - cleavage extending to posterior cortex with no displacement, and type 3 - cleavage extending to posterior cortex with significant displacement ( The injury types of the fibular column (segment i) were: type 1 - avulsion fracture of fibular apex (“arcuate sign”), type 2 - fibular head fracture, type 3 - proximal diaphyseal fracture, and type 4 - proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation. Two expanding types were: EX1- LCL tear and EX2 - avulsion fracture of lateral femoral condyle ( All injury types of columns and segments were shown in the schematic TPII is equal to the number of injured column(s) plus the number of segment(s), omitting the extending types. The complexity level of TPF was classified into three grades: mild comminuted (TPII: 2–5), moderate comminuted (TPII: 6–9) and severe comminuted (TPII: 10–13). Based on the CT imaging of TPF, the involved column/segment, injury type, and TPII of each patient was retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). Qualitative data are shown as n (percentage) and quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD. A two-sided A total of 698 adult patients (377 males, 321 females) with 704 affected knees were included, of which the TPF of OTA/AO type 41-A, B and C were totally involved. The rate of suffering TPF was higher in males than in females (M vs. F = 377 vs. 321, 1:0.85), while the mean age of males (18–85 years) was significantly younger than that of females (19–89 years) (M vs. F = 49.8 ± 12.3 vs. 53.7 ± 13.3, P＜0.001). Patients’ biographical data are presented in 371 (53.2%) left knees and 321 (46.0%) right knees were injured solely and 6 (0.9%) patients sustained bilateral injuries. The two-column injury rate (222 cases, 31.5%) and the one-column injury rate (215 cases, 30.5%) were the highest, the three-column injury rate (197 cases, 28.0%) was lower, and the all-four-column injury rate (70 cases, 9.9%) was the lowest. On average, 2.2 ± 1.0 columns and 3.6 ± 2.1 segments were involved, and the mean TPII was 5.7 ± 3.0. There was no statistic difference in gender (M vs. F 5.8 ± 2.9 vs. 5.7 ± 3.0, P＞0.05) and knee side (L vs. R: 5.8 ± 2.9 vs. 5.6 ± 3.0, P＞0.05). The rates of mild, moderate and severe comminuted fractures were 50.0% (352/704), 37.5% (264/704) and 12.5% (88/704). The injury types and amount of all columns and segments were listed in Generally, there are at most six injury types and two extending types for special columns or segments. For the medial/lateral column, the most frequently injury type was type 3 (homolateral) in both columns (medial, 138/219, 63.0%; lateral, 267/572, 46.7%). Notably, 36 and 45 cases of injury type 1 (rim avulsion or depression) were observed respectively in medial and lateral columns, which was highly related to the ligament tear. Furthermore, 27 and 107 cases of injury type 2 (pure depression) were found respectively in medial and lateral columns. In the intermedial column, type 1 (cleavage) was the most frequently injury type in segment c (56/85, 65.9%), e (132/334, 40.0%) and f (131/379, 34.6%). The second most frequent injury type was type 3 (comminution) in segment e (104/273, 38.1%) and f (108/320, 33.8%), and the least frequent injury type was type 2 in segment e (73/334, 21.9%) and f (119/379, 31.4%). In the special injury types of segment d, the cases of type 1 (120/279, 43.0%) and type 3 (98/279, 35.1%) were about twice of that of type 2 (61/279, 21.9%). Most interestingly, in the presence of TPF, 218 cases (31.0%) with proximal fibula fractures (segment i) were observed, of which the most frequently injury type was type 2 (113/218, 40.5%), followed by type 1 (61/218, 28.0%), and type 4 was observed only in 1 case. The incidence of EX1 was omitted for indistinguishable in CT. EX2 of medial column, segment c, segment e and fibula column was respectively observed in 13 cases (1.8%), 10 cases (1.4%), 2 cases (2.8%) and 11 cases (1.6%). EX2 of segment f was not found in the cohort. In this study, we analyzed the most frequently affected columns and segments of TPF according to a new-style classification. Several improvement aspects of this novel classification are explained as followed: First, four columns covers crucial structure fully. Early-stage classifications (Hohl, Schatzker, OTA/AO 2007) were established based on the plain film [ Among the four columns, the lower rate of medial column injury (31.1%) and the higher rate of lateral column injury (81.3%) was consistent with the previous studies, which was generated from anatomical differences between the medial and lateral plateau [ Second, sufficient injury types of medial/lateral columns. Type 1 - rim avulsion or compression (e.g., segond fracture or reverse segond fracture) was highly correlated to the ligament injury, which was equal to OTA/AO classification 41-A1, Khan classification R1&R2, and Hohl-Moore classification type 3&4 [ Third, ligament tear and insertion fracture were common in TPF. Gardner et al. identified 77% (80/103) as complete ACL or LCL injury in operative patients and Stannard et al. reported that 71% (73/103) cases had at least one ligament tear and 53% (55/103) cases had multiple ligament injuries (total cohort 103: ACL 45, PCL 41, MCL 16, PLC 46) [ The ligament insertion fracture was usually generated from direct extrusion of adjacent bone (compressed injury) or avulsion of ligament (tensive injury, equal to the ligament tear). Hardly any classification could precisely record the injury information of ligaments and insertion fracture in TPF, which are categorized as three injury types (cleavage, dissociation, comminution) and two extending types (ligament tear, upper insertion avulsion) in the new-style classification. Regardless of isolated insertion fracture or combined intra-articular TPF, five injury types are sufficient for early treatment determination. For the medial column, two extending types about MCL is usually involved in valgus injury pattern [ Among the intermedial column, tibial tubercle (segment c) fracture (OTA/AO 41-A1.2) was not rare in the TPF, lacking of category for adults [ The avulsion of the ACL/PCL tibial insertion were coded as OTA/AO 41-A1.3 [ PCL tibial insertion (segment f) fractures were very common in TPF. Kim et al. reported 6 isolated PCL injuries, 1 PCL injury and posterolateral rotatory instability and 6 PCL avulsion fractures in 13 TPF patients [ Proximal fibula is firmly connected to tibial plateau by the tibiofibular syndesmosis, which affects the TPF fragment displacement and surgical approach deeply. The proximal fibula (segment i) fracture was recorded as 41-A1.1 in OTA/AO classification 2007 and coded independently as 4F1A/4F1B in latest 2018 edition with the qualifications: extraarticular or intraarticular [ The Segond fracture, an avulsion of the anterolateral ligament (ALL), was recorded as type 1 of lateral column [ Fourth, all classifications attempted to clarify the complicated injury mechanism of TPF, aiming to improve reduction and clinic outcome. Schatzker classification roughly explained the mechanism as valgus (type I–III),varus (type Ⅳ) and neutral (type Ⅴ, Ⅵ) which were lucid in the coronal plane [ Combining the injury types with the extent of displacement and the implicative range [ Most of uncomplicated TPF can be simplified as one kind of coronal injury in combination with another kind of sagittal injury, for example hyperextension-varus injury [ Fifth, the hyperextension TPF (OTA/AO 41C) presented several characteristics as followed: (1) compression of the anterosuperior cortex (bare area), (2) decreased or reversed posterior slope, (3) tension failure of the posterior cortex, and (4) avulsion fracture of fibula head or PCL/PLC tear [ Sixth, we identified a subset of bicondylar TPF (6/704, 0.9%) (OTA/AO 41-C) with a hyperflexion deformity which had been insufficiently mentioned in the literatures. The characteristic fracture line extending from the posterosuperior articular surface margin to anteroinferior tibial tubercle in the sagittal plane was diametrically opposite to fracture line extending from anterosuperior margin to posteroinferior cortex in hyperextension TPF. Hyperflexion TPF presented several characteristics as followed: (1) mild-to-moderate compression of posterosuperior margin cortex even intact articular surface (2) increased posterior slope, (3) tensional fracture of tibial tubercle, and (4) ACL tear or avulsion fracture occasionally. By analysis of the pathomorphic features of representative cases, we speculated that the uncomprehending injury mechanism was not exactly the same between hyperflexion and classical flexion injury triad [ Seventh, the new-style classification evaluate the complexity level of TPF objectively using a digitized index (ranged 2–13), other than ambiguously describing low-energy variants (Schatzker types I–III) and high-energy variants (Schatzker types Ⅳ–Ⅵ) [ Eighth, there is no intuitional approach to depict the injury patterns of TPF, which has caused inconvenience in academic communication. We proposed an innovative tabular approach to record TPF that could incorporate the patient’s profile and all injury types of involved columns/segments. If available, the information of meniscus injury could also be listed. For instance, a 20-year-old woman encountered a car accident and suffered a left-side TPF complicated by hemopneumothorax. CT showed the injuries referring to intermedial column (segment d, type 1; segment e, type 3; segment f, type 1), lateral column (segment g + h, type 3), and combing with an avulsion fracture of the femoral insertion of MCL (EX2) ( Rotation force, which played a significant role in ligament injury, was included in the extending types. Besides, the terms “fracture-subluxation/dislocation”, lacking of an exact definition and category, were omitted for the simplification and accuracy. Limited by space, the reliability, reproducibility and clinical guidance of this classification will be further discussed in subsequent articles. In summary, this study established a new CT-based classification and indicated the most frequently affected columns and segments in TPF. Moreover, the injury mechanism was concluded, the hyperextension TPF was classified and a new injury pattern “hyperflexion” was raised. Also, TPII and record chart to assess and record the fracture information were proposed. The novel “four-column and nine-segment” classification will be a beneficial classification system for clinical diagnosis, statistical analysis and prognostic judgment of tibial plateau fracture.
