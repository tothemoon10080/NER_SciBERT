                     . Batch experiments were carefully designed to explore a wide range of operating conditions without precipitating any secondary phases, namely amorphous silica or magnesium carbonates. The operational range included solutions whose compositions were very close to solubility of the dissolving silicate species. Expressions for specific dissolution rates were developed in order to describe the experimentally measured near-equilibrium, non-steady state dissolution profiles. The near-equilibrium kinetic model was able to describe the evolution of the concentration profiles of

The effects of all the phenomena above have been observed and documented in literature (e.g. This publication will build upon the far-from-equilibrium modeling work described in Hariharan et al. The influence of pH, In the case of forsteritic silicate, the specific dissolution rate under far-from-equilibrium, acidic conditions was written as Rimstidt et al. performed a comprehensive statistical analysis on forsterite dissolution rates by analyzing all the data that were reported in the literature Under the conditions relevant for CO We assume that a ligand-adsorbed site, The complete rate expression for the dissolution of forsteritic silicate in the presence of bicarbonate ligands can then be written as the sum of the dissolution rates of the bicarbonate-free and of the bicarbonate-adsorbed sites: The equilibrium for forsterite dissolution can be written as In the far-from-equilibrium model, the dissolution mechanism of Si-rich species at At near-equilibrium solution compositions, the reversible dissolution of the Here the dotted lines represent the interface between the dissolving silicate, on the left, and the aqueous solution, on the right. As an example, the deprotonated surface site, As the real nature of the Si-rich species, the leaching of the following relationship holds:  Therefore, the reversible dissolution of the Si-rich species can be written as: The temperature dependence of Lizardite is present in smaller amounts only in the core of PDL particles in the case of a heterogeneous particle structure The above expression has been shown to be valid at The evolution of the instantaneous concentration of either solute ( PDL particles were obtained from Shell Global Solutions International as a milled sub – 125 Isothermal batch dissolution experiments were performed on an EasyMax™ synthesis workstation (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). A 140 The conductivity probe was calibrated in order to track the evolution of Dissolution experiments were performed at Preliminary test experiments showed that the withdrawal of such a high volume fraction of the reactor solution affected the subsequent dissolution dynamics in a non-reproducible way. Therefore, it was decided to stop the first experimental run after sampling and to start the second and the third experimental runs by following the exact same procedure. The second and the third experimental runs were then allowed to run until Besides the initial solution compositions, the maximum values of the theoretical pH, the activity ratio In order to validate the assumption of perfect The experimentally measured they cover a wide range of values of pH, the solid loadings, Deviations from perfect For the sake of simplicity, all simulation plots shown in this study assume the homogeneous particle structure, though the discussion presented and the conclusions drawn are valid for both particle structures. In the kinetic model that we have developed, bicarbonate ions affect the dissolution rate of the forsteritic silicate as described in Eq. The effect of CO The dissolution rate of the forsteritic silicate is affected by the presence of  The dissolution rate of Si-rich species was assumed to be affected by the presence of The rate limiting step for an aqueous CO Mineral dissolution is a complicated process and often involves a multitude of phenomena. In this study, we have made several assumptions and simplifications to develop the equations that describe experimentally measured dissolution rates over a wide range of operating conditions. Nevertheless such a simplified model allows for an accurate quantitative description of both the far-from-equilibrium and the near-equilibrium dissolution profiles, within the range of operating conditions considered in this study, and in the absence of passivating amorphous silica layers. Precipitating amorphous silica has been shown not to completely inhibit the dissolution of PDL particles Financial support from the A number of studies exist in literature that describe the evolution of solution conductivity, The conductivity of the solution composed of different ions The limiting equivalent conductance is calculated from the definition of mobility of an ion The temperature dependence of From Eq.
