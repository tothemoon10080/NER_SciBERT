Monosize quartz sand suspensions (53, 45 and 38μm) were prepared in water at 60% solids weight and were ground for a fixed period of 10min, in a lab ball mill (16Φ×18cm), with steel balls of 4, 3, and 2cm in diameter. Resulting size distributions were fitted to the Swrebec function. This function was initially proposed to fit coarse size distribution (as in the case of blasting and crushing processes), with an excellent correlation coefficient, showing that this function can be used with good results in fine grinding.Description of particle size distribution (PSD) is probably among the most important physical characteristics of granulated materials, being determinant, for instance, in the combustion efficiency of pulverized coal, casting time in cement, flowing characteristics in pneumatic conveying, agglomeration properties in powder metallurgy, etc. Traditional PSD models such as GGS and RR Considering that cumulative passing function F(x) follows: Considering f(x As a consequence, the Swrebec distribution function can be described: In the case of wet grinding, quartz sands were used with 96% SiO  Composition of quartz sands was determined using XRF methodology and results are shown in Results in the case of grinding product size of monosize 53 It seems interesting to notice that, within the size interval studied, ball size has no great influence on x The Swrebec function seems to obtain a good modeling of PSD functions, thus becoming a sound alternative to traditional functions. As can be seen in Results prove that the Swrebec function not only fits with reasonably good accuracy PSD in coarse size range, as is well known and recorded in the literature, but can be used to describe PSD in fine grinding. Results also show very good values of the correlation coefficient, so it can be recommended in modeling and simulation processes throughout the particle size range. Further research is programmed to correlate material breakage parameters and classification model parameters with Swrebec model parameters. G. Restrepo and A.
