Flotation performance is most commonly represented using grade-recovery curves, with a shift upwards and to the right indicating an improvement in performance. The problem with using grade recovery curves, especially on plant data, is that position and shape of the curve is strongly influenced by both the feed rate and grade to the circuit. In this paper a method for representing flotation performance in a way that is independent of the feed grade and rate is presented. This uses the principle that both the concentrate grade and mass pull are defined by what is in the cell and the cell operating conditions. This means that for cells operating at the same conditions, there is a single relationship between the tailings grade and concentrate grade and between the tailings grade and mass pull. In this paper a semi-empirical form for these relationships is presented. Using these relationships together with a mass balance the effect that feed rate and grade have on flotation performance is explored.Grade-recovery curves are the standard way in which flotation bank and plant performance are represented as it is a clear way of showing the trade-off between the two main objectives of flotation, namely achieving a high grade concentrate while sacrificing as little recovery as possible. Grade recovery curves are also often used to compare the performance of different sets of operating conditions, reagent suites, cell designs etc., with a shift in the curve upwards and/or to the right indicating an improvement in performance. The big problem with carrying out these comparisons on plant is that grade-recovery curve is also very sensitive to variations in both feed grade and feed rate. Since plants often have quite variable feed grades and rates, a fair comparison based purely on grade-recovery curves can be hard to make. This is illustrated in The question that this paper will attempt to address is how the effect of feed conditions can be accounted for when comparing grade recovery curves. This paper will build on a method describe in a previous paper by the authors ( The methodology developed here is based on the assumption that the separation occurring in the froth and the rate at which solids enter the froth (the pulp zone kinetics), are uniquely defined by the conditions prevalent in the pulp in each cell. This is considered reasonable, as in most flotation plants the slurry feed rate is low enough so that changes in the feed rate do not affect significantly the cell hydrodynamics. This means that the flotation performance of each individual cell depends only on the cell operating conditions (air rate, froth depth, impeller speed and so forth) and the composition of the pulp It will also be assumed that the composition of the pulp can be characterised by its grade. This has the useful implication that only the pulp grade in each cell is required to predict the cell performance. This is likely to hold for both the pulp and the froth (for the same operating conditions such as froth depth and air rate); for the pulp this can be appreciated purely from rate kinetic considerations, while the froth performance depends on the material presented to the froth from the pulp. The two key relationships in this approach are therefore that the concentrate grade ( The most important benefit of this approach is that data from the same type of cells, operating under similar conditions down a bank can be combined as a single relationship. This can then be used for prediction of, for example, different feed rates and feed grades (as will be shown later). Of course, different concentrate grade and mass rate to concentrate relationships are required for different operating conditions, such as air rate or froth depth. Taking the tailings grades, concentrate grades and mass pulls used to produce all the grade recovery curves in The mass balance around any flotation cell can be solved by knowing the feed grade, From this information, the tailings grades, For a bank of cells, the calculations can be done using two different approaches. In the first approach, the known feed rate and grade to the first cell are used, and the above equations solved iteratively. The tailings from the first cell become the feed to the second, which is solved in the same way, and so on. This requires iteration for each cell. In the second approach, the calculation is done in reverse; the tailings grade and rate from the last cell are assumed, and from them the concentrate grade and mass rate directly calculated. The feed to the last cell is the combination of the tailings and concentrate, and becomes the tailings of the previous cell. This is repeated to the head of the bank. The single iteration here is to adjust the assumed values of the tailings grade and rate until the feed rate and grade are correct. Both approaches are easy on a spreadsheet. The first has the benefit that more cells can be added easily, but requires multiple iterative solutions. The second requires only a single solving step, but is less flexible when adjusting the number of cells. In this section semi-empirical equations for the concentrate grade and mass rate to concentrate curves will be derived. This allows the curves fitted to the data to be described by a small number of relevant parameters with physical meaning. It is also a necessary step towards predicting the grade recovery curves.                The mass balance equations are based on first order rate kinetics for the floatable material in the tank, adjusted by a single froth recovery. The mass rate of entrained material is proportional to the amount of water collected. The floatable material reports to the concentrate by flotation and entrainment. These basic assumptions are often used (e.g. The mass rates of floatable material, The mass fraction of floatable material in the concentrate, The single rate constant kinetic equation describes the recovery rate of floatable material, using the concentration of the floatable material in the tank. In practice it is difficult to distinguish between the floatable material and non-floatable material in a stream. It is thus more useful to write the expressions in terms of the grades of valuable material (e.g. Cu), rather than of the floatable material. This requires two parameters; the mass fraction of valuable material in the floatable component, As Eq. By combining terms, and simplifying, the grade of valuable material reporting to the concentrate, The total mass rate to the concentrate, Occasionally, especially at the head of rougher banks, bubble carrying capacity becomes the limiting factor and the flotation rate becomes zero order with respect to pulp grade. A derivation for these conditions is included in Eq. This is a non-linear equation relating Similarly, for This linear equation relates  The relationship between mass pull and tailings grade is quite close to linear, though the slope does increase slightly with tailings grade. This is probably because this slope is proportional to the froth recovery, which is likely to be higher at higher tailings grades. The relationship between concentrate grade and tailings grade can not only be used to predict bank grade-recovery curves, but can be used to analyse the behaviour of the cells directly. This is especially true if this analysis is coupled with Eq. Each set of data has been fitted to Eq. It can be seen from As illustration of the potential of the approach, the two equations fitted to the data in The nominal feed rate used was 100 The feed rate was changed by 50% from the nominal, i.e. down to 50 The feed grade was varied up and down by 50%; i.e. down to 0.25% and up to 0.75%. The results are shown in It is of interest that the response of the flotation banks to changes in feed rate and grade are very different, and that a variation of equal magnitude in the feed properties has effects of very different magnitude and direction in the performance (see While this paper has only predicted the grade and recovery down banks of flotation cells, the same instantaneous grade and instantaneous recovery curves can be used to predict the performance of any circuit configuration; the only limitations being that the tailings grades must be within the experimental data range unless there is adequate confidence in extrapolation. This method can also only be used to model banks or circuits which consist of different types of cells or cells operating at different operating conditions for which the relationship between concentrate grade and tailings grade and mass pull and tailings grade are known. This paper has demonstrated that it is possible to represent flotation performance in a manner that is independent of the feed grade and feed rate, allowing for more objective comparisons between the effects of different sets of operating conditions. The paper has also demonstrated that this method can predict the effect of changing feed conditions on the performance of a flotation bank. Rate kinetics need to be based on the grade of floatable material, while the more easily measurable quantity is the grade of the valuable material (e.g. metal grade). These quantities can be related to one another by mass balance. To do this mass balance two variables To express this as a grade of valuable material we need to introduce two new grades, namely the grade of the valuable material in the floating, Combining Eqs. Flotation cells usually display 1st order rate kinetics with respect to the floatable material concentration. Occasionally, especially in the first cell or two in the rougher bank, the carrying capacity of the bubbles becomes the limiting factor and the rate kinetics become zero order with respect to the floatable material concentration. Let This can therefore be identified as a region in which the mass rate to concentrate becomes independent of the grade in the tank (or tailings grade), The simplest way of accounting for the maximum bubble loading is to assign a tailings grade at which the behaviour changes from 1st to zero order. Below this value the behaviour will follow Eqs. The tailings grade at which the system switches from 1st order to zero order can be obtained by equating Eqs. The first order rate constant is usually proportional to the flow of surface area (while not actually a flux, this quantity is usually referred to as the bubble surface area flux in the literature): This implies that this critical grade is independent of air rate, bubble size and froth conditions (e.g. froth height), though it could depend on frother concentration if the frother also acts as a collector (influences the proportionality
