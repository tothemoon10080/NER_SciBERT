For hybrid systems which incorporate both dynamical and discrete event models in process industries, the mass balance models will be changed because of discrete scheduling events. The redundancy degree of whole sensor network is time variant so that the conventional data reconciliation is very difficult to be implemented. In this paper a new approach of data reconciliation for hybrid system is proposed and its industrial application is discussed. The whole process includes 15 units and more than 100 tanks. Comparing with AspenTech Advisor, the application results demonstrate the efficiency and consistency of the proposed approach.
