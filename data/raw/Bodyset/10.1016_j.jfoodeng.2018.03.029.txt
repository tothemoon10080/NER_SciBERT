The combination of steam blanching (SB) with Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) treatments of whole tomatoes, in addition to reducing the energy required for tomato peeling, can significantly contribute to the recovery of carotenoids from the peels.
                  In this work, PEF (0.25-0-75 kV/cm, 1 kJ/kg) and SB (1 min at 50–70 °C), as pre-treatment prior to hand peeling, were investigated to assess their ability, separately and in combination, to induce the cell permeabilization of tomato peels, and hence to improve the carotenoids extraction in acetone (4 h at 25 °C).
                  PEF and SB, by inducing significant damages at the cuticular level, caused the increase of the yield in total carotenoids (up to 188% for PEF and 189% for SB) and antioxidant power (up to 372% for PEF and 305% for SB) with respect to the peels from untreated tomatoes. The application of a combined treatment (PEF + SB) significantly increased the carotenoid content and the antioxidant power of the extracts, with a synergistic effect observed already at 60 °C (37.9 mg/100 g fresh weight tomato peels). HPLC analyses revealed that lycopene was the main carotenoid extracted and that neither PEF nor SB caused any selective release or degradation of lycopene.
                  Results obtained from this study demonstrate that the integration of PEF in the processing line of tomato fruits prior to SB contributes to the valorization of tomato processing by-products.Tomato ( Thus, the industrial transformation of tomatoes typically includes a peeling phase of the fruits, consisting in the use of either hot lye solutions or steam blanching (SB), which, however, suffers from various disadvantages such as disposal of caustic, high pH waste solution, and excessive water and energy consumption ( Recently, the “FieldFood” (635632-FieldFOOD-H2020) project investigated the possibility of coupling a mild pre-treatment of whole tomatoes by pulsed electric field (PEF) at field strength and energy input below 1 kV/cm and 1 kJ/kg, respectively, with SB, as a less energy-intensive peeling treatment, as compared with a conventional peeling process ( However, as suggested by the vast literature on the topic, PEF pre-treatment might be expected to have a beneficial effect also on the permeabilization of the tomato peels, enabling the recovery of valuable intracellular compounds ( Tomato peels, together with seeds and unused pulp, are the main by-products of tomato fruit processing, representing 2–5% in weight of the total processed tomatoes ( The tomato peels currently find low-added value uses as animal feed and fertilizers ( Carotenoid compounds are natural pigments, with health-beneficial properties, which are accumulated in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of several fruits during ripening ( Lycopene, along with β-carotene, is an authorized natural pigment for several types of food products ( For all the above reasons, in the last decade the global market of carotenoids exhibited a tremendous growth, which is expected to reach around US$ 1.53 billion in 2021, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.78% between 2016 and 2021 ( Conventional extraction processes of carotenoids are usually based on the maceration of the by-products using an organic solvent (e.g., acetone, hexane, ethanol, diethyl ether, methanol and petroleum ether) or a solvent mixture with high affinity for lipid-soluble compounds ( Therefore, the implementation of an innovative wet disruption method, such as PEF, has been proposed as an intensification pre-treatment in the extraction of valuable intracellular compounds from food residues, which is also able to prevent their degradation, reduce the energy costs, the solvent consumption and shorten the treatment time ( Many investigations have proved that PEF can enhance the extraction yield of water-soluble natural pigments and antioxidant compounds such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins from a wide range of food processing by-products ( In particular, to date, only the study of In addition, no studies have been published on the extractability of carotenoids from tomato processed by-products (peels), after steam blanching (SB) of whole tomato fruits. The objective of this work was to investigate the use of PEF, alone and in combination with SB, as pre-treatment of whole tomato fruits, with the aim of improving the extractability of carotenoids from tomato processing by-products (peels). Specifically, the effects of different electric field strengths and steam blanching temperatures on the cell disintegration index of peel tissue, as well as on the total content and composition of carotenoids and antioxidant activity of the extracts were investigated. Fully ripened tomatoes of the “ Color measurements were performed on the surface of tomatoes with a tristimulus colorimeter CR400 Chroma Meter (Konika Minolta Inc., Japan). Five readings were taken at random positions from each fruit. Data were collected in CIE L*a*b* color space and the values of L*, a* and b* were recorded and used to evaluate the combination parameter hue (H) angle, which indicates the actual color or the redness. Tomatoes of similar size (about 2.6 cm in diameter) and color (H = 45.8 ± 1.8) were selected prior to PEF, SB or PEF + SB pre-treatments, in order to use fruits that exhibited a homogeneous carotenoid concentration ( Physical-chemical parameters of selected tomatoes, such as total soluble solids (6.53 ± 0.15°Brix), titratable acidity (0.44 ± 0.05 g citric acid/100 g fresh weight tomatoes) and moisture content (90.2 ± 0.8 g HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile as well as acetone, iron (III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl PEF-assisted extraction of carotenoids from tomato peels was carried out using a laboratory scale batch system. It consisted of a high voltage pulsed power (20 kV-500 A) generator (Modulator PG, ScandiNova, Uppsala, Sweden) able to generate monopolar square wave pulses (3–25 μs, 1–450 Hz). The generator was connected by a high voltage cable to a batch parallel plate treatment chamber ( For each experiments, approximately 150 g of whole tomatoes (10 fruits) were subjected to PEF, SB or PEF + SB pre-treatments. In a first set of experiments, tomato fruits were loaded into the PEF treatment chamber with tap water at a constant solid to liquid ratio (1:1 g/mL) and exposed to different field strengths (E = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 kV/cm) at a constant total specific energy input (1 kJ/kg), frequency (10 Hz) and pulse width (20 μs). These PEF parameters were determined on the basis of preliminary experiments to ensure the preservation of the fruit integrity, and improve its peelability ( After the electrical pre-treatment, tomato fruits were hand peeled, and square pieces (1 cm Samples of identical size and shape were manually cut from the peels recovered from untreated tomato fruits, to be used as controls. A second set of experiments investigated the effect of the pre-treatment of tomato fruits, based either on SB alone or on its combination with PEF (PEF + SB), on the extraction yield of carotenoids from the tomato peels. Fresh and PEF treated tomato fruits were subjected to SB in a lab-scale steam oven (Minea, SO25P, France) for 1 min at different blanching temperatures (T The extracts from untreated and treated (PEF, SB, PEF + SB) samples were then centrifuged at 5700 × g (PK121R model, ALC International, Cologno Monzese, IT) for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the supernatant, which was then filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters. The final extracts were then stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Cell disintegration index (Z The total carotenoid (TC) content of tomato peels extracts from untreated and treated samples was determined according to the method described by FRAP assay of tomato peels extracts was carried out according to the method described by The FRAP working solution was prepared by freshly mixing 0.3 M sodium acetate buffer, 10 mM TPTZ solution, and 20 mM ferric solution at a ratio of 10:1:1 (v/v/v). For the analysis, 2.5 mL of freshly prepared FRAP working solution and 0.5 mL of undiluted extract were mixed and incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. The change in absorbance due to the reduction of ferric-tripyridyltriazine (Fe III-TPTZ) complex by the antioxidants contained in the samples was monitored at 593 nm using a V-650 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Jasco Inc., Easton, USA). The absorption of blank samples (applying the same analysis conditions) were tested each time before and after analysis. Trolox was used as the standard for calibration curve and the FRAP values were expressed as mmol of Trolox equivalents (mmol TE) per 100 g of FW tomato peels. All the assays were performed in triplicate. For the identification of individual carotenoids, the tomato peel extracts of untreated and treated samples were further analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Carotenoids were separated using a Waters 1525 series HPLC system, equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector (DAD) (Waters Corporation, USA). Analytical separation of carotenoids was carried out in a Waters Spherisorb C18 reverse phase column (5 μm ODS2, 4,6 mm × 250 mm, Water Corporation, USA). The temperature of the HPLC column was set at 30 °C. Before the injection, the tomato peel extracts were filtered through 0.20 μm filters. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/methanol (30:70, v/v). The flow rate of the mobile phase through the column and the injection volume were 1.5 mL/min and 100 μL, respectively. The absorbance detection wavelength was 472 nm. The identification of the major carotenoids in tomato peel extracts was carried out by comparing their retention times and absorption spectra with those described in the literature data ( All experiments and analysis of collected samples were performed in triplicate, and the mean values and standard deviations (SD) of experimental data were calculated. Statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) between the means were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the Tukey's test. The Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) statistical package.  The amount of TC extracted from the untreated samples was 9.26 mg/100 g FW tomato peels, which is consistent with previous observations showing that a substantial amount of carotenoids (in particular lycopene) are accumulated in the skins of tomato fruits ( The permeabilization degree of the cell membranes of the tomato peel tissues upon the exposure of the whole fruits to an external electric field was determined in terms of PEF-induced permeabilization of cell membranes is effective in improving pigments extractability from plant tissues, such as anthocyanins from grape pomace, blueberry press cake, purple-fleshed potato, red prickly pear peels and red cabbage ( A qualitative analysis of the composition of the peel extracts was carried out via HPLC, with the resulting chromatogram profiles, detected at 470 nm, reported in In particular, in The strong positive correlation, observed also between TC content and lycopene content in peel extracts ( Moreover, it is worth noting that, in comparison with the control sample, the application of PEF pre-treatment caused a remarkable increment of the lycopene peak area of 52%, 192%, and 231% at 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 kV/cm, respectively. Similar results were observed by other authors, when comparing the anthocyanin profile in the extracts from PEF treated blueberries and purple-fleshed potato ( Additionally, also the antioxidant power of the carotenoids (particularly lycopene) contained in the peel extracts was assessed using the FRAP assay. As shown in The results of this study hence suggest that, within the range of field strength investigated, the cell disintegration level ( Further investigations of PEF pre-treatment in combination with SB of tomato fruits were, therefore, carried out at 0.5 kV/cm with a constant energy input of 1 kJ/kg. Steam blanching (SB) is a unit operation typically used to facilitate peel removal from tomato fruits during the manufacturing of several tomato products. Therefore, in view of the exploitation as a cheap and rich source of natural carotenoids of the large amounts of tomato processed by-products (peels) currently produced at the industrial level, the impact of SB pre-treatment on the cell structure of peel tissues and the subsequent recovery of these compounds should be evaluated. Eventually, the application of a mild cell disintegration technique such as PEF in combination with SB of tomato fruits could be used to further intensify the extractability of valuable intracellular compounds. In this work, extracts obtained from peels of whole tomato fruits pre-treated by SB (1 min) alone or by the sequence of PEF (E = 0.50 kV/cm, W The results of It is likely that in the blanching temperature range examined, the improved extractability of carotenoids when increasing temperature can be related to the thermal damage induced at the cuticular level ( In contrast, when PEF pre-treatment was applied prior to SB, the TC content rose to significantly higher values (p = 0.05) with respect to the thermally treated samples for blanching temperatures of 50 and 60 °C, while a slight but not significant increase was observed when the temperature was increased to 70 °C. No statistical difference was, instead, observed among the PEF + SB treated samples ( However, it is worth noting that the combined treatment showed an additive effect in the extraction yield of TC at the blanching temperature of 50 °C, whereas a synergistic effect was observed at 60 °C, corresponding to a maximum value of 37.9 mg/100 g FW tomato peels. Further increasing the SB temperature up to 70 °C, instead, caused a slight but not significant decrease in the amount of TC extracted, as compared with the combined treatment performed at lower temperatures. From these results, it might be concluded that the electroporation effect induced by PEF prior to the thermal treatment enables the intensified recovery of valuable compounds at lower blanching temperature, probably because of the reduced thermal stress that could negatively affect the extraction and bioavailability of thermolabile compounds. Similarly, previously published works demonstrated that PEF permeabilization of plant tissue before extraction has the potential of decreasing the extraction temperature without affecting the extraction yield ( The results of Moreover, the results of As expected, the greater release of carotenoids, particularly of lycopene, detected in the extracts of peels obtained after SB or PEF + SB of tomato fruits, markedly increased also the antioxidant power of the extracts, as shown in Furthermore, the combination of PEF with SB resulted in a significantly (p = 0.05) higher antioxidant activity of the extracts, as compared with the thermally treated samples, without any statistical difference detected only at the highest blanching temperature investigated. The observed increase in the antioxidant activities of the peel extracts, detected after SB alone or in combination with PEF (PEF + SB) when increasing the blanching temperature, correlate well with the higher content of carotenoids and lycopene in the extracts, showing a stronger correlation especially for samples obtained from fruits treated by SB alone ( The results of this study have demonstrated the efficacy of the pre-treatment of whole tomato fruits, typically applied to facilitate tomato peelability, also on the extractability of carotenoids from tomato peels. In particular, the cell disintegration induced at the cuticular level by either the electrical and/or thermal treatment improves the penetration of the solvent into the cytoplasm and the subsequent mass transfer of the solubilized intracellular pigments, thus intensifying the extractability of carotenoid compounds. More specifically, the application of a pulsed electric field treatment (E = 0.5 kV/cm; W This work demonstrates the potential of PEF pre-treatment, in combination with mild steam blanching, to be implemented in the industrial processing of tomato fruits, to achieve the valorization of the tomato processing by-products. However, further studies are required to fully validate the implementation of PEF technology at industrial scale, through the extension of this research to other tomato cultivars in semi-industrial/real industrial conditions, also as a function of the ripening stage of the raw material.
