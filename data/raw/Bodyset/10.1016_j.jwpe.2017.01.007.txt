Hydraulic tracer studies for horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands require addition of a conservative chemical tracer to track the flow path of wastewater inside subsurface media. However since one would wish to use fully conservative tracers disposal problems of the wetland effluent are created. In this study the use of heat as a hydraulic tracer was explored. Heat is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical tracers as the post-study wetland and effluent temperature equilibrates to ambient conditions. Nevertheless the non-conservative behaviour of heat creates a distorted response curve at the outlet from which the hydraulic performance indices cannot be easily computed. In this paper we were able to develop a mapping methodology accepting a heat tracer response curve as an input and is converted to a conservative chemical tracer response curve by establishing a mathematical relationship between heat and conservative solute hydrodynamic dispersion. The methodology was tested by conducting a dual heat-chemical tracer study on a laboratory-scale unplanted subsurface flow constructed wetland and the predicted chemical tracer response was compared with the actual experimental chemical tracer response data. The predicted response curve adequately matched the experimental response curve supported by the fact that there was a 5% and 6% relative difference in Peclet number and mean of the RTD respectively. The outcome of this study is that it is possible to use the proposed mapping methodology in conjunction with a heat tracer to quantify hydraulic behaviour of subsurface flow constructed wetlands without having to use a conservative chemical tracer.Longitudinal solute dispersivity Transverse solute dispersivity Interfacial mass transfer coefficient Interfacial surface area Longitudinal thermal dispersivity Transverse thermal dispersivity Concentration of dye at time t Initial wetland tracer concentration Wetland inlet tracer concentration Concentration of chemical dye as t Outlet concentration Fluid specific heat capacity Solid specific heat capacity Specific heat capacity of gravel Specific heat capacity of water Thickness of pinewood Thickness of polystyrene Thickness of pond liner Chemical dispersion coefficient Heat dispersion in fluid phase Molecular diffusion coefficient Packed bed porosity Effective volume utilization Residence time distribution function Complementary error function Cumulative distribution function Zero order production coefficient Interfacial heat transfer coefficient Packed bed depth Convective heat transfer coefficient of air Convective heat transfer coefficient of water Distribution coefficient Thermal conductivity of gravel Solid thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity of water System thermal conductivity Thermal conductivity of pinewood Thermal conductivity of polystyrene Thermal conductivity of pond liner Heat dispersion coefficient Packed bed length First order decay coefficient Number of equally sized CSTRs placed in series Peclet number Fluid density Solid density Bulk density Gravel density Water density Chemical retardation factor Thermal retardation factor Variance Adsorbed solid concentration Nominal residence time Time Mean of residence time distribution Temperature Ambient temperature Fluid temperature Initial wetland temperature Wetland inlet temperature Solid temperature Pore water velocity Wall heat transfer coefficient Volumetric flow rate Total volume of reactor Packed bed width Distance Residence time distribution (RTD) studies are used to assess the hydraulic performance of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) Heat has frequently been used in hydrogeology as a tracer for groundwater movement To date, little has been published regarding the use of heat as a tracer for RTD studies on HSSF CWs and is most likely due to its non-conservative behaviour. In this study we sought to develop a mathematical model, based on transport phenomena theory, which maps an input of response data obtained from a non-invasive tracer in the form of heat to the response curve which would be obtained from a conservative chemical tracer. This approach would allow for accurate hydraulic behaviour of the wetland to be ascertained without having to tackle the environmental hazards posed by conservative tracers. The model was then tested by conducting a combined conservative solute and heat tracer RTD study on a laboratory-scale HSSF CW. The shape of the predicted conservative tracer response curve was compared with the actual experimental response curve as well as their corresponding hydraulic performance indices. The overall aim of developing a methodology to obtain accurate hydraulic information of an HSSF CW using a heat tracer could be achieved by fulfilling the following research objectives: To develop the heat tracer transport equation with a similar form or functionality to the chemical tracer transport equation. To solve the chemical and heat tracer transport equations subject to initial and boundary conditions applicable to a step change RTD study. To establish a mathematical relationship between the heat and chemical tracer hence allowing transferral of data from the heat space to chemical space. To test the methodology by conducting a dual heat and chemical tracer study on a laboratory scale unplanted HSSF CW. An RTD study is used to quantify the extent of mixing inside an HSSF CW Hydraulic behaviour is described by determining the first and second temporal moments of the response curve in The second temporal moment is the variance of the response curve, which provides an indication of the spread of tracer as it flows through the system σ In this approach the response curve is analysed to determine the number of equally sized continuously stirred tanks reactors (CSTRs) placed in series that will provide the same In this method the RTD function, By performing a mass balance on tracer about to leave at time t we obtain  The conceptual thinking behind the methodology was developed for the impulse response experiment from which the Hydrodynamic dispersion can be quantified by fitting the response curve to the solution of the partial differential equation describing movement of a chemical tracer inside the subsurface media, as provided in  The heat tracer transport equation is developed by drawing analogies with the chemical tracer transport equation presented in It is assumed that fluid and solid temperatures at the solid-pore interface equilibrate rapidly Since the purpose of this study is to map heat tracer data to a non-reactive chemical tracer  The initial condition for Similar to the chemical tracer, the appropriate boundary conditions are a step change in temperature in the wetland feed at time zero and the semi-infinite assumption, expressed in  The development of the methodology as well as subsequent testing is summarized in the flowchart presented in The proposed mapping methodology requires fitting the solution to the heat tracer transport equation, as shown in Hydrodynamic dispersivity is a function of the subsurface media heterogeneity and is, in essence, the physical property which an RTD study attempts to evaluate. Based on this premise the total thermal dispersivity should be equal to the total chemical dispersivity of the system Therefore re-arranging The methodology developed herein was tested by conducting a combined chemical and heat hydraulic tracer study on a laboratory-scale unplanted HSSF CW with the experimental set up presented in The external support trough of the wetland consisted of 20 The feed tank used for the hydraulic study was placed 4 The chemical tracer used in the hydraulic study was FWT Red (Cole-Parmer, USA) which is a variant of Rhodamine WT applicable to water tracing. The dye was assumed to be conservative and non-sorbing Temperature was logged at the wetland inlet and outlet using type K thermocouples and tracer samples were collected at the outlet in 2 Chemical tracer samples were analysed immediately after sample aliquot collection. A spectrophotometer (Merck Spectroquant Pharo 300) was used to measure the absorbance at a wavelength of 550 Curve fitting was used during two phases of the modelling exercise; to determine λ The least fit chromosomes are discarded and hence each successive generation contains fitter solutions to the problem. The algorithm is said to be converged when the relative difference of at least 99% of the candidate solutions is less than the specified tolerance. In In In The experimental and predicted chemical tracer response curves are presented in There appears to be no lag between the two curves hence validating the assumption made in the development of the mapping methodology that K A methodology was developed ( We wish to thank the School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering Workshop at the University of the Witwatersrand for their assistance with the experimental set up.
