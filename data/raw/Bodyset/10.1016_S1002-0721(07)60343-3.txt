The synthesis of precursor of green phosphors, LaPO4 : Ce, Tb, by means of co-precipitation with cocurrent flow feed was studied. The effects of the reaction temperature, the kind and concentration of the acid in the bottom water, and the charging rate on the physical properties, such as particle size, were investigated. It is found that the particle size of the powder is controllable by adjusting acidity in bottom water and charging rate. The powder with diameter size of 3 to 5 Î¼m was obtained. Its XRD and SEM were analyzed. XRD patterns of the as-prepared green phosphor powders display the typical peaks of CePO4. SEM shows that the morphology of powders is ball-shaped.
