Pulverized firing oil shale ash belongs to a group of wastes characterized by a relatively high theoretical CO2 capture capacity as well as very low specific surface area. Low porosity inhibits the availability of free lime for hydration and carbonation reactions, especially in the case of continuous flow processes where the recirculating process water is saturated with different species leached from oil shale ash (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, OH-, SO4
                     2−) and absorbed from the flue gases (CO3
                     2-, HCO3
                     -, HSO3
                     −). This study was focused on examining the inhibitory effect of each of the main species in process water on the availability of lime for hydration and carbonation reactions.
