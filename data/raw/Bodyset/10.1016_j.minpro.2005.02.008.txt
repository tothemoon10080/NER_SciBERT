Non-magnetized suspensions of magnetite particles with concentrations in excess of 30% by mass and particle size less than 75 μm exhibit Bingham plastic behaviour. When exposed to external magnetic fields of strengths in excess of 41×10−4 T, the rheological behaviour of the suspensions departs from the Bingham model and can be described by a Herschel–Bulkley model of the form τ

The value of the index n was found to range from 0.38 to 0.9, depending on the magnetic field strength, solids concentration and particle size and correlations are proposed for the apparent viscosity of magnetized suspensions as a function of magnetic field strength and solids concentration.It is well-known that the rheology of concentrated mineral suspensions is dominated by the interaction between particles that could be related to Van der Waals forces, electrical double layer effects, structural (hydration) forces, steric and electrosteric effects, and other polymer-based interactions, etc. Likewise, from an engineering perspective, the influence of temperature, solids concentration, particle size and shape, pH, zeta potential, presence of surfactants and other factors on the rheology of slurries have been studied extensively ( Magnetorheological fluids are interesting materials, composed of particles suspended in liquids whose rheological properties can be altered dramatically, rapidly, and reversibly by the application of external magnetic fields. Currently, few magnetorheological devices have made it to commercialization, owing to a lack of effective fluids ( Experiments were conducted with magnetite concentrate from a mine in South Africa that mainly consisted of magnetite, quartz, manganese oxide and pyrite. The material was separated by sieving into four size fractions, viz. +75 μm, −75 The magnetite suspensions were placed in plastic containers in uniform adjustable external magnetic fields with strengths ranging from 0 to 350 Rheological measurements of non-magnetized and magnetized suspensions were conducted in a Haake rotational viscometer over shear rates ranging from 87 to 2770 s  The apparent viscosity increases sharply as the solids concentration increases to more than 50% by mass, owing to a significant increase in interaction between the particles. The change in apparent viscosity at different shear rates and solids concentration has been attributed to a change in the internal structure of the suspensions ( The flow curves of the suspensions shown in The effects of a uniform magnetic field on the flow curves of the suspensions of magnetite containing different particle concentrations and size fractions are shown in At low magnetic field strengths ( From  These magnetorheological effects can be explained by considering the microstructure of the suspension. The magnetic particles in suspension are polarized under the influence of the external magnetic field, resulting in increased interaction between particles and the formation of magnetic chains or flocs ( Since magnetite is ferromagnetic, the magnetic interaction between the non-colloidal particles is large compared to other interactions, such as those associated with electric double layers and van der Waals forces. The magnetic polarization reaches a limit known as the saturation polarization and a remanent polarization, which explain the limit observed in the apparent viscosity of the suspensions. The maximum packing fraction of suspensions shows the packing efficiency of particles and was used to correlate the relative viscosity of suspensions, which are sensitive to particle size distributions and particle shapes ( The value of for −75  for −53  for −38 μm:  The shear stress and apparent viscosity versus shear rate curves of magnetized suspensions of magnetite after mechanical agitation are shown in  Experiments have shown that in the absence of an external magnetic field, a Bingham model represented the rheological behaviour of suspensions of magnetite, the parameters of which depended linearly on the volumetric concentration of solids ( After exposure to a uniform magnetic field, the shear stress of the magnetite suspensions increased significantly. The rheological behaviour of magnetized suspensions of magnetite in magnetic fields in excess of 113 The apparent viscosity of magnetized suspensions of magnetite increased with an increase in magnetic field strength. The apparent viscosity of the magnetized suspensions reached a limit when the magnetic field strength was larger than 113 The observed rheology was dependent on the magnetic field strength, solids concentration and particle size fraction and could in principle be controlled by mechanical agitation of the suspension.
