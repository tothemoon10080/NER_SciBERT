In this work, a comparative study of electrochemical performance of reduced graphene oxide–ferrites (RGO-MFe2O4, M=Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn) nanohybrids synthesized by hydrothermal method was done. The structural morphology and investigation of other physical properties of nanohybrids confirm the cubic spinel phase of the MFe2O4, reduction of graphene oxide and the distribution of ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) on RGO nanosheets. The role of RGO on the electrochemical behavior of nanohybrids was understood by quantifying the charge storage capacitance and charging-discharging behavior in a 0.1M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance values of pristine Fe3O4, CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 are 128, 117, 15.2 and 9.1Fg−1 respectively whereas specific capacitance of RGO-Fe3O4, RGO-CoFe2O4, RGO-NiFe2O4 and RGO-ZnFe2O4 are 233, 200, 25 and 66.8Fg−1 respectively. Our investigation suggests that apart from specific surface area of nanohybrids other factors such as structural morphology determine interaction between nanohybrids and electrolyte ions which play critical role in elevating the performance of electrodes.Electrochemical energy storage devices that rely on charge storage mechanisms due to the interaction of the electrolyte ions and the electrode material have become popular in recent years Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are electrochemical devices that store energy by the mechanism of reversible adsorption of electrolyte ions or by redox reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces of high surface area electrodes In this work, we have synthesized four types of RGO-MFe Graphite powder with a particle size of 45 Hummer’s method was used to synthesize GO which involves subsequent oxidation of graphite powder by using strong oxidizers X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips powder diffractometer PW3040/60 with CuKα radiation) was used to analyze the crystallographic structures of the RGO-MFe XRD patterns of MFe The structures and morphologies of the ferrites nanoparticles before incorporating them into RGO matrix can be understood from the Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) images.
