The sub-micron sized YAG:Ce phosphors were synthesized via a modified sol-gel method by peptizing nano-pesudoboehmite particulate. It is found that YAG phase from the dried gel powders appears at 1000 °C then the pure YAG phase exists at a relatively lower sintering temperature of 1400 °C. The smaller sizes of phosphors in the ranges of 1 ∼ 3 μm are obtained due to the contribution of seeding effects of nano-sized alumina particles to strengthen each step of the processes. Both the excitation and emission spectra of photoluminescence of the phosphor obtained at 1400 °C meet well with the spectroscopic requirements of the WLED phosphors.
