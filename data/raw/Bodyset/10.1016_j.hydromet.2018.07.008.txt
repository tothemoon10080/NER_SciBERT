Ag+ is one of the efficient and recoverable catalysts to improve chalcopyrite bioleaching. Because of the complexity of the surface reaction during chalcopyrite bioleaching, there is still controversy on catalytic mechanism of Ag+ in improving dissolution of chalcopyrite. In the present study, we studied the catalytic effect of Ag+ on bioleaching of chalcopyrite by extreme thermophile Acidianus manzaensis. Based on synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, the relevant iron and sulfur speciation of leaching residues was analyzed. Bioleaching experiments showed that copper extraction was significantly promoted by adding Ag+, and the optimum concentration of Ag+ was 0.05% (mass fraction of Ag+ to chalcopyrite). SR-XRD and XANES analyses showed that, during bioleaching in the presence of 0.05% of Ag+ and in the absence of Ag+, the intermediates S0, jarosite and secondary minerals (chalcocite, bornite and covellite) were formed. The linear combination fitting of XANES spectra further revealed that the addition of silver ions remarkably promoted the formation of bornite and covellite, while had no effect on formation of chalcocite, indicating that bioleaching of chalcopyrite should be catalyzed by Ag+ with promoting the generation of bornite and its conversion to covellite. This model suggested that the rapid formation of bornite like species contributed to positive effect of Ag+ on chalcopyrite bioleaching, while the accumulation of covellite slowed leaching rate at the end period of chalcopyrite bioleaching.Chalcopyrite (CuFeS So far, many efforts have been made to enhance the bioleaching process of chalcopyrite, including using thermophiles ( Unlike to the above model, It is no doubt that Ag Therefore, in the present study, we use a widely studied thermophilic Archaea strain The extremely thermoacidophilic Archaea strain The chalcopyrite and the reference minerals (i.e. bornite, chalcocite, covellite, jarosite) were provided by the School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China, and they have been widely used in our previous studies ( For bioleaching experiments, During bioleaching experiment, leaching solutions were taken out at 1 d intervals to determine cell densities, pH and ORP values, and the concentrations of Fe The surface morphology of chalcopyrite particles in bioleaching and in abiotic experiment was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Nova™ NanoSEM 230, FEI, USA). The solid samples for SEM were first treated according to previous description ( The compositions of chalcopyrite during bioleaching were analyzed by SR-XRD and XANES spectroscopy, respectively. Before these analyses, the solid samples were first washed gently ( The SR-XRD patterns was recorded at beamline BL14B1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai, China, at a step of 0.01° and a dwell time of 0.5 s. SR-XRD benefits from low detection limits (<1 wt%), thus permitting the analysis of both major and minor phases. The X-ray energy and the spot size for SR-XRD analysis were 10 keV (λ = 0.124 nm) and 0.5 × 0.5 mm During bioleaching and in the sterile control, [Cu Results in The catalytic effect of silver ion had been widely studied ( There was no difference in cell densities for all bioleaching assays at day 1 ( [TFe] for all bioleaching tests increased in the early leaching stage and then decreased ( According to Eq. The leaching residues with 0.05% of Ag The XRD results ( The composition of iron species and sulfur species on chalcopyrite surface during bioleaching with 0.05% of Ag It should be noted that, for bornite and jarosite, the energy positions of peak B were significantly different. The energy position of peak B for jarosite was 714.0 eV, and this value was 0.3 eV smaller than that for bornite (714.3 eV) ( It could be seen from It could be seen from The S K-edge XANES spectra of the samples during bioleaching ( The dissolution of chalcopyrite is very complex, involving in dissolution of three elements. For bioleaching of chalcopyrite, the preferential release of metal ions (mainly iron) into solution resulted in the formation of secondary minerals ( S It should be noted that according to the Fe L-edge and S K-edge XANES spectra more bornite like species formed for the bioleaching experiment with Ag On the other hand, according to The effect of silver ions on bioleaching of chalcopyrite were confirmed according to the above section: (1) silver affected the dissolution of chalcopyrite during bioleaching, resulting in higher amount of jarosite and S According to the catalytic model proposed by It should be noted that the indirect model (Eqs. On the other hand, we detected iron-deficiency bornite like species, which was previously thought to be the reason to promote chalcopyrite dissolution ( By referring to models proposed by Bioleaching experiment showed that the copper extraction in the leaching system with 0.05% of Ag This work is supported by
