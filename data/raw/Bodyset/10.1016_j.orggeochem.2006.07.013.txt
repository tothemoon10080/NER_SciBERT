This study describes the reduction of functionalised model compounds to their corresponding hydrocarbons by catalytic hydropyrolysis to provide information on the release of biomarkers from kerogens and asphaltenes covalently bound through the functional groups investigated. Five model compounds were investigated, the n-C18 carboxylic acids, stearic and oleic acids; the C24 steroidal acid, 5β-cholanic acid; and the saturated and unsaturated C27 sterols, 5α-cholestanol and cholesterol. The yield and distribution of the hydrocarbons generated were assessed for the model compounds adsorbed to silica and carbon substrates, and unsupported on a bed of catalyst. The n-C18 acids are shown to be reduced to the n-C18 alkane, with a selectivity of >95% for stearic acid, although due to its unsaturated structure, oleic acid is prone to cracking, with shorter chained n-alkanes also being formed. The conversion of these compounds, adsorbed to either silica or carbon is relatively low, even at hydropyrolysis temperatures significantly above their boiling point, suggesting that interactions between the acids and substrate leading to the formation of stable entities (Si–O–C linkages in the case of silica) significantly retard volatilisation. The yield can be increased by placing the compounds directly onto a bed of catalyst, but for low boiling compounds such as stearic acid this can result in volatilisation and cracking at temperatures below that of the activation point of the catalyst. This method produced improved yields of >95% pure product for higher boiling compounds such as 5β-cholanic acid. The presence of the functional group attached to the ring system of compounds such as 5α-cholestanol does not diminish the selectivity of the technique. The double bond in cholesterol resulted in more incomplete hydrogenation with sterenes being generated, and in addition to 5α and 5β-cholestane, diasteranes were also generated via migration of the double bond.The hydropyrolysis of coals and oil shales at high hydrogen pressures (>10 In order to exploit the hydropyrolysis technique to its full potential it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the efficiency and selectivity of the technique for releasing bound biomarkers from kerogens and oil asphaltenes. This study describes a series of experiments with functionalised model compounds including carboxylic acids (stearic acid, oleic acid and 5β-cholanic acid), and sterols (cholesterol and cholestanol), which allow for the selectivity of hydrogenation to their corresponding alkanes to be assessed. In addition, the extent of cracking and isomerisation undergone by Experiments with model compounds are commonly utilised to further our understanding of the efficiency and mechanisms involved in a variety of pyrolysis techniques ( Owing to their importance in biological processes, use as source tracers in biogenic material and the application of their diagenetic products as biomarkers in petroleum geochemistry (e.g. The fixed bed hydropyrolysis tests were conducted using the five model compounds, oleic acid ( Prior to hydropyrolysis, the acid model compounds were adsorbed (∼5 Hydropyrolysis experiments were also performed with an aliquot of each model compound placed in the reactor directly onto a bed of sulphided molybdenum catalyst (250 Quantification of the recovered products from the stearic and oleic acid experiments was achieved by the addition of Partial gas chromatograms of the products generated by the hydropyrolysis at 500 In contrast to previous studies where intermediates such as ketones were recovered in addition to the hydrocarbons ( The yield of Adsorption to the carbon substrate appeared to influence both the yield and distribution of In an attempt to increase the yield of octadecane at lower temperatures, the experiments were repeated with the stearic acid placed directly onto a bed of sulphided molybdenum catalyst. While the total product yield was marginally higher than for the silica adsorbed sample at 400 The selectivity of the hydrogenation of the polycyclic 5β-cholanic acid was similar to that observed for stearic acid, with the product being >95% 5β-cholane ( Experiments similar to those performed on the stearic acid with the sample placed on a bed of catalyst resulted in a product similar to that generated from cholanic acid adsorbed on silica, although the product was more fully hydrogenated with fewer cholenes generated. There was no evidence of increased hydrocracking or the recovery of partially reduced compounds as seen for stearic acid, and this configuration of the reactor resulted in significantly improved yields, especially at lower temperatures. The total yield at 500 The highly selective hydrogenation of 5β-cholanic acid demonstrates that the selectivity of defunctionalisation of model compounds by hydropyrolysis is not influenced by the compound having a polycyclic structure, provided that the functional group is located on the side chain. The presence of a functional group attached to the ring system was tested by experiments with the saturated and unsaturated alcohols, cholesterol and 5α-cholestanol. The products of the hydropyrolysis of cholestanol are shown in The products generated from the hydropyrolysis of cholesterol ( The highly selective defunctionalisation of model compounds demonstrated in this study will potentially allow for hydropyrolysis to be employed as a preparative method for the compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of important biological compounds, as recently described for carboxylic acids by The selectivity towards hydrogenation of single functionalised saturated carboxylic acids and sterols by hydropyrolysis to their corresponding alkanes is extremely high with >90% being achieved for stearic acid, 5β-cholanic acid and cholestanol, with negligible hydrocracking and isomerisation being observed. Unsaturated model compounds such as oleic acid and cholesterol show lower selectivity, with minor cracking and structural rearrangement being apparent. The choice of substrate on which the model compounds are supported has a major influence on both the yield and product distribution, with silica generating higher yields of more selectively reduced products than the carbon substrate. The most selective results for high boiling point compounds are obtained by placing the model compounds directly onto a bed of sulphided molybdenum catalyst.
