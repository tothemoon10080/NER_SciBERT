This article deals with a fluid–particle interaction model for the evolution of particles dispersed in a fluid. The fluid flow is governed by the Navier–Stokes equations for a compressible fluid while the evolution of the particle densities is given by the Smoluchowski equation. The coupling between the dispersed and dense phases is obtained through the drag forces that the fluid and the particles exert mutually. The existence of weakly dissipative solutions is established under reasonable physical assumptions on the initial data, the physical domain, and the external potential. Furthermore, a weak–strong uniqueness result is established via the relative entropy method yielding that a weakly dissipative solution agrees with a classical solution with the same initial data when such a classical solution exists.Fluid–particle systems encountered in many scientific and engineering applications pose significant modeling and analytical challenges. Fluid–particle interaction is of great significance in sedimentation analysis of disperse suspensions of particles in fluids. One of the challenges in that context is the separation of the solid grains from the fluid by external forces: gravity settling processes or centrifugal forces. These procedures have applications in biotechnology, medicine, waste-water recycling and mineral processing, as well as in combustion theory. In what follows, we focus on the macroscopic description of the dispersed phase obtained by taking averages with respect to the microscopic variable Let   The pressure The viscous stress tensor The external potential We impose the no-slip boundary condition for the velocity vector leading to no-flux for the fluid density through the boundaries and the no-flux condition for the particle density The total energy of the system is given by Motivated by the stability arguments in  An inherent definition of By monitoring the evolution of a relative entropy functional and by employing Gronwall’s argument, a weak–strong uniqueness result is established yielding that a weakly dissipative solution agrees with a classical solution with the same initial data when such a classical solution exists. Physically grounded hypotheses are imposed on the domain We remark that system The coupling between the kinetic and the fluid equations is obtained through the friction forces that the fluid and the particles exert mutually. The friction force is assumed to follow the Stokes law and thus is proportional to the relative velocity vector, namely The paper is organized as follows.
