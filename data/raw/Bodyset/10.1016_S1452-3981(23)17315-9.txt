This study examined the effect of manganese on the corrosion resistance of carbon steel in 10 wt.% sulfuric acid by using carbon steels containing three different manganese contents. From the results of electrochemical tests, it was confirmed that the increase of manganese in steel had a positive effect on the corrosion resistance and manganese content in steel changed the corrosion current density with the immersion time. From impedance spectroscopy and surface analysis, it was confirmed that the corrosion inhibiting effect of manganese in steel was attributed to the adsorption of manganese ions and the protective manganese products.
