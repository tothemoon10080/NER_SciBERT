Huge volumes of solid waste are produced globally while, at the same time, huge amounts of energy are produced from fossil fuels. Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies are developing rapidly, holding out the potential to make clean, sustainable power from waste material. Energy producible from the burning of solid waste represents an elective energy supply that can help reduce reliance on ordinary petroleum derivatives. WTE advances physically convert waste material - beyond the commonplace notion of large incinerators used to produced heat from garbage - into increasingly valuable types of fuel that can be used to supply energy. These WTE processes incorporate various methods and blended approaches, and present an enormous opportunity for clean, sustainable energy. A. Khan, M. Jawaid, A. Pizzi, N. Azum, A. M. Asiri, and I.
