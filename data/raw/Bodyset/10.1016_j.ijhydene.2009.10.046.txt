Thermodynamic data for the solubility and formation of copper(I)and copper(II) species are required to model innovative designs of the electrolysis cells used in the thermochemical copper-chloride hydrogen production process. Cumulative formation constants of Cu2+(aq) complexes with Cl−(aq) were determined by Principal Component Analysis of UV-spectra, obtained over a very wide range of solution compositions and temperature, coupled with an appropriate model for activity coefficients of the solution species. Shortcomings in the existing database and future work to extend these studies to higher temperatures and much higher copper concentrations are discussed.The Super-Critical-Water-Cooled Reactor (SCWR) is a concept for a novel, extremely energy-efficient advanced nuclear reactor that has been chosen by Canada as its major R&D contribution to meet the targets of the Generation IV International Forum treaty. A requirement of all the SCWR concept designs is an ability to co-generate hydrogen from high-temperature steam at temperatures below 823 Over 200 processes for thermal hydrogen production have been evaluated by the US Department of Energy and three have been selected for use at temperatures below 823 Fritz and Königsberger In the case of CuCl In the first phase of this study, we have used the high-temperature UV-visible flow system developed by Trevani et al. These measurements are part of a broader project involving the study of complexation reactions in concentrated HCl solutions up to 6 All chemical materials were used without further purification. The list of chemicals includes: lithium chloride, LiCl (Sigma–Aldrich, 99+%, A.C.S. reagent); sodium hydroxide, NaOH (50% w/w solution, Fisher ACS certified); hydrochloric acid, HCl (ACS reagent-grade); copper(II) chloride dihydrate, CuCl The concentrations of the CuCl LiCl–HCl solutions with chloride concentrations from ∼0 to 15 UV-visible spectra were measured in a high-temperature, high-pressure titanium cell with sapphire windows (1.72 A Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer (190–1100 According to the Beer's law, the absorbance of a solution containing multiple absorbing species can be written as where with The baseline-corrected absorbance data shown in The first estimate of the number of absorbing aqueous species required to describe the experimental absorbance data was carried out using principal component analysis, “PCA” In addition to the constraints applied in the “model-free” regression to Beer's law, the concentrations of species present in any solution must obey the mass-action laws for association reactions (LiCl, HCl) and complex formation reactions (Eq.(1)), as well as the mass balance equations for total Cu, Cl and Li. Simultaneous treatment of absorption data with all these equations and with a model for the activity coefficients allowed us to derive concentration profiles of absorbing species and their formation constants. Below, we comment on the required input for the thermodynamic model, which includes association constants of HCl and LiCl and an assumption for activity coefficients of all species, ionic and neutral, in the solutions. As a strong electrolyte, LiCl undergoes dissociation in aqueous solutions, which is almost complete at temperatures below 473 A similar procedure was adopted for calculating the association constant for hydrochloric acid, using parameters of the HKF equation for HCl,aq given by Sverjensky et al. Mean stochiometric activity coefficients for LiCl based on the ion-interaction approach Following Pokrovskii and Helgeson Ionic strength and the degree of association were calculated first, using initial estimates of the parameters Parameters Parameter Step (1) was repeated with the new set of parameters Activity coefficients for neutral molecules other than LiCl Regressions with a full thermodynamic model were also performed with the BeerOz software package  Our results at 373 Increasing trends for the dependence of formation constants with temperature are confirmed by our data, although there seem to be vestiges of a maximum in log One of the conclusions we have drawn from these preliminary modeling attempts is that more reliable interpretation of the data requires additional measurements, namely we plan to obtain several complete new sets of data at temperatures to ∼473 UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured in acidic copper-chloride solutions at 373 This work was supported by the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS Young Scientist Fellowship for J.E.), the Research Centre “Advanced Remedial Technologies and Processes” at the Technical University of Liberec, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., the Ontario Research Foundation and the Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada (NSERC).
