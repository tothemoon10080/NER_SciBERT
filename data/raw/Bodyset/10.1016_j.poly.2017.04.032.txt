The synthesis of a series of lanthanide trifluoroacetic acid (H-TFA) derivatives which contain only the TFA and its conjugate acid has been developed. From the reaction of Ln(N(SiMe3)2)3 with an excess amount of H-TFA, the products were identified as: [Ln(μ-TFA)3(H-TFA)2]

Tm was isolated with py coordinated to the metal, whereas Ho, Er, and Yb were isolated with py located within the lattice. Select samples from this set of compounds were used to generate nanomaterials under solvothermal (SOLVO) conditions using pyridine (py) or octylamine at 185°C for 24h. The SOLVO products were isolated as: (i) from py: La – fluocerite (LaF3, PDF 98-000-0214, R

Therefore, we elected to study the non-modified H-TFA derivatives, following Eq. All compounds described below were handled with rigorous exclusion of air and water using standard Schlenk line and glovebox techniques unless otherwise discussed. Analytical data were collected on dried crystalline samples. All solvents and chemicals were used as received from Aldrich and Alfa Aesar unless otherwise stated, without further purification, including: toluene (tol), pyridine (py), octylamine and H-TFA. The lanthanide bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (Ln(NR In an inert atmosphere glovebox, toluene was added via pipette to a pre-weighed sample of [Ln(NR Used [La(NR Used [Ce(NR Used [Pr(NR Used [Nd(NR Used [Sm(NR Used [Eu(NR Used [Gd(NR Used [Tb(NR Used [Dy(NR Used [Ho(NR Used [Er(NR Used [Tm(NR Used [Yb(NR Used [Lu(NR Used [Y(NR Single crystals were mounted onto a loop from a pool of Fluorolube™ and immediately placed in a cold N The In an argon filled glovebox, “Ln(TFA) Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed on a PANalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer (10–100° two theta) employing Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Small amounts of samples from the ‘green’ or ‘fired’ materials were placed in vials and dispersed with methanol to form a cloudy solution. Aliquots of the sample solution were placed on holey-carbon copper coated TEM grids and was allowed to air dry. TEM images were obtained by utilizing a Phillips CM30 transmission microscopy instrument at 300 Measurement of particle size distributions for the fired nanomaterials ( A search of a crystallographically characterized TFA moiety in the presence of a Ln (including Sc and Y) cation yields ∼90 complexes, which is cut in half when the heteroleptic species are removed from this list Since the inclusion of H Several attempts to generate the desired Ln-TFA species were undertaken. Initially, the reaction shown in Eq. It has been reported that mixtures of organic solvents and fluorinated compounds will become miscible at elevated temperatures For each reaction of Eq. Often the loss of the OH stretches of the precursors can be used as an indication of completeness of reaction; however, the expected binding of the H-TFA precluded this interpretation. Therefore, the changes noted for the bends and stretches of the Due to the limited structural information that could be discerned from these data, additional studies were undertaken using single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structures proved to be of high quality with a variety of polymeric structures being solved. In general, these structures are quite complex upon symmetry expansion; therefore, it is suggested that in order to visualize the structures properly, the reader is encouraged to use an imaging program. For the majority of these polymers there are three bridging TFA ligands, which are followed by either three or four μ-TFA moieties forming the polymeric chain. If the location of the H was not easily observed in the final structure, the H is assumed to be equally spread over the entire structure, represented by a proceeding [H]. The largest Ln metal center investigated, A similar polymeric chain was solved for An alternative polymeric arrangement, [Ln(μ-TFA) For the smaller Finally, the While there are subtle variations in the structures noted for these compounds, the Ln–O distances show the expected systematic decrease as the Ln series is traversed. It was discovered in the process of developing this unusual family of compounds that an oxo species could be formed when the reaction mixture was dissolved in py and heated for a short time. Since the oxo core will make conversion to the desired LnF Elemental analyses of the bulk material using a Perkin-Elmer CHN/O Elemental Analyzer were attempted using standard combustion processes; however, due to instrument limitations and the high F content of the compounds (>10% F will cause unreliable results in the H and C data) With this new family of Ln-TFA/H-TFA salts in hand, their conversion to the LnF As can be discerned, the PXRD crystallite measurements indicate that the samples were significantly smaller in size than the TEM images. This can be explained by the fact that the values obtained by the PXRD patterns are based on peak broadening, which means they will represent the smallest crystallite sizes. Thus, the values via PXRD are generally indicative of primary crystal regions but do not reveal twinning or agglomeration behavior observed in the TEM images. In general, the To further determine the size of the polycrystalline particles, DLS characterization was for each product and are tabulated in The first examples of TFA-Ln salts with its conjugated acid (H-TFA) acting as the solvent, have been reported ( Most of these samples were successfully converted to F-containing Ln species; however, the full conversion to the desired LnF The authors would like to acknowledge the grateful use of the Bruker X-ray diffractometer purchased via the National Science Foundation CRIF:MU award to Prof Kemp of the University of New Mexico (CHE04-43580).
