Chile is the largest copper producing country of the world; and almost 50% of the copper it exports to the rest of the world is exported as copper concentrates to be smelted and refined abroad. However, 70% of the weight of these exported copper concentrates is gangue (valueless and undesirable material associated to the copper content in these exported concentrates). In this paper analyze and quantify the contribution Chile could make to the ongoing world efforts to reduce climate change and global warming, if it adopts a trading policy eliminating its exports of copper concentrates and replacing them with the greater value added exports of the refined copper obtained from smelting and refining those concentrates in Chile. This policy would allow a significant reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted every year to the global atmosphere. This reduction would occur through two channels: 1. avoiding the combustion of more than 600,000 tons of diesel oil currently used to transport by sea almost 6,600,000 tons of the gangue incorporated in Chile's copper concentrate exports; and, 2. using Chile's cleaner technology for smelting and refining copper concentrates instead of the dirtier technologies of the countries currently importing, smelting and refining the Chilean copper concentrates. For the first time, using data for 2014, we estimate the total net reduction in GHG emissions to the global atmosphere that the proposed trade policy would imply. We calculate the distance of the nautical routes used for the 919 shipments of concentrates exported by Chile that year; and we perform sensitivity analysis for 4 scenarios, employing two alternative values for two key parameters. Additionally, we compare the GHG emission performances of the copper smelting and refining metallurgic technologies employed in Chile and in every one of the 22 countries that import and smelt and refine Chilean concentrates. Our estimates for the 2 most extreme scenarios indicate that, if instead of exporting copper concentrates in 2014, Chile would had exported only refined copper, it would had contributed with a total net reduction of GHG emissions emitted to the global atmosphere of 2,227,047 and 2,799,279 ton CO2-eq tons that year, which are equivalent to approximately 5.6% of the total amount of GHG emissions that would had made Chile fully carbon neutral that year. This is a significant contribution regarding Chile's commitment to the Paris Agreement as well as in terms of the required world efforts to reducing GHG emissions from sea shipping.Chile is the largest copper producing country; in the last 10 years, it produced 30% of all the copper produced in the world ( In 2014, Chile exported the equivalent to 5.8 million tons of refined copper, and almost 2.8 million of them, or 49%, were exported as copper concentrate and the other 3.0 million as refined copper. As it is shown in In 2014, 919 shipments of copper concentrate were sent from 13 Chilean ports to 22 foreign countries ( In fact, there is a scientific consensus on the impact that the GHG concentrations in the atmosphere cause on global physical processes and their implications on rising temperature and changing other climate variables ( Several scientific studies have warned that global warming of more than 1 °C, relative to 2000, will constitute “dangerous” climate change as judged from likely effects on sea level and extermination of species ( Moreover, the most recent IPCC studies have warned that estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2 °C per decade due to past and ongoing emissions; that, warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to three times higher in the Arctic; and that, warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean ( All this evidence is indicating that reducing GHG emissions and its concentrations in the planet's atmosphere is an urgent challenge that must be met, which implies that to achieve the Paris climate objectives of limiting the increase of global mean temperature to well below 2 °C requires today, among other measures, drastic changes in energy systems ( Here we do not analyze the reasons why not all copper concentrates are refined in Chile; but several authors agree in that there are no technical or economic reasons explaining this ( The first of the two main goals of this work is to estimate the avoidable quantities of fuel oil burned in transporting by sea the gangue contained in the copper concentrates exported from Chile every year. The other main goal of this study is to estimate how much more, or how much less, environmentally efficient is to smelt and refine the copper concentrates in Chile; in terms of how many more, or how many less, tons of GHG are emitted for smelting and refining 1 ton of copper concentrate in Chile, than in the more than 20 importing countries to which these concentrates are exported currently. The key factor to calculate this is the relative efficiency of the metallurgic smelting and refining technologies existing and used in the Chilean metallurgic industry compared with the average efficiency existing and used in the metallurgic industries of those other countries. There is no additional foreseeable effects in the atmosphere if copper were to be refined in one country only or if this was done in a non-concentrated form ( These results imply that a policy of refining copper concentrates domestically instead of exporting them could help Chile to achieve its international commitments to reducing GHG emissions. These commitments refer to reducing CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) produced in the economy. Moreover, Chile has very favorable conditions for photovoltaic power generation in areas where mining is located—Chilean mining is concentrated in regions I to IV, where solar radiation factors are around 4.5 Kcal/m The next section presents the methodology employed for our estimations, and section The methodology we use to estimate the net reduction of GHG emissions resulting from a Chile's policy of not exporting copper concentrate and replacing them by refined copper exports considers the two relevant components of the life cycle analysis (LCA) of these two copper products. The first one corresponds to the GHG emissions from the sea shipping of these products when they are exported from Chile, and the associated reduction in the total GHG emissions generated from the fuel oil burned by the freight-ships transporting for more than 15.5 million km (9.6 million miles), around 6.6 million tons of gangue incorporated in the copper concentrates currently being exported from Chile, every year. Burning this diesel oil would be avoided if instead of these cooper concentrates Chile exports only the refined copper included in those concentrates. The second relevant component of the LCA of the two copper products under analysis corresponds to the GHG emissions generated by the metallurgic processes of these two products, and the resulting difference, i.e. the associated increase or reduction, in the GHG emissions per ton of refined copper produced from Chilean copper concentrates provoked by smelting and refining those copper concentrates in Chile instead of smelting and refining them in the countries where they are processed today after importing them from Chile. After calculating these two components, the final total net reduction in GHG emissions resulting from the relevant changes in the life cycles of these two copper products, occurring if Chile adopts the trade policy analyzed here, will be the result of adding (subtracting) to the reduction in GHG calculated in the first component the reduction (increase) in GHG emissions calculated in the second component. The part of the life cycle analysis for refined copper involved in calculating the second component corresponds to the one beginning once the copper concentrates have been produced and still are in Chile before being exported. The previous processes these concentrates have already gone through (mine extraction, crushing, grinding, flotation, thickening, filtration, internal transport, etc.) also generate GHG emissions that are emitted to the global atmosphere. However, the amount of these GHG emission does not change with a hypothetical decision of Chile to export copper as copper concentrates instead of as refined copper (after processing the copper concentrates domestically). In other word, this part of the life cycle of copper concentrates as well as of refined copper do not change because of the trade policy. Thus the initial product for our comparative analysis is the copper concentrate produced and still located in Chile, ready to be exported abroad or be smelted and refined in Chile; and, the final product, on the other hand, corresponds to the refined copper obtained from the copper content of the copper concentrates that has already been converted in refined cooper in Chile, and has also been exported to and it is already located in the same countries currently importing the copper concentrates exported from Chile. The methodology employed here has been designed to guarantee that reductions of the GHG emissions resulting from the Chile's hypothetical trade policy we are evaluating here are never overestimated. This guarantees that the estimations we obtained always correspond to minimum or “floor” values of the true GHG reductions that will occur in a real-world realization of the trade policy analyzed. Additionally, we do not estimate GHG emissions associated with the domestic transportation of copper concentrates from the arriving port to the corresponding refining facilities in the countries importing concentrates from Chile, because there is no data available to calculate them. I any case, it is evident that these emissions are very much lower than the emissions associated with the sea transportation of these copper concentrates, as well as with the emissions generated in their smelting and refining process. For any country “l” importing copper concentrates from Chile, the weight of the gangue content incorporated in these concentrates,    Thus, the total weight of the gangue transported during 2014 from Chile to the L countries that imported copper concentrates from Chile that year is calculated as:         Using the carbon emission factor for oil combustion provided by  Using equation [2], in equation [9] we obtain an expression formally defining the amount of copper content that arrives to the importing country l, To estimate the GHG emissions generated from smelting and refining the copper concentrates we use a factor of emission specific to each country, depending on the smelting and refining technology each country has. Then, there are 2 basic cases for which it is necessary to calculate smelting and refining GHG emissions: 1. if the concentrates are refined in Chile; and, 2. if the concentrates are refined in any of the countries importing copper concentrates from Chile. Therefore, we define as   Using equations [7] and [8], it is possible to calculate the total amount avoidable GHG emissions resulting from not transporting the gangue incorporated in copper concentrates from Chile to the countries importing these concentrates. As explained before, to obtaining the final total avoidable carbon emissions is it necessary to estimate the change in GHG emissions provoked because the smelting and refining of copper concentrates is switched to Chile from the countries importing these concentrates from Chile. This change can be positive or negative (and increase or a decrease in the GHG generated), depending on the relative size of More formally, defining as Finally, it is possible to define For doing our most relevant empirical estimations we use data for 2014, which is the most recent year for which there is official data on copper concentrate exports with the detailed information on every exported shipment required for our calculations. The database of the   More details regarding the shipments of Chile's copper concentrate to the destination countries in 2014 are presented below in Using data on the shipments of copper concentrates exported in 2014, and the copper content reported by the National Customs Service for each shipment, we estimated that the average copper content of the copper concentrates exported from Chile that year was 30%. Also, 13 of the 18 companies exporting copper concentrates that year, or 72.2% of all of them, exhibited a copper content of their shipments between 25% and 30%. We identified a total of 97 different origin-destination maritime routes by which the shipments of exported copper concentrates were sent from Chile to the rest of world in 2014. For each one of these routes, we calculated the direct nautical distance involved, using the computer tool “Distances and Times” (   As of 2014, ships with gross tonnage over 52,000 tons were not allowed to use the Panama Canal route; therefore, we assumed here that copper concentrates exported from Chile through this route were transported on ships of the “Panamax” type. On the other hand, the maritime routes that do not cross the Panama Canal do not imply capacity limitations on ship tonnage. With the purpose of avoiding any possible overestimation when we estimate the reduction in GHG emissions generated by Chile's hypothetical trade policy under analysis, we assume that the representative ship for the routes not crossing the Panama Canal corresponds to a large, efficient fright-vessel of the “MSC Oscar” type from the Mediterranean Shipping Company, with a gross tonnage of 193,000 tons.  Fuel consumption rates of freight-ships may be affected by several conditions, especially in long trips, causing that their actual fuel consumption rates are lower than their potential (most efficient) fuel consumption rates. Therefore, for our fuel consumption estimations we have followed The technical specifications of the gross tonnage of the freight-ships shown in Additionally, to calculate the travel distance involved in every shipment of copper concentrates, we have estimated the nautical distance travelled as in a direct trip from the corresponding port in Chile to the final destination port. However, freight-ships very often do not travel directly from the port of origin to the final port but they make intermediate stops, which increases the actual travel distance, especially for vessels passing through the Panama Canal. To incorporate this in our estimations, we have used a correcting factor expressed as the ratio of the estimated direct nautical distance over the actual travelled distance. As proposed by Enertrans (2008), Finally, we calculate the amounts of the different greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, etc.) emitted to the global atmosphere from the oil burned by the freight-ships transporting the copper concentrates exported from Chile in terms of their equivalent tons of CO2. To perform the involved transformation, we use the converting factor calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is 2.8 tons of CO2-eq per cubic meter of oil burned ( As explained before, to calculate the total amount of GHG emissions avoided by smelting and refining the copper concentrates in Chile instead of exporting them, it is also necessary, in addition to calculate the emissions avoided from the ship transportation of the gangue incorporated in the copper concentrates, to calculate the difference in total GHG generated by the smelting and refining processes when they are done in Chile compared to when they are done in those countries currently importing those concentrates from Chile. If smelting and refining these concentrates in Chile generates less GHG than doing it abroad, then the calculated difference will be an additional contribution to the GHG reduction generated from avoiding the sea transportation of the gangue incorporated in the copper concentrates. On the contrary, if smelting and refining the concentrates in Chile generates more GHG emission than smelting and refining them abroad, the calculated difference will reduce the net total reduction in GHG emissions implied by Chile's decision of exporting refined copper instead of copper concentrates. To do these estimations, we analyzed the group of 10 countries that jointly imported more than the 98% of the copper concentrates exported by Chile in 2014. We gathered detailed information on the GHG emissions generated by the copper smelting and refining technologies of these countries and Chile. In As noted in the previous section, two key parameters are involved in the estimation of the amount of the GHG emissions that could be reduced if copper concentrates are refined in Chile instead of being exported as such. The first of them is the correcting factor used to estimate the actual distance travelled by the ships transporting each shipment of copper concentrate exported from Chile, starting from an estimate of this distance from the origin Chilean port to the final destination port without considering the usual intermediate stopovers made by the ships. The second of these key parameters corresponds to the oil consumption rate per kilometer travelled by the two kinds of freight-ships involved. Therefore, in order to perform sensitivity an analysis in our estimations we use two different values for each of these two key parameters. Thus, we calculate 4 different scenarios of the net total reduction of GHG emissions resulting from refining Chilean copper concentrates domestically and exporting their copper content as refined copper afterwards. For each of the 4 scenarios described in Column 2, in turn, shows that the amounts of GHG emissions generated by this burned fuel were, for the four scenarios estimated, between 1,445,551 and 2,017,783 tons of CO2 equivalent. Column 3 of To estimate the final total net GHG emissions involved in the hypothetical Chile's decision of exporting refined copper instead of copper concentrates, it is necessary to add to (to subtract from) the figures presented in  When we add both GHG emission reductions we have estimated, resulting from the hypothetical trade policy of Chile under analysis, we obtain a net total reduction of GHG emissions liberated to the global atmosphere of between 2,227,047 and 2,799,279 tons of CO2-eq. Indeed, as shown in column 2 of Thanks to a suggestion of an anonymous referee of this journal we significantly improved our estimates of the embodied emissions generated in the whole production process of Chile's copper concentrate and refined copper exports reported here, by extending them through a more encompassing life cycle analysis. To do that, we used some of our findings from a parallel ongoing research that attempts to estimate the carbon footprint of the Chilean economy, and uses an input-output methodology (see On the other hand, in columns 3, 4 and 5 of Of all the GHG emissions that Chile emitted to the global atmosphere in 2014, 2,227,047 to 2,799,279 tons were generated from two sources related to its copper exports. First, by the diesel oil burned to transport Chile's copper concentrates exported to the 22 countries who imported them. Second, by the environmentally dirtier processes used afterwards in those 22 countries to smelt and refine those copper concentrates, compare with the same metallurgic processes used in Chile. Obviously, these large amounts of GHG emissions are not insignificant. For example, they represented around 50% of all the direct GHG emissions released that year by the entire copper mining sector of Chile, the largest copper producing country, who produces 30% of all the copper annually produced in the world. On the other hand, they were also equivalent to 5.6% of the amount of GHG emissions that Chile would have needed to mitigate that year to make its economy fully carbon neutral, and to 2.5% of the total amount of GHG emitted by Chile that year. Therefore, if these more than 2,500,000 tons of CO2-eq GHG would had been mitigated instead of released to the atmosphere, they would had made a valuable contribution to the world's efforts to reduce climate change and global warming that year. Moreover, Chile could make a contribution like this, every year in the future, by adopting a trade policy of not exporting copper concentrates any longer, replacing them by refined copper exports. Chile committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement a 30% reduction of its CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 2030, relative to its levels in 2007. This involves going from 1.02 to 0.71 tons of CO2-eq per million Chilean Pesos of GDP in 23 years ( The International Maritime Organization (IMO) of the United Nations estimated that, in 2012, the GHG emissions from international shipping accounted for 2.2% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and that, by 2020, such emissions will grow between 50% and 250% ( To pursue these objectives, the IMO defined its Initial Strategy, one of whose levels of ambitions is to peak GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and to reduce the total annual GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008. Moreover, IMO is committed to pursue efforts towards phasing out international shipping GHG emissions as a point on a pathway of CO2 emissions reduction consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals ( On the other hand, the growing evidence indicating that the international efforts committed in the 2015 Paris Agreement would not be sufficient to slowing down global warming with the required speed pushed the IPCC to launch, at the end of 2018, its Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. In this report the IPCC urges the global community to strengthen current efforts to attaining pathways to limit global warming to 1.5 °C instead of 2 °C, because, with high confidence, the pathways reflecting the ambitions of the Paris Agreement would not limit global warming to 1.5 °C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of emissions reductions after 2030 ( To meet these tough challenges, the world maritime transport sector can make a significant contribution, because 80% of the world's merchandise transport is made by sea. This is why, in the Climate Action Summit of last September, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization, Kitack Lim, committed this UN organization's efforts to attempt to reduce in 40% the CO2 intensity of sea transport by 2030, relative to 2008, and to reach 70% towards 2050. To honor these commitments, it would be convenient that the IMO plays a more active role to generate incentives to motivate all countries to implement initiatives for reducing the GHG generated by their international shipping activities. A proposal to attain this would be to determine that the amounts of GHG emissions mitigated by a country as a result of reducing the sea shipping of its exports can be accounted as part of its future national determined contribution (NDC). An internationally agreed policy like this would create large incentives for all countries to reduce the GHG emissions generated by the sea shipping of their exports; which, in the case of the mining sector of Chile studied here, implies eliminating its exports of copper concentrates. The latter would reduce the GHG intensity of Chile's mining sector in more than the 30% reduction in the GHG intensity per million Chilean Pesos of GDP already committed by the country to the Paris Agreement. Of course, this would be beneficial to Chile but, more relevant than that, this recognition of the GHG emissions reductions from sea shipping would align the incentive of all countries with the world efforts to reduce global GHG emissions. On November 29, 2019, the Assembly of the IOM reelected Chile as a member of the IMO's Council, the executive organ responsible for supervising the work of the Organization. This occurred only three days before the COP 25 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will convene in Madrid, Spain, under the Presidency of Chile, and in which the safeguard of global oceans as well as the reductions in GHG emission to the atmosphere will be relevant issues. Both of these facts represent opportunities for Chile to promote in the international arena the necessary changes to increase the current existing incentives for countries to reduce GHG emissions from the sea transportation of their exported merchandises by obtaining their recognition as part of their NDCs.
