The sulfur phase in high sulfur-containing bauxite was studied by an X-ray diffraction analysis and a chemistry quantitative analysis. The methods for the removal of different shaped sulfur were also discussed. The results show that sulfur phases in high sulfur-containing bauxites exist in the main form of sulfide sulfur (pyrite) or sulfate sulfur, and the main sulfur forms of bauxites from different regions are not the same. Through a combination of an X-ray diffraction analysis and a chemistry quantitative analysis, the sulfur phases of high sulfur-containing bauxite could be accurately investigated. Deciding the main sulfur form of high sulfur-containing bauxite could provide theoretical instruction for choosing methods for the removal of sulfur from bauxite, and an oxidizing-roasting process is an effective way to remove sulfide sulfur from high sulfur-containing bauxite, the content of S2- in crude ore in the digestion liquor is above 1.7 g/L, but in the roasted ore digestion liquor, it is below 0.18 g/L. Using the sodium carbonate solution washing technology to wash bauxite can effectively remove sulfate sulfur, the content of the total sulfur in ore is lowered to below 0.2% and can meet the production requirements for the sulfur content.
