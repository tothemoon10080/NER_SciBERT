Results of an investigation of drum granulation of dolomite flour of selected grain-size composition, which guaranteed geometrical similarity at different degrees of bed-wetting, are discussed. Taking into account changes in granule porosity, the dependence of agglomerate growth rate in particular raw materials on the liquid saturation degree in the agglomerates was shown. It was found that a necessary condition to initiate the process of agglomerate growth was to reach some required degree of saturation of the liquid in the SgI granules. After achieving the second boundary value of saturation degree in the SgII granules, an abrupt growth of agglomerates was observed. It was reported that the values SgI and SgII depended on the mean particle size of raw material.
