Fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—have for numerous decades supplied abundant energy to industrialized countries of North America, Western Europe, and other prosperous countries. These fuels have been traditionally a major, domestic energy resource, with their present role anticipated to steadily grow for the first half of the 21st century. Today, over 60% of all electricity in the United States is generated from coal and natural gas, with hydrocarbon-derived products directing the transportation sector. At the same time, however, large amounts of anthropogenic CO This special issue of Fuel Processing Technology is based on a symposium titled “Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration” held at the 227th American Chemical Society National Meeting in Anaheim, California, USA in March 2004. During the symposium, strategies for capturing CO The following nineteen peer-reviewed manuscripts cover topics in carbon capture, including novel methods, solid, high-temperature sorbents and absorption processes; geological sequestration in large scale projects as well as modeling and lab-scale experimental investigations; mineral, ocean and terrestrial sequestration; and carbon dioxide utilization. As the editors, we hope the articles within this special issue of Fuel Processing Technology will provide the scientific community with insights to answers related to the specific subject matter presented, focused interest in the basic science and engineering fields to include chemical sciences, oceanography, and geological sciences, and the search for practical and cost-effective solutions, especially those related to environmental challenges and greenhouse gas control. Finally, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the authors for their efforts in preparing their manuscripts for this special issue and to the reviewers for their time and assistance.
