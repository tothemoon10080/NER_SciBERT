Reaction of 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-5-pyranyl)-2,2,2-trifluoro-1-ethanone with benzylic Grignard reagents affords by 1,2-addition unsaturated allylic alcohols. These alcohols readily undergo dehydration and cyclisation to give trifluoromethylnaphthalenes. The generality of this procedure was established by reaction with diverse benzyl and allyl Grignard reagents and by reaction of a number of unsaturated ketones. The resulting trifluoromethylnaphthalenes were oxidised to give substituted acetic- and propionic acids.Acyclic fluorinated building blocks Our study has been based on cyclic ketones ( We find that method A by prior preparation of the Grignard reagent in ether followed by addition of the ketone ( Katritzky et al. Using the procedure with The major significance of these results is the development of a route to 2-trifluoromethyl benzenes and naphthalenes, which defines specifically the position of the fluorinated substituent relative to other substituents. Although 2-trifluoromethylnaphthalene ( General experimental procedures are described elsewhere.      Following method A, reaction of ketone (           Following method C, alcohol ( Following method C, a mixture of the two isomeric trienes (         To a cold solution of the alcohol (     We thank the Egyptian Government for a research studentship (A.
