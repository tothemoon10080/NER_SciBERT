Complex intermetallics such as quasicrystals, a relatively new class of solid state materials have attracted considerable attention; because they have a long-range quasiperiodic order but no three-dimensional translational periodicity. The high density of tetrahedral interstitial sites displayed by metallic alloys with quasicrystalline structure makes such materials of technological interest in the field of hydrogen storage capabilities. The physical properties such as frictional properties of quasicrystalline materials are more exciting because the structures of quasicrystal are different from the both conventional crystalline and amorphous phases. This article summarizes the general overview of the research conducted in the field of frictional properties of various quasiperiodic intermetallic systems. We also describe situations where the surface elements exhibit a quasiperiodic structure opening up the possibility of extending our understanding of the relation between quasiperiodicity and the frictional properties of such structurally and chemically complex solids.

Quasicrystals (QCs) are intermetallic materials exhibiting a long range and non-periodic ordering with forbidden rotational symmetry, which changed the concept of crystallography [ There are several ways in which the QC can be distinguished. One way of its classification is depend on the number of spatial dimensions in which it shows the quasiperiodicity. One class of the quasicrystal that exhibits the quasiperiodicity in all the three directions and five fold rotational symmetry is called as icosahedral quasicrystal (IQC) [ QCs can also be classified on the basis of the majority component and thus may be termed as Al-based, Mg-based, Zn-based, Cd-based, Ti-based, Zr-based, and Hf-based quasicrystals. Some illustrative examples (not exhaustive) alloys systems are provided here:        The structure and consequent properties of QC are not completely understood. However, they are found to be useful and interesting, especially when applied in combination. High hardness, a low frictional coefficient, high brittleness, elevated corrosion resistance, reduced wetting, and superplasticity above 700 The value of the thermal conductivity QC exhibits some peculiar magnetic features. The transition metals (e.g. Fe, Co, Cu and Mn, and so on) present in the QC generally put-in unpaired electron spin in the material, and if not ferro- or antiferro then paramagnetism should be observed. But this does not happen in case of QC, and shows diamagnetic character with a negative susceptibility −5 The existence of both phason and phonon (phonon do exist in crystal) modal gives rise to the unique elastic characteristics to the QCs [ Hydrogen atoms can be absorbed into either interstitial sites or on surfaces of materials. Lightweight carbon-based storage materials (e.g. carbon nano-tubes) provide potential alternatives, but their properties favorable for storage are not yet optimized. Greater hydrogen storage capacity was revealed by Ti–Zr–Hf based quasicrystals in comparison to the related crystalline phases [ There are two important properties QCs such as low friction coefficients and anti-adhesion giving rise to an ideal coating material particularly to be applied as coating in the frying pans or other cookwares [ Though the QC properties are not fully understood but they are interesting and useful due to high hardness, reduced wetting, a low friction coefficient, eminent corrosion resistance and hydrogen storage. The wetting behavior of QC surfaces lies at the origin of two important properties, namely anti-adhesion and low friction coefficients desirable for tribological applications. In general, the frictional coefficient of the QCs also depends on the testing conditions. The friction coefficient with diamond remains as low as 0.05 under constant–load operations, for loading both below and above the critical value for transverse cracks to form, where as the friction coefficients for cemented carbide, hardened steel and alumina tips are of the order of 0.20. Brittleness is attenuated with the scratch and in all cases repeated passes reduced the frictional coefficient down to a limit.
