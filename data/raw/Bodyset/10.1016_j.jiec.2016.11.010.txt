Aliphatic oxime derivatives C7H15CXNOH (X=H, CH3, NH2 or OH) have been commercially used as copper(II) extractants or flotation collectors, but the true nature of their reactivity toward Cu2+ or mineral surfaces still remains elusive. Using density functional theory (DFT) method, the structure–reactivity relationship of these aliphatic oxime derivatives was evaluated at B3LYP/6-311+G(d, p) level. The results indicated that the O or N atoms in the head group of octanaldoxime (OTAO), methyl n-heptyl ketoxime (MHKO), N-hydroxyoctanimidamide(HOIM) and n-octanohydroxamic acid (OTHA) are the chemical reaction center. The reactivity of the aliphatic oxime ionic species increases successively with the replacement of hydrogen atom by methyl, amino and hydroxyl, suggesting that the affinity of them to copper species is as follows: OTHA>HOIM>OTAO>MHKO, which coincides with the order of their binding energy toward Cu2+. The flotation performance of aliphatic oxime derivatives to malachite was in the order of OTHA>OTAO>HOIM>MHKO, which was in line with the combination effect of their reactivity and hydrophobicity. The established structure–reactivity relationship provides an atomic level understanding of the structural requirements for aliphatic oximes to recover cupric ions or copper oxide minerals.Oximes (RR′C In the last decades, computational chemistry has been widely recognized as a valuable tool to understand the reactive chemical system and predict their physiochemical properties. Among the myriads of powerful computational chemistry techniques, the density functional theory (DFT), with acceptable reliability and affordable computing power, has been commonly used to study the electronic structure and property of various chemical species The chemical reactivity of a extractant or collector toward metal ions or its mineral surfaces depends on certain quantum-chemical parameters, e.g., the composition and energy of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) Since aliphatic oxime derivatives uniformly exhibited particular affinity toward Cu In spite of the large number of experimental studies conducted for aliphatic oxime derivatives, however, the comparative theoretical study of their reactivity has rarely been reported. It has been well established that the structure–reactivity relationship study is of great significance to develop a theoretical framework to guide the design of flotation collectors of high performance All the computational analysis in this work was carried out using Gaussian 09 software package In order to shed light on the detailed information about reactivity of aliphatic oxime derivatives, chemical reactivity descriptors, e.g. dipole moment (D), absolute chemical hardness ( Dipole moment is a useful index for the description of interactions between two chemical species. The larger the dipole moment is, the stronger the van der Waals interaction will be Absolute chemical hardness ( The global electrophilicity index ( The relative affinity of interaction of different metal–oxime complexes was quantified in terms of interaction energy (Δ All commercial compounds used for preparation of aliphatic oxime derivatives were used without further purification. The detailed synthetic process for OTAO, MHKO, HOIM or OTHA was presented orderly as follows: The preparation of octanaldoxime was carried out according to the method suggested by Xu et al. Methyl  Octanohydroxamic acid was prepared according to the method recommended by Liu et al. Micro-flotation experiments were performed in a 220 OTHA may exist as ketone and oxime tautomers, and both can be further ionized in aqueous solutions as shown in The optimized geometries of OTAO, MHKO, HOIM and OTHA at B3LYP/6-311  As seen from The calculated r(N3–O4) values for the ionic species of aliphatic oximes in aqueous solutions follow the order: r The selected dihedral angles in The calculated values of global reactivity descriptors ( Dipole moment, as a descriptor of molecular polarity, is closely related to the electrostatic and van der Waals interaction of extractants or collectors with metal species For the ion species of all aliphatic oxime derivatives, the computed The order of calculated From The HOMO energies of the ion species of aliphatic oxime derivatives in aqueous phase increased in the following order: OTAO The LUMO energies of the ion species of aliphatic oxime derivatives in aqueous system follow the order: OTHA In order to understand the contribution of atomic orbitals to the frontier molecular orbitals of aliphatic oxime derivatives both qualitatively and quantitatively, the compositions of frontier molecular orbitals obtained by GaussView 5.09 are presented in Based on the contributions of N3 and O4 atoms to the HOMO in the ionized species of OTAO and MHKO, the copper complex of OTAO and MHKO may be formed through both the N3 and O4 atoms. As to the HOIM ion, the The results derived from above theoretical analysis are in good agreement with previously reported findings. For example, Li et al. As shown in The calculated Mulliken and natural atomic charge values are listed in The Mulliken and natural charges of N1 and O4 atoms in the HOIM anion have relatively higher negative values compared with its molecular species. Moreover, the Mulliken and Natural atomic charge of N1 atom in HOIM anion are both more negative than the N3 atom, showing its stronger tendency to transfer electrons to metal atoms to form a five-numbered ring complex along with the O4 atom, as evidenced by previous findings Based on above results and analyses, it comes to the conclusion that the O or N atoms in the head group are of the chemical reaction center for the four aliphatic oxime derivatives, especially the O4 atom. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms usually show strong electron-donating ability and weak electron-accepting ability. Since aliphatic oxime derivatives are chelating-type flotation collectors or extracting agents, the interaction between them and metal species on mineral surface or in solution would be governed by their electron donor properties. Therefore, the HOMO energy and composition of aliphatic oxime derivatives play a dominant role in determining their flotation/extraction performance, while their LUMO energy and composition are of relatively little importance. With regard to the ionized species of aliphatic oxime derivatives, the key parameters relevant to their chemical reactivity in aqueous phase are summarized in In order to further investigate the effect of substitution on the reactivity of aliphatic oxime derivatives, the interactions of Cu(II) metal ion with aliphatic oxime derivatives in solution were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Employing B3LYP functional, a split-valence basis set with polarization and diffuse functions viz. 6-311 The more negative the interaction energy, the stronger the binding intensity. As seen from The selected optimized geometrical parameters for the copper–oxime complexes are listed in The flotation recovery of malachite as a function of pH with the collector concentration 1 It was evident from In this work, the molecular structure and geometrical parameters of aliphatic oxime derivatives were optimized using DFT at the B3LYP/6-311 The O or N heteroatoms in the head group are the electron-donating center, i.e., the chemical reaction center (N3 and O4 atoms for OTAO and MHKO, N1and O4 atoms for HOIM, O1 and O4 atoms for OTHA), which can participate in the bond formation with metal species. In light of the chemical reactivity indexes such as frontier orbital energies, the predicted reactivity order of aliphatic oxime derivatives is as follows: OTHA The flotation performance of aliphatic oxime derivatives toward malachite follows the order: OTHA Owing to the complexity and variability in the extraction process or flotation system, a more theoretically robust framework should be proposed to further reconcile the molecular simulation and experimental observations. The calculation of interaction energy between flotation collectors and mineral surface using DFT is under progress, which will be reported in due time. This study shed light on the relationship between the molecular architecture of aliphatic oxime derivatives and their reactivity toward cupric ion. The structure–reactivity relationship thus obtained may function as a stepping stone for the rational design of oxime-based Cu The authors would like to thank the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article: Spectral characterization (IR,
