The bioleaching experiments of chalcopyrite were conducted with mixed mesophilic culture (30°C), moderately thermophilic culture (45°C) and extremely thermophilic culture (65°C), respectively. During bioleaching, the S/Fe/Cu speciation was analyzed by synchrotron radiation (SR) based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and S, Fe and Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The results showed that the chalcopyrite dissolution could be significantly promoted by these mixed cultures, and the promotion effects were enhanced with the increase of bioleaching temperature. For all bioleaching tests, the formation of intermediates S0, jarosite and secondary minerals (chalcocite, bornite and covellite) was detected, in which the formation of bornite, chalcocite and covellite was just related with redox potential. The formation of bornite could accelerate chalcopyrite dissolution, while the decrease of bioleaching microorganisms could reduce chalcopyrite dissolution.Chalcopyrite is very refractory and recalcitrant because of the forming the surface layer and iron deficient secondary minerals ( The dissolution of chalcopyrite by bioleaching microorganisms has been widely studied ( On the other hand, the bioleaching microorganisms are mainly sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms (SOMs) and iron-oxidizing microorganisms (IOMs) ( However, since the metal-deficient secondary minerals are always of low abundance and could be in unstable transition states, it is difficult to detect directly some species formed during bioleaching due to the low resolution of most traditional techniques (such as Raman spectroscopy and traditional XRD) ( Recently, by combining SR-XRD and S, Fe, Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, we had studied the evolutions of leaching intermediates of chalcopyrite by In the present study, the bioleaching process and the evolution of intermediates during bioleaching of chalcopyrite by mixed mesophilic, moderately thermophilic and extremely thermophilic cultures were comparatively studied based on SR-XRD and S, Fe and Cu K-edge XANES spectroscopy. It will be helpful to comprehend the dissolution mechanism of chalcopyrite during bioleaching. The bioleaching microorganisms used in the present study were provided by the School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China. The mixed mesophilic culture was comprised by The chalcopyrite and the reference minerals used in the present study were provided by the School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China ( The mixed cultures were conducted in the 250 During leaching experiments, leaching solution was taken at 2-day intervals for mesophilic culture and moderately thermophilic culture, and at 1-day intervals for extremely thermophilic culture, until the cells of these cultures reached death period. The leaching parameters (such as cell density, pH and ORP values, total [Fe], percentage of [Fe The solid samples during bioleaching were taken at intervals according to changes of the leaching parameters in the leaching solution. The solid samples during leaching experiments were first washed three times with diluted sulfuric acid and diluted hydrochloric acid, respectively, in nitrogen, and then stored at −20 The cell density curves for these three mixed cultures ( By contrast, for the sterile control experiments at 30, 45 and 64 The dissolution of chalcopyrite is very complex, which could be attacked by Fe It should be noted that, whichever culture was conducted in the bioleaching experiment, the leaching parameters including total [Fe], the percentages of [Fe The S, Fe and Cu speciation on mineral surface was studied by SR-XRD ( The S, Fe and Cu K-edge XANES spectra of reference samples showed clear differences in the peak position and peak intensity and in their absorption edges ( The S, Fe, Cu speciation transformation of chalcopyrite during bioleaching was analyzed by linear combination fitting using the reference spectra from The fitted results of S K-edge XANES spectra of chalcopyrite during bioleaching of mixed mesophilic culture ( It should be noted that the fitted results of Fe and Cu K-edge XANES spectra ( The SR-XRD and S, Fe and Cu K-edge XANES analyses also showed that the iron-deficient bornite and chalcocite were detected at day 2 and day 4 for mixed mesophilic culture and extremely thermophilic culture, and at day 2 for mixed moderately thermophilic culture. Then bornite and chalcocite disappeared, and covellite appeared. The metal-deficient sulfide probably caused by the initial non-stoichiometric dissolution ( It should be noted that bornite could be easily oxidized and transformed to other species (Eqs. According to By combining SR-XRD and S, Fe, Cu K-edge XANES spectroscopy, we also found that jarosite gradually became the main component during bioleaching. The formation of jarosite was accelerated with the increase of [Fe It was noted that, in the present study, the leaching process of chalcopyrite by different temperature-grown mixed cultures was investigated with the evaluation of S, Fe, Cu speciation transformation of chalcopyrite. Although the study was done using flask conditions which were far from industrial situation, some useful information about the bioleaching mechanism can also be deduced. Whichever mixed culture was used for chalcopyrite bioleaching, the formations of bornite, chalcocite and covellite during bioleaching were confirmed associating with the ORP of the leaching solution. The copper extraction rate was closely related to the cell growth and the sulfur activity of the different temperature-grown cultures. With increasing of the growth temperature, the copper extraction rate was high and the leaching time was short. In addition, the formation of bornite at lower ORP conditions might also accelerate the copper extraction. Bioleaching experiments of chalcopyrite showed that the copper extraction rate in the leaching solution with mixed mesophilic culture, moderately thermophilic culture and extremely thermophilic culture was 59.20% (±0.63), 77.71% (±2.24) and 84.56% (±2.38), respectively, indicating that thermophiles, especially extreme thermophiles, can significantly promote bioleaching efficiency. The SR-XRD and S, Fe and Cu K-edge XANES analyses showed bornite and chalcocite first formed with a low ORP value (<500 This work is supported by
