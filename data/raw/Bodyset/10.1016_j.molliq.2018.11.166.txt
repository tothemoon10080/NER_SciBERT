This study focuses on preparation and characterization of physicochemical properties of a series of phosphorodithioate-bearing ionic liquids. They displayed low glass transition temperatures, high thermal stability, and were hydrophobic in character. The results of their ligation capability toward Pd(II) via 
                     31P NMR spectroscopy is also presented. The synthetic strategy has the potential to impart (EtO)2P(=S)S functionality to ionic liquids by providing the flexibility to incorporate long linkers and task-specific anion to enhance hydrophobicity.The field of ionic liquids (ILs) has been one of the most active and exciting areas of research over the past 15 years for both fundamental and applied research with >7000 contributions in 2017 alone [ The addition of an ion-tethered functional group onto IL structures has generated a new subclass of ILs, known as functionalized ILs. Functionalized ILs – also known as task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs) – present a new variety of applications that standard ILs have been unable to offer. The tunability of TSILs allows for functional diversity, as they can be customized by selecting which cationic and/or anionic species are implemented, for tasks ranging from organic synthesis to metal ion extraction. The growth in popularity of TSILs conveniently coincided with the uprising of green chemistry, leading to compounds with a myriad of functional capabilities while incorporating key green chemistry principles in the synthetic procedure, Organodithiophosphorus-based systems have found large-scale commercial applications, With these in mind, a simple and efficient methodology was implemented to carry out numerous reactions to synthesize twelve new functionalized ILs ( In an attempt to employ the thiol–ene reaction for the functionalization of ILs, which was recently reported by our group, [ The general strategy employed to synthesize ILs The ability to functionalize The thermal properties of the ILs were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a heating/cooling rate of 5 °C/min, resulting in glass transition temperatures ( To provide further insight into the structure-property relationship of the new ILs, their thermal stability Expectably, the hydrophobicity of ILs is enhanced as the longer alkyl spacers are purposefully placed. The solubility of ILs in water is illustrated in To gain insight about the most stable IL structures and ion interactions, the structure of Two IL structures were found based on the location of the anion ( The O The HOMO is localized on phosphate moiety of imidazolium cation, mostly electron lone pairs on sulfur atoms. The LUMO orbital is delocalized on the imidazolium ring. The HOMO ➔ LUMO transition is an intramolecular transition, with the HOMO-LUMO gap being 5.02 eV (see ESI, Fig. S1). The electrostatic potential energy map of complex (a) demonstrates a strong interaction between the O atoms of [NTf Another objective in this study is testing the complexation process of selected phosphorodithioate-functionalized ILs toward the Pd(II) element from 0.10 mol dm As a measure for the coordinating ability of the ILs, a complexometric titration of an increasing amount of Pd (II) was performed by There is a distinction in To summarize, we generated and characterized a library of Acknowledgment is made to the Donors of the  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
