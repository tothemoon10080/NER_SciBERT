Considering the available alternatives for automation of the operation and control of the pulp-froth interface, and aiming at its stabilization, as well as the accomplishment of scale-up parameters, CETEC (Technological Center of Minas Gerais Foundation), located in Belo Horizonte/Minas Gerais/Brazil, developed a computer-control system to vary the pulp-froth interface by varying the flow of non-floated fraction. The chosen alternative to control the flotation column operation aimed to render available an installation, in pilot plant scale, endowed with a control system with faster response and lower cost, compared to what is currently available on the market. In the system which is already in operation, and whose results will be presented here, FIELDBUS technology was used. Besides allowing further implementation of measurements and flow control at a distance, the system presents the basic characteristics of a “network architecture” and has as its main advantages: low installation cost, simple maintenance procedures, options to upgrade, information for quality control, and compatibility with equipment of various manufacturers.
