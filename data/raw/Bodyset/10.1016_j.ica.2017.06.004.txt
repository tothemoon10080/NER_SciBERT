Reaction of [Ru(PPh3)3Cl2] with 2-(methylthio)phenylsalicylaldimine Schiff-base (HL) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of triethylamine afforded a ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(ONS-L)(PPh3)2Cl]·CH3OH·2.75H2O (1). Similarly, reaction of [Ru(CO)2Cl2] with HL in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of triethylamine gave a ruthenium(II) complex [Ru(ONS-L)(CO)2Cl] (2), while the reaction between [Ru(CO)2Cl2] and HL without base resulted in a ruthenium(III) complex [Ru(ONS-L)(CO)Cl2] (3). Treatment of RuCl3·3H2O with HL in ethanol in the presence of triethylamine gave an anionic complex [Et3NH][Ru(ONS-L)Cl3] (4), which reacted with [Cp∗

Besides, reaction of 4 and AgNO3 afforded a dinuclear ruthenium(II) complex [Ru2(ONS-L)(μ-ONS-L)2Cl]·CH2Cl2 (6). The structures of complexes 1–6 have been established by X-ray crystallography, of which complex 4 was selected as a catalyst for the typical oxidation of 1-phenylethanol to the according acetophenone.Schiff-base ligands offer a considerable versatility in their substituent groups, and thus the possibility exists for designing transition metal complexes with useful biological and catalytic properties All synthetic manipulations were carried out under dry nitrogen by standard Schlenk techniques. Solvents were purified by standard procedures and distilled prior to use.
