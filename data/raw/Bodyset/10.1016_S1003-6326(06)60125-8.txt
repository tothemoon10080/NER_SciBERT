The silver in some silver-manganese ore with a grade of 3.15×10−4 was concentrated by a combined beneficiation technique including magnetic separation, flotation, reducing leaching and gravity desliming. The major silver contained in manganese ore as isomorphism was concentrated by magnetic separation, while around 8.50% of the silver individual minerals were separated by flotation. The manganese in the mixed concentrate of both magnetic separation and flotation was dissolved in a reducing leaching, in which some cellulose reductant named CMK was used. Part of the slime contained in leach residue was removed by a laboratory desliming equipment. A silver concentrate with a grade of 4.96×10−3 Ag and a recovery of 84.25% were obtained.
