Individual bubbles ca. 2.3mm in diameter were produced at a capillary in water containing an inorganic salt (NaClO4, KCl, NaCl, Na2SO4, or CaCl2). Using high speed photography and image analysis techniques, bubble aspect ratio and rise velocity were measured at 1ms time intervals over a distance ca. 1.15–1.20m above the capillary. All conditions showed oscillations in bubble aspect ratio and velocity that were related. Increasing concentration, on average, created more spherical bubbles that rose at lower velocities. The same observations were made in the presence of MIBC frother. Results suggest a unique relationship between bubble shape and rise velocity independent of solute type. The effect of inorganic salts on bubble behavior and gas dispersion in flotation systems is discussed.Froth flotation and gas dispersion in saline solutions has garnered increased attention in recent years ( Frother is typically added to flotation circuits with one function being the reduction of bubble rise velocity ( Much of the literature concerning bubble dispersions in inorganic salt solutions discusses their ability to inhibit bubble coalescence ( Much of the data on bubble rise velocity in inorganic salt solutions comes from oceanography and typically focuses on bubble diameters below 1 Researchers have found that bubble shape and velocity strongly interact in surfactant, polymer and inorganic salt solutions both close to and far from bubble generation ( It has been demonstrated that the nature of bubble formation (release) affects bubble shape, velocity and motion ( The present work aims to build upon the work of The experimental setup is shown in A Fastec Imaging (model No. HiSpec5 8G Mono) high-speed camera equipped with a Nikon–AF Micro Nikkor 60 Image sequences were analyzed off-line using ImageJ software and a macro which automatically calculated and tabulated: (1) bubble size, (2) bubble aspect ratio and (3) bubble velocity. These parameters were tracked at intervals of 1  The sphere-volume equivalent diameter (   Aspect ratio (   Bubble rise velocity was calculated from the vertical displacement of the center of the fitted ellipse over two consecutive frames. Constancy of bubble size in order to compare solutes is a necessary pre-condition. A total of 490 image sequences of rising bubbles were analyzed and an average bubble size was determined from each sequence. The average bubble size for all image sequences was 2.29        As noted by several researchers, the dynamic behavior of a rising bubble is reflected by changes in shape and velocity ( A feature of the aspect ratio – rise velocity relationship in Surface tension gradients help explain both bubble coalescence inhibition and reduced single bubble rise velocity with solute present. Several authors have characterized coalescence-inhibiting salt strength which correlates well with ionic strength ( Gas dispersion parameters (e.g. bubble size and gas holdup) play a key role in determining flotation kinetics ( The correlation noted between graphite recovery and gas holdup reflects the particle collection process which depends on bubble surface area and rise velocity. Collection would seem favoured by high surface area which can increase the number of particles transported, and by low rise velocity, i.e., high bubble retention time, which increases the number of collision events. Given that surface area increases as a spheroid becomes more oblate (i.e., for a given bubble volume a sphere is the geometry with the least interfacial surface area), Ellipsoidal bubbles of 2.3 The work was sponsored by Vale, Teck Resources, Xstrata Process Support, Barrick Gold, Shell Canada, SGS Lakefield Research, COREM and Flottec through the Chair in Mineral Processing under the NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) CRD (Collaborative Research and Development) program.
