The optimal treatment of calcaneal fractures (CF) is currently controversial and is still under debate. It is well established that conservative treatment of these fractures is associated with poor results. Several surgical techniques are described in the literature; however, there is no consensus on which of these is more effective. The main goals of surgery are to restore the subtalar joint congruence, and calcaneal width, height, shape and alignment, thus avoiding medial and lateral impingement and enabling the patient to resume a normal lifestyle. ORIF is the most popular technique for these fractures, but it is associated with high rates of wound complications, hardware failure and infections. Several minimally‐invasive techniques have been developed recently for the treatment of CF, with the common aim to be as simple, effective and inexpensive as possible and to reduce surgical times, complications and length of hospital stay.Many techniques are described in the literature: arthroscopically‐assisted reduction and fixation, calcaneoplasty and reduction and fixation through mini-incisions. Each of these techniques seems to achieve satisfactory results; nevertheless, prospective studies with wide patient cohorts and long‐term follow-up are needed. This paper analyses minimally‐invasive techniques for the treatment of CF and describes our experience in the management of these fractures with a minimally‐invasive approach under direct visual control. Calcaneal fractures (CF) are a common lower limb injury and represent 2% of all fractures and 60% of all tarsal bone fractures ORIF is considered the standard treatment for CF and can be performed through several approaches: lateral, medial, plantar, posterior or a combination of these. A wide lateral approach is the most popular technique; this provides good visualisation of fracture fragments and subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints, but it is associated with many complications In this paper, the authors analyse minimally-invasive techniques for the treatment of CF and describe their experience in the management of these fractures in a cohort of patients treated with reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires through a sinus tarsi incision. Patients with simple injury or with critical local soft tissue conditions may benefit most from minimally-invasive procedures The first minimally‐invasive percutaneous approach was proposed in 1855 by Clark, who introduced a pulley device for skeletal traction to reduce displaced fracture fragments Westhues, Gissane and Essex-Lopresti helped increase the popularity of percutaneous techniques in the first half of the 20th century Forgon described a three-point distraction system to the calcaneal tuberosity, talar trochlea and cuboid to manipulate the fracture fragments separately Currently, most surgeons use both the Forgon and Essex-Lopresti techniques; satisfactory results for these methods are well documented in the literature Stehlik and Stulik proposed a combination of direct percutaneous reduction of the articular surfaces using a Steinmann pin and indirect reduction of the anatomical calcaneus shape with traction and compression Tornetta gained experience with the Essex-Lopresti method, then proposed the use of a Steinmann pin for fracture fixation after achieving reduction, under fluoroscopic view, with leverage at the pin; however, once drainage and complications related to shoe wear were observed at the pin site scars, the procedure was changed to percutaneous screws fixation More recently, Gavlik reported good‐to‐excellent results in Sanders type II fractures treated with percutaneous reduction by pin leverage followed by minimally‐invasive screw fixation Stein reported the results of 47 CF treated with the Essex-Lopresti method and there were no complications Abdelgaid reported the results of 60 fractures reduced with Steinmann pins and fixed with cannulated screws with good‐to‐excellent results in 79.3%, and with no wound infections or complications at a mean follow-up of 29 months Walde treated 67 CF with traction followed by percutaneous wires fixation: at a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, Böhler's angle was restored in 70.1% of the patients, with 77.7% of good results and a complication rate of 6.5% The use of arthroscopy in combination with percutaneous techniques to obtain a better reduction of the subtalar joint has recently become more popular. Authors emphasise the decreased exposure to radiation for surgeons and patients, the precise view and the continuous monitoring of articular surface during the procedure, the improvement in anatomical reduction, the possibility of performing a debridement of the articular surface and a careful removal of osteochondral fragments Gavlik treated 15 CF of Sanders type II with percutaneous, arthroscopically‐assisted osteosynthesis; no wound complications were reported Positive results were also reported by Schuberth in 10 CF managed with arthroscopic assistance with good Böhler’s angle restoration and medial wall reconstruction Rammelt in 2002 examined the value of subtalar arthroscopy and showed similar results in 18 Sanders type II fractures treated with arthroscopy and percutaneous reduction, with a mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 94.1 at a minimum of one‐year follow-up Woon conducted a prospective study of 22 CF and found no wound complications or infections and good correction of Böhler's angle at two‐years follow-up with an AOFAS score of 84.2 Pastides treated 39 Sanders type II and III CF with percutaneous arthroscopic osteosynthesis and evaluated the results at mean follow-up of 24 months Despite the good results reported, arthroscopy has some disadvantages: the use of a metal bone tamp can lead to joint cavity penetration if a trajectory error occurs, and the dispersion of comminuted fracture fragments during elevation may require conversion to open surgery to achieve a proper reduction Bone substitutes can be used alongside percutaneous techniques to support and improve reduction and fixation. Chen reported the results of 38 patients with Sanders type II and III fractures treated with percutaneous reduction with cannulated screws and a calcium sulphate cement graft, and compared this group with 40 patients treated with ORIF Wee and Wong treated 12 fractures with calcium phosphate cement and reported no complications at seven months follow-up Jacquot and Atchabahian described percutaneous injection with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in four patients at a minimum three years follow‐up: good bony fusion and reduction were observed in all cases Percutaneous reduction techniques using inflating balloons have been used for several years in the spine to treat acute vertebral fractures As good results have been shown after kyphoplasty, this simple and reproducible minimally‐invasive technique has been applied by many authors in the treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures Mauffrey described a similar technique in one patient using an inflatable bone tamp device Gupta performed percutaneous balloon reduction followed by calcium sulphate injection in three patients and reported low complication rates and fast recovery Labbe studied six patients treated with the same technique at mean follow-up of 12 months Biggi retrospectively reviewed 11 patients with Sanders type II and III fractures treated with balloon-assisted augmentation with PMMA or calcium phosphate at an average follow-up of 24 months Vittore reported the results of 20 patients treated with a minimally‐invasive technique using an inflatable bone tamp filled with tricalcium phosphate, with Kirschner-wires used to help reduction and to direct balloon inflation, at a mean follow-up of 12.25 months Most of the authors reported excellent outcome in terms of bone healing and complications rate. The potential benefit from this technique resides in its economic costs and in the low rate of skin complications Few complications were reported, but concerns still remain about the possible extravasation of material into the subtalar joint with inadequate reduction of fracture fragments. Although good results have been reported, the majority of these studies had only a small group of patients with no statistical analysis. External fixation may represent a treatment option in cases of comminution or extensive soft tissue compromise. The main goals of external fixation are to provide anatomical reduction while avoiding extensile exposure of the soft tissue. In treating complex CF, external fixation appears to minimise skin complications, restore a good calcaneal volume and shape, and enable early weight-bearing. Several studies have shown that early postoperative weight-bearing may result in better outcome and can represent an induction for bone healing Schepers treated 61 fractures with custom-made distractors and percutaneous cancellous screws; at one‐year follow-up there were 72% good‐to-excellent results with a mean AOFAS score of 83 Roukis also reported good long-term results with external fixation in 66 fractures Battaglia et al. proposed an early minimally‐invasive percutaneous fixation of displaced intra-articular CF with a percutaneous angle stable device High wound complication rates have been reported secondary to the extended approaches; therefore, several minimally‐invasive open techniques have been proposed to minimise soft tissue‐related problems, while enabling a direct vision of the fracture site The sinus tarsi approach is one of the most commonly described approaches in the literature, although it is less common than the extensile lateral approach The sinus tarsi technique allows direct exposure of the posterior subtalar and calcaneocuboid joints, thereby enabling good reduction of posterior subtalar joint depression and calcaneocuboid articular malalignment There are many advantages of this approach, particularly limited surgical time and fewer wound complications and nerve injuries compared to the extensile lateral approach Kikuchi reviewed the results of 22 Sanders type II, III and IV CF treated with the limited sinus tarsi approach at an average follow-up of 28 weeks Hospodar treated 16 consecutive displaced intra-articular CF with the limited sinus tarsi approach Although direct exposure has its advantages, visualisation is limited with this approach and, according to some authors, a displaced posterior tuberosity may be more difficult to reduce Fixation can be achieved with different devices: many reports in the literature describe the use of screws, different plates or Kirschner-wires, with variable application of bone grafting or bone graft substitutes Although the use of isolated screws is well established in the literature, concern remains about the less rigid fixation they might provide compared with Plates The use of a minimally‐invasive technique with rigid fixation using locking plates is a widely accepted treatment that combines the advantages of both methods to facilitate immediate postoperative mobilisation, earlier rehabilitation, and improved wound healing Many different plates designed for minimal incisions are currently available on the market and have variable features including locking, non-locking or both, with similar results reported in the literature Kirschner-wires fixation represents another option. In the literature, this type of treatment is usually described in the management of particularly unstable fracture dislocations of the subtalar and calcaneocuboid joint, when stable fixation cannot be achieved, or in cases where open reduction is contraindicated due to multiple risk factors We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 91 patients with 97 displaced intra-articular CF treated with a sinus tarsi approach and Kirschner-wires transfixation and/or screw osteosynthesis Patient positioning was supine or in lateral decubitus on a radiolucent table. A proximal thigh tourniquet was usually applied. Skin incision ranged from 2 to 6 A non-weight‐bearing plaster cast was applied after surgery and maintained for 30 Ninety-one consecutive patients with 97 displaced intra-articular CF were reviewed. Mean age at operation was 42.5 years (range: 17–74 years). Fifty-two patients presented risk factors for wound complications, such as smoking (46 patients), peripheral vascular disease (six patients), and diabetes (seven patients). All patients underwent initial radiographical evaluation, including anteroposterior, lateral, and axial views, with further fracture characterisation using CT. Fractures were classified according to both the Essex-Lopresti and Sanders classification systems Böhler’s angle was measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at final available follow-up. Functional outcome scores were evaluated through AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot scale. The average preoperative Böhler’s angle was 8.1° (range −6° − 29°), with an immediate postoperative measurement of 26.7° (range 15° − 40°). Mean follow-up was 26.9 months (12–42 months). Average Böhler’s angle at final follow-up was 24.6° (range 9°- 40°), indicating only a few degrees of subsidence or correction loss. Thirteen patients developed a wound dehiscence that resolved with standard wound care. Mean AOFAS Ankle–Hindfoot score at the final follow-up was 87.8 (range 58–100). Splitting functional results according to Sanders classification, 62 patients out of 79 with fracture types II or III reported excellent or good results while six patients out of 12 with type IV CF reported poor results. The minimally‐invasive sinus tarsi approach and Kirschner-wires transfixation for the treatment of CF combines the advantages of direct visualisation of the subtalar joint, thereby enabling anatomical reduction, with minimal hardware implantation and thus reducing wounds complications. The conditions necessary to achieve satisfactory results include knowledge of the type of fracture to be treated and careful preoperative planning. In our experience, fracture reduction is challenging in Sanders fracture type IV, where there is severe fracture comminution, and loss of reduction over time is common; therefore, a direct subtalar joint fusion is suggested for patients with this type of fracture. There are concerns regarding the potential risk of loss of reduction and redislocation following Kirschner-wire transfixation. Buch treated 172 CF with Kirschner-wire transfixation: despite the good-to-excellent results in 65.7% of patients, Kirschner‐wire migration occurred in 22% of cases We observed an average of only 2.1° loss of reduction in Böhler’s angle at final follow-up. This result is because of the meticulous postoperative treatment. Patients must be extremely compliant considering that full weight‐bearing without aids is not allowed until 10 weeks after surgery. If supported by plaster cast immobilisation, Kirschner-wires enable stable fixation with reduced surgical time and without permanent osteosynthesis devices, thus reducing infection rate and avoiding, or at least decreasing, the need for additional revision surgery or subsequent hardware removal. We performed screw fixation of subtalar joint fragments in a minority of our patients. Considering the high complexity of these injuries, screw fixation was achievable in most of Sanders type II fractures, but became more challenging in types III and IV. Several minimally‐invasive techniques have been reported in the literature for the treatment of CF with lower complications than those reported for standard open procedures. Although the results are satisfactory in the majority of these series, prospective studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up are required to better evaluate both the drawbacks and the advantages of each of these techniques.
