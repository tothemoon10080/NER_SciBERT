In the theory of grinding kinetics, the grindability of a material is the only factor used to determine the required size of a grinding machine. So for users of the Tower mill, this grindability is expressed through Bond's work index (W
                     i). However, the uniformity constant (n), which is found empirically by using a small Tower mill and is expressed also as the grindability of material, can be of great help to designers in the determination of the real parameters of a Tower mill. The present study is an approach to establish a relationship between the Bond's third theory of comminution and the above-mentioned constant of grinding kinetics. The validity of the obtained relationship,

                     has been confirmed with a correlation coefficient of 0.855** through a regression analysis of 22 samples of limestone.The Tower mill is a vertical stirred type of grinding equipment developed in the early 1950s by the Japanese At present, the biggest Tower mills operate in Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) plants. They are furnished with a 1500-hp (1120 kW) motor and have a grinding capacity of 65 t of limestone per hour. To determine the size of these equipments, grinding tests are carried out in an original way on 70 kg of raw materials; and measured values of the uniformity constant ( In the theory of grinding kinetics, selected particles of size By substitution of Thus, In the Bond's third theory of comminution, the particle size distribution is used to evaluate the work index ( Thus, if  As for Since the circulating load CL depends on the mill discharge (see In the specific case of In a Tower mill, the stirring power is almost settled when the mass of balls is definite, but the energy required to grind materials of size Substituting From the above relationship, As kinetic factors In Japan, the Bond's work index ( Experiments were carried out in a closed wet-grinding circuit as shown in Collected data were analyzed using the grinding kinetics As shown in The values reported in To certify these results, a comparative study was carried out on three samples of iron minerals, and analyzed data show a tendency similar to the one observed in grinding limestone is found out after a thorough analysis of collected data. The present investigations have shown that a relationship could be established between the Bond's work index (
