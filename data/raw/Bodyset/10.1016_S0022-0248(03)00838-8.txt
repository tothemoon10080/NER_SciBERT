The microstructure and crystallization habit of natural abalone shells were characterized with the methods of SEM and XRD, etc. The soluble proteins extracted from the abalone shell play an important role on controlling the morphology and transformation of the mineral phase in the abalone shell. In vitro crystallization experiments of calcium carbonate showed that the addition of the soluble protein accelerates the transformation from vaterite to calcite.The abalone shell, with highly ordered calcium carbonate lamellar structure of aragonite morphology, having a layered-structure with about 5% (wt.) organic species, is an excellent example of natural composites which exhibits remarkable mechanical properties compared to pure minerals The abalone (Haliotis Discus Hannai Ino) shells were obtained from the sea-culture of Dalian Fisheries University (Bohai Sea of Northern China), of which AS means the shell of alive abalone until it was sacrificed for experiments, DS the shell of dead abalone died about 1 year ago in the sea-culture, and HS the heated alive abalone shell seethed in boiling water for 10 One gram of abalone shell powders was agitated with 25 All containers for crystallization were submersed in K The soluble protein solution was concentrated with a Zip Tip C The molecular weight of the main component of the soluble proteins extracted from AS was 9634 The In order to check the efficiency of the water soluble proteins on the controlling morphology of CaCO In conclusion, the water soluble proteins of abalone shell play an important role both on stabilizing the lamellae aragonite of CaCO This work was partly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [20151004] and the Foundation from the State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics & Chemistry [01-B-08].
