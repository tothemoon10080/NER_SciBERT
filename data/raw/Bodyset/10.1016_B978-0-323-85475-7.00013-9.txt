Traumatic injuries to the knee are extremely common but only rarely severe, the vast majority being benign sprains or contusions.
               Significant damages are usually seen during mid to high-velocity accidents where severe axial (with or without a flexed knee) or lateral (“bumper injury”) compression forces are applied to the knee. In adults, the lateral tibial plateau and the patella are preferentially involved. In children, injuries affect the patella or the extensor system in about half of the cases (patellar dislocations).
               Radiographs remain the firstline imaging, CT being indicated to evaluate an articular fracture or to detect articular loose fragments.
               Joint effusion is reliable indirect sign of injury: it can be either a hemarthrosis reflecting, at least, a tear of articular soft tissue (ligament, meniscus) or a lipohemarthrosis that reveals an articular fracture.
               Some benign-looking avulsions (such as Segond fracture) have to be recognized as they are indirect signs of more serious ligament injuries.Two main mechanisms of injury: axial compression with (dashboard) or without flexed knee (fall); lateral impact (“bumper injury”) Lateral tibial plateau: most common injuries in adults Patella: frequently involved in both children and adults Hemarthrosis = intraarticular soft tissue (ligament, meniscal) injuries (at least) Lipohemarthrosis = articular fracture Benign-looking avulsions can reveal severe ligament injuries Joint effusion Lipohemarthrosis Foreign body Plateau outlines Femoral condyle outline Tibiofemoral alignment Patella height (alta, baja) Patella outline Soft tissue mass (quadricipital and patellar tendon) Anatomy Tibiofemoral joint Femoropatellar joint Imaging Ottawa knee rules Radiograph series Radiological anatomy AP view Lateral view Fat pad and joint effusion Mechanisms of injury What to look for and where? Knee injuries in adults Knee injuries in children Fractures of distal femur Condylar fractures Avulsion fractures Impaction fractures Osteochondral injuries Stress fractures Distal epiphyseal injuries in children Fractures of the tibia Fractures of tibial plateau Stress fractures Tibial avulsions Knee dislocation Classification Imaging Patella and extensor system injuries Patellar fractures Patellar dislocation Extensor system injury Fibula fractures References The knee is the largest joint of the body, and consists of two joints sharing a common joint space cavity tibiofemoral joint: between the femur and tibia patellofemoral joint: between the femur and patella The proximal tibiofibular joint connects the fibular head with the lateral tibial condyle and is independent of the knee joint. Nevertheless, the integrity of the fibular head must be checked in any knee trauma, as its involvement can reveal associated capsuloligamentous injury (“arcuate sign,” discussed later). The articular surfaces of the femur are the medial and lateral condyles that are rounded structures separated by the intercondylar notch ( The articular surfaces of the tibia are the medial and lateral condyles (also called plateau). Both are concave, and the medial condyle is larger than the lateral one as it transmits most of the body weight. The intercondylar eminence separates the condyles. This ridge bears the tibial spines where the distal fibers of the anterior cruciate ligament insert. The patella is a flat and triangular bone entrapped within the quadriceps muscle tendon and is the largest sesamoid bone of the body ( Distally, the patella attaches to the anterior tibial tuberosity by the patellar ligament. Laterally, the patella is stabilized by the lateral and medial retinacula that blend with collateral ligaments and muscles fascia. Radiographs are the first-line imaging modality. Guidelines, known as the Ottawa knee rules, were defined to avoid unnecessary examinations [ Patients with knee injury that required radiographs are thoser with any of these findings: age 55 or older isolated tenderness of the patella (no bone tenderness of knee other than patella, no distractive pain) tenderness of the head of the fibula inability to flex the knee to 90° inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency room department for four steps (counts even if the patient limps) Standard series include AP and lateral views The AP view is realized with the patient in the supine position with the leg extended, the knee and ankle in contact with the table The lateral view can be realized with a vertical beam (most of the cases) or with a horizontal beam [ An axial image can be added to evaluate the femoropatellar joint. The projection is usually inferosuperior, with the knee flexed to 40°. The distance between lines tangent to tibial plateaux and femur condyles should not exceed 5 mm ( The patella should project in the midline of the femoral sulcus. The distal pole of the patella should not project more than 20 mm above the plane of the femoral condyles ( On a strict lateral view, the femoral condyles are superimposed. If the knee is slightly rotated, it can be possible to distinguish between medial and lateral condyles, because of minor asymmetries ( the femoral notch of the lateral condyle (lateral notch) the adductor tubercle, a bony elevation proximal to the posterior side of the medial femoral The lateral notch is a mild depression; its depth should be less than 2 mm in normal conditions. A deeper notch reveals an osteochondral impaction of the lateral condyle by the tibial plateau, usually after an anterior cruciate ligament injury [ The medial femoral condyle can have a femoral notch as well, more anteriorly placed and only rarely seen. The adductor tubercle is the insertion site of the adductor magnus and medial gastrocnemius muscles. It can appear irregular in children because of the traction of the above mentioned muscles, and is sometimes called a cortical desmoid On a strict lateral view, the plateaux are superimposed, and only the intercondylar eminence forms a distinct line The height of the patella is best evaluated on the lateral view ( The patella is commonly located between two femoral lines: Blumensaat’s line representing the roof of the intercondylar notch physeal scar The Insall–Salvati ratio is a commonly used method of assessing the patellar height: in normal conditions, the length of the patellar tendon divided by the greatest length of the patella should be approximately 1 (range: 0.8–1.2) Three fat pads are present within the knee joint Infrapatellar fat pad (or Hoffa’s fat pad) (IP): inferior to the patella, posterior to the patellar tendon Prefemoral fat (PF): anterior to the distal shaft of the femur Suprapatellar fat pad (SP): triangular, superior to the patella and anterior to the suprapatellar recess In mild effusion, fluid first obliterates the prefemoral fat pad ( Lipohemarthrosis is a particular joint effusion combining blood and fat, secondary to an articular fracture with the migration of medullar fat within the joint space [ The knee is a very vulnerable joint, exposed to various types of injuries including direct blow, axial loading, bending forces, rotation, or any combination therein. Injuries can be either of high energy (motor vehicle or motorcycle crash) or of low-energy (fall from standing height) Injuries can be direct (fracture at the level of the vector of force) or indirect (fracture away from the level of the vector of energy) [ Common mechanisms of direct injuries are ( dashboard injury with direct impact on the patella, distal femur and proximal tibia ( direct blow to the lower limb (“bumper injury” from motor vehicle) direct fall on the patella Common mechanisms of indirect injuries are ( fall on an extended lower limb with compression forces along the distal femur and tibial plateau dashboard injury with compression forces along femoral shaft Forced contraction of the quadriceps with patellar avulsion Lateral tibial plateau fracture ( Patella fracture Lateral femoral condyle fracture Tibial spine avulsion Distal femoral epiphysis fracture Patellar fracture and dislocation Fractures of the distal femur represent about 6% of femoral fractures and 3–5% of all fractures [ The lateral condyle is three times more affected than the medial one. Most of articular fractures are in the sagittal plane. Coronal plane fractures, especially of the posterior femoral condyle (Hoffa fractures), are rare Fractures of the distal femur classically result from an impact on a flexed knee The most commonly used classification is the OA classification that distinguishes between type A: extraarticular (supracondylar) type B: partial articular (unicondylar) type C: complete articular (intercondylar or Y-shaped) involving both condyles, the articular surface is totally separated from the distal femur. Most distal femur fractures are obvious on radiographs and a significant degree of displacement is almost always present [ Fractures can be more difficult to detect in elderly as displacement is rarer (low energy trauma) and bones are diffusely demineralized. Joint effusion, and more specifically lipohemarthrosis, should alert on the existence of an articular injury [ The femoral insertion of the lateral and medial collateral ligaments on respective epicondyles can be avulsed [ The Pellegrini–Stieda lesion is a bony spur on the medial epicondyle, that is a scar from a prior medial ligament injury Impaction of the lateral condyle happens in about 80% of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear Osteochondral injuries can be developmental (osteochondrosis) or acquired (osteochondral fractures) disorders. Osteochondrosis is a spectrum of diseases resulting from an abnormal enchondral ossification Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a form of osteochondrosis in which a fragment of cartilage (with or without a fragment of subchondral bone) is not fully integrated within the epiphysis ( Stress fractures of the distal femur happen in athletes or in elderly with osteoporosis. The medial condyle is mostly affected as it bears most of the body weight Radiographs can remain normal for several weeks, and later show the typical linear sclerosis of the fracture line ( Fractures of the distal femoral epiphysis are common in children, representing about 1 percent of all fractures Fractures are classified upon Salter-Harris ( type 1: fracture that traverses the entire physeal–metaphyseal interface (10%) type 2: the most common pattern (70%), varus/valgus displacement associated with a metaphyseal fragment of variable size type 3: fracture that involves either the medial or the lateral condyle type 4: fracture that involves condyles and metaphysis type 5: impaction of the physis Fractures of tibial plateau represent about 1% of all fractures They have a bimodal distribution. Over 50% of fractures happen in patients over the age of 50 years. In these population, there are usually simple fractures, after a fall from the patient’s height. Before the age of 30, most fractures of the tibial plateau are complex fractures, resulting from a motor accident or in high-energy sports injuries (skiing, football, rugby, etc.) Three main mechanisms of injury can be identified [ axial loading during a fall on an extended lower limb (most common mechanism of injury). Force is transmitted through the femoral condyles into the medial or lateral plateau, or both ( lateral impact with a forced valgus. A compression injury of the lateral side of the knee is associated with a distraction injury of the medial side (“bumper” fractures) ( anterior impact usually on a flexed knee (“dashboard” injury) ( The Schatzker’s classification is the most widely used [ type 1: split (wedge) fracture of the lateral plateau without articular depression type 2: split (wedge) wedge fracture of the lateral plateau associated with articular depression (split/depression fracture lateral) type 3: isolated articular depression fracture of the lateral plateau (depression fracture lateral). type 4: medial plateau fracture, most likely associated with tibial eminence fracture. type 5: bicondylar fracture, without metaphyseal involvement. type 6: unicondylar or bicondylar fracture, with metaphyseal involvement. An attentive checking of the contour of tibial plateau is mandatory not to overlook mildly displaced fractures. Undisplaced fractures can appear as subtle step-off or impaction. The existence of a lipohemarthrosis is an important clue for the diagnosis. Any doubtful case on radiographs must benefit from a CT or MR examination [ Lipohemarthrosis is a joint effusion of mixed blood and fat and is an indirect but reliable indicator of an articular fracture ( In such fractures, the medullar fat can migrate within the joint space. Fat and blood don’t mix, and fat will float over blood, creating a blood/fat level, better seen with a horizontal beam. The detection of lipohemarthrosis help in limiting the number of overlooked tibial plateau fractures Stress fractures of proximal tibial are not uncommon; they can be seen in both athletes or elderly with osteoporosis Radiographs can remain normal for several weeks, and show the typical linear sclerosis of the fracture line only several weeks after the onset of pain The anterior cruciate ligament inserts on the medial tibial spine of the intercondylar eminence The avulsed fragment is pushed backwards and upward within the intercondylar notch, appearing as an additional image on both AP and lateral views [ Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) avulsion fractures are rare, as PCL injuries are most commonly intrasubstance tears. PCL inserts in a posterior depression on the intercondylar eminence known as the PCL fossa Segond fracture corresponds to an avulsion fracture on the outer side of the lateral tibial plateau, presumably of the lateral capsule, iliotibial ligament and a portion of the lateral collateral ligament ( Segond fracture develops following an internal rotating moment of the tibia on the femur and is with a rupture of the ACL in almost all the cases (same mechanism of injury) [ “Reverse Segond” fracture is the avulsion of the deep fibers of the medial collateral ligament at the level of the medial aspect of the medial tibial plateau ( The avulsion of anterior tibial tuberosity classically happens in adolescents, just before the completion of growth, during a sudden contraction of the quadriceps ( The tuberosity is an apophysis, a secondary ossification that appears next to the primary ossification center within the tibial proximal epiphysis. In trauma, the tuberosity is first avulsed by the traction of the patellar tendon, then the fracture can run across the whole physis The most commonly used is the modified Ogden classification (with modifiers for displacement) ( type 1: fracture of the secondary ossification center near the patella tendon insertion type 2: fracture between the primary and secondary ossification centers type 3: fracture that traverses the primary and secondary ossification centers (most common type) type 4: fracture through the entire physis type 5: avulsion of the periosteal sleeve This avulsion needs to be distinguished from the Osgood–Schlatter disease (OSD) Knee dislocations are rare, requiring high-energy trauma. Nevertheless, they are severe conditions because of the frequently associated vascular (popliteal artery), nervous (peroneal nerve) and ligamentous injuries [ Three main types of knee dislocation exist, based on the movement of the tibia with respect to the femur ( anterior (40%) secondary to a forced hyperextension of the knee posterior (30%): secondary to an axial load on a flexed knee (dashboard injury) lateral (20%): secondary to a varus or valgus force The diagnostic of knee dislocation is usually obvious on radiographs as the dislocated tibia only rarely auto-reduces ( Soft tissue (ligaments, capsule) damages are usually significant and can be already suggested on radiographs Nevertheless, MRI remains best suited to demonstrate tearing of capsule, ligaments and meniscus, or cartilage impaction ( Patellar fractures represent about 1 percent of all fractures and occur in both children and adults [ The most common circumstance of patellar fractures is a direct blow, usually a fall or an impact on a flexed knee [ Indirect injuries, caused by a forced quadriceps contraction, are less frequent Several classifications exist, but a morphological description of fracture line remains a relatively straightforward approach (Neyret classification) ( type A: horizontal fracture (about 50%) type B: vertical fracture (about 20%) type C: comminutive fracture, with impaction against the femoral condyles, and potential injury to both the femoral and patellar cartilage. type D: osteochondral injury type E: apex sleeve avulsion Small proximal or distal avulsion-type fractures should not be missed ( Patella bipartite is a developmental non-fusion of a secondary center at the superolateral aspect of the patella Clues to the diagnostic are the characteristic superolateral location the lenticular shape the medial sclerotic border Defect dorsal of the patella is a developmental abnormality of the superolateral quadrant of the patella Most patellar dislocations are lateral. They result from an internal rotation of the femur relative to a fixed tibia with the knee usually in extension and the patella not fully engaged in the trochlea groove If the dislocation is not reduced, radiographs show the abnormal position of the patella, superimposed or lateral to the lateral femoral condyle ( If the dislocation is already reduced at time of imaging, indirect findings can reveal the prior impact of the patella with the lateral condyle or the injury to the medial retinaculum [ Findings suggestive of the diagnosis are ( joint effusion avulsion at the medial aspect of the patella vertical fracture of the medial aspect of the patella osteochondral defect of medial patellar facet or lateral trochlea of femur free floating osteochondral fragment within the joint cavity The extensor system is an osteoligamentous chain formed by the quadriceps tendon, the patella, the patellar tendon and the tibial tuberosity. A failure of any of those components lead to an impairment of knee extension ( Quadriceps and patellar tendon ruptures are typically indirect low-energy injuries. The typical circumstance is a forceful quadriceps contraction with the knee in a flexed position [ Radiographs are first line imaging, but reveal only indirect sign of tendons injuries Radiographic findings suggestive of quadricipital tendon injuries are ( inferior displacement of patella (patella “baja”) blurring of the normal quadriceps tendon silhouette suprapatellar mass bony fragments of avulsion Radiographic findings suggestive of patellar tendon injuries are ( superior displacement of patella, with a position superior to Blumensaat’s line (patella “alta”) obliteration of the patellar tendon shadow infrapatellar mass avulsion of anterior tibial tuberosity Most fractures are traumatic avulsions of lateral collateral ligament and biceps femoris tendon from the head of the fibula ( This injury is rarely isolated and occur in the setting of a knee sprain or dislocation. When present, this sign is therefore pathognomonic for an associated posterolateral corner (PLC) injury
