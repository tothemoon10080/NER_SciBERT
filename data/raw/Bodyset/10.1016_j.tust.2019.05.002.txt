Block theory has been widely used in analyzing the stability of rock blocks during engineering activities in jointed rock masses due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. This paper extended the traditional block theory to tunnels constructed using tunnel boring machine (TBM) by incorporating the disc cutter-block interaction mechanism. The rock blocks were divided into front, corner and rear blocks according to their spatial positions with respect to the cutterhead. The interaction between different blocks and the disc cutters mounted on the cutterhead were examined by estimating the forces exerted by disc cutters on the blocks relative to the location of the blocks in the face, direction of movement of the discs, and the depth of penetration. The estimated forces were then used in a subsequent analysis to calculate factor of safety for individual blocks and probability of blocks dislodging from its location. Two new evaluation parameters,

                      is the ratio of cutterhead rotation angles making a block unstable to the total rotation angles in a revolution which reflects the possibility of encountering an unstable block during a single round of revolution. This paper discussed the implementation of the idea of using fundamental concepts of block theory to determine block stability at the face and related analysis for assessment of face stability. The proposed method was used in evaluation of the stability conditions for a water-conveyance tunnel in western China that is currently under construction using a hard rock TBM.Rock mass in nature can be generally categorized into intact rock, blocky rock, and fractured rock according to the density of discontinuities ( In the traditional block theory, the unstable blocks can move into the opening or the excavated space with no restrictions. However, the blocks surrounding TBM tunnels will encounter the machine (either the cutterhead or the shield(s)) when moving into the excavated space. Therefore, the limit equilibrium analysis in the traditional block theory can no longer represent the stability issues of unstable blocks subject to the TBM-block interaction. Block theory for TBM tunnels is based on the traditional block theory ( The basic assumptions of the traditional block theory are retained, including planar joints, rigid blocks, and circular or polygonal joint shape. Furthermore, the failure modes are limited to vertical falling, single-plane or double-plane sliding. Sliding is assumed to be a shear failure at the joint surface. Apart from these assumptions, some additional assumptions specific to TBM tunnels for taking TBM-block interaction into account are described below: The process of rock breakage by disc cutters is assumed to be incremental (position of the face relative to the block as the machine advances) and represented by cutting forces exerted by the cutter to the block. The excavation face is assumed to be a circular plane so that the cutterhead-block interaction can be simplified as the combination of disc cutter-block interaction. There are different concepts for building a model of blocky rock mass including specific, ubiquitous and probabilistic approaches as three conventional strategies adopted to build complex rock mass models ( The discontinuities (including joints, fractures and faults) are located in the rock mass with certain geometrical characteristics, including dip angle, dip direction, extent and spacing. Two types of joints are usually generated to build a rock block system: deterministic joints and stochastic joints. The deterministic joints are dominated by prescribed geometrical parameters while the stochastic joints are identified by statistic distribution of the geometrical parameters, subject to pre-determined probability distribution functions. For example, the orientation parameters usually obey Fisher’s distribution and the extent may follow exponential, gamma, lognormal or normal distributions ( Each joint splits the rock system into two half-spaces and the intersections of the half-spaces form identified blocks. The blocks can be divided into infinite and finite types when considering the extent and spacing of the joints, or into convex and concave due to the angle between the planes representing the joints which is based on the joint dip angle and orientation. After excavation of the opening in the rock mass, the blocks can be further classified into joint blocks and excavation-induced blocks ( In TBM tunnels, particular characteristics of blocks are defined by the machine-rock interaction. Thus, blocks can be sorted into front or face blocks, corner blocks and wall or rear blocks according to their spatial relationship relative to the boring machine as shown in Based on the new method proposed by Naturally, the joint planes have the ability to restrict the movement of blocks, but the excavation surfaces make no contribution to the block’s motion. Subject to the definition of finite block in previous section, the block pyramid (BP) is inherently empty, which can be ignored in the analysis. According to the removability theorem ( If JP is non-empty, the block is removable; otherwise, the block is stable, or stationary and non-removable. A finite block is removable only when all the points belonging to the block are removable. The removability of a block is the intersection of the removability of the points, which is independent of the geometrical convexity. Therefore, it is not necessary to divide a concave block into several convex sub-blocks to indirectly identify the removability of the concave block from the removability of sub-blocks. The improvement can be described as: The joint pyramid (JP) is calculated by the joints forming the block, ignoring the convexity and concavity of the block. This section introduces the determination of the cutter-block interaction relative to the magnitude of cutting forces (normal and tangential forces). The concept of factor of safety for block stability and two evaluation parameters are used to describe the stability features of the block in a TBM tunnel. This includes failure ratio of unstable area to the excavation face area for a rotation angle. According to the basic assumptions, the cutterhead-block interaction forces can be reduced to the exchange of cutting forces which simplifies the modeling. The cutting forces consist of normal force and rolling or tangential force ( For a given block, the cutter acting on the block is defined as Full scale laboratory cutting tests, modeling based on force estimation formulas, and numerical simulation can also be utilized to calculate the magnitude of cutting forces exerted on a single disc cutter ( For the TBM tunnelling in rock masses, the active forces for dislodging rock blocks are a combination of weight, water pressure, in-situ stress, tectonic stress, and cutting forces imposed by disc cutters. As indicated in the previous section, TBM cutterhead forces act on front/corner blocks, but do not on rear blocks. Consequently, the forces acting on a block can be divided into two parts: When incorporating the forces, three kinematics modes are investigated based on the traditional block theory: falling, single-plane, and double-plane sliding. The basic factors of safety for the three types of movements are derived as following. For free falling motion, there is no reaction force from joints. The sliding direction As for single-plane sliding, reaction forces come from one single joint, controlling the block motion. The sliding direction where The resistance force In double-plane sliding motion, the sliding direction is along the intersection line of planes The resistance forces are distributed in both of the two sliding joint planes, derived as: Then, the safety factor can be expressed by: The block is a key block or an unstable block if the safety factor is less than a certain threshold limit, which must be reinforced before excavated. Usually, the threshold limit of factor of safety is set as 1. Normally, the direct consequence of encountering an unstable block on the cutterhead is the clogging or damage of the cutterhead. The factor of safety in traditional block theory analysis can represent the stability of a block but is insufficient to reflect the influence of cutting force on block stability. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new evaluation parameters that can represent both features of block stability due to its geometry and joint properties and the impacts of cutting forces. During the TBM tunnelling, the cutterhead motion is coupled by translational movement of the head, or combined advancement and rotation. Therefore, the movement of a cutter on the cutterhead follows a helical trajectory ( Failure ratio of unstable area At a given cutterhead position, there could be several unstable front or corner blocks interacting with the cutterhead, each of which has a free excavation surface formed by the working face. The relative failure ratio of exposed area can represent the extent of risk of face collapse by an unstable block to the tunnel face. Usually, the risk of an unstable block correlates with the failure ratio of exposed area. The general risk or probability of unstable face can be obtained by summing the failure ratios of all the unstable blocks, expressed as: The influence of unstable blocks on the cutterhead is determined by the relative geometrical size between the block and the cutterhead. The block B4 in Failure ratio of cutterhead rotation For a given rotation angle, the disc cutters are stationary in their position, and move with rotation of the head. Thus, the cutter-block interaction forces change according to the rotational position of the head and consequently the stability status of the blocks will change ( When rotation angle of the cutterhead changes, the block stability as represented by factor of safety, changes to the point where the block may dislodge as factor of safety becomes smaller than 1. As shown in This failure ratio of cutterhead rotation is used to describe the possibility of occurrence of a single unstable block during a single revolution of the cutterhead. For all the unstable blocks at a given excavation position, the overall failure ratio of cutterhead rotation for excavation face Note that in the numerator union set It is obvious that the probability of block instability during a cutterhead revolution is related to the failure ratio of cutterhead rotation. This ratio is used to express the influence of cutterhead revolution on the varying stability status. BLKLAB (block laboratory) was originally developed by Step 1: Establish an appropriate computational domain Step 2: Generate deterministic joints/stochastic joints Step 3: Generate rock mass system (first split the rock into element blocks and then assemble them into complex blocks representing rock mass) Step 4: Establish TBM tunnel sections and regenerate the excavation face for each section Step 5: Analysis of removability and stability Step 6: Stability analysis of given excavation chainages considering the TBM-block interaction forces To evaluate the capabilities of the model and observe its suitability for use in practical applications, a case study was performed. The studied project is a water-conveyance tunnel in western China. The tunnel has a designed inner diameter of 5.3 m and is 41.823 km in length. As shown in The anticipated geological risks in the tunnel includes: Water inrush in water bearing zones, mostly the fault zones and fractured rocks; Large deformation in the squeezing rocks, i.e. grade IV and grade V rock masses; Rock burst in relatively intact rocks due to the high in-situ stresses, mainly in grade I and grade II grounds; Collapse of the face through unstable rock blocks formed by discontinuities in hard rocks, mainly appearing in grade II and grade III grounds. This paper will investigate ground stability in selected tunnel chainages to evaluate the stability of blocks in grade II and grade III ground which is primarily in hard rocks. At the time of completion of the preliminary study, 2 km of the tunnel has been excavated by TBM NO.1. During the excavation, different ground behaviors were observed. For example, blocks of the roof were dislodged and fell directly onto the steel ribs and formed irregular caverns ( The section between K11+577 and K11+590 was selected as a representative section in this study. To include all the blocks in K11+577–K11+590, a computational domain with 20 m × 30 m × 20 m in dimension was established, representing the chainage between K11+570 to K11+600. The range of the domain is [0, 20] × [0, 30] × [0, 20], as shown in Direction of a joint in the tunnel/model coordinate system is equal to the direction in natural system plus 12°. In this section, all the orientation parameters are relative to the tunnelling coordinate system. According to the results of geotechnical investigation, there are several joints in tunnel section from K11+584 to K11+621. The report predicted that joints would cut the rock into structurally unstable blocks. The onsite daily inspection reports indicated that unstable blocks occurred between K11+586 to K11+617. In this section, several excavation positions were mapped to obtain joint information supplementary to the vertical borehole data. The position of cutters can be determined based on the cutterhead configuration. A local coordinate system According to the daily geotechnical inspection report of tunnelling during the construction, section K11+581.28–K11+599.21 was excavated during February 1st 10:00 AM to February 2nd 10:00 AM, 2018. The boring machine recorded the total thrust force of the cutterhead every 1 min. From 10:00 to 14:00 on February 1st, the TBM stopped for maintenance. The total net boring time in this section was 331 min (5.52 h) after eliminating the stoppage period for re-gripping and other activities, with 17.93 m as the total excavation length. It should be noted that the thrust values lower than 2000 kN are eliminated because the operators regard the boring machine with thrust smaller than this value as either moving of the head or stoppage. In both cases, the machine can be considered not excavating the rocks. The average rate of penetration (RoP) is 17.93/5.52 = 3.25 m/h. In addition, the average total thrust (exceeding 2000 kN) during the net consuming time is adopted to evaluate the normal force of cutters, which is 8791.7 kN as shown in The radii of the cutters are assumed to be uniform and equal to 216 mm for 17 in. (43.2 cm) cutters, neglecting the differences in the detailed geometry of different types of cutters and the effects of cutter wear. The cutting coefficient will be expressed as: Therefore, the rolling or tangential force on a single cutter is 214.3 × 13.51% =28.95 kN. The section between K11+582 and K11+591 was selected to explore the distribution of key blocks, at 1 During the tunnelling process, the newly excavated surfaces expose newly-formed blocks which may be unstable. In chainage K11+582, there are two rear blocks located at K11+577.3 and K11+579.4, which are 0.065 m As shown in Based on the definition of evaluation parameters, the failure ratios of cutterhead rotation and unstable area, and the failure modes are shown in For a single block, larger values of failure ratios indicate a higher probability of instability and greater danger to the excavation face or cutterhead. For excavation at a given chainage, larger values of failure ratios indicate that the cutterhead will encounter more unstable blocks and have more rotation angles that may dislodge a block. Specifically, For high High When If As shown in The proposed evaluation parameters can represent the stability of blocks in a rock mass before excavation and allow for assessment of tunnel stability at this given excavation position. However, the relative importance between safety factor, failure ratios of cutterhead rotation and unstable area are unclear. An evaluation function to represent the integrated stability issues for TBM tunnels can be developed by using the method that is proposed in this study. Considering that all the three parameters are of equal importance, the integrated function is recommended as: A larger value of It should be noted that This paper extended the traditional block theory to analyze the stability of the face in TBM tunnelling by consideration of cutter-block interaction. The extended methodology adheres to the basic concept and most of the principles of the traditional block theory; whereas, the procedure of removability analysis is improved in two aspects: (a) only joint pyramid is adopted to determine the block removability as the block pyramid is initially finite due to the configuration of the generated blocky rock system; (b) the concave regions of the block are ignored because the rigid-body motion is restricted to the intersection of the belonging points’ movement. When considering the TBM-block interaction, the block-shield interaction is ignored due to overboring, and the cutterhead-block interaction is reduced to the interaction between disc cutter and rock block according to basic assumption of block theory including the planar excavation face and neglect of the detailed geometry of the cutterhead and disc cutters. The factors of safety for three traditional kinematic modes were derived considering cutter-block interaction forces which are more closely related to block geometry, position of cutters, and cutting forces. Two new parameters, i.e. failure ratio of unstable area and failure ratio of cutterhead rotation, were proposed to represent the stability of rock blocks at the face. These parameters reflect the probability of negative impact laid by unstable blocks on the performance of cutterhead, which depends on the size of unstable blocks relative to the size of cutterhead and varies with cutterhead rotation. The proposed methodology was implemented in the BLKALB program and was used to investigate the block stability issues for a water-conveyance tunnel excavated by TBM in western part of China. The simulation results show the possibility of identifying unstable blocks and the corresponding evaluation parameters, which seem to correlate with the observed conditions in the field. Future studies will focus on integrated face stability evaluation of TBM tunnels and using the proposed method to develop guidelines for assessment of face stability based on cutterhead thrust and torque requirements.
