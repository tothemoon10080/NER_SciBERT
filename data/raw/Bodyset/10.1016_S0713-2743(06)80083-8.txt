 This experience coupled with many years in the academic world in the mineral-processing field has provided the background for this current undertaking in which key information from a host of publications has been assembled under a single cover for ready reference by all interested organizations and individuals. This new text focuses on documenting the large number and diversity of processes that have been devised for recovering minerals and metals from industrial by-products, manufacturing and post consumer wastes and outlining the technical and scientific principles underlying these processes. Each of the twelve chapters has an introduction to help put the contents of the chapter into industrial content. The evaluation of the technical and economic merits of the many processes and techniques described is left to the reader since in many cases these are sensitive to current and local conditions even when the information for specific cases is available. The text is intended to help those in industry and academia seeking improved technology in this field to see where others have gone and to build on the innovative efforts of previous investigators. Some of these processes are widely used and accepted, others have yet to leave the researchers bench. Both embody techniques and principles that may provide the basis for new and important industrial processes to greatly increase the proportion of secondary resources that are recovered and used beneficially. The technical world is indebted to Dr Rao for undertaking this monumental task.
