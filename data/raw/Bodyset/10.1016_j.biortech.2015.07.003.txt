The effects of pyrite and bornite on bioleaching of two different chalcopyrite samples by Leptospirillum ferriphilum were studied for the first time. Results showed that bioleaching behaviors of the two chalcopyrite samples were extremely different. Bornite decreased the redox potential (ORP) and maintained it at an appropriate range (380–480mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to promote chalcopyrite (A) dissolution, but caused the redox potential out of the optimum range and inhibited chalcopyrite (B) dissolution. Large amount of pyrite decreased the redox potential and maintained it at an optimum range to promote chalcopyrite (A) dissolution, while increased the redox potential and kept it at appropriate range for a longer period of time to enhance the dissolution rate of chalcopyrite (B). Chalcopyrite (B) had significantly higher values of conductivity and oxidation–reduction rate when compared with those of chalcopyrite (A). The work is potentially useful in interpreting the inconsistence of the researches of chalcopyrite hydrometallurgy.Bio-hydrometallurgy is considered as one of the most important mineral processing techniques in processing low grade ores as it is simple, low cost and eco-friendly, and it has been successfully applied to the extraction of copper from secondary sulfide minerals like chalcocite (Cu Chalcopyrite is commonly associated with some other sulfide minerals in raw ores, such as pyrite (FeS Most of the time, different strains of microorganisms may cause different dissolution efficiencies and pathways. The microorganisms can be classified into three main types according to their optimum growth temperature, mesophiles, moderately thermophilic and extremely thermophilic microorganisms ( Therefore, two different types of chalcopyrite were chosen in the present work. The effects of bornite and pyrite on bioleaching of the two different types of chalcopyrite in the presence of  A conventional three-electrode system consisting of a working electrode, two wired graphite rods as counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (3.0 The two different chalcopyrite samples were named as chalcopyrite (A) and (B), respectively. Chalcopyrite (A) and pyrite samples were obtained from the geological museum of  Iron-oxidizing bacteria have a beneficial effect on chalcopyrite dissolution, but it was not the determining factor when compared to redox potential (ORP) which was widely considered as the determining factor in both bioleaching and ferric leaching of chalcopyrite (  However, high redox potential (ORP) can rapidly cause the passivation of chalcopyrite due to the formation of passivation layer which was considered to be mainly consisted of disulfide (S   As discussed above, the bioleaching behaviors of the chosen two types of chalcopyrite were extremely different. To further investigate their differences, electrochemical measurements were carried out. The cyclic voltammograms of different chalcopyrite electrodes in acid culture medium are presented in  It can be clearly found that current density of peak (a) of chalcopyrite (B) was significantly higher than that of chalcopyrite (A), indicating that chalcopyrite (B) was more easily to be transformed to Cu To further determine the potential range where the oxidation and reduction reactions of chalcopyrite took place, potentiostatic polarization experiments were conducted for the duration of 240 The relationship between the total charge (evaluated by the integrals of current density and time) and applied potential is shown in To interpret the effects of pyrite and bornite on bioleaching of the two different types of chalcopyrite in the presence of High redox potential (ORP) of more than 480 This work was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
