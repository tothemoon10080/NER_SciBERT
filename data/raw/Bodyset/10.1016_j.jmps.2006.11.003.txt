Different measures have been suggested for quantifying the amount of fragmentation in randomly compacted crushable aggregates. A most effective and popular measure is to adopt variants of Hardin's [1985. Crushing of soil particles. J. Geotech. Eng.

However, unlike damage that is most suitable to tensioned solid-like materials, the breakage is aimed towards compressed granular matter. While damage effectively represents the opening of micro-cavities and cracks, breakage represents comminution of particles. We term the new theory continuum breakage mechanics (CBM), reflecting the analogy with CDM. A focus is given to developing fundamental concepts and postulates, and identifying the physical meaning of the various variables. In this part of the paper we limit the study to describe an ideal dissipative process that includes breakage without plasticity. Plastic strains are essential, however, in representing aspects that relate to frictional dissipation, and this is covered in Part II of this paper together with model examples.The mechanics of particle crushing, or particle breakage, is one of the most intractable problems in geosciences. The topic is of interest to many research disciplines including powder technology, minerals and mining engineering, geology, geophysics and geomechanics. Prior studies have normally been aimed towards characterising the evolution of the particle size distribution with increase in energy. Another motivation, which is of particular interest in the field of geomechanics, is to link between the crushing of particles and the mechanical response of the soil through behavioural constitutive models. Existing constitutive models are based on simple curve-fitting parameters, which are taken in isolation from unique stress–strain tests, following paths appropriate to the case in hand. The result is that geotechnical engineers often distrust the use of modern constitutive models, which presents one of the most pressing problems of soil mechanics today ( A practical way of introducing the vulnerability of a collection of particles to crush is by constructing an enriched continuum model that mesoscopically averages the micro-crushing events. An exciting example was recently proposed by Another approach to understand the collective fragmentation process of an aggregate could be given by tracking the changes in the particle size distribution. The purpose of this paper is to establish a soundly based continuum theory that incorporates the concept of breakage. The pressing problems of the lack of physical meaning of the various parameters is addressed by consistently incorporating the evolution of grain size distribution in constitutive models by developing the concept of breakage. In this paper, we employ the concept of relative breakage and use it as an internal variable in a continuum mechanics formulation of constitutive models. The concept of relative breakage, or At the micro-scale level, damage may be interpreted as the creation of additional micro-surfaces of discontinuity surfaces: breaking of atomic bonds and enlargement of micro-cavities. Despite the discontinuous nature of such processes, the damage concept represents them in an effective continuous way by employing the framework of continuum mechanics. The mechanics of this particular continuum are called continuum damage mechanics (CDM). In this area of mechanics, a set of effectiveness rules is amended by adopting thermomechanical principles, and using damage as an internal variable. The scalar damage concept was first introduced by Generally, CDM models are To quantify effectively the amount of fragmentation within the representative volume of randomly compacted crushable granular materials an initial cumulative distribution, and an arbitrary cut-off value of ‘silt’ particle size (of 0.074 According to We therefore propose to adjust the original definition of the relative breakage by Hardin to weigh from zero to one the relative proximity of the current grain size cumulative distribution from an initial cumulative distribution, and an ultimate cumulative distribution. In An alternative way to obtain For the same reasons, Hardin's ‘total breakage’ definition may be represented by The exact definition of relative breakage follows by combining Eqs. Let us define the fractional breakage The assumption of fractional independency is also equivalent to the use of a single plastic strain variable in elastoplastic models for granular media. It is quite clear that the single plastic strain variable represents in an effective manner the much richer and realistic description of the relative micro-sliding and rotation between the many contacting particles in the representative volume element. Nevertheless, the use of the simple single plastic strain measure has proven useful. By rearrangement and integration: The effectiveness of the fractional identity hypothesis is now examined via the use of the following example. In this section we explore the recent results presented by Based on Hardin's definition of breakage, Let us start by examining our modification to Hardin's breakage definition, replacing the cut-off silt grain size curve by an assumed ultimate distribution. As mentioned earlier, the exact form of distribution is unknown, but the fractal distribution should be a good starting point. For that reason, let us assume that the ultimate distribution is indeed fractal, using Eq. For the same shear strain values, the breakage values could be recalculated based on our modification to Hardin's proposition. This set of results is added in To examine the capabilities of the fractional identity working hypothesis, let us assume that the only known parameters, at this stage, are the initial and ultimate distributions. This would be the common practical situation. For a given breakage value we can deduce a theoretical cumulative distribution via Eq. Since according to Eq. The approach adopted here is to use statistical homogenisation, via statistical averages, which is a known strategy in statistical mechanics (e.g., The stress–strain behaviour of sand analysed in elementary laboratory tests (e.g., triaxial, simple shear, etc.) will not be repetitive unless the characteristic size of the individual particles is significantly small compared to the overall laboratory sample dimensions. However, the common practise in the laboratory is to restrict the tests for sands that have infinitesimally small particles compared to the sample dimensions. This condition ensures that the results will become essentially repetitive for the same sand even if it is being tested several times. This characterises the spatial ergodicity property of the material, i.e., the independency of the material behaviour from the spatial organisation of the particles ( In this case we may use statistical homogenisation, implementing the grain size distribution as a weighting average function over the microscopic variables. In general, the average For illustration, the property Most generally, the We are now able to integrate the concept of breakage within modern thermomechanical procedures and complete the basic foundations of the new theory. A convenient form to represent the two laws of thermodynamics of rate independent compacted agglomerate in isothermal conditions is stated as follows (e.g., Under the action of external loads, compacted granular materials may undergo several dissipative mechanisms at the micro-level. Those mechanisms generally include dissipation from the fracturing of the particles (here described via breakage), and from their relative frictional sliding and spin. However, when the compacted aggregate is isotropically compressed, the frictional modes are often triggered only after breakage and fracture. In other words, the particles are interlocked with no degrees of freedom allowed for rotation and slippage, at least until the breakage begins. Subsequently, the rearrangement of the fragments may be accompanied with further dissipation due to friction, in the general sense of plasticity. Therefore, in these conditions, the plasticity is only secondary to breakage. Hence, developing models that account for the breakage, without considering plastic straining, is a good starting point before proceeding to the full analysis. In this paper we limit the study to general elastic CBM models, ignoring frictional dissipation for the time being. This component is dealt with in Part II of the paper ( Our expectation is that the average stored energy within grains of a given size Rewriting Eq. The increment of the statistical average of the Helmholtz free energy is then As mentioned earlier, In a randomly compacted assembly of granular materials smaller particles have a smaller coordination number, i.e., on average they contact fewer adjacent particles. Individual small particles may even ‘float’ between the micro-voids and hence carry no forces, and not store energy. Individual larger particles, on the other hand, are almost guaranteed to contact their neighbours, owing to their higher surface area. We may safely conclude that probabilistically larger particles store more energy. A rather general expression could be given by adopting the following non-dimensional power function for any In these conditions The question is which value to assign for According to this model, for In We would now like to examine the hypothesis of energy split, as represented in Eq. The right picture in  Based on Eq. It is also useful to write the following expression: Based on Eq. Let us postulate the following yield criterion Combining Eqs. The breakage energy is initially given by Eq. A new continuum mechanics theory for the constitutive modelling of brittle granular matter has been proposed. We start by advancing the concept of breakage based on the existence of an ultimate grain size distribution. Breakage essentially measures the relative proximity of the current grain size distribution to the initial and ultimate distributions. Therefore, the breakage is confined to increase from zero to one with the increase in surface area, exactly as damage is when applied in continuum damage mechanics (CDM) models. We term the new theory continuum breakage mechanics (CBM), reflecting the analogy with CDM. However, while damage effectively represents the opening of micro-cavities and cracks in solid-like materials, breakage represents comminution of particles in discrete granular media, for which damage is simply ambiguous. The two measures of breakage and damage may therefore be seen as complementary, but dissimilar. Whereas damage is generally insensitive to compression and increases in extension, the breakage is active in compression but insensitive to extension. The incorporation of breakage in continuum models is made possible by adopting a statistical homogenisation procedure in which the grain size distribution is used as a weight function of the stored energy in the different grain fractions. By following a thermomechanical analysis, we identify the thermodynamic couple of breakage in the form of the ‘breakage energy’. We show that this property is always positive by hypothesising that larger particles store more energy than smaller particles. This hypothesis, which is tested numerically in the paper, may explain the fact that particles become smaller with time in accordance with the principle of energy minimisation. The rate at which the energy is dissipated is postulated to be linked with the rate of change of the ‘residual breakage energy’ that represents the amount of stored energy that is available for release from the system. The incremental change in residual breakage energy is related with the area confined between the current and ‘new’ current particle size distributions, associated only with those particles that undergo crushing. It is shown that this postulate provides an explanation of the so-called isotropic hardening in granular materials, in a direct physical way, without the imposition of phenomenological curve-fitting of compression curves as typically used in critical state soil mechanics. To derive predictive models, it is important to account for additional dissipative mechanisms that arise from frictional plasticity. This is discussed in part II of this paper ( The CBM Theory shows that in brittle granular materials isotropic hardening is related to grain crushing and this is similar to the conclusion obtained based on the clastic hardening approach of The author would like to thank A/Prof. David Airey from University of Sydney, Dr. Kristian Krabbenhøft from Newcastle University, and Prof. Mark Randolph from University of Western Australia, for their critical comments and encouragement.
