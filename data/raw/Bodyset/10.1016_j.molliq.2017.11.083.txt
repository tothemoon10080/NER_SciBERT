The objective of the present work is the thermodynamic study of the Cu-Na-H-SO4-Cl-HSO4-H2O system using the Pitzer model in the temperature range from 293.15 to 333.15K. Also, the water activities for aqueous solutions of copper sulfate were experimentally determined. This information and the Pitzer ion-interaction model were used to represent the solid-liquid equilibrium of the copper sulfate – sulfuric acid – seawater system.
                  A simplification of the seawater system has been carried out, where the main ions from seawater (Na+ and Cl−) have been considered in the modelling. A good agreement between the correlated and the experimental solubility data of the CuSO4 - H2SO4 - seawater system was obtained, with an absolute average deviation of 0.0157mol/kg.
                  The ion-interaction model of Pitzer has been successfully used to predict the solubilities of an electrolyte in a system as complex as natural seawater, which makes it a suitable model to be applied to mining processes using seawater.Copper sulfate pentahydrate is the most important industrial compound of copper and has many commercial uses, including as soil additives, fungicides, bulk preparations of other copper compounds, and an important component in the electronic industry In Chile, there are some mining companies that use seawater in the hydrometallurgical and flotation concentration processes Accordingly, some authors studied the applicability of the ion interaction or virial-coefficient model of Pitzer The prediction or correlation of salt solubility data in mixed solvents is an important tool to design and simulate the drowning-out crystallization process The reagents used in this work were of analytical grade.

Among the greatest contributions of the present work are that the ion-interaction model of Pitzer has been successfully used to predict the solubilities of an electrolyte in a system as complex as natural seawater, which makes it a suitable model to be applied to mining processes using seawater. Additionally, in this work new binary and ternary Pitzer parameters in a wide temperature range have been determined; these values can be used to predict solubilities of other solid-liquid systems (ternary, quaternary, quinary, etc.) where the Cu-Na-H-SO In a future work, it would be interesting to consider other ions as part of the seawater, in order to determine their influence in the modelling. This is the first work that applies Pitzer's ion interaction model to mining processes using seawater, where binary and ternary Pitzer parameters of the Cu-Na-H-SO The ion interaction model of Pitzer was successfully used to determine the solubilities of the CuSO Funding for this research was provided by
