The fractures of the femur are considered amongst the most complicated to resolve after an operation of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Currently, in the USA, there are approximately 200,000 THA implanted a year and this number is increasing constantly. This increase is justified by the continual evolution of the material and operating techniques available, which have enabled orthopaedic specialists to operate increasingly older patients (with increasingly deteriorated bone quality) and also increasingly younger patients with the possibility of giving them back the quality of life they had before trauma, a condition which puts these patients at risk of high energy traumas which are able to provoke a fracture of the periprosthetic. The surgeon's objectives must be represented by: the alignment of the fracture, early union and functional rehabilitation of the condition before injury. A pre-requisite for all this will be the certainty to be able to obtain the survival and stability of the THA implant after the treatment of the fracture. The available options for curing can be: the conservative treatment with immobilization, or the surgical treatment of osteosynthesis and/or of the prosthetic substitution. Nowadays the conservative treatment is reserved for inoperable patients or Vancouver Type A composed fractures. Regarding the surgical treatment, it is unanimously agreed that internal osteosynthesis be considered useful when there is a good bone stock and a fixed prosthesis. However being a rare complication, it is hard to obtain homogenous data in order to trace treatment guidelines for these types of fractures, especially because the number of patients presented in various case studies is not enough. The aim is therefore to verify, on the base of the case studies available, the long-term results for surgical treatment of fractures after THA.
