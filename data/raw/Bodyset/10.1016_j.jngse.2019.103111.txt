Fracture closures have direct effects on the void ratio distributions of proppant particles filled in hydraulic fractures and then influence the fluid pathways of coalbed methane (CBM) within those fractures. In this paper, a numerical simulation method was used to investigate the void ratio distributions of proppant-filled fracture under different compression amounts of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%. The results showed that the void ratio distributions had exhibited an inverted “U” shape, with a trend of decreasing first, followed by remaining constant, and then increasing from the bottom to the top of the fracture, which could be divided into three zones: bottom loose zone (BLZ), middle compaction zone (MCZ) and top loose zone (TLZ). At the same compression, the small coordination numbers in the BLZ and TLZ had accounted for a larger proportion, and the average coordination numbers and void ratios in the two zones were 0.8–0.9 and 1.3 times than those in the MCZ, respectively. In addition, the proportion of the large coordination numbers in the different layers had increased, and the layered average coordination numbers had increased linearly, which had resulted in the layered void ratios decreasing linearly with the increases in the compression amounts.Coalbed methane (CBM), which is widely distributed around the world, is an enormous resource ( Recently, major efforts have been undertaken to study the permeability, conductivity variations of proppant-filled fractures and hydraulic behavior of particles. For example, In this study, a Lagrange framework and a discrete element method were developed to investigate the void ratio distributions of proppant particles filled in a fracture at various compression amounts of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively. Also, the effects of the different compression amounts on the overall and layered void ratio distributions of the proppant particles in a proppant-filled fracture were extracted, which were analyzed using the coordination number.  Then, the normal contact force ( In which The tangential contact force ( The slip speed ( In which Therefore, when Then, the line speed ( Then, the angular velocity ( It was then determined that the joint force ( The combined moment ( In which Therefore, at It was determined that at In the present study, the proppant particles were spherical particles. The quartz sand proppant particles with a typical and common diameter (D) range of 0.425–0.850 mm were selected for the simulation process ( The model illustrated in           The void ratios of the proppant particles had first decreased, then remained constant, finally increased from the bottom to the top of the proppant-filled fracture. Also, the void ratio distribution of the proppant particles in the fracture had exhibited an inverted “U” shape. The proppant particles within the fracture could be divided into three zones: BLZ, MCZ and TLZ. At the same compression, the small coordination numbers in the BLZ and TLZ had accounted for a larger proportion, and the average coordination numbers and void ratios in the two zones were 0.8–0.9 and 1.3 times than those in the MCZ, respectively. As the compression amounts increased, the number of newly established connections for the proppant particles was found to be much larger than the number of lost connections. Also, the proportion of the large coordination numbers in the different layers increased, and the layered average coordination numbers increased linearly, which resulted in the layered void ratios decreasing linearly.
