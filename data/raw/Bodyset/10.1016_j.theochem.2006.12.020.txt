Structural and electronic properties of endohedral Po@C60 are studied with density functional theory method. The results show that the triplet structure with Po occupies the center of the fullerene cage is the ground state of this endohedral fullerene. And Po approximately keeps its atomic electronic configuration. Po@C60 could be candidates as metallofullerene radiotracers and radiopharmaceuticals in the field of nuclear medicine.Endohedral metallofullerenes which have atoms inside the C In this letter, all-electron relativistic density functional theory is presented for the optimized structures of Po@C The computational procedures start from five different positions for Po inside C Two spin states: Mulliken population analysis gives a charge of −0.076 on the encaged Po, suggestive of almost no hybridization between the central atom and the fullerene cage. The spin density on the Po atom is 1.975; therefore two α electrons spin on the Po atom. As shown in The Kohn–Sham electronic levels of the most stable Po@C To better understanding the electronic structure of this endohedral fullerene, we plot the total DOS of Po@C In conclusion, all-electron relativistic density functional theory calculations show that the ground state of Po@C We thank the Key Laboratory of Automobile Materials (Jiling University), Ministry of Education for the software.
