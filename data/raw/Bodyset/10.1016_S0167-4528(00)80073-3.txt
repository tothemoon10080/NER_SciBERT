Some concentrators in China have adopted the use of ammonium sulfate and ammonium hydrocarbonate for activation of iron sulfides that were previously depressed by lime. This action of ammonium salts has recently been undertaken as a research topic, and the results of flotation and XPS investigations are reported in this paper, with some details. Ammonium sulfate, ammonium hydrocarbonate and ammonium chloride can all restore the floatability of pyrite, without the need to use copper sulfate or sulfuric acid. These salts lower pulp pH to a value below 9.0, and wash off calcium and ferric hydroxide layers on the surface of the pyrite. It is also proposed that activation involves the catalytic promotion of xanthate oxidation to dixanthogen by the ammonium ions. The activation mechanism has three main aspects: desorption of the calcium species, precipitation in solution, and activation. As a result, the recovery of pyrite increases substantially, e.g., from less than 10% to more than 85%.
