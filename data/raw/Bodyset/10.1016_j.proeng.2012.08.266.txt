Porosity where most complicated physicochemical changes in is not only related to coal metamorphic degree but also to the maceral. Relationships of coal maceral and porosity are the main content of this paper. By pressured-mercury testing and polarizing microscope analysis, it is found that vitrinite has higher content of transition pore and inertinite is rich of macroporous, meanwhile the specific pore volume of mesopore and microporous is related to both vitrinite and inertinite. Also, there is a creative found that the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation could be used to estimate the relationship of the coal maceral and porosity.
