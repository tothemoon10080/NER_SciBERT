The influence of mineralogy on the milling performance and the flotation-based recovery of Au, the platinum group elements (PGE), Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and S was investigated for three samples of the Merensky Reef (BK, RPM and WP facies types) and one sample of the UG2 at the Marikana mine, using a mineral liberation analyser (MLA). The samples differ in their milling behaviour in that a range of milling times are required in order to produce a grind of 60% passing 75μm. This is primarily controlled by the abundance of plagioclase, orthopyroxene and chromite.
                  The size distribution of the base metal sulfides (BMS; pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite) is similar for the three samples of Merensky Reef, and is significantly coarser than for BMS in the sample of the UG2. Upon milling to 60% passing 75μm, the best BMS liberation is achieved for the BK facies type of Merensky Reef, relative to RPM and WP. The degree of BMS liberation in the sample of UG2 is lower than that for samples of the Merensky Reef.
                  Cumulative mass pull during flotation is higher for the sample of the WP facies of Merensky Reef than for the rest of the samples examined. This is due to the higher abundance of orthopyroxene in this sample, which is known to be naturally floating, and which reports to concentrate.
                  A high flotation-based recovery of PGE, Cu and S is observed for all four samples, with the highest recovery associated with the sample of the BK facies type of Merensky Reef. Ni recoveries are generally poor, suggesting that Ni is associated with gangue minerals, in addition to that in pentlandite.
                  Of the three facies types of Merensky Reef examined, the overall characteristics of the BK facies type i.e. a high PGE grade, low abundance of orthopyroxene, a high abundance of BMS, and a higher degree of liberation of the BMS on milling of the ore, represent the most favourable set of characteristics for the efficient recovery of PGE. It is therefore the best quality ore of the three samples of Merensky Reef examined.The Bushveld Complex in South Africa is the world’s largest reserve of the PGE ( Variations in recovery are to a large extent caused by mineralogical changes in the ore ( Recent advances in automated mineralogy ( The Lonmin Platinum Marikana operation is located in the Rustenburg mining district on the Bushveld Complex, directly east of the town of Marikana ( Five dominant facies types of Merensky Reef are recognised, including the Brakspruit (BK), Rustenburg Platinum Mine (RPM) and Western Platinum (WP) facies types, the subject of the present study. Of these, WP comprise about 40 The BK facies type is about 1.5 The RPM facies type of Merensky Reef is typically about 2 The WP facies type is about 2 As is typical for the Merensky Reef in general ( The UG2 chromitite layer vary in thickness between 0.8 and 1.5 Four channel samples were collected from the underground operation at the Marikana mine in order to obtain sufficient material for milling and flotation tests. Three samples were collected in the Merensky Reef being the BK facies type (sample location 15-MW-6E1-RSE, as per the mine survey grid), the RPM facies type (sample location 15-MW-22-RSE), the WP facies type (sample location K3#13-ME-69-RSE) and one in the UG2 (sample location 4B UG2), with the entire reef interval sampled from the contact with the hanging wall to the contact with the footwall. The channel samples were located in exposures of reef facies types, that, based on visual observation (routine underground geological mapping) and assay data (conducted for grade control purposes), are considered as typical (i.e. representative) of the bigger ore deposit. Each channel sample comprised of ∼25 individual sub-samples for a typical total weight of ∼8 Milling was conducted on a 1 A 20 For the mill tests samples were milled for 10 Laboratory scale flotation testing was conducted on a Denver laboratory flotation test machine, using a 2.5 All flotation was conducted in duplicate, and the feed, concentrate, and flotation tailings combined, per sample.The concentrations of Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru and S in the flotation feed and tailings were determined using a commercial laboratory service provider ( In order to exclude fine material recovered through entrainment during flotation ( Representative splits of each coarsely crushed (-2 Each of the samples collected of the swirling pulp in the flotation cell prior to flotation was split into representative aliquots using a rotary micro riffler. One of these, per sample, was sieved to −75 The samples of Merensky Reef are dominated by plagioclase (anorthite variant) and orthopyroxene (enstatite variant), with an anti-correlation of the abundance of these two minerals observed ( Rock texture and mineral grain size is as per the details given in Section The PGE content of the samples are dominated by Pt (938–2189 The four samples selected for study differ in their milling behaviour in that a range of milling times are required in order to produce a grind of 60% passing 75 Upon milling to 60% passing 75 Cumulative mass pull during flotation is higher for the sample of the WP facies of Merensky Reef than for the rest of the samples examined ( MLA examination of the mineralogy of the concentrates produced in the present study show that orthopyroxene is the most abundant of all minerals reporting to concentrate, with highest orthopyroxene abundance in the concentrates produced from the sample of the WP facies type (75 The flotation-based recovery (‘recovery efficiency’) of PGE ( Au recoveries are lower than for the PGE, at approximately 80%, and with only 63% of gold recovered from the UG2 ( Ni recoveries are generally poor, ranging from ∼12% for UG2 to 88% for BK ( The recovery of S is 100% for all samples ( Cr mainly reports to the tailings, with only 3–9% of total Cr encountered in the concentrate ( The milling behaviour of the samples collected from the Merensky Reef ( Based on the above, the sample of UG2 with 25 The result reported here, for the milling of the Merensky Reef, contrasts with that of In the case of the sample of UG2 the rock texture is completely different to that of the Merensky Reef, consisting of fine grains ∼2 The high mass pull during flotation of the sample of the WP facies type of Merensky Reef ( It could be argued that the higher liberation of the BMS in the milled sample of the BK facies of Merensky Reef relative to the other samples of the Merensky Reef examined in this study, may be a result of the longer milling required to reduce this sample to a grind of 60% passing 75 Due to the markedly smaller grain size of BMS in the sample of UG2 (relative to the samples of Merensky Reef; The comparatively low rate of Cu recovery in concentrates 1 and 2 of the sample of the BK facies of Merensky Reef ( The lower recovery of Au relative to the PGE ( The S content of the flotation feed ( The positive correlation of recovery efficiency of Ni with the abundance of BMS in the samples examined ( The observed reporting of both Cr and Co to the tailings ( The following conclusions are considered noteworthy: The amount of plagioclase and orthopyroxene in ores of the Merensky Reef in the present study has a direct influence on the amount of energy required to produce a grind of 60% passing 75 The amount of orthopyroxene in ores of the Merensky Reef has a direct influence on mass pull, as orthopyroxene is naturally floating in character ( Of the three facies types of Merensky Reef examined, the overall characteristics of the BK facies type i.e. a high PGE grade, low abundance of orthopyroxene, a high abundance of BMS, and a higher degree of liberation of the BMS on milling of the ore, represent the most favourable set of characteristics for the efficient recovery of PGE ( The finer grain size of BMS in the UG2 relative to the Merensky Reef requires a finer grind in order to achieve maximum recovery of the PGE ( We thank Lonmin PLC for generous donation of samples, Dennis Hoffmann and Riana Smit for much assistance with sample collection, and Mapilane Madiba and Derek Rose for help with sample flotation.
