In this study, a PbAg alloy anode was prepared by a “powder rolling method”, and its possible use as an alternative insoluble anode for an electrowinning application was investigated. The Pb-0.71wt.% Ag cast-rolled alloy, which is currently an insoluble anode for zinc electrowinning, caused remarkable creep deformation under the stress of 15.0MPa in a 150gL−1 H2SO4 solution at 303K, and fractured at about 100ks. The Norton plot data allowed the determination that the creep of the Pb-0.71wt.% Ag cast-rolled alloy proceeded by a “dislocation mechanism”. On the other hand, a Pb-0.71wt.% Ag powder-rolled alloy did not deform at all even at a current density of 10mAcm−2, which confirmed the fact that the Pb-0.71wt.% Ag powder-rolled alloy was an outstanding creep-resistant material in a highly concentrated H2SO4 solution. For galvanostatic electrolysis, it was shown that the oxygen evolution overpotential and the energy efficiency of the Pb-0.71wt.% Ag powder-rolled alloy were nearly equal to those of the present Pb-0.71wt.% Ag cast-rolled alloy. Moreover, the amount of Pb impurities in the deposited Zn on the Al cathode was a low value, i.e., only 57% of the Pb-0.71wt.% Ag cast-rolled alloy. Therefore, the Pb-0.71wt.% Ag powder-rolled alloy may be considered an alternative Pb-based insoluble anode with both an excellent durability and a good energy efficiency for electrolysis.The Pb On the other hand, the Pb In this study, an alternative Pb As the measurement samples, i) pure Pb and ii) Pb-0.71 The Pb-0.71 The creep resistance of the Pb-based alloy was evaluated by the electrochemical creep test system shown in The anodic polarization measurement was done to evaluate the oxygen evolution overpotential of the various Pb-based anodes.
