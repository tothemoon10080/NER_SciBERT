In this work, novel heterostructure Bi/Bi2SiO5 composites with micro-flowers are successfully synthesized via one-step hydrothermal strategy, and applied as photocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO under simulated sunlight irradiation. The XRD, XPS, SEM, HRTEM, UV–vis DRS and EIS characterizations are performed to clarify the crystalline phase, surface compositional chemical states, structural morphologies, optical and photoelectrochemical properties. 2 M NaOH solution as pH regulating agent plays a vital role in the formation of Bi-decorated Bi2SiO5 composites, and as-prepared Bi/Bi2SiO5 sample in the pH value of 12 exhibits super-high photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity to CO. Besides, a possible enhanced mechanism of CO2 reduction to CO over Bi/Bi2SiO5 composite is proposed. Finally, our findings should provide good foundation and scientific guidance for the research and development of Bi-modified Bi-based materials.Bi-based materials have attracted widespread attentions owing to the low toxicity, abundant and good stability [ Therefore, it is rather interesting for achieving enough utilization of SPR effects for Bi metal in the synthesis of Bi/Bi All the reagents used were purchased without further treatment (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd.). In a typical synthesis, 3 mmol of Bi(NO X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterization of samples were obtained using X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (Model D/max 2700, Rigaku Co., Japan). Structural morphologies were performed on the filed-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL model JEM-6490, Japan) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The chemical composition surface states were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250 xi, England) using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). Binding energies were calculated and measured with respect to C (1s) at 284.8 eV and a precision of ±0.05 eV. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of samples were obtained by using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu, Japan) with 100% BaSO The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the CO  Surface chemical composites and states of samples are investigated by XPS spectra ( The structures and morphologies of BSO-11 and BSO-12 are provided in In terms of our experimental phenomena and characterization data, the formation mechanism of Bi/Bi The photocatalytic activity is evaluated for CO Novel Bi/Bi  This work is supported by the
