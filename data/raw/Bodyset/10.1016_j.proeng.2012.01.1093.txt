The overburden movement in cemented backfill mining is different from what it is in traditional longwall mining. This paper analyses the overburden movement in cemented backfill mining by using computer simulated model, observes the overburden movement in different mining advances distance, compares to traditional longwall mining and finds the characteristic of overburden movement in backfill mining. Studies show that the range of periodic weighting is relatively wide in back fill mining, and the weighting strength is also low; The key rock strata will be bending subsidence without failure situation. The displacement of overburden movement can be dramatically decreased. As a result, ground surface deformation can be well controlled.
