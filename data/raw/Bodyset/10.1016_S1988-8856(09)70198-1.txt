Introduction and purpose
                  In the last few years, there has been increased aggressiveness in the treatment of distal radius fractures by means of internal fixation. Locked plates prevent metaphyseal collapse even in the presence of osteoporotic or comminuted bone; they also maintain reduction and allow early motion. Nevertheless, there is as yet not enough evidence as to what may be the best way of treating this fracture. Our purpose is to assess our functional results and the complications that can arise from the use of distal radius locked plates.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  This is a retrospective study of 145 unstable distal radius fractures treated by means of a locked volar plate, with a mean follow-up of 28 months. AO (Association for the Study of Osteosynthesis) and Fernandezâ€™ classifications were used to assess the presence of osteoporosis, need for a graft, difference between healthy and fractured hand in terms of mobility, the radiographic measurements and the functional PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation) test and any potential complications. A statistical analysis was carried out.
               
                  Results
                  95 patients were analyzed. Mean PRWE score was 13 points. A significant relation was found between motion and functional result. A graft was used in 3 patients and there were no cases of pseudoarthrosis or metaphyseal collapses. Eight percent of patients presented with some serious complication (algodystrophy, chronic pain, malunion).
               
                  Conclusions
                  Locked plates can be regarded as an alternative to the treatment of unstable distal radius fractures. They provide good functional results and few complications, they minimize the need for grafting and they allow early mobilization even in the presence of osteoporotic and comminute bone.
