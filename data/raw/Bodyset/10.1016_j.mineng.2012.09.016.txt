The effect of Zn2+ on calcite flotation and the effect of lattice ions on calcite flotation in presence of Zn2+ were investigated through microflotation tests, zeta potential measurements, and surface analysis. The results show that Zn species inhibit the interaction between the reagents and calcite through the formation of surface precipitation coating on the calcite surface, when the concentration of Zn2+ is higher than 10−5

                     . The zeta potential measurements and surface analysis show the existence of a mixture of hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide products on mineral surface, and zinc surface coating can be desorbed due to the strong chemical adsorption of Ca2+ and the formation of hydrozincite in the bulk solution.Calcite is the common and important component of sediments and sedimentary rocks ( In the case of smithsonite, surface conversion inhibits the selective separation of smithsonite from calcite as a result of reactions of the dissolved species with mineral surface, considerably altering interfacial characteristics of minerals ( The behavior and mechanism of Zn The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Zn The calcite used for all experiments was obtained from Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Mineralogical and X-ray powder diffraction data confirmed that the calcite sample was of high 99% purity. The samples were ground and then sieved to collect the −100 Single mineral flotation tests were carried out in a mechanic agitation flotation machine at a constant rate. The mineral suspension was prepared by adding 2.0 Zeta potential measurements on calcite were carried out using a plus zeta potential meter (Brookhaven, Zetaplus, USA). Potassium chloride was used to maintain the ionic strength at 10 A Thermo Fisher Scientific K-Alpha 1063 XPS system was used for the X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy measurements (XPS). The test chamber pressure was maintained below 10 The effect of Zn It is clear from Hydrozincite is reported to be the most stable phase under atmospheric CO The goal of the following experiments is to change the flotation recovery of calcite through removing the surface coating of zinc species from the mineral surface. Sodium carbonate, known as pH regulator used in minerals processing, and calcium chloride can provide a large amount of  In order to investigate whether Zn species can be desorbed from the mineral surface by Ca With a high concentration of Ca To help interpret these flotation results, In presence of 1 To further confirm surface property of calcite, XPS analysis of calcite samples was conducted at pH 10.0 using Na Analysis of the binding energy (BE) and kinetic energy (KE) of the zinc XPS signals gives information about the state of the zinc on the mineral surface ( The position of the Ca and Zn XPS peak remain unchanged with increasing Zn and Ca surface concentrations. The Ca2p3/2 peak is located at around 346.8 From the above results and discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn: In the alkaline range, Zn ions can interfere the interactions between the reagents and calcite through the formation of insoluble surface precipitates, when the concentration of Zn The Zeta potential measurements and surface analysis show the presence of a mixture of hydrozincite and zinc hydroxide products on calcite surface, which mainly link to carbonate site instead of exchanging with calcium on the mineral surface. The zinc surface coating can be desorbed from calcite surface due to the strong chemical adsorption of Ca The authors acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51174229) and Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation for Postgraduate (Nos.
