The determination of the mineral content of the bone and its distribution by Computed Tomography (CT-Scan), allows defining insertion points for prosthetic device, diagnosis, or to determine the level of healing in case of fractures or interventions. The use of subject-specific models allows to shows graphically and quantitatively, the state of the bone with respect to the spatial structure and mineral content in a tridimensional map. Minimization of radiation dose is mandatory as this method is proposed as a regular tool for clinicians. Subject-specific models over porcine jaws were developed to construct the maps based on computational tools of: segmentation, transcription of densitometric database and, generation and verification via finite element analysis. The material used for this study was six frozen porcine heads, between 10 and 12 months old, completely covered by soft tissue and calibration phantoms of K The tridimensional maps showed the highest mineral value in the molar cusp and symphisis. The sum of the section's weight is equal to that of the complete model, according to its mineral distribution. The radiation dose was minimized eight times from the maximum recommended for this exam. The tridimensional maps obtained at low radiation dose, show numerically and graphically, the spatial distribution of the density field independently of the bone sample's size or acquisition parameters. These maps could facilitate the location of insertion points or determine the evolution of the mineralization level of the patient's tissue.
