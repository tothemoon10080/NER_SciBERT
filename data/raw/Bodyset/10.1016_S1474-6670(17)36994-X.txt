The X-ray fluorescence analyzers are widely used for on-line analysis of minerals. Even though the X-ray spectral intensities are proportional to the atom contents in the material, differing process conditions, slurry densities, and particle size distributions affect the measurement results, and analyzers need to be calibrated against laboratory assays. The models mapping the spectral channel intensities to concentrations of basic elements are normally based on the standard least-squares regression analysis. However, there exist various problems when the basic regression models are used; the reasons for these problems are both theoretical (due to colinearity) and practical (time-varying nature of the process). To attack the problems, more sophisticated model structures can be introduced. First, the clustered nature of the long-term observations can be taken into account when a kind of model library is utilized; the integrity of the clustered set of models can be maintained utilizing self-organization. Second, the colinearity problem is avoided when latent variables are introduced and the prediction model is constructed using the measurements only after they are projected onto this hidden internal basis. Third, the special statistical structure of the measurements can be taken into account when the latent variables are independent components extracted from the data. From the mathematical point of view, the above ideas can be implemented in the framework of sparse coded linear structures.
