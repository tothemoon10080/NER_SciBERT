Comminuted fractures of the mandible are unusual but not rare. They are complex injuries with a high complication rate. Gunshot wounds are a frequent cause. Traditional management with closed techniques is noted for good long-term results, but may involve an extended period of treatment. Treatment with open reduction and rigid internal fixation significantly shortens the course of treatment and simplifies the convalescence.
