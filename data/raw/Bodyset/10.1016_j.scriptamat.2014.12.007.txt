Accumulative press bonding (APB) is proposed as a novel method for inducing severe plastic deformation. This process can produce a homogeneous and ultrafine-grained nanocomposite, which is extremely difficult to obtain by other processes. AA1050/SiCp nanocomposite with an average grain size of 280nm and well-developed high-angle grain boundaries (39° average misorientation angle and 82% high-angle boundaries) exhibited the highest tensile strength reported in the literature, i.e. 284MPa. Theoretical models revealed that the contributions of Orowan and grain refinement strengthening mechanisms to yield strength were 76.6% and 14.8%, respectively. The materials used in this study were aluminum of commercial purity ⩾99.5% (AA1050) with dimensions of 100  EBSD/orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) maps of the initial material and AA1050 pure aluminum processed by APB after different cycles are shown in   (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) The modeling methods commonly used to predict the strength of MMNCs includes the simple arithmetic summation method, the quadratic summation method originally described by Clyne, and the compounding method In summary, a new SPD technique, APB, was proposed in order to manufacture UFG metals and MMNCs.
