A reaction model was developed to predict kinetic parameters and competition of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions during carbonation in mild conditions, i.e. ambient temperature and up to 3atm for the CO2 partial pressure. The experimental carbonation results at different temperatures, Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios, and atmospheric pressure were used to validate and predict the kinetic parameters of individual reactions in the aqueous phase by applying genetic algorithm and reactor modeling. This model showed a good agreement with experimental results, and satisfactorily predicted the competition between Mg2+ and Ca2+ and the formation of magnesian calcite (MgNCa(1âˆ’N)CO3). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the validated kinetic model to maximize the precipitation rates of Mg2+ and Ca2+. It was found that the final yield for magnesian calcite is the highest for the Mg2+/Ca2+ molar ratio of 1, referring to an equal concentration of two cations in the leachate. This suggests the strongest synergy between both cations for their co-precipitation. The optimum ammonia amount used as a pH-swing agent was found to be equal to the amount of ammonia released from the leaching stage in a closed loop leaching-carbonation. This amount of ammonia led to ~100% Mg2+ and Ca2+ precipitation along with the highest magnesian calcite precipitation yield.Various researchers have investigated the mineral carbonation of CO In addition to the natural minerals, the industrial wastes rich in calcium and magnesium have been examined for mineral carbonation, including lignite fly ashes and slags ( This study aims to establish a kinetic model for the Mg - Ca - CO The carbonation experiments have been performed through the use of 50 For each carbonation experiment, the pre-determined amount of MgCl A simplified flowchart for the modeling procedure is presented in In order to clarify the kinetics of the dissolution of CO In the Mg In addition, we assumed that such a system consist of a number of reversible chemical reactions Deprotonation of the pH-swing reagent is initiated according to Eq. These reactions will exert a remarkable impact on the pH of the solution, which in turn determine the concentration of CO Calcium carbonate consists of different polymorphs including three anhydrous crystalline phases (calcite, aragonite and vaterite), two hydrated phases (monohydrate and hexahydrate), and amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). Calcite and aragonite are the most naturally occurring polymorphous of calcium carbonate, whereas ACC is the least stable and often transforms to a crystalline phase ( To account for the interaction and co-precipitation of Mg Kinetic modeling of such a complicated process with many reaction steps led to a set of non-linear kinetic equations. To solve such a complicated system, one of the solutions is to model the reactor and then try to find the kinetic values using an optimization method ( The rate - based chemical reactions were modeled for a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) with a continuous CO The kinetics of Eqs. Eq. An optimization tool was employed to find the kinetic parameters of the reactor model by the least-square method. For objective functions with such a complex structure, traditional gradient-based algorithms are likely to fail due to getting trapped in local optima ( The primary motivation of the sensitivity analysis here is to clarify how the carbonation yields and compositions differ upon the variation of the parent fly ash composition and the subsequent change in the composition of its leachate used for carbonation. In light of this, the influence of a variety of effective parameters such as initial Mg The initial parameters were manipulated according to The first step of kinetic modeling was performed using experimental data at different temperatures and the fixed Mg The experimental data from the carbonation of different Mg In the above equations, k The validity of the kinetic model was further tested by the comparison of the precipitation percentages of the two cations calculated by the model with the respective experimental data for the two other Mg  In general, the weight percentage of magnesian calcite increased rapidly, once the reaction started, and eventually leveled off.
