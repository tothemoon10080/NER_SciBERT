The experimental determination of higher heating value (HHV) of solid fuels is a cost intensive process, as it requires special instrumentation and highly trained analyst to operate it, where as proximate analysis data can be obtained relatively easily using an ordinary muffle furnace. Therefore, to simplify the task and to reduce the cost of analysis many correlations were developed for determining HHV from proximate analysis of solid fuels. An attempt has been made in this paper to evaluate the applicability of these correlations with a special focus on Indian coals. It has been observed that the developed correlations are either complex in nature or by-pass the effect of important variables like moisture and ash contents of coals. An effort has, therefore, been made to develop a simple correlation based on proximate analysis data for predicting HHV of coal (as-received basis). The model presented here is developed using analyses of 250 coal samples and its significance lies in involvement of all the major variables affecting the HHV. The developed model appears to be better than the existing models and has the following form:

                              .In any thermal power plant determinations of calorific value, proximate analysis and ultimate analysis are common practice to assess the quality of coals. Calorific value is defined as the amount of heat evolved when a unit weight of the coal is burnt completely and the combustion products cooled to a standard temperature of 298 In India, due to non-availability of consistent power supply and higher industrial tariffs many industries are opting for coal-fired captive power plants. Quick assessment of coal quality by cheaper means to run the boilers efficiently is a pre-requisite. Accurate prediction of calorific value of coal based on proximate analysis data is, therefore, being attempted by various research groups. As a result, varieties of correlations Accordingly, in this paper the existing correlations are first reviewed and the need for developing a simpler correlation is then discussed. To test the prediction accuracy and the versatility of the existing correlations covering the entire range of the characteristics of thermal coals available in India proximate analysis and HHV values of around 250 coal samples have been determined carefully. The limitations of the existing correlations in predicting the HHV values from the proximate analysis data are then highlighted. An effort has also been made to develop a much simpler but better correlation based on the experimental data to outperform the existing correlations. Many correlations have been developed for predicting the calorific values of coal. An attempt has been made in this paper to evaluate them. Goutal Schuster Recently, some nonlinear models for the estimation of HHV of Indian coals were proposed by Patel et al. In view of the above it is imperative that there is an urgent need to develop a simple but reliable model to predict the HHV of coals of various sources from the proximate analysis data involving all the major variables. To minimize the efforts and time involved in pre-processing it is also desirable to develop this model based on data as-received basis. Coal samples were collected from coalfields of central India, which are well-known as South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL). The coal deposits of SECL occur in five districts of Chhattisgarh named as Bilaspur, Korba, Raigarh, Surguja and Korea and in three districts of Madhya Pradesh named as Shahdol, Umaria and Anuppur. Coal samples collected from these regions were ground to −212 It is well-known that ash, volatile matter, moisture and fixed carbon combinely decide the nature of coal and more precisely its HHV as a fuel. Therefore, the results obtained were carefully examined for observing the impacts of ash, moisture, volatile matter and fixed carbon on the HHV of coal. It was observed that ash and moisture have negative effects on HHV. To show the impacts of ash and moisture contents of coals on HHV, the HHV values are plotted as a function of the added value of both the variables ( Out of 250 data 164 data covering a wide range of moisture, ash and volatile matter were selected to generate the correlation and 86 data points were kept separately for the validation purposes. To maintain the conciseness of paper only 50 data covering the entire range of proximate analysis (as-received basis) are shown in Regression equations obtained in this analysis were compared on the basis of coefficient of multiple determinations (  The equation proposed has a genuine basis to accept it for the estimation of HHV of coal as it deals with all the major variables affecting HHV. To confirm the validity of the proposed equation the experimentally determined values of HHV of 86 coal samples kept separately are compared ( To further demonstrate the validity of the present correlation the experimental data of HHV’s for coals, covering the major coalfields in India, presented in a published article A simple but reliable correlation has been developed to predict the HHV of coals from the proximate analysis (as-received basis). The developed correlation involves the effects of all the major variables affecting the HHV of coals. Validation with a set of published data at reasonable accuracy establishes the general acceptability of the developed correlation.
