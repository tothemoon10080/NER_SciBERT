A kinetic study of the leaching of a low-grade niobium–tantalum ore by concentrated KOH solution under atmospheric pressure has been investigated. The effects of reaction temperature, KOH concentration, agitation speed, particle size and alkali-to-ore mass ratio on the dissolution rate of niobium were examined. It was found that the dissolution rate of niobium is significantly influenced by the temperature, particle size and concentration of KOH solution. The experimental data were well interpreted with a shrinking core model under diffusion control through the product layer. By using the Arrhenius expression, the apparent activation energy for the dissolution of niobium was evaluated. Finally, on the basis of the shrinking core model, the following rate equation was established:

                              .At present, most ores containing niobium and tantalum are decomposed by concentrated hydrofluoric acid. However, such an approach is only appropriate for high-grade niobium–tantalum ore, and special containers are required due to the remarkable corrosiveness of hydrofluoric acid (HF) ( Recently, a new process for the leaching of a low-grade niobium–tantalum ore has been proposed by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. Based on the principles of cleaner production, the new process can serve as an alternative solution for the traditional process. In the new process, low-grade niobium–tantalum ore is decomposed in fluid medium of concentrated KOH solution under atmospheric pressure, and the reaction and mass transfer are significantly enhanced. As a result, the decomposition rate of niobium–tantalum ore is greatly improved at a relatively low temperature. Concentrated KOH solution leaching of niobium from low-grade niobium–tantalum ore remains so far a developing field. Much fundamental work needs to be carried out. Although some previous studies had been performed on the atmospheric alkaline leaching or pressure alkaline leaching process for niobium–tantalum ore ( The reactions of niobium–tantalum ore with KOH solution are as follows ( At the first stage, the soluble K The niobium–tantalum ore used was supplied by the Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd, Ningxia, PR China. The main chemical composition of the ore, determined by ICP-AES, is given in The result of X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, using Phillips PW223/30) of the ore is shown in All the chemical reagents employed were of analytical grade and deionized water was used in the corresponding procedures during the experiment. The batch reactor used in this work was a 500-ml nickel stainless steel canister equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. The reactor was heated by an oil bath, whose temperature was thermostatically controlled by an electrical bar, with a precision of ± All the experiments were conducted in batches. For each run, 150 g of solid KOH was first charged into the reactor, and deionized water of the required amount was added. Then the system was heated to the required temperature under continuous stirring. When the temperature reached the pre-set value and remained stable, a certain amount of niobium–tantalum ore was added to the reactor through the thief hatch. Next, the mixture of all the reactants was intensively stirred under atmospheric pressure. At appropriate time intervals during a run, approximately a 1 g sample of the reaction mixture was taken out through the thief hatch, quenched, weighed and dissolved into 50 mL deionized water, and filtered. After that, the filtrate was diluted to 100 mL. Finally, the sample was analysed by ICP-AES to determine the content of niobium. Both unreacted and partially leached niobium–tantalum ore were examined under a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with EDAX facility. Under the condition of 150 °C, agitation rate of 1100 rpm, alkali-to-ore mass ratio of 7:1, particle size of − It can be seen that reaction kinetics is fast in the first 15 min, and slows down in the remaining period. This means that the first 15 min of leaching are of primary importance for kinetic analysis. Many leaching processes for fine particles require agitation to suspend solid particles and allow efficient mixing in the leach solution. The results of niobium leaching from low-grade niobium–tantalum ore with concentrated KOH solution at different agitation speeds are shown in An important factor to be studied is the effect of particle size, and particles of different size were prepared in a series of leaching experiments. The results are summarized in Leaching kinetics for diffusion-controlled reactions is related to the inverse square of initial particle diameter or radius, while those controlled by chemical reaction vary with the inverse of initial particle diameter or radius. It is apparent from Eq. The constant, Based on the data in With these findings in hand, more explanation can be given for the observed behaviour at different agitation speeds. According to In order to confirm the existence of the layer of solid product, SEM and EDAX studies have been carried out.  Another factor considered in this work is the mass ratio of alkali-to-ore. The results of different mass ratios of alkali-to-ore are illustrated in The kinetic data in The experimental results of the effects of different KOH concentrations are summarized in It can be seen from Temperature dependence can be used to estimate the apparent activation energy, enthalpy of activation and entropy of activation. A group of experiments were performed to investigate the temperature dependence of the reaction, which are summarized in It can be seen from The overall reaction rate constant from Eq. The reaction rate constants for different temperatures were calculated from the plots in From the experimental data above, the activation energy for niobium was calculated as 72.2 kJ mol Although the value of the activation energy is so high and seemingly the process should be of chemical reaction control (  Temperature, KOH concentration and particle size have a significant effect on the rate of dissolution of niobium from niobium–tantalum ore. The results indicated that the shrinking core model is applicable, and the reaction is controlled by transport process in the product layer. The fitted model is shown in Eq. Leaching kinetics are improved with increasing KOH concentration and temperature, while reaction rates are enhanced and final conversion is improved with decreasing initial particle size. Also, the leaching kinetics is improved by increasing the mass ratio of alkali-to-ore.
