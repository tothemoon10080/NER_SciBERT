Comminution is known to be an inefficient user of energy. This makes it the largest energy consumer in many mine sites and therefore a large component of cost. One would therefore have thought that improving comminution energy efficiency would be receiving the undivided attention of the mining industry, but this is not the case. This paper considers why this is so and what the future might hold, by posing and attempting to answer three questions:

                  The conclusions of the paper are pessimistic in the sense that forces may be gathering that will demand that the issue be addressed across the industry in the relatively near future, but optimistic in the sense that there is a clear development path. There is much that can be done with what is already known, and considerable promise exists in new developments which can be realised through sustained and focused R&D, building on new knowledge acquired in the last 20years. These are outlined in the paper. It is concluded that there is a case for a global initiative to significantly reduce comminution consumption over say the next 10years through a partnership between all parts of industry and the research community, covering short, medium and long-term innovation.Is this really an important issue for the mining industry? If so, can comminution energy be substantially reduced in a reasonable time frame? What are the drivers that will motivate change, and what should now be done? It is well known that comminution, particularly grinding, is the largest consumer of energy on most base and precious metal mine sites and a significant consumer in other commodities. Some defensible calculations suggest that it uses nearly 2% of all electrical energy generated on the planet (see Is comminution energy consumption actually important to the mining industry? If so, can we reduce it substantially in a reasonable time frame, and by how much? What are the drivers that will promote significant reductions in comminution energy intensity, and what should now be done? In the course of addressing these questions we will consider new knowledge which has accumulated in the last 20 In the preparation of this paper the author has consulted a number of experienced workers in the field from mining companies, equipment vendors, engineering companies and academia, and this paper reflects in part his interpretation of those views. A list of those consulted appears in the Acknowledgements and the author is grateful for their willing participation. However any foolish statements or mis-interpretations remain the author’s responsibility. These are two different questions. Estimating comminution energy consumption as a proportion of total mine site consumption is surprisingly difficult to do accurately, although many have tried. Lack of published data and inconsistency in how total energy consumption on mine sites is calculated or expressed are the main culprits. However there is enough information around to arrive at figures that are good enough to answer the first question with sufficient accuracy for our purpose. It is also important to remember that a significant amount of additional energy is expended indirectly in supporting comminution operations, particularly in the consumption of liners and grinding media. The question of the proportion of world energy consumed in comminution is similar to the ancient conundrum about the number of angels which can dance on the head of a pin – interesting but not very useful. However the miracles of the internet allow one to do a rough calculation, shown in A similar problem attends the estimate of the ‘true’ energy efficiency of comminution. A commonly quoted figure for the efficiency in terms of the free energy of new surface produced is 1–3% ( It is clear therefore that comminution energy costs are high and the process is inefficient, and these problems are reflected in operating cost, capital cost and possibly future regulatory constraints related to carbon emission mitigation. One would therefore expect the issue to be receiving the undivided attention of the industry, yet the evidence is that this is not so, far from it in fact. The reasons are many. The CEEC Roadmap ( Project valuation practices (e.g. NPV) do not capture the issue. Lack of support from senior management for alternative strategies. Inconsistent work structures and metrics across an organisation: the ‘silo problem’, leading to difficulty in seeing the whole picture. Current organisational practices, including KPIs, do not encourage maximising efficiency, particularly across silos. A focus on maximising throughput at almost any cost. The conservative, risk-averse nature of the industry; a reluctance to adopt new technologies (with some honourable exceptions). Lack of an open exchange of information, sometimes related to the protection of IP. A gap between project owners and engineers on one side and technology developers on the other, so technology transfer is more difficult than it should be. There is little incentive to be an early adopter. These should not be seen as criticisms of the industry. They are a natural consequence of the risky capital-intensive nature of the business, and the human condition, and some companies are indeed addressing the issue through energy audits and benchmarking. However it is interesting to note that most of the problems are cultural, not technical, and thus perhaps harder to solve. The ‘lack of senior management support’ (which is not universal) is particularly telling; senior management will generally support whatever makes more money for the company, and if comminution energy is not on their radar then there is a reason for that. Either the issue is truly unimportant relative to the many others clamouring for management attention, or the problem is not being articulated or captured in a way that merits action. In this author’s view the latter is more likely to be the case than the former. This view was reinforced by the informal canvass of opinion conducted for this paper, mentioned earlier. In the end dollars drive everything, and if comminution energy is not seen as a serious impediment to profit it will not be addressed, except incidentally. A particular problem seems to be the understandable knee-jerk reaction that it is simply too difficult to solve unilaterally; other lower-hanging fruit gets the attention. Also vertically integrated companies which include very energy-intensive processes such as smelting give more scrutiny to those processes than to comminution. Overall the impact which comminution energy has on project value is not well understood because the metrics are often too primitive. For example downstream metal recovery is absolutely dependent on the judicious expenditure of comminution energy which in turn depends on mining method (particularly blasting), but these three are not usually treated as an optimisable continuum in financial analyses. Also the additional embedded energy mentioned below (liners and grinding media) and the associated pumps and conveyors are rarely considered in the mix and the magnitude of the problem is therefore underestimated. The appreciation of comminution energy consumption as part of the project evaluation mix is growing, but it will usually only get attention where the project economics are marginal and savings are being sought, or where power is in short supply. The mining companies are in the driving seat for change as the clients of the engineering companies and equipment suppliers. In the end the service providers will do what the client wants. However things may be changing. Potential drivers for change are considered further below. The science of comminution, and its associated phenomenon of mineral liberation (the main purpose of comminution in mineral processing), has advanced considerably in recent years. Some of the things we know now as R&D outcomes that we did not know 20 Blasting usually pre-weakens rock for grinding, probably due to increases in micro-crack intensity. Product from rock-cutting mining machines is not pre-weakened and therefore requires more grinding capacity. Optimising blast design can significantly increase grinding throughput (mine-to-mill). The consumption of liners and grinding media implies a significant degree of embedded comminution energy in terms of the energy required to manufacture these items. The computationally-intensive modelling of breakage in comminution machines using discrete element, finite element and hybrid algorithms has given us many insights into mechanisms. One of them is that the dominant breakage events in tumbling mills are low energy, not high energy. Accumulated damage from repeated impact is a significant factor in comminution efficiency. Fracture paths in breakage events are controlled more by rock texture, i.e. the relative abundance of mineral grains of high and low stiffness (Young’s modulus), than by the comminution method. Some mineral liberation is non-random. Efficient classification is key to efficient comminution. The 3-product cyclone has been invented and modelled. Comminution processes are inextricably bound up, chemically and physically, with subsequent separation processes, and the two need to be considered together. The population balance approach to comminution modelling has been made more rigorous by the inclusion of parameters that have physical meaning, e.g. feed size, number of impacts, etc. The high pressure grinding rolls has been shown to have energy and other advantages in specific applications. Stirred mills have been developed and applied for very fine grinding. Novel flowsheets have been potentially shown to reduce comminution energy consumption in specific applications. Sorting machines have emerged as a potentially viable pre-concentration option. Small-scale electrical comminution has been developed, which may offer process advantages. Other novel comminution approaches tried have included microwave irradiation, dry air milling, and centrifugal mills of various kinds. Taken together these developments comprise a significant advance in the capacity of the industry to improve comminution energy efficiency, but little of this advance has yet been realised. Some of the developments remain immature and need further research. However there are several strategies that can be pursued now to reduce comminution energy consumption in specific cases and many of these have been well researched in principle if not in practice. 1. Better classification is often an important part of the solution (e.g. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. In considering the quantum of improvement which is possible by application of some or all of these strategies, the analogy with the length of a piece of string comes to mind. However there is a strong consensus in the literature and anecdotally amongst the experts that savings in the range 5–30% are attainable now by implementing what is already known, i.e. by adopting and sustaining best practice. This is not easy in an industry that has decimated its experience base in recent years but can and is being done. In the longer term (10–20 The ‘Six Cs’ are going to be the main drivers of any change: Cost, Competition, Compliance, Community, Culture and Crisis.       The CEEC Roadmap ( The short-term action is considered under four main headings: Measure performance; benchmarking and baseline studies, more meaningful measures of energy usage that are integrated with the whole value chain. Adopt best practice in technology; doing well what is known now. Implement appropriate business drivers and KPIs. Communicate the benefits, motivate, train. Baseline studies, benchmarking and the development of more appropriate KPIs are important precursors to more detailed planning for change, and several companies have undertaken such studies or are doing so. Rob McIvor has recently established a working group within the Global Mining Standards and Guideline Group (GMSG) to work on a standard for industrial comminution efficiency ( The industry enjoys a well-developed, international and effective research community devoted to the issue of comminution in general and its energy efficiency in particular. Industry can take much of the credit for supporting and directing this effort over many years. However the effort needs to be maintained, and even increased, in order to make progress both in incremental improvement and in quantum change. The industry must continue to play a role in engaging with and supporting R&D and in facilitating the resulting innovation, not easy or cheap tasks. Incremental step change is more likely to achieve significant progress ( There is in this author’s view a case for a global initiative to significantly reduce comminution consumption over say the next 10 The CEEC Roadmap is a good place to start. CEEC’s mission is to facilitate an informed debate about the issue of energy-efficient comminution ( An important aspect which is often overlooked is the need for training. Mining operations now run lean and mean compared to the halcyon days when young engineers were mentored by 20-year site veterans. The inevitable consequence is that the principles of good practice are less appreciated than they were and this has a direct impact on operating efficiencies. Professional development training is one way in which this deficiency can be addressed ( Finally if the reader wants a primer on how to think more effectively about the role of comminution in mineral processing, and how to use to-day’s powerful analytical tools to do a better job of being a mineral engineer, then they need look no further than Joe Pease’s entertaining but penetrating reminder of why the fundamentals drive everything: ‘The Elephant in the Mill’ ( The literal answer to the question posed by the title of this contribution is yes, progress in energy-efficient comminution is doomed, if by ‘energy-efficient comminution’ we mean trying to beat the physics. There are fundamental limits to what can be achieved by mechanical breakage of rock. However the picture is rosier than is apparent from this pessimistic analysis. For a start we can probably get closer to the limits by exploiting the physics better. But there are many other options for progress in both the short and long term. We can chart a path forward by considering the answers to the subsidiary questions posed at the beginning of this paper: Yes, comminution energy is important to the mining industry and is likely to become more so. Its contribution to shareholder value is not yet captured in a form that encourages significant reductions in the short term, except in specific cases, but cost pressures and potentially game-changing regulatory and market interventions will in due course demand improvements in what is accepted as a very energy-inefficient process. Yes, much can be done now to reduce comminution energy consumption by up to 30%. Reductions of over 50% will be possible in the next 10–20 The drivers for change will be (as usual) mainly economic, but may also include a significant component of community expectation as the world management of energy sources evolves. A coordinated industry-wide attack on the problem including site-based initiatives, changes in the philosophy of process design, and continued support of focused R&D would certainly be capable of achieving the elusive paradigm change, if the will was there to do so.
