Based on the novel technology of Co-recovery of manganese from low-grade pyrolusite and vanadium from stone coal using fluidized roasting coupling technology, the leaching effect of manganese and vanadium has been investigated and many technical conditions have also been optimized. The results indicated that the optimum leaching efficiency of 99.25% for manganese and 91.84% for vanadium could be attained under the conditions that the mass ratio of stone coal to pyrolusite was 3:1, the roasting temperature of stone coal was 1000°C, the roasting temperature of pyrolusite was 800°C, the roasting time was 2h, the sulphuric acid concentration was 2mol/L, the leaching temperature was 75°C, and the leaching time was 2h.Manganese is one of the significant strategic resources that plays important roles in many fields, such as ferrous metallurgy, nonferrous metal production, battery production, and fine chemicals ( Stone coal, mainly consisting of silicate minerals, contains a small amount of carbon component. Vanadium resources in China primarily exist in stone coal and its V In this paper, a novel technology, that is to couple the oxidizing roasting process of stone coal with the reducing roasting process of low-grade pyrolusite, was presented. In order to make full use of the carbon component in stone coal, it was used as the reductant in low-grade pyrolusite processing. This eco-friendly coupling mine processing technology can not only maximize the utilization of stone coal and benefit the following step of the vanadium extraction, but also decrease the emission of harmful gases such as CO and SO The sample of stone coal was obtained from Guangxi, China. The ore sample was crushed and ground into powder with the particle size smaller than 0.074 The sample of low-grade pyrolusite was obtained from Yunnan, China. The ore sample was crushed and ground into powder with the particle size smaller than 0.147  After crushing, rod milling, screening, and drying, 10 Fluidized gas flow rate required for suspending ore powder in roasting was determined by cold gas flow experiment according to the flow characteristic curve of the pressure drop of feed layer. After an ore sample was added into a fluidized bed, a certain height of the feed layer was formed above the grid plate. When gas passed through the feed layer from the bottom, four different phases of the fluidized conditions could be observed with the change of the gas flow rate, which were the static bed, the initial bed, the fluidized bed, and the conveying bed ( When the gas flow rate gradually increased from the beginning, the feed layer remained the condition of the static bed. The pressure drop of the feed layer increased with the increase of the flow rate. When the flow rate increased to a certain value, the pressure drop of the feed layer was exactly equal to the weight of the feed layer per unit area, and the whole feed layer could be held up. If the flow rate was kept on increasing, the condition of the bed would be changed from static to bubbling, and the feed layer started to be fluidized. At this moment, the pressure drop of the feed layer was almost constant with the increase of the flow rate within limits of a certain flow rate. With the further increase of the gas flow, the particles of the feed layer were fluidized from fine to coarse successively till the coarse particles at the bottom were all fluidized. The pressure drop was maximized. At this point, the corresponding gas flow rate of the intersection point of two pressure drop extension line (the static bed and the fluidized bed) was the critical fluidized gas flow rate ( In order to evaluate the effect of the mass ratio of stone coal to pyrolusite, a series of experiments was carried out by varying the mass ratio from 0.5:1 to 4:1, while fixing the roasting temperature of stone coal at 1000 The fluidized roasting coupling experiments at different roasting temperatures of stone coal from 700 The effect of the roasting temperature of pyrolusite on the leaching efficiency of manganese and vanadium from 650 The effect of roasting time on the leaching efficiency of manganese and vanadium is shown in The effect of sulphuric acid concentration on the leaching efficiency of manganese and vanadium is shown in The effect of leaching temperature on the leaching efficiency of manganese and vanadium is shown in The effect of leaching time on the leaching efficiency of manganese and vanadium is shown in  The novel technology of Co-recovery of manganese from low-grade pyrolusite and vanadium from stone coal using fluidized roasting coupling technology for the manganese and vanadium exploitation and utilization is green and eco-friendly, because it can not only maximize the utilization of stone coal and benefit the following step of the vanadium extraction, but also decrease the emission of harmful gases such as CO and SO The optimum leaching efficiency of 99.25% for manganese and 91.84% for vanadium could be attained under the conditions that the mass ratio of stone coal to pyrolusite was 3:1, the roasting temperature of stone coal was 1000 This work was financially supported by the
