The objective of this paper is to display the results of the flotation and adsorption behaviors of benzohydroxamic acid (BHA), potassium amyl xanthate (KAX), dodecylamine- hydrochloride (DDA), mixed BHA/DDA and KAX/DDA on smithsonite. The flotation results show a collecting ability sequence of BHA>KAX>DDA on smithsonite and the best flotation performance at mixing ratio of 1:4mol fraction DDA/KAX for mixed collector on smithsonite. The enhancement of smithsonite recovery by co-adsorption of KAX and DDA, while no promotion effect as to mixed BHA/DDA catanionic system, are attributed to the difference in steric effect of absorbed head group. According to the results of zeta potential and contact angle (CA) measurements, a most negative charged and the highest hydrophobic smithsonite surface are attained using KAX with DDA as co-collector, which shows a good agreement with the flotation results. FTIR measurements display the stabilization against oxidation and decomposition of DDA on KAX and the inhibition of preferential adsorbed BHA ions on DDA adsorption. The interaction energies of single and mixed collectors with mineral surface also shows well consistency with experimental results. The adsorption models proposed illustrate the decrease in the electrostatic head–head repulsion and the increase in lateral tail–tail hydrophobic interaction between adjacent KAX anions due to the insertion of DDA cations, while almost no DDA could access to smithsonite surface through adjacent BHA owing to steric effect.Smithsonite (ZnCO Mixed anionic and cationic (catanionic system) collectors for smithsonite was firstly investigated in DDA/KAX collectors solution As above, catanionic system is increasingly brought to the forefront as effective reagents during the flotation of various ores. Most of the relevant papers focus on the synergistic effect mechanisms of the mixed collectors on minerals′ surfaces, however, what kind of collectors combination could generating synergies was rarely taken into consideration. When a collector was combined with another, molecular structure, to a great extent, determined whether they will promote each other. It has been shown that the use of N-dodecanoyl sarcosine in combination with DDA gives a synergistic effect in flotation efficiency, in contrast, the use of sodium dodecanate in combination with DDA shows only a very small effect on the flotation efficiency, due to the different molecular structures and adsorption mechanisms of the two anionic collectors Smithsonite were bought from a Mineral Specimens Co., LLC in Beijing. The hand sorted mineral was crushed by a hammer and then grounded in a ceramic-grinder, the −0.074 KAX, purchased from Qixia TongDa Flotation Reagent Co., Ltd., China, was purified using the recrystallization process from acetone. Both BHA with a purity of 99% and analytically pure DDA were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, and then DDA solution was prepared by adding equimolar dodecylamine into hydrochloric acid solution. Analytical grade sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid were used for pH control. KCl of analytical purity was employed as background electrolyte solution. The water used in all these tests is deionized water with a resistivity of 18.3 Flotation tests were carried out in a micro-flotation cell with an effective volume of 40 A 2 A high purity massive mineral was singled out firstly, followed by the grinding of the desired exposed surface to obtain a flat surface using metallography specimen polishing machine PG-1A, from Shanghai Metallurgical Equipment Company Ltd. After grinding the surface was polished on a polishing cloth. The thoroughly cleaned sample was firstly conditioned in the beaker in which water and known reagents were added, to experience 10 The FTIR reflection spectra were obtained using the infrared spectrophotometer (type NEXUS 470) at room temperature in the range from 3500 to 1000 Smithsonite belongs to the R3-c space group, of which the crystal cell with lattice parameters a The interaction of the mineral surface with collectors could be relatively quantified in terms of interaction energy, calculated using Eq. The recovery of smithsonite as a function of the collector concentration at pH 8.5 is shown in With the purpose of studying the flotation performance of mixed collectors on smithsonite, the collector dosage was determined in such a way that the addition of single anionic collector would bring about a recovery of 50% for smithsonite It should be note that when appropriate DDA was used as co-collector, the collecting ability of KAX on smithsonite is far better than BHA, which is different with the case of single collector system. It is well known that zeta-potential of mineral surface has been widely used for the interpretation of variation tendency of mineral flotation behaviors when it was treated with flotation reagents The zeta potential of smithsonite is negative when there is only anionic BHA and KAX, which can be ascribed to the adsorption of BHA and KAX ions on mineral surface by electrostatic interaction and chemisorptions For purpose of investigating the wetting properties of smithsonite surface treated with catanionic system, the CAs of mineral surface were measured at a pH 8.5, the experimental results was shown in As we can easily see in In order to discuss the adsorption characteristic of DDA, KAX, BHA and their mixtures on smithsonite surfaces, FTIR measurements were conducted to obtain the change information of valence linkage and relative adsorbed amount In the spectrum of smithsonite treated with mixed KAX/DDA collectors, the characteristic bands at 1049 In the case of mixed BHA/DDA catanionic system, the adsorption peaks at 1479 The interaction energies of single DDA, KAX, BHA, mixed BHA/DDA and KAX/DDA molecules with smithsonite (101) surfaces are compared in The sum of the interaction energies of individual DDA and KAX is −126.3 For making the distinguishing performance of mixed BHA/DDA and KAX/DDA on smithsonite clear, the size effect of collectors molecular dimension and the distance between active sites on mineral surface was taken into consideration. It was thought that the ions of KAX and BHA would preferential adsorption Based on the above data, in order to interpret the different flotation and adsorption behaviors of mixed BHA/DDA and KAX/DDA mixtures on smithsonite, suggest adsorption models  The collecting ability of single collector examined on smithsonite is in the order of BHA The most negative charged and highest hydrophobic smithsonite surface are reached at DDA mole fraction 0.2 with mixed KAX/DDA, which demonstrates well the promotion effect of DDA on the adsorption of KAX and shows a good agreement with the flotation results. The stabilization against oxidation and decomposition of DDA on KAX and the inhibition of preferential adsorbed BHA ions on DDA adsorption are found through FTIR measurements. The inserted DDA cations between adjacent absorbed KAX causes the decrease in the electrostatic head–head repulsion between KAX ions and the increase in lateral tail–tail hydrophobic interaction between KAX hydrocarbon chains.
