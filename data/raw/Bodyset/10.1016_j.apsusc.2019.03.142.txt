Due to Van der Waals or electrostatic interactions of surfactants active to all kinds of minerals, in low-rank coal (LRC) flotation, surfactants could both adsorb on the organic and mineral matter of LRC, thus increasing the hydrophobicity of them and resulting in the increase of clean coal yield as well as the ash content. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were clarified the adsorption mechanism of surfactant (C12EO, lauryl polyoxyethylene ether) on the LRC model molecules and kaolinite surfaces (the representative of organic and mineral matter in LRC). The DFT results demonstrate that the interaction strength between C12EO and LRC model molecules is stronger than that of kaolinite. Based on the calculation results, ultrasonic treatment was selected to expand the wettability difference between organic and mineral matter that adsorbed C12EO. The microcalorimetry results show that the wetting heat of organic matter that is adsorbed C12EO is unchanged basically after 30 s ultrasonic treatment. However, there is an obvious increase trend for the wetting heat of kaolinite. Flotation experiments of artificial mixed samples proved that ultrasonic treatment is useful in decreasing the extent of ash content in LRC flotation, thus improving the quality of clean coal in LRC flotation.As a major energy source, low-rank coal (LRC) constitutes about half of the global coal reserves [ However, surfactants could both adsorb on the organic and mineral matter of LRC, thus increasing the hydrophobicity of them and resulting in the increase of clean coal yield as well as the ash content, which is undesirable in LRC flotation [ During the last few years, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate the microscopic interaction behavior between chemicals with various mineral surfaces by providing chemical information about the energetics, structures and properties of atoms and molecules. Therefore, DFT calculations were carried out in this study to clarify the adsorption mechanism of surfactant (C Low-ash LRC from Manglai in China was selected for this work to represent organic matter of LRC and its proximate and ultimate analysis is given in Kaolinite is a layered clay mineral composed of the alternate layers of tetrahedral SiO To locate the optimal adsorption sites of the C DFT calculations were performed using the CASTEP program [ The interaction energy was calculated after the simulation. The associated energies can be expressed by Eq. Before adsorption experiments, all the samples were conducted 10 min ultrasonic pretreatment to eliminate the clean and dissociation effect of ultrasonic on minerals as possible. Batch adsorption experiments were performed in flasks containing 30.00 g of adsorbent and 1000 mL of the surfactant solution of 100 mg L The wetting heat of samples immersed in water was obtained using a C80 micro-calorimeter (Setaram, France), which is a new type of Calvet calorimeter and has a high accuracy in characterizing surface wettability [ The most stable adsorption configurations of H  In order to gain deeper insight to the adsorption mechanism of C   The microcalorimetry results of samples are presented in  In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to clarify the adsorption mechanism of lauryl polyoxyethylene ether (C The authors acknowledge the financial support from the
