This paper reports a 57Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic study of the kinetics of roasting process of chalcopyrite at two different temperatures and for different time intervals. Iron compounds formed at different stages of roasting have been identified and a possible scheme of transformations has been suggested to explain the observed kinetics.
