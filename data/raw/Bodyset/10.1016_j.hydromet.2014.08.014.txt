A co-precipitation process was used to recover composite powders from a NdFeB slurry. The most appropriate concentration of HCl and a v/w ratio were obtained in the leaching process. The optimum pH range for the co-precipitation process was determined by the log[Me(Nd, Fe, Co, Pr)]–pH curve simulated using a thermodynamics model. Fe2O3, Fe2O3·Nd2O3, and Pr2CoO4 phases were detected in the final composite powders after firing the co-precipitated products at 1273K for 2h. The content of the valuable metals (Nd, Pr, Co, Fe) in the obtained composite powders was greater than 99.4%, which meets the raw material requirements for preparing recycled NdFeB magnetic powders. The main advantages of the co-precipitation process are that it is efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly.Increasing attention has been focused on the recycling and recovery of rare earth (RE) elements from NdFeB waste because of the recent shortage of mineral resources and their high prices ( Considering the environmental impact and high cost, in this study, we substituted a co-precipitation method ( The simulation model for the thermodynamics of the H The surplus concentration of metals (Nd, Fe, Co, Pr) can be calculated at each pH value using MATLAB, and the log[Me(Nd, Fe, Co, Pr)]–pH curves can be plotted (  The NdFeB magnet slurry was separately leached by 4 For obtaining the optimum leaching parameters, the leaching effect was compared in different concentration of HCl (2 The major phases in the used slurry consist of the amorphous compounds, instead of the NdFeB phase ( HCl was used to leach the NdFeB magnet waste. The metal leaching efficiency was improved by increasing the concentration of HCl ( The content of the valuable elements and the other undesired elements in the composite powders obtained from the NdFeB slurry using the various pH conditions are shown in  The comparison of precipitation efficiency of metals [Nd, Pr, Co, Fe] between process with adding oxalic acid and process without adding oxalic at pH values of range 0.5–2.5 also has been analyzed as shown in In addition, the optimum precipitation efficiency of metals [Nd, Pr, Co] in the two-step process is higher than the precipitation efficiency in the one-step process shown as in Stabilized Nd–Pr–Co–Fe composite powders were prepared from the NdFeB slurry using an efficient co-precipitation route that was simulated using MATLAB. The thermodynamics model, based on the mass balance principle and the simultaneous equilibrium principle, was applied to guide the co-precipitation efficiently. The optimum HCl concentration and
