                      microbattery anodes, with various oxygen deficiencies, are deposited from a SnO2 target on to an ambient temperature substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The high reversible capacity and cycle performance characteristics of SnO

                      are described. RF power density and process gas pressure during deposition are fixed at 2.5 W/cm2 and 10 mTorr, respectively. The SnO

                      films are characterized by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Constant-current galvanostatic charge–discharge tests of half cells are also performed. The stoichiometric parameter x increases with the increase in oxygen partial pressure, but decreases when the number of Sn chips placed on the target material in an argon atmosphere are increased. It is observed that SnO

The charge–discharge performance of the tin oxide films is found to be dependent on stoichiometry. In the present work, SnO1.43 is the optimum stoichiometry, exhibiting the highest reversible capacity (498.33 μA h/cm2 μm) and the lowest irreversible capacity (301.79 μA h/cm2 μm).Microbatteries Recently, tin oxide has been proposed as a promising alternative anode material for microbatteries. It has been reported that its theoretical volumetric capacity is four times larger than that of carbon-based material, while its gravimetric capacity is twice as large Tin oxide tends to undergo a transformation from SnO Thin films of tin oxide were deposited on a soda lime substrate by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering from a SnO Qualitative analysis of the Sn/O composition of the films was conducted using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
