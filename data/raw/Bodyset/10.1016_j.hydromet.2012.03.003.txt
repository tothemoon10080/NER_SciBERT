A systematic liquid–liquid extraction of lanthanum and neodymium from aqueous nitric acid solutions using a mixture of two neutral extractants, namely trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and trialkylphosphine oxide (TRPO) in kerosene has been investigated. The different factors influencing the extraction affinity of those metals have been studied in detail. The extracted species for both metals have been found in the form of

                     , where M refers to the metal ion. The temperature had a negative effect on the extraction of the metals where the extraction process has been found to be spontaneous in nature and associated with exothermic reaction. Since yttrium is accompanied with these metals in monazite ore, the extraction of Y(III) has also been studied. Based on the results obtained, a proposed method has been suggested to extract and separate the above metals from the hydrous oxide cake resulted by alkaline leaching of Egyptian monazite and a schematic diagram explaining the process has been presented.Rare earth elements (REE) have been increasingly used in the field of chemical engineering, metallurgy, nuclear energy, optical, magnetic, luminescence and laser materials, high-temperature superconductors, secondary batteries and catalysis ( The high value of these elements depends on their effective separation into high purity compounds. The separation of the natural REE mixtures into the individual elements is very difficult to achieve, due to the very low separation factors involving the adjacent REE and because the chemical properties of the individual elements are very similar. The solvent extraction of the trivalent lanthanides by reagents of different types has been extensively studied since the 1950s, and this technique is widely accepted in the commercial processing of rare-earth compounds ( On the other hand, synergistic extraction systems have been applied to rare earths, numerous times, with a large increase in the extraction efficiency being observed ( Since the extractants used in synergistic systems are usually composed of a mixture of acidic extractant with a neutral one, the acid liberated during the process of solvent extraction of metals with those acidic extractants adversely affects the metal extraction. Therefore, the present work is directed to study the extraction behavior of lanthanum and neodymium from nitric acid solution using a convenient mixture of TOPO and TRPO neutral extractants in kerosene to maintain the best conditions for applying the method to recover and separate those metals from Egyptian monazite sand. Lanthanum(III), neodymium(III) and yttrium(III) stock solutions (1 TOPO, TRPO and all Cyanex reagents were supplied by Cytec Inc., USA. TOPO [(C Lanthanum, neodymium and yttrium concentrations were separately determined by the Arsenazo-III method ( Extraction experiments were carried out by shaking equal volumes of aqueous and organic phases for 30 Known aliquot volumes were taken from the aqueous phase before and after extraction for determination of metal ion concentration. Stripping experiments were carried out by shaking 10 In order to choose the suitable extractant for recovery of La(III) and Nd(III) (1 Since the extraction of the lanthanides is highest from nitric acid and this medium offered comparatively better possibilities for separation ( The pattern of extraction of La(III) and Nd(III) from HNO The extraction of La(III) and Nd(III) (1 A traditional and effective means of obtaining both the stoichiometric and equilibrium constant and information about the extraction processes, called “slope analysis,” is based on an examination of the variation of the distribution ratio as a function of the relevant experimental variables. If the concentration of the extractant is constant and the hydrolysis in the aqueous phase as well as the polymerization in the organic phase occur to a negligible extent, then the plots will be straight lines and their slopes give the number of the ligands. Therefore, the slopes obtained indicate the participation of three TOPO molecules or two TRPO molecules in the extracted species when they are used separately. The variation of distribution ratio of La(III) and Nd(III) as a function of TOPO and TRPO concentration at 1 The effect of hydrogen ion concentration at 1 Increasing the nitrate concentration from 1 to 3 The metal to extractant ratio was found out by observing the effect of variation of the concentration of TOPO (0.1–0.3 Based on the slope analysis results taken from the previous On the other hand, the reaction in case of synergism in this work could be written as: Thus, the extraction constant in case of synergism can be calculated from the relation: The average values of The effect of change of organic to aqueous (O/A) phase ratio on the extraction trend of La(III) and Nd(III) from 1 Regarding to its concentration value, yttrium is the fourth rare earth element present in Egyptian monazite. So, it is necessary to study its extraction under the same experimental conditions used in lanthanum and neodymium extraction system. As illustrated in It is interesting to note that Y The increase of temperature in the range 15 –45 where, The examination of Eq. Combining this with Eq. Thus, the plot of ln The free energy change (Δ As shown in Stripping investigations were carried out on the organic solution consisting of the usual mixture of TOPO and TRPO in kerosene containing La(III), Nd(III) and Y(III) (1 The separation factor ( In a previous work, a modified alkaline leaching and extraction process for uranium from hydrous oxide cake of Egyptian monazite was developed ( The extraction studies of some rare earths including yttrium from nitric acid medium with a mixture of neutral organophosphorus reagents gave synergistic behavior and showed the formation of a neutral complex of the form of The author would like to express his deep thanks and gratitude for Prof. Dr. H.F.
