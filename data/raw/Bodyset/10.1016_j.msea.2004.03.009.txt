This paper presents a numerical and experimental analysis of the formation of interdendritic microporosities during unidirectional solidification of Al 4.5wt.% Cu alloy. A model, based on the method of finite difference is applied to simulate the solidifying process, permitting the determination of structural parameters, as primary and secondary dendrite arm spacing, permeability of the interdendritic channels and the formation of microporosity between the dendritic arms. The model permits the prediction of microporosity due to metal shrinkage during solidification and due to the evolution of hydrogen resulting from the difference in its solubility in the liquid and solid phases, including determination of their dimensions and locations. The model allows establishing the minimum gas content and the ideal thermal conditions to minimize microporosity formation. To test and optimize the model developed, experimental testing was performed, using a specially built unidirectional solidifying oven and in situ measurements of the hydrogen content in the liquid metal. Using optical microscopy, the primary and secondary interdendritic spacing were obtained, also including determination of microporosity dimensions and locations. Results obtained are presented with the application of the model for Al 4.5wt.% Cu alloy solidification under different conditions.Microporosity influences the mechanical properties of castings and is one of the most undesirable defects. Microporosity may occur during solidification of castings, either due to rejection of gas from the liquid metal or to the inability to feed through interdendritic channels to compensate for the shrinkage Specially in alloys which freeze over a temperature range presenting a dendritic structure, microporosity may be found after solidification. Analysis of microporosity formation is complex because it depends on interdendritic fluid flow and the dendritic structure is affected by parameters such as alloy composition, gas content, casting geometry and alloy and mold thermal properties that directly influence the solidification processes. In addition, during solidification, the rejection of gas at the solid/liquid interface leads to an increased gas concentration in the liquid. If this concentration reaches a critical value, based on the net solubility of gas in the liquid, then pores can nucleate and grow Microporosity formation has been studied for the last decades but different approaches and equations have been used to estimate the parameters related to microstructure and pore formation, such as primary and secondary arm spacing The aim of the present paper is to analyze the problem of microporosity formation during the unidirectional solidification of an Al 4.5  Temperature profiles in the casting and the mold during solidification were measured with kromel–alumel thermocouples at different positions ( The variation of heat transfer coefficient at metal/mold interface was estimated through the adjustment of experimental casting temperature close to the interface and the numerical prediction. Small samples were cut and polished in order to measure pore size and primary and secondary dendrite arms spacing at several positions along the ingot, using optical microscopy. The pore fraction was measured by image analysis. A numerical simulation to predict microporosity formation during solidification must be able to describe precisely the evolution of The numerical model adopted in this work is the one based on the equation of energy conservation Adopting the enthalpy method, Following a suitable discretization of the metal/mold system, equations are solved using an explicit finite difference method. Taking into account the influence of the shrinkage and dissolved gases, a pore will form if the following equation is held The thermophysical properties of Al 4.5  The temperature profile containing the experimentally monitored temperatures was used in a finite difference heat flow program to determine the transient metal/mold heat transfer coefficient. Using these parameters, it is possible to calculate the velocity at which the dendrite tip advances, the local solidification time and the thermal gradients in front of the dendrite tip and then predict the variation of the dendritic arm spacing during solidification. The equations proposed by Hunt  Considering that the flow of liquid metal through the interdendritic channels follows the flow through porous media, flow velocity is related to the pressure drop by Darcy’s law To determine the pressure drop that occurs in the liquid flow in the interdendritic channel, it is necessary to calculate the permeability of the dendritic network. During solidification, a continuous variation occurs in the interdendritic primary and secondary spacing; therefore, permeability also varies during the solidification process.  The variations found in the curves in Analyzing the permeability evolution curves with liquid fraction in Comparing to the curve of the Carman–Kozeny Analyzing The use of the equation proposed by Santos and coworkers  For the case of the experimental apparatus used (vertical directional solidification) with the Al 4.5 From the experimental verification of the existence of microporosity in the entire sample, according to During solidification the rejection of gas at the solid/liquid interface leads to an increased gas concentration in the liquid. If this concentration reaches a critical value, based on the net solubility of gas in the liquid, then pores can nucleate and grow In In Still analyzing On the other hand, the proposal for solubility by Sigworth and Engh  Since the results of the mathematical model developed showed good agreement when compared with the experimental results, one can use the model to evaluate other process variables. As an example, some simulation results of the numerical model developed for the case of the Al–4.5% Cu alloy are presented below.   Adopting the variable coefficient and the other conditions remaining the same, the primary arm spacing and the pore radius also increase, for hydrogen concentrations of 0.10 and 0.05. For no initial gas dissolved there is practically no pore formation in the casting, according to  Numerical and experimental results presented in this paper indicate that the numerical model permits a sufficiently precise analysis of the formation of microporosity by dissolved gases and by shrinkage of metallic alloys during solidification, considering temperature profiles, position of Results presented for the Al 4.5 For the case of the experimental apparatus used (vertical directional solidification) and for the Al 4.5 For a given initial hydrogen content, the volumetric fraction of pores and the size of the pores diminish with the increasing in the cooling rate; for rates below 1 For a certain cooling rate, the volumetric fraction of pores and their size increase with the initial hydrogen content and these increases are larger, the smaller the cooling rates.
