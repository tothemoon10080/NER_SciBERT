The commercial carbon black is used as a film electrode (nCFE), and as support of the copper and palladium particles. The electrodes Cu/nCFE, with different quantities of copper was evaluated for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in 1M KHCO3 by means cyclic voltammetry, and exhibited a good behavior as catalysts. The morphology of the electrodes had an important influence in the catalytic process. On the other hand, the cyclic voltammetry studies allowed to define a specific potential range for palladium electrodeposition without hydrogen evolution (-0.09 to -0.17 V vs. SCE), and by means of anodic stripping voltammetry it was possible to evaluate the corresponding mass of metallic palladium with and without hydrogen discharge. The carbon black was used without purification and FTIR analysis shows they surface chemical composition (C-O, C=O, CF2, CF, S-O, C-O-C). These groups provide a degree of chemical reactivity. However, they did not affect the electrochemical deposit of copper and palladium; they are not electroactive in ammonia acidic and basic systems. The SEM images showed the morphology of copper and palladium particles. The copper dispersion on the surface of carbon electrode was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The hydrogen discharge reaction has an important influence in the palladium particles morphology. The size of the palladium particles are about 31 and 34 nm estimated by analysis XRD.
