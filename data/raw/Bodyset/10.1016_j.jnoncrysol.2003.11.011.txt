The stability of the quasicrystalline phase present in as-cast Al65Cu20Fe15, Al65Cu20Co15 and Al72Pd19.5Mn8.5 alloys during high energy ball milling and on subsequent annealing has been studied. The synthesis and stability of the quasicrystalline phase prepared by mechanical alloying of Al65Cu20Fe15, Al70Cu20Fe10 and Al65Cu20Co15 alloys has also been studied. In all the cases, the quasicrystalline phase is unstable with long hours of milling and transforms to the β-phase (bcc phase), which is stable on further milling and on subsequent annealing up to 1073 K. The quasicrystalline to β-phase transformation appears to occur for grain sizes below 20 nm.The discovery of a thermodynamically stable quasicrystalline (QC) phase in the Al–Cu–Fe system Elemental blends of Al, Cu, Fe and Co (99.9% purity) powders corresponding to the nominal compositions of Al  MA of Al The DQC phase forms in Al MM for 40 h of the as-cast Al Irrespective of the composition chosen in the present study, the QC phase appears to be unstable for long milling times. The present results indicate that the stable state after MA or MM of the QC phase is the β-phase. It is important to note that the compositions chosen in the present study are close to the stable QC compositions in the respective systems. It is possible that the β-phase might be the room temperature stable structure for these alloys as shown in Thus, the formation of the β-phase and its stability during MM/MA could be attributed to enhanced diffusivities due to the formation of nanocrystalline structures and the introduction of a number of defects. It is important to note that a QC to β transformation was observed in the present study only after the former phase becomes nanocrystalline. However, if The QC phase synthesized by MA in both Al–Cu–Fe alloys studied transformed to β-phase with long duration milling. MA of Al
