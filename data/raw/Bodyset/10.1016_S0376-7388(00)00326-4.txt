An emulsion liquid membrane containing Span-80, CHCl3 and o-phenanthroline, as a mobile carrier, is proposed for the preparation of nanosized semiconductor CdS particles. Effects of the different factors on the synthetic reaction were investigated. The structure and morphology of the products were characterized, and the opto-electronic properties were detected. Under the conditions of Roi 2.0, Rew 1.5 and pH 5, in 10min of contact between ELM and the external aqueous phase, the CdCl2 in the external aqueous phase was completely transferred and reacted with the Na2S in internal aqueous phase, and turned into size-quantized CdS nanocrystals with the average size of about 4.5nm. The ELM method may open a new synthetic route for a series of nanostructured inorganic materials.Since liquid membrane separation was first invented by Li The emulsion and CaS nanoparticles were prepared through the following procedure. Mix 0.1 The content of cadmium in the internal and the external aqueous phase was determined by porphyrin spectrophotometry In preparation of ELM, we adopted the common system of Span-80, but the selection of carrier was the key of the nano-CdS synthesis. Through test and analysis, a kind of ideal complexant, Phen, was chosen for the mobile carrier, and CHCl The test results indicated that the suitable concentration of Phen and Span-80 were above 0.01  Direct TEM observation of the CdS particles obtained (  According to the test results and literature reports, a possible mechanism of the reaction and the transport, which was The test results showed that the size of the CdS particles was not directly proportional to the diameter of the emulsion droplets (μm level) and didn’t reach its limit value. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the CdS nanoparticles was adsorbed on the ethereal carbon rings of the hydrophilic-groups of Span-80 on the internal wall of the ELM for its polarity is weaker than that of H
