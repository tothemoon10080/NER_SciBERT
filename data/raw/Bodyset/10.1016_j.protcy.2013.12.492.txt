Titanium implants, such as bone plates, require compatible surface microtopography for bone cells adhesion and proliferation. To directly imitate complex natural bone structure, casting of different titanium alloys into natural bone structure investment was developed and compared. Major challenges are titanium's high melting point as well as its high reactivity to nearly all crucible materials. Pure titanium, Ti-Cu eutectic and Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 alloys were cast for comparison. Reaction layers, hardness profiles, and phase morphology and identification were investigated. Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 was found to be the best in terms of minimized reaction layer thickness and its ability to replicate trabecular bone structure.
