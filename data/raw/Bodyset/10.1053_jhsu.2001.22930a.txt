The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of computed tomography (CT) results in changes in the evaluation and treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures. Fifteen intra-articular distal radius fractures were evaluated independently by 4 hand surgeons. Plain x-rays were reviewed initially followed by the corresponding CT scans for comparison of articular step-off and gapping, comminution, and treatment. Kappa coefficients (κ) of intraobserver and interobserver reliability for treatment plans were generated. Computed tomography scans improved the sensitivity of measurement of articular surface gapping, improved the accuracy of detection of comminution and distal radioulnar joint involvement, and altered proposed treatment plans within observers (intraobserver agreement: κ =.54, moderate) and improved agreement of proposed treatment plans between observers (κ =.34 to κ =.44, fair to moderate). Computed tomography scanning influenced observers to change treatment plans and resulted in increased interobserver reliability in the proposed management of these injuries.
