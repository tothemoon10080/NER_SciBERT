Industrial screening is extensively used for size separations from 300mm down to roughly 40µm, although the efficiency decreases rapidly with fineness. Dry screening is generally limited to material above ca. 5mm in size, while wet screening down to ca. 250µm is common. Although there are screen types that are capable of efficient size separations down to 40µm, sizing below 250µm is more commonly undertaken by classification. Selection between screening and classification is influenced by the fact that finer separations demand large areas of screening surface and therefore can be expensive compared to classification for high-throughput applications.What is the %−12.7 To solve we need the efficiency of recovery of finished product to the underflow, Size the screen in the crusher-screen closed circuit, A simplified screen area calculation is:  For From  We can get to this by calculating  To calculate need %−6.5 In In The calculation for %−6.5 The calculated screen area Applying a safety factor: Depending on availability, a 2.44  The types of screening equipment are many and varied. Likewise, there are a wide range of screening objectives. The main purposes in the minerals industry are:        In its simplest form, the screen is a surface having many apertures, or holes, usually with uniform dimensions. Particles presented to a screen surface either pass through or are retained, according to whether the particles are smaller or larger than the governing dimensions of the apertures. The efficiency of screening is determined by the degree of separation of the material into size fractions above and/or below the aperture size. These can be derived from mass balances around a screen,       The mass fractions At steady state, the overall solids mass balance on the screen is: Several methods of defining screen performance exist (  In most cases (and if there are no broken or deformed apertures), the amount of coarse material in the underflow is usually negligible and a simplification is to assume This is the efficiency equation used in If, rather than the fine product, the coarse product is of more interest, a second definition of efficiency is recovery of oversize to the overflow,  Formulae such as these are acceptable for assessing the efficiency of a screen under different conditions, operating on the same feed. They do not, however, give an absolute value of the efficiency, as no allowance is made for the difficulty of the separation. A feed composed mainly of particles of a size near to that of the screen aperture—“near-size” (or “near-mesh”) material—presents a more difficult separation than a feed composed mainly of very coarse and very fine particles relative to the screen aperture. Circulation of material occurs in several parts of a mineral processing flowsheet, in grinding and flotation circuits, for example, as well as the crushing stage. In the present context, the circulating load ( In circuit (b), at steady state From The circulating load as a function of screen efficiency for the two circuits is shown in For a screen this is drawn by plotting the partition coefficient, defined as the fraction (percentage) of the feed reporting to the oversize product, against the geometric mean size on a logarithmic scale. (For particles in the range, say, −8.0 +6.3 The separation size, or The efficiency of separation is assessed from the steepness of the partition curve (see The efficiency definitions above refer to the recovery of finished product to either stream, for example, Screen effectiveness must always be coupled with capacity as it is often possible, by the use of a low feed rate and a very long screening time, to effect an almost complete separation. At a given capacity, the effectiveness depends on the nature of the screening operation, that is, on the overall chance of a particle passing through the screen once it has reached it. The process of screening is frequently described as a series of probabilistic events, where particles are presented to a screening surface many times, and on each presentation there exists a given probability that a particle of a given size will pass. In its simplest form, the probability of passage for a single spherical particle size The probability of passage for Screening performance is therefore affected by factors that influence the probability of particle passage, and factors that influence the number of opportunities the particles are given to pass through the screen mesh.  It can be seen from The principle of sieve sizing analysis is to use a low feed mass and a long screening time to effect an almost complete (perfect) separation. In industrial screening practice, economics dictate that relatively high feed rates and short particle dwell times on the screen should be used. At high feed rates, a bed of material is presented to the screen, and  The screen angle also affects the speed at which particles are conveyed along the screen, and therefore the dwell time on the screen and the number of opportunities particles have of passing the screen surface. Banana screens (see Most granular materials processed on screens are nonspherical. While spherical particles pass with equal probability in any orientation, irregular-shaped near-mesh particles must orient in an attitude that permits them to pass. Elongated and slabby particles will present a small cross section for passage in some orientations and a large cross section in others. The extreme particle shapes therefore have a low screening efficiency: Mica, for instance, screens poorly on square aperture screens, its flat, plate-like crystals tending to “ride” over the screen apertures. The chance of passing through the aperture is proportional to the percentage of open area in the screen material ( Open area generally decreases with the fineness of the screen aperture. In order to increase the open area of a fine screen, very thin and fragile wires or deck construction must be used. This fragility and the low-throughput capacity are the main reasons for classifiers replacing screens at fine aperture sizes. Advances in screen design continue to be made and examples of cyclones being replaced by screens are reported ( Screens are vibrated in order to throw particles off the screening surface so that they can again be presented to the screen, and to convey the particles along the screen. The right type of vibration also induces stratification of the feed material ( The vibration must be sufficient to prevent pegging and blinding. However, excessive vibration intensity will cause particles to bounce from the screen deck and be thrown so far from the surface that there are very few effective presentations to the screen surface. Higher vibration rates can, in general, be used with higher feed rates, as the deeper bed of material has a “cushioning” effect that inhibits particle bounce. Vibration can be characterized by the vibration frequency, Vibrating screens typically operate with a vibration force of between 3 and 7 times the gravitational acceleration, or 3–7 The amount of surface moisture present in the feed has a marked effect on screening efficiency, as does the presence of clays and other sticky materials. Damp feeds screen poorly as they tend to agglomerate and “blind” the screen apertures. As a rule, dry screening at less than around 5 Wet screening allows finer sizes to be processed efficiently down to 250 Screen models aim to predict the size distribution and flow rate of the screen products. Models in the literature can be classified as: phenomenological models that incorporate a theory of the screening process; empirical models based on empirical data; numerical models based on computer solutions of Newtonian mechanics. Phenomenological models are based on the theory of particle passage through a screening surface. The two dominant theories are Empirical or One set of correction factors: account for the feed size distribution, namely: the quantity of oversize (material larger than the aperture), half-size (material less than half the aperture size), and near-size (material between 75% and 125% of the aperture size). Other factors include: the density of material being screened; whether the screen is a top deck or a lower deck on a multideck screen; the open area of the screen cloth; whether square or slotted apertures are used; whether wet-screening is employed; and the desired screening efficiency. The values of the base capacity and for each of the factors are given in the form of tables or charts (e.g., While these capacity-based calculations are popular, the information should be treated as a guide only ( Numerical computer simulations are being increasingly used to model the behavior of particles in various processing equipment, including screens ( There are numerous types of industrial screens available. The dominant type is the vibrating screen, of which there are many subtypes in use for coarse and fine-screening applications. Vibrating screens are the most important and versatile screening machines for mineral processing applications ( Vibrating screens of most types can be manufactured with more than one screening deck. On multiple-deck systems, the feed is introduced to the top coarse screen, the undersize falling through to the lower screen decks, thus producing a range of sized fractions from a single screen. A vertical, circular or elliptical vibration is induced mechanically by the rotation of unbalanced weights or flywheels attached usually to a single drive shaft (see Very coarse material is usually screened on an inclined screen called a grizzly screen. Grizzlies are characterized by parallel steel bars or rails ( The most common use of grizzlies in mineral processing is for sizing the feed to primary and secondary crushers. If a crusher has a 100 The bars are typically made from wear-resistant manganese steel and are usually tapered to create gaps that become wider toward the discharge end of the screen to prevent rocks from wedging between the bars. Domed or peaked profiles on the tops of the bars give added wear protection and prevent undersized rocks from “riding” along the bars and being misplaced. As shown in These is a type of horizontal screen consisting of a screen frame connected by rubber buffers to a dynamically balanced frame having a natural resonance frequency which is the same as that of the vibrating screen body. The vibration energy imparted to the screen frame is stored up in the balancing frame and reimparted to the screen frame on the return stroke. The energy losses are reduced to a minimum, and the sharp return motion produced by the resonant action imparts a lively action to the deck and promotes good screening. This type of vibrating screen receives a thick slurry feed and produces a drained sand product. Dewatering screens are often installed with a slight up-hill incline to ensure that water does not flow over with the product. A thick bed of particles forms, trapping particles finer than the screen aperture. Becoming popular in high-tonnage sizing applications where both efficiency and capacity are important, banana screens ( The steep sections of the screen cause the feed material to flow rapidly at the feed end of the screen. The resulting thin bed of particles stratifies more quickly and therefore has a faster screening rate for the very fine material than would be possible on a slower moving thick bed. Toward the discharge end of the screen, the slope decreases to slow down the remaining material, enabling more efficient screening of the near-size material. The capacity of banana screens is reported to be up to three or four times that of conventional vibrating screens ( Units such as the This is a vibrating screen exploiting the principle that particles smaller than the aperture statistically require a certain number of presentations to the screen in order to pass (refer to A thin layer of particles on each screen surface is maintained, enabling high capacity such that a particular screening duty can be met with a machine occupying less floor space than a conventional screen, and blinding and Efficient screening of fine particles requires a vibration with small amplitude and high frequency. Frequencies up to 3,600 Widely used in wet screening applications, the Stack Sizer® comprises up to five individual screen decks positioned one above the other operating in parallel ( By classifying by size-only, screens compared to hydrocyclones, give a sharper separation with multidensity feeds (for example, in Pb–Zn operations), and reduce overgrinding of the dense minerals. When the shaft of an inclined screen is located precisely at the screen’s center of gravity, the entire screen body A linear vibration is induced by using mechanical exciters containing matched unbalanced weights rotating in opposite directions on two shafts, as shown in A three-shaft exciter design can be used to generate an elliptical vibratory motion, as shown in With no vibration mechanism, these units are used in scalping applications. They are installed at a slope of 35–50° to assist material flow ( Along with self-cleaning grizzly screens ( These revolving screens are one of the oldest screening devices ( Trommels remain widely used in some screening duties, including aggregate screening plants and the screening of mill discharge streams. Tumbling mill (AG, SAG, rod, and ball mills) discharge streams usually pass through a trommel screen attached to the mill outlet to prevent grinding media Introduced in 2001 by Particle Separation Systems, it is a trommel-like device designed for fine screening between 1,000 and 75 A variation of the trommel screen, it is employed in the coal industry (see also Used for screening applications from 3 to 300 The concept used in the Liwell “Flip-flow” screens is a system of flexible screen panels that are alternately stretched and relaxed to impart motion to the screen bed instead of relying only on mechanical vibration of the screen body. The throwing action can generate forces of up to 50 Flip-flow screens can be used for separations ranging from 0.5 up to 50 As shown in Along with One of the most important applications for sieve bends is in draining water from the feed to drain and rinse screens in dense medium separation circuits. When treating abrasive materials sieve bends will require regular reversal of the screen surface as the leading edge of the apertures will lose their sharpness over time. Sieve bends and inclined wedge-wire screens are sometimes installed with mechanical devices to periodically vibrate or rap the screen surface in order to remove blinded particles. Developed by Delkor (now Tenova Delkor), this screen is predominantly used for removing wood chips and fiber from the ore stream feeding carbon-in-pulp systems, and for the recovery of loaded carbon in gold CIP circuits ( It has a similar principle to the linear screen, but rather than a continuous screen surface, the deck is divided into a series of pans that move in a manner similar to a conveyor ( There are many types of screening surface available. The size and shape of the apertures, the proportion of open area, the material properties of the screening surface, and Screening surfaces are usually manufactured from steel, rubber, or polyurethane and can be classified according to how they are fixed to the screen. Bolt-in, tensioned, and modular fixing systems are used on industrial vibrating screens. Screening surfaces for screening duties with particles larger than around 50 These screening surfaces are available with custom-designed aperture shapes and sizes. Apertures usually have a tapered profile, becoming wider with depth, thereby reducing the propensity of particles pegging in the aperture. These screen surfaces consist of cloths that are stretched taut, either between the sides of the screen (cross tensioned) or along the length of the screen (end tensioned). Maintaining the correct tension in the screen cloth is essential to ensure screening efficiency and to prevent premature failure of the screening surface. Tensioned screens are available in various wire weaves as well as polyurethane and rubber mats. Usually constructed from steel or stainless steel, these traditional screen surfaces remain popular. Wire cloths are Various types of square and rectangular weaves are available. Rectangular screen apertures have a greater open area than square-mesh screens of the same wire diameter. The wire diameter chosen depends on the nature of the work and the capacity required. Fine screens can have the same or greater open areas than coarse screens, but the wires used must be thinner and hence are more fragile. Traditionally, blinding problems have been countered by using wire with long-slotted apertures or no cross-wires at all (“piano-wire”), but at the cost of lower screening efficiency. Self-cleaning wire ( Interchangeable with tensioned wire cloths, these mats are usually reinforced with internal steel cables or synthetic cords. Polyurethane and rubber screen decks ( Modular polyurethane and rubber screen panels are typically 305 Square, rectangular, and slot apertures are the most commonly used aperture shapes. Rectangular and slot apertures can be in-flow (usual for sizing applications), cross-flow (usual for dewatering applications), or diagonal. With slabby particles rectangular and slot apertures provide greater open area, throughput, resistance to pegging, and efficiency These have much greater open area compared with modular polyurethane screens. These wire panels consist of a polyurethane or rubber fixing system molded around a woven-wire or wedge-wire screening surface.
