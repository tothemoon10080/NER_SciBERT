Zinc cadmium sulphide (ZnCdS) is a ternary II-VI direct band gap semiconducting material. The band gap varies from 2.5 to 3.5eV. The semiconducting material is used as the window material in photovoltaic solar cell. We have developed the ZnCdS nano film using AR grade CdCl2, ZnCl2 and thiourea in ethylene glycol. The deposition was carried out on molybdenum substrate at 1600C. The solid state properties of the as deposited films were carried out by XRD, EDS, SEM etc. The diffraction peak observed at 2Î¸ = 26.730 with 002 plane indicate the crystalline hexagonal phase of ZnCdS film. Compositional analysis reveals the presence of Zn, Cd and S. The average grain size is observed to be 36nm. The band gap and band emission of the ZnCdS films are observed to be 2.58eV and 382nm, 496nm respectively.
