Self-consistent extension of linear poroelasticity (Biot 1941) to overlapping systems or scales of porosity and permeability within fluid-saturated, elastic materials is presented. An arbitrary number of N porosity systems with linear relations for fluid flow within and in between the porosities is considered. The theory is applied to Cryer's problem of poroelasticity. The problem considers sudden confinement of a spherical sample of porous material while the pore fluid is allowed to drain from the surface boundary. The closed-form solution to Cryer's problem is developed in Laplace transform domain for the general case where N porosity systems with full inter-porosity fluid exchange properties are present in the spherical sample. Numerical results are retrieved in the time domain for a hierarchical class of multiple-porosity models describing the commonly observed porosity systems of organic-rich shale. The stress and pore fluid pressure solutions pertaining to the cases of up to five coexisting porosity systems are demonstrated.A mechanistically viable and mathematically rigorous integration of the dual-continuum theory ( Generalization of the theory to multiple-porosity and multiple-permeability poroelasticity has been presented in ( A complex of   Substitution of The ad hoc formulation of potential energy density function in  The potential energy density function of an Likewise, Maxwell–Betti reciprocity theorem demands a symmetric form in the material coefficient submatrix, i.e., Algebraic relations between the intrinsic single-porosity poroelastic parameters  Similar to the case of single-porosity poroelasticity, the shear stresses do not produce any volumetric deformation in the isotropic material. Therefore, the general constitutive relation between the full stress and strain tensors can be conveniently derived, as follows: Mandel's problem of poroelasticity ( The continuity of the fluid phase of porous matrix can be formulated through the following equation: Multiple-porosity poroelastic manifestation of Navier–Cauchy's stress equilibrium equation, The integral of  Because of the spherical symmetry, Substitution of Substitution from  The new parameters  The resulting equation for the pore pressure vector is shown in the following compact form: In  Recent advances in imaging technologies have revealed the multiple-porosity nature of organic-rich shale. The observed porosity types vary depending on the origin and sedimentation processes of shale. They may include the inter-crystalline matrix, intra-particle porosity, inter-granular porosity, dissolution porosity, floccules ( The average pore size of all porosity systems is assumed to be sufficiently larger than the mean free path of the saturating fluid molecules, so that the thermodynamic definition of the pore fluid pressure remains valid. The assumption may be violated in nanometer-scale pore sizes such as the ones in the organic matter. In case the saturating fluid is gas, the Klinkenberg correction ( Results are presented for the following models of organic-rich shale:        The field observation of evolving hydrocarbon production rates from naturally-fractured source shale, and the associated history matching studies, advocate the intermediate role of the natural fractures porosity system in the process of hydrocarbon fluid transport from the low-permeability organic porosity to the high-permeability network of induced fractures (  This paper presented the natural extension of Biot's theory describing the plausible scales of REV definition, along with energy density function and constitutive relations for a multiple-porosity and multiple-permeability poroelastic continuum. Furthermore, the analytical solution to Cryer's problem of poroelasticity is extended to the general case that considers an arbitrary number of Support from the Institute for Natural Gas Research (INGaR) at Pennsylvania State University, and Poromechanics Industry Consortium at the University of Oklahoma is acknowledged.
