Benzyl Grignard reagents react with cyclic β-alkoxy-α,β-unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones by 1,2-addition to afford unsaturated allylic alcohols in high yield. The factors determining the balance between 1,2- and 1,4-addition to unsaturated ketones are discussed. The structures of major and minor products are established by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies.In an earlier paper The factors The ketone ( Assignment of the structures to three further products from reaction of ketone ( The above results differ from those reported in the accompanying paper Reaction of benzyl magnesium bromide with the ketone ( Reaction of allyl Grignard reagents, as expected, Four aspects of the above results are noteworthy. The most striking observation is the contrast whereby isolation in high yield of 1,4-adducts from the ketone ( The route, by 1,2-addition of benzyl Grignard reagents to ketones ( General procedures are described elsewhere.  Reaction of ketone (            Reaction of ketone (      We thank the Egyptian Government for a research studentship (A. H. El-S.) and EPSRC for X-ray facilities.
