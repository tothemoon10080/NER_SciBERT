This chapter describes the Swedish wood fuel supply in the medium time perspective. The aim of this chapter is to calculate technically and economically available quantities of wood fuel, with regards to ecological considerations in the medium time perspective around 10 years in Sweden. The applied methodology means that the potential supply of wood fuel of various types are distributed on different cost influencing factors. All types of wood fuels are included. Without reductions for ecological, technical, or economic reasons the total supply is about 452 PJ depending, e.g., on the future cut of industrial wood. About 270 PJ can be considered to be available in the medium term with today's best technique and with today's average price level of about 32 SEK per GJ. Moreover, for the ecological reductions, the recommendations of the Swedish Board of Forestry have been applied to other aspects that might influence the available quantity in the future are the forestry law, the average cutting level, willingness to deliver for energy purposes, harder ecological restrictions, and new regulations about certification of the forest.
