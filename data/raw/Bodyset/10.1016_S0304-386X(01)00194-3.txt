The effect of the mixture of surfactants nonylphenolpolyethylene glycol with molecular weight 900 (D1), dinaphthylmethane-4,4′-disulphonic acid (D2) and polyethylene glycol with molecular weight 400 (D3) on the processes taking place during the acid and neutral leaching of zinc calcine was investigated: dissolution of zinc and metal impurities from calcine; precipitation of Fe(OH)3 and AL(OH)3 and coagulation of colloidal silicic acid solutions. The influence of the surfactant mixture (D1+D2+D3) was determined by comparing the results obtained with and without surfactants. The following effects of surfactants were found:
                        
                           •
                           The presence of surfactants causes a small decrease of zinc, copper and cadmium dissolution during the acid leaching of zinc calcine;

                           The volume of Fe(OH)3 or Al(OH)3 precipitated in solutions increases in the presence of surfactants which improves the effect of both hydroxides as scavengers;

                           Surfactant mixture initiates silicic acid coagulation at lower pH values compared to experiments without surfactants providing higher purification of zinc sulphate solutions and better separation from the insoluble residue.The presence of surfactants causes a small decrease of zinc, copper and cadmium dissolution during the acid leaching of zinc calcine; The surfactant mixture improves deposition of impurities during the neutral leaching stage; The volume of Fe(OH) Surfactant mixture initiates silicic acid coagulation at lower pH values compared to experiments without surfactants providing higher purification of zinc sulphate solutions and better separation from the insoluble residue. Surfactants nonylphenolpolyethylene glycol (D1), dinaphthylmethane-4,4′-disulphonic acid (D2) and polyethylene glycol with molecular weight 400 (D3) were used in previous studies on zinc electrowinning to increase current efficiency and to improve cathodic zinc quality Dissolution of zinc and metal impurities from calcine in sulfuric acid solutions and precipitation of metal hydroxides (Fe(OH) The concentration of D1, D2 and D3 in all experiments was (in mg L The leaching experiments were carried out with the industrial zinc calcine from zinc plant in Plovdiv (Bulgaria). Calcine composition is given in The precipitation of Fe(OH) The effect of the surfactant mixture on the formation of colloidal silicic acid was investigated at room temperature. The colloidal silicic acid was obtained by mixing of diluted water–glass solutions (0.015; 0.030 and 0.045 M Na The effect of the surfactant mixture on the dissolution of zinc and metal impurities, precipitation of ferric and aluminium hydroxides and formation of colloidal silicic acid was determined by comparing the results obtained with and without surfactants. At least two parallel experiments were carried out for all experiments. The time-dependence of zinc, copper and cadmium dissolution during the acid leaching of zinc calcine in 0.25 M H It was also found that the clarification of solutions at the end of neutral leaching carried out in the presence of surfactants is faster than without surfactants which improves solid–liquid separation. The impurities content in zinc sulphate solutions and the fraction of impurities remaining in zinc sulphate solution (Fr) after the neutral leaching of calcine are presented in The results indicate that the presence of the surfactant mixture during the neutral leaching stage substantially decreases antimony, arsenic, nickel and cobalt content in zinc sulphate solutions but the effect of surfactants on the decreasing of copper and cadmium content is small. The results concerning precipitation of Fe(OH) The experiments concerning the behaviour of colloidal silicic acid solutions obtained in the presence of or without surfactants (pH=1.5) indicate that: (a) Coagulation of colloidal silicic acid solutions in the absence of surfactants was not found for the experimental conditions mentioned above; (b) Surfactant mixture causes coagulation of colloidal silicic acid solutions which starts immediately. The effect of surfactants decreases with increasing silicic acid concentration; (c) Coagulation of silicic acid in the presence of surfactants improves both the cleaning of zinc sulphate solutions and their separation from insoluble residue. The influence of surfactants D1, D2 and D3 on the processes which take place during the leaching of zinc calcine seems to be related to their effect as surface tension-reducing agents. D2 is anionic but D1 and D3 are non-ionic wetting agents. D1 and D3 are long chained organic molecules with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. D2 involves negatively charged (hydrophilic) and aromatic (hydrophobic) groups. The decrease of surface tension ensures better contact between solution and solid faces. This increases sorption capacity of Fe(OH) The influence of surfactant mixture on zinc, copper and cadmium dissolution during the acid leaching stage as well as on the decreasing of impurities in zinc sulphate solutions can be related to the effect of D1 and D3 as complexing agents, since the oxygen atoms in their molecules can provide binding to the metal ions. This correlates with the results of our polarographic investigations The following conclusions can be drawn comparing the results obtained in the absence of and with a mixture of surfactants nonylphenolpolyethylene glycol (30 mg L (a) The presence of surfactant mixture causes a small decrease of zinc, copper and cadmium dissolution during the acid leaching of zinc calcine; (b) Impurities concentration in solutions obtained during the neutral leaching of zinc calcine in the presence of surfactants is lower than without surfactants; (c) The increase of the volume of precipitated Fe(OH) (d) The surfactant mixture initiates coagulation of colloidal silicic acid solutions at lower pH values than without surfactants which improves purification of zinc sulphate solutions and their separation from insoluble residue; (e) The influence of surfactant mixture seems to be related to the effect of surfactants as tension-reducing agents and complexing agents.
