Separation and recovery of molybdenum was investigated from the sea nodule leach liquor containing 0.505kg/m3 Mo(VI), 0.212kg/m3 Fe(III),12.08kg/m3 Cu(II), 2.012kg/m3 Co(II) and 15.16kg/m3 Ni(II). The recovery process was carried out in two key steps: (i) Solvent extraction of Mo(VI) from the leach liquor using Alamine 304-1 dissolved in kerosene and (ii) Preparation of MoO3 from stripped solution by crystallization followed by thermal decomposition of ammonium polymolybdate crystals. In the solvent extraction study, the effects of several operational factors like contact time, pH, extractant concentration and different stripping reagents were examined to establish suitable conditions for effective extraction and stripping of molybdenum. The number of stages required for extraction and stripping were determined from a McCabe Thiele diagram and confirmed by a counter current simulation study. Enrichment of approximately 6.05kg/m3 Mo(VI) into the loaded organic phase was achieved with 10% (v/v) Alamine 304-1, at equilibrium pH 1.62, and A:O=12:1. The McCabe Thiele diagrams at A:O=1:16 with 5M NH4OH+2.5M (NH4)2CO3 showed two theoretical stages needed for quantitative stripping of molybdenum. Ammonium polymolybdate was crystallized from the stripped solution (96.79kg/m3 Mo) and molybdenum trioxide was obtained by thermal decomposition at 400°C with purity of 99.9%.Molybdenum is one of the significant refractory metals used as an alloying agent in cast iron, steel and super alloys and in numerous chemical applications including catalysts, lubricants and pigments ( The Korean Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) has developed the processing of Pacific ocean manganese nodule based on a pyro-hydrometallurgical combination system. This method involves the reduction smelting-sulfidation route to produce Cu–Ni–Co–Fe rich matte followed by oxidative pressure leaching with dilute sulphuric acid. This leaching solution produces 0.2 Several authors have studied the extraction of molybdenum from the aqueous solutions by various hydrometallurgical techniques such as: ion exchange ( Many authors have investigated the solvent extraction of molybdenum from aqueous media containing hydrochloric acid (  From the above literature survey, most of the phosphoric and thio-phosphoric acid, oxime and amine extractants are being applied for solvent extraction of molybdenum from acidic solutions bearing other base metals such as Al, Ni, Co, of various secondary sources. In contrast, a few attempts have been made relating to the extraction of molybdenum from the acidic leach solutions which invariably contains the other impurities like Cu and Fe. Moreover, the reagent: tri-dodecylamine (Alamine 304-1) which is chosen as the extractant for the current investigation, was found to be highly selective and efficient in extraction of molybdenum from the acidic sulphate solution, in laboratory as well as pilot scale, reported by As no systematic study is reported on the extraction of molybdenum from sea nodule, we propose a selective extraction of molybdenum from the sea nodule leach solution containing Cu, Co, Ni and Fe using Alamine 304-1 in kerosene and the recovery of MoO The synthetic solution containing 0.505 The desired volumes of aqueous and organic phases were contacted manually in separating funnel for 5 minutes, except the study on extraction or stripping kinetic study in which contact time was varied within 0.5–10 minutes. After phase disengagement, the aqueous phase was separated followed by the measurement of equilibrium pH (using pH meter, Orion, USA) and determination of metal concentrations in the raffinate by ICP-AES (JOBIN YUVON JY 38). The metal ion concentrations in the organic phase were determined from the difference between the concentration in the aqueous phase before and after extraction. As and when required, the metal concentrations in the organic phase were estimated after filtration through 1PS phase separation paper and stripping a suitable aliquot of it with 5 Where distribution coefficient, D is [Mo] The kinetics on extraction of molybdenum from the sea nodule leach solution with varying the phase contact time from 0.5 to 10 The effect of temperature was studied ranging from 25 To study the molybdenum extraction as the function of pH, the equilibrium pH values of the aqueous leach liquor was varied from 0.35 to 2.95 with using 0.6% v/v Alamine-304 (stoichiometric amount), at the phase ratio: A:O The extraction reaction of molybdenum in sulphuric acid solution with Alamine 304-1 occur in two steps; (i) acid transfer from the aqueous phase to form the hydroacid of ammine (protonation), (ii) ion exchange of anionic molybdenum complexes, according to Eqs. From The study on the variation of higher concentration of Alamine 304-1 (5% v/v to 15% v/v), were tested in order to enrich the molybdenum concentration to a greater value in the organic phase. The other parameters namely equilibrium pH 1.62 and phase ratio (A:O The A/O ratio studies were carried out to find out the theoretical number of extraction stages and the enrichment of molybdenum in loaded organic phase during extraction. The molybdenum distribution isotherm was determined by varying the phase ratio of A:O from 15:1 to 1:5 at equilibrium pH 1.62, using 10% (v/v) Alamine 304-1. The McCabe Thiele diagram constructed for extraction of molybdenum is shown in Two stages counter current simulation (CCS) study was conducted with 10% v/v Alamine 304-1 at A:O The kinetics for stripping of 6.05 Stripping of loaded organic was examined with four different reagents such as NH Different concentration of NH The loaded organic contained 6.05 Two stages countercurrent stripping study (CCS) of the loaded organic with 5 The stripped solution generated by a two stages counter current simulation study contained 96.79 Two typical samples obtained after crystallization of stripped solution and thermal decomposition of the respective crystals, were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) study, for confirmation of the compounds present in the solid matrices. The XRD patterns of the crystallized (Product-I) and the thermal decomposed product (Product-II) are as shown in Based on the experimental results of the present investigation a conceptual flow diagram, describing the solvent extraction and stripping of molybdenum and the recovery of MoO Extraction and separation of molybdenum from the sea nodule leach solution was carried out using Alamine 304-1 in kerosene. Molybdenum extraction was rapid and dependent on the equilibrium pH of the aqueous phase. The extraction of molybdenum at equilibrium pH 1.62 was demonstrated with 10 % v/v Alamine 304-1 in two stages at A:O The first author thankfully acknowledges the award of a Post Doctoral Fellowship from KIGAM during the course of investigation.
