Micro-sized carbon dioxide gas bubbles can be applied as alternatives to air bubbles in flotation separation processes, which can reduce CO2 emissions as well as decrease energy consumption. CO2 and air bubbles were used as particle collectors in the flotation process to investigate and compare the collision efficiency and particle separation characteristics. This study measured bubble size distributions and simulated the single-collector collision (SCC) model that has been applied extensively to flotation processes. The diameter of the air bubbles was found to decrease as the saturator pressure increased, but the size of the CO2 bubbles increased when the pressure exceeded 151.99–202.65kPa. When using CO2 bubbles as collectors to separate particles in water, the simulation results from the SCC model expressed in terms of bubble volume concentration (BVC) was related to the lower collision efficiency of CO2 bubbles, and the bubble number concentration (BNC) rather than the BVC to the effects of macrobubbles. The findings of this study suggest that the advantages of CO2 bubbles used as collectors in particle separations would be lower operating costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from water and wastewater treatment plants.Carbon dioxide (CO In the field of water treatment, a flotation process using CO This study compares the particle separation characteristics of CO A series of particle separation tests using air or CO Pressure influences on microbubble sizes. According to Han et al. Flotation induces solid–liquid separation through the rising of aggregates. The aggregates consist of microbubbles attached to the restricted surface of solid as an interface between the dispersion medium, air, and the solids suspended in the dispersion medium. In the flotation process, bubble sizes are distributed in range 10–120 In addition, a linear relationship (Eq.         Also, Eq. In an ideal plug-flow, all flocs in the reaction chamber have equivalent residence times, and Eq.         This study evaluated the particle separation efficiency using the collision efficiency and the final flotation efficiency models that are described by the SCC and Eq. The trajectory analysis program for collision efficiency was encoded using MATLAB software, and numerical analysis was performed using the fifth-order Runge–Kutta method. The Runge–Kutta method is used to solve the ordinary differential equation, Using the data provided in The size distributions of the air and CO The air bubble diameters decrease as the pressure in the saturator increases, with slight changes above 354.64 In a real flotation process, the BVC is an important factor affecting treatment efficiency. The BVC is related to the collision of particles and is basic information for calculating the number of bubbles. In the laboratory, the BVC measured for CO The number of bubbles can be calculated using the measured bubble size distribution. The collision efficiency between a bubble and particle in water directly affects the ultimate particle separation efficiency. The collision efficiency was predicted using the SCC equations in As shown in The initial attachment coefficient This study estimated the CO Air bubble diameters were reduced as the saturator pressure increased, but CO BVCs measured at the same saturator pressure were much higher for CO In the case of CO In separating kaolin particles in water, the initial collision–attachment coefficient This research was supported by the
