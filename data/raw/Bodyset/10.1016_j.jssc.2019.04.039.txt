This study aims to synthesize very pure form of LaB6 nanocrystals at low temperatures. The synthetic route employed involved low temperature magnesiothermic reduction process of La2O3 with a mixture of Mg, I2 and B2O3 at 90 °C. The powder mixtures were mechanically induced under Ar atmosphere for 3 h and then heat treated. The pure form of nano LaB6 powder produced by this technique is by far the most versatile route for the synthesis of nano-LaB6. From the XRD evidences of the synthesized powders, a correct reaction path for the reduction process has been elucidated. The average particle size of nano powder synthesized was estimated from SEM as well as XRD as 78 ± 12 nm and 61.3 ± 2.0 nm respectively, and the values were found to be in good agreement. The particle size determined by XRD was upon applying the Rietveld refinement method and using isotropic Lorentzian Scherrer particle broadening parameter (LX) of refined peak profiles. From the average size of the particulates and from the specific surface area of LaB6 (1.3 m2/g) as determined by BET method, the number of unit crystals that might have constituted a nano-particulate of size 61.3 ± 2.0 nm was estimated as 105 numbers from the crystallographic information of LaB6.Metal borides in general are of great importance as ceramic materials due to their high hardness, high heat and electrical conductivity, good abrasion, thermal shock and corrosion resistance properties, and for an excellent chemical stability at high temperatures [ Various synthetic methods are commonly used for the synthesis of nano metal borides, such as borothermal [ As starting materials La The pre-weighed stoichiometric powder mixtures of La For the preparation of LaB Malvern Mastersizer-2000 was used for the particle size analysis of all precursor powders used for the synthesis of LaB The average particle sizes (d For the purpose of optimizing the conditions of synthesis, four formulation samples of varying mixing ratios marked as A, B, C and D ( Going by the conventional wisdom and as reported by other authors as well, the intuitive reaction path for the synthesis of LaB However, the XRD pattern of the synthesized powders prior to leaching brought about the fact that the reaction was of very different nature in the presence of I The standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and the standard enthalpy changes (ΔH) were determined using HSC Chemistry 6.0 software [ The probable reaction steps as shown above indicated that the higher concentration of Mg can induce the formation of more LaI The XRD's also confirmed that mechanistically higher concentration of Mg can force the reaction to form more LaB After a thorough and careful washing with 5 M HCl solution, the Mg  Because of the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized LaB SEM images of the purified powders are shown in The average particulate size of LaB A viable method of synthesizing a very pure form of LaB Authors would like to thank Etimaden Works General Managements, Head of Technology Development Department for using laboratory facilities and providing chemical materials.
