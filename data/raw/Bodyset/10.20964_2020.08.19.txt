The corrosion behavior of Fe-base alloy in H2SO4 acid at different concentrations was evaluated. The effect of sodium tungstate inhibitor on Fe-base alloy in 10 % H2SO4 solutions was evaluated by using weight loss and potentiodynamic polarization methods along with scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The corrosion rate and surface morphology of Fe-base alloy in the presence of various concentrations of sodium tungstate inhibitor compared to control in 10 % H2SO4 solutions were measured. The sodium tungstate inhibitor was found to improve the protection against corrosion in comparison to the uninhibited 10 % H2SO4 solution.
