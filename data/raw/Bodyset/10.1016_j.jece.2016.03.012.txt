A low cost carbon-felt (CF) material has been successfully employed as an air-diffusion cathode for the generation of H2O2 from O2 reduction in 0.05M Na2SO4 at pH 3. Using a BDD (Boron Doped Diamond)/CF air-diffusion electrode (3cm2), a maximum of 94mgL−1 of H2O2 were accumulated for the best current density value identified (21.7mAcm−2). These results were technically and economically better than other performances observed for similar cathode materials in O2-saturated solutions. An electrochemical reactor utilizing these electrodes was employed to degrade malachite green (MG) dye in the same electrolyte containing 0.5mM of Fe2+ using the electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes. The main oxidant was HO formed at the BDD surface from water oxidation and in the bulk from Fenton’s reaction between H2O2 and added Fe2+. As expected, the PEF process was more powerful than the EF due to the enhancement of HO production by photolysis of Fe(III)-hydroxy species and of Fe(III) complexes of the oxalate of the dye, as well as of intermediates. The effect of MG concentration on decolorization and mineralization rates, mineralization current efficiency and energy consumption for both processes were assessed. The CF air-diffusion cathode lost progressively performance upon consecutive PEF treatment of a 150mgL−1 MG owed to the gradual deposition of Fe species, as well as an enrichment of O, Na and S species on its surface. The deposition of Fe species was reversible since these were dissolved in the medium in consecutive trials without the need of adding new amounts of Fe2+.Malachite green (MG) is a cationic triphenylmethane dye also called Basic Green 4. It is extensively used as biocide in the aquaculture industry because of its effectiveness against important protozoal and fungal organisms and relatively low cost Several works have reported MG degradation by different conventional processes, including biological treatments A variant of this method is the photo-Fenton process, where the working solution is also treated with UV light to accelerate the degradation process taking advantage of: (i) the photoreduction of Fe(OH) Recently, the degradation of a large variety of dyes has also been studied by different electrochemical AOPs (EAOPs) such as electro-Fenton (EF) Aside from the use of inexpensive and safer H When EF and PEF are carried out in an undivided cell, organics are also destroyed by physisorbed M(HO The high efficiency of EF and PEF for the mineralization of many organic pollutants, including dyes, has been well-proven using carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) fed with O Commercial malachite green (83% purity as oxalate salt, C  The solution pH was measured with a Crison GLP 22 pH-meter. Aliquots withdrawn from the electrolyzed solutions were neutralized to stop the degradation process and filtered with 0.45 The surface morphology of the CF electrode after the different treatments studied was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). In all cases, the samples were placed in a gold plate and electron acceleration voltage of 15 To evaluate the performance of the BDD/CF air-diffusion cell for EF and PEF processes, several assays were made. In this way, the concentration of H   The influence of applied current density on H The cost of the CF used in this work was compared with that of other carbonaceous materials reported in the literature to generate H EF experiments were made by electrolyzing 100   The influence of dye concentration in the 50 and 150 The low mineralization reached for the MG solutions using EF is indicative of the formation of intermidiates that are recalcitrant to the action of BDD(HO  Ion chromatograms of the final electrolyzed solutions revealed the pre-eminent accumulation of NH The exponential TOC decay of Since the mineralization of MG involves its conversion into carbon dioxide and pre-eminently NH Taking this reaction, the mineralization current efficiency (MCE) for the EF and PEF degradations of MG were estimated by Eq.  For the above EF and PEF trials, the specific energy cost per unit mass of TOC removed (EC The energy consumptions thus obtained are summarized in The EF process might appear to be more expensive than ozonation and other advanced oxidation processes. In this regard, there is some evidence that for certain applications, EF is in the same range of cost than the Fenton process To investigate the stability of the CF air-diffusion cathode in the EAOPs tested, a series of ten cycles was made by consecutively electrolyzing a 150  To confirm the above hypothesis, the surface of the CF cathode after 10 cycles was analyzed by SEM. The image of Complementary EDS analysis of the elements detected at the CF surface also corroborated the deposition of iron. In view of the large influence of the inorganic species of the solution on the performance of the CF air-diffusion cathode, a last series of 11 consecutive trials were carried out by electrolyzing a 150 It has been demonstrated the feasibility of using a CF as air-diffusion cathode for the generation of H The authors are grateful to MINECO (Spain) under project CTQ2013-48897-C2-1-R, cofinanced with FEDER funds and to the Mexican Council for Science and Technology (CONACyT), Mexico, for financial support of this work.
