Zirconium diboride ceramics produced using commercial ZrB2 powders, and milled with zirconium diboride grinding media, were fabricated by hot-pressing at temperatures of 2100–2200°C with hold times of 30–120min. This ZrB2 exhibits no additional impurities typically introduced by milling with grinding media of differing composition. Microstructure analysis revealed grain sizes ranging from ~25 to ~50µm along with ~3vol% porosity. Flexure strength ranged from 335 to 400MPa, elastic modulus from 490 to 510GPa, fracture toughness from 2.7 to 3.2MPam½, and hardness from 13.0 to 14.4GPa. Strength limiting flaws were identified as surface grain pullout induced by machining. Elastic modulus and hardness were found to increase with decreasing porosity. Compared to the fine grained ceramics typically reported, large grain zirconium diboride ceramics exhibit higher than expected room temperature strengths.Zirconium diboride (ZrB The processing and mechanical properties of ZrB Studies of the mechanical properties of ZrB For applications at elevated temperatures, fine grained materials may not be desirable due to their increased propensity for creep compared to ceramics with larger grain sizes The objective of the present study was to investigate the microstructure and room-temperature mechanical properties of hot-pressed ZrB This study used commercially available ZrB Milled powders were hot-pressed (Model HP20-3060-20, Thermal Technology, Santa Rosa, CA) in 44.5 During hot-pressing, the change in thickness of the specimens was measured in-situ using a linearly variable differential transducer (LVDT) attached to the hot-press rams. The effect of linear thermal expansion of the rams and load train during heating to process temperatures on the calculated densities was corrected using the coefficient of thermal expansion calculated from ram displacement during cool down from the process temperature. Time-dependent density values were calculated using Bulk density of hot pressed specimens was measured by Archimedes' method using distilled water as the immersing medium according to ASTM C373. Relative density was calculated by dividing the Archimedes' density by the density predicted from the nominal ZrB Grain growth kinetics were described using a general form of the grain growth model [ Flexure strengths were measured following ASTM C1161 in four-point bending using a semi-articulated test fixture and type-A bars (25 Bulk densities ranged between 5.95 and 6.02 Grain sizes ranged from 25.0 to 52.1 Relative density as a function of hot-pressing time is shown in Grain sizes were analyzed as a function of hot-pressing time to determine the grain growth exponent ( Flexure strength, elastic modulus, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness were measured for the ZrB Elastic modulus was 492–509 Fracture toughness measured by the direct crack method, 2.7–3.2  Billets of ZrB The authors would like to thank Lucas Showalter, Conner Wittmaier, and John Tomaszewski for their assistance with the production of the ZrB
