The processing and mechanical properties of rapidly solidified and consolidated hypereutectic Al-20wt% Si alloys were studied. A bulk form of rapidly solidified Al-20wt% Si alloy was prepared by extruding gas atomized powders having a powder size of 106–145μm. Powder extrudates were subsequently equal channel angular pressed up to eight repetitive route C passes to refine matrix microstructure and Si particles by imposing severe plastic deformation. The microstructures of the gas atomized powders, extrudates and equal channel angular pressed samples were investigated via a scanning electron microscope. The mechanical properties of the bulk samples were measured by compressive tests. Equal channel angular pressing was found to be effective in matrix grain and Si particle refinement, which enhanced the strength of the Al-20wt% Si alloy without deteriorating ductility in a range of experimental strain of up to 30%.In contrast with conventional coarse grained materials, which are either strong or ductile, but rarely both at the same time, it is expected that both high strength and ductility can be achieved by grain refinements to nanoscale Many attempts have been made to use Al alloys in place of steels and cast irons, providing weight reduction and high efficiency in automobiles and home appliances. Among the newly developed Al alloys In recent years, SPD processing has been developed as a new method of manufacturing bulk specimens having ultrafine/nanocrystalline grained structure. Materials processed by SPD show not only unique physical and mechanical properties inherent in various ultrafine grained materials In this paper, we investigated the processing and mechanical properties of rapidly solidified and consolidated Al-20 A hypereutectic Al-20 The sieved powders were consolidated over 75% in relative density by cold compacting in an Al can, degassed for 1 All three sections of the extrudates and ECAP processed samples (i.e. pressing, thickness and width directions in  The powder extrudate in   In order to develop advanced performance materials and processing of high strength and low weight, gas atomized Al-20 This work was supported by Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2005-202-D00205).
