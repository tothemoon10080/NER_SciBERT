In this work, a comparative study on the electrochemical behavior of massive chalcopyrite electrode in different leaching mediums was carried out to investigate the different interface reactions. The results showed that the dissolution process of chalcopyrite in sulfuric acid solution system involves series of complex oxidation and reduction reactions, containing several intermediate species. The corresponding interface reactions were discussed in details according to some other researches. The results also revealed that the pH values, the addition of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A.f) and Acidithiobacillus caldus (A.c) do not change the interface reactions of chalcopyrite dissolution. But a lower pH value and the presence of the two strains of bacteria could significantly accelerate the oxidation rate of chalcopyrite. Additionally, low pH value and the presence of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A.f) made chalcopyrite prone to be reduced to bornite or talnakhite, thus resulting in a higher copper leaching rate.
