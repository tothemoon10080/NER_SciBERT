Liquidus phase equilibrium data of the present authors for the CaO–ZnO–SiO2 system (as a part of research program on the characterization of the multicomponent PbO–ZnO–FeO–Fe2O3-“Cu2O”-CaO-SiO2 system), combined with phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data from the literature, have been used to obtain a self-consistent set of parameters of the thermodynamic models for all phases. The modified quasichemical model is used for the liquid slag phase; lime (Ca,Zn)O, zincite (Zn,Ca)O, α- and α′-dicalcium silicate (Ca,Zn)2SiO4 and tricalcium silicate (Ca,Zn)3SiO5 are described within Bragg-Williams formalism; tridymite, cristobalite SiO2, wollastonite, pseudowollastonite CaSiO3, rankinite Ca3Si2O7, willemite Zn2SiO4, melilite (hardystonite) Ca2ZnSi2O7 and Ca–Zn feldspar CaZnSi3O8 are treated as stoichiometric compounds. From these model parameters, the optimized ternary phase diagram is back calculated.The present thermodynamic optimization was performed using FactSage thermodynamic software package [ Experiments are performed to support thermodynamic database development. Thermodynamic predictions are used to identify gaps and discrepancies and to plan further experiments. The thermodynamic ‘‘optimization’’ of a system using the CALPHAD approach involves critical evaluation of all available phase equilibria and thermodynamic data to obtain one set of model equations for the Gibbs energies of all phases as functions of temperature and composition [ The ZnO–SiO Thermodynamic properties of the pure CaO component, liquid and most compounds in CaO–SiO Until recently, there was no experimental data on phase equilibria in the CaO–ZnO system, and the liquid was described as ideal solution, no solubility of CaO in zincite, and 50 mol.% solubility of ZnO in lime, at the predicted eutectic temperature of 1847 °C [ Early investigation of the phase equilibria in the CaO–ZnO–SiO An extensive experimental study of solid-liquid phase equilibria of the CaO–ZnO–SiO At liquidus temperatures, tridymite and cristobalite SiO Thermodynamic assessment of the CaO–ZnO–SiO The Modified Quasichemical model (MQM) is used in the present work to describe the liquid phase in the binary and ternary systems. The model has been described in detail by Pelton and co-workers [ The model takes into account second-nearest-neighbour short-range ordering of cations in melts by considering pair exchange reactions, such as [ The Gibbs energy change for the quasichemical reaction (1) is used in the mathematical formulation of the model. The Gibbs energy of the solution is given by:   Coordination numbers Finally the excess Gibbs energy of pair formation Further, extrapolation of binary parameters into a ternary system is normally performed by a grouping method [ Dicalcium silicate (Ca,Zn) Optimized thermodynamic properties of the liquid slag solution and the ternary compounds in the CaO–ZnO–SiO The experimental results are compared to the optimized thermodynamic model calculations for the binary CaO–ZnO, CaO–SiO The solidus surface of the CaO–ZnO–SiO Zincite, lime, dicalcium silicate (C Calculated isothermal section at 1560 °C and activities of ZnO relative to the pure solid in the CaO–ZnO–SiO The root mean square (RMS) deviation of calculated liquidus from experimental data is chosen as a quantitative measure of the model performance: RMS error T A critical evaluation of phase equilibria and thermodynamic data for the CaO–ZnO–SiO The raw/processed data (thermodynamic parameters) required to reproduce these findings are provided in supplementary file.
