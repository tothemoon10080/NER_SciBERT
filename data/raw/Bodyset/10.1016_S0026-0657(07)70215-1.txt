Co-extrusion allows carbide particles and binder to be placed in specific locations at the meso-scale level, 10s to 100s of μm, giving a functional architecture. Wear properties did not depend on orientation effects in the structure in spite of anisotropy. Wear properties were affected by formation of Co  N G Hashe et al.

Microstructures of WC-Co with large additions of VC or VC-TiC were investigated with respect to TiC as a grain growth inhibitor. In WC-VC-Co core-rim structures and composition gradients were observed with dislocations at the core/rim interface. In WC-VC-TiC-Co structures were similar but without composition gradients. Lattice parameters of (W,V)C and (W,V,Ti)C were 0.420 and 0.429nm respectively. Co binder composition was similar for both alloy types. Addition of TiC lowered carbide grain size from 2.0 to 1.7μm, reduced particle size distribution and increased Vicker's hardness from 1519 to 1249. A model is proposed.  A S Kumar et al.

Dense diamond/cemented carbides were fabricated at 1300°C and 41MPa for three minutes, mete-stable conditions for diamond, by pulsed electric current sintering. Diamond particles were coated with SiC to prevent graphitisation. Microstructure and Raman scattering showed no graphitisation. The cemented carbide with diamond had 50% higher K  Zheng Min Sun et al. (National Inst. of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Nagoya, Japan.)
