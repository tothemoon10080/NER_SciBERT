The paper describes hydrometallurgical treatment of photographic effluent. A combined effect of cathodic current density and Na2SO3 dosage on the purity of cathodic silver and efficiency of silver electrowinning from spent photographic fixer was shown. It was found that efficient silver recovery is possible at a gradual decrease in the cathodic current density in the subsequent electrolysis stages from an initial value of 0.1A/dm2. Decrease in the Ag+ ions concentration with the electrolysis time was accompanied by increased contamination of silver deposits with Ag2S, if no extra SO3

In ancient times it was used for making bracelets, necklaces or coins, whereas nowadays its main applications broaden to electronics, silverware, photovoltaics, batteries, catalysts, medicine, photography ( Despite that the amount of the photographic waste gradually decreased, it is forecasted that even in 2017 the amount of silver recovered from photographic wastes will reach 21 Silver in waste photographic materials exists in various forms: as insoluble halides, soluble thiosulfate complexes and colloidal fine metal particles ( Ag(S Over the years, a variety of hydrometallurgical methods for silver recovery from spent photographic fixers was reported. Chemical precipitation, electrochemical methods, sorption processes as well as biohydrometallurgical techniques were proposed. Precipitation methods are based on the removal of silver ions out of the solution in a form of sparingly soluble compounds (usually Ag Electrochemical methods based on spontaneous reactions (cementation, electrochemical cell) or electrowinning enable to obtain metallic silver. The simplest process is cementation ( Main disadvantages of this method are: contamination of silver with Ag Electrowinning seems to be one of the best ways of silver recovery ( During electrolysis the following reactions can take place (standard potentials vs. SHE; at the cathode at the anode Anionic complexes Ag(S Literature data on the optimal parameters of silver electrowinning are often indicative due to some differences in the composition of fixer solutions originated from various sources For example, the colour of the cathodic deposit depends on the cathodic current density. At low current density matt white layers are obtained, while increase in the current is accompanied by the change of the colour of silver via yellow to dark brown (caused by Ag Finally, sorption ( A short review of the literature data shows various possibilities of the treatment of spent fixers, although electrolysis is mainly used to obtain metallic silver. However, it is accompanied by a gradual depletion of the electrolyte with silver ions, thus lowering cathodic current should be used to prevent incorporation of Ag Recovery of silver was carried out with spent fixer coming from one of the hospitals in Cracow (Poland). Solution contained Ag Concentration of Ag Concentrations of S 10 times diluted waste fixer was added from a burette to a definite quantity of standard iodine solution (0.088 Total amount of iodine used corresponds to the total content of both ions, S obtained in the previous step solution was then titrated with a standard NaOH solution (0.096 The amount of NaOH used during titration corresponds to the amount of iodine reacted with SO Molar concentrations of the individual ions Electrowinning of silver was carried out in a cuboid electrolyser (8 Electrowinning of silver was carried out using galvanostatic conditions, but two current modes were applied: constant current density or current density was decreased for the consecutive electrolysis stages. Electrolysis was carried out using various electrolytes: “pure” spent fixer or fixer with some addition of Na During electrolysis samples of the solution were taken (5 Cathodic deposits were observed by means of optical microscope. In order to determine sulfur contents in the cathode deposits, they were mechanically peeled off from the substrate and dissolved in hot HNO Literature data ( prevention of thiosulfate degradation by acids in the reaction: SO inhibition of the reduction of thiosulfate ions at the cathode improvement of electrochemical reduction of Ag H dissolution of Ag  Gradual decrease in the current density in the subsequent stages of the electrolysis (C and D series) improved silver recovery. In this case, the changes of Ag During electrolysis, a decrease in the S Changes of the SO  Silver electrodeposited from thiosulfate solutions was contaminated with sulfur. A review of the literature shows that most researchers believe that sulfur is present in the silver deposit as silver sulfide. However   The presence of large amounts of SO At the S  Depending on the electrolysis conditions matt white, yellowish-gray or brownish silver deposits were obtained ( Microscopic observations of the silver deposits showed that even fine grained layers were obtained from a spent fixer, while more coarse grained deposits were produced when Na According to the assumptions mentioned previously, silver sulfide in the cathode formed in the secondary reaction. Therefore, the current flowing through the system was not consumed on the reduction of Ag  The dependence of the cathodic current efficiency on the applied current density can be compared for the first stages of each of the experimental series, where the Ag During electrolysis the cathode potential was recorded. Electrolysis voltage was measured during the process. It was found that at each stage the voltage was kept almost constant, but its values varied in the range from 0.65 Electrolysis voltage It was found that the energy consumption increases with the electrolysis time from about 0.2 Research on the silver electrowinning from spent photographic fixer allowed drawing the following conclusions: efficient silver recovery is possible at gradual decrease in the cathodic current density at the subsequent electrolysis stages from an initial value of 0.1 decrease in the Ag 0.05–0.1 there is no direct relationship between Ag the highest current efficiencies (90–100%) are correlated with the cathode potential from the range of −
