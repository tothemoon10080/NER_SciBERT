Dodecylamine hydrochloride (DAHC) surfactant was used as a collector for effective apatite recovery through flotation separation in siliceous phosphate ore, wherein quartz is the main gangue mineral. The roles of pH and collector concentration were investigated, and the adsorption of the collector on the minerals and related properties were systematically studied by measuring zeta potential, contact angle, surface tension, and adsorption density. When the collector concentration was 5×10−5
                     M, 23.7% P2O5 grade was achieved for a conditioning time of 10min. However, the separation performance of the flotation was lower at pH 7 regardless of the collector concentration. Thus, more collector molecules are adsorbed on the quartz surface than the apatite surface at pH 3 and 5×10−5
                     M of collector, resulting in separation of quartz and apatite. The extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, which considers the hydrophobic interaction energy, revealed that the improved flotation performance is attributed to a hydrophobic attractive force that is a consequence of the collector adsorption. Therefore, the results of flotation of artificially mixed minerals further revealed that optimization of the amine collector concentration and pH value can selectively separate quartz from apatite.Flotation, which is a kinetic process involving 3 phases, such as solid (particles), liquid (water), and gas (air), is a widely used technique in mineral processing to recover a useful resource Nevertheless, during the flotation process, the most important step is the attachment of mineral particle to the bubble surface, as the interaction between the particles and the bubbles determines the overall efficiency of the process The phosphate ore is an important non-renewable resource and is an irreplaceable raw material for phosphorus-based fertilizers and chemicals Therefore, the purpose of this work is to investigate the reverse flotation behavior and analyze the surface forces in the interactions between the bubbles and particles (i.e., quartz and apatite) at different pH and cationic collector concentrations. The flotation performance was evaluated by micro-flotation. The surface properties of quartz and apatite were systematically investigated at various pH and with different amine cationic collectors by measuring zeta-potential, contact angle, surface tension, and adsorption density. Furthermore, the surface forces in the bubble–particle interactions were calculated by the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. Quartz and apatite used in the present study were obtained from SAC Co., South Korea and Wards Natural Science Establishment, Canada, respectively. To investigate the chemical composition and mineralogy of samples, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) (Sequential XRF-1800, Shimadzu), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (D8 HRXRD, Bruker) were performed. Specific surface area of the minerals was determined via gas physisorption at –196 The zeta potential of the particles was determined at desired conditions using an Otsuka Zetasizer ELS-Z. To measure the zeta potential, the particles for a bottle were further ground using a mortar to obtain a smaller size (<5 For micro-flotation tests, the minerals were ground in a rod mill sized at 45–75 To confirm the collector adsorption on particles in solution, the surface tension and the adsorption density were measured by the pendant drop analysis For the surface tension measurement, a liquid droplet was formed at the end of the needle with outside diameter of 0.908 The adsorption density ( To better interpret the surface forces results according to pH and DAH contents, we used the extended DLVO theory to calculate the total bubble–particle (i.e., bubble–quartz and bubble–apatite) interaction energies as a function of separation distance. The extended DLVO theory is determined by the sum of the van der Waals attractive interaction energies ( The The Hydrophobic forces were first measured by Isrealashivili and Pashley To confirm the mineral crystal structure, XRD analysis was carried out ( Fig. S1 shows the representative nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and BET surface area plot of the apatite and quartz samples; Advancing contact angle ( In general, when particles have contact angles lower than 45°, it is not necessary to consider the hydrophobic force The zeta potentials of quartz and apatite as a function of collector concentration at pH 3 and pH 7 were measured and the results are shown in The results of micro-flotation experiments of mixed minerals (apatite and quartz) at various collector concentrations are shown in According to the previous results ( In order to better understand the flotation behavior of the mixed minerals (apatite and quartz), surface tension measurements and adsorption density analysis were carried out Long chain collector surfactants are not only adsorbed at the particle/water interface, but also at the air/solution interface, thus reducing the surface tension Additionally, the adsorption density of the collector surfactant on apatite and quartz was studied at different pH and collector concentrations ( The mechanism of separation of quartz and apatite during the reverse flotation process using the amine collector at pH 3 and 7 is schematically summarized in The Hamaker constants of quartz, apatite, air, and water were determined as Based on the results of the zeta potentials for quartz and apatite with different collector contents at pH 3, the electrostatic interaction energies between air bubble and particles (quartz or apatite) calculated by Eq. The hydrophobic interaction energy between the particles and bubbles at pH 3 with different collector concentration as a function of separation distance is calculated by Eq. If the hydrophobic interaction energy is ignored (1 In this study, the roles of pH and collector concentration on the flotation separation behavior of quartz from apatite were systematically investigated. At pH 3, the separation performance improved with the increase in collector concentration, but decreased significantly at the highest collector concentration (1 This work was supported by the National Research Council of Science & Technology (NST) grant by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article:
