  Risk factors for fracture severity including demographics, medical comorbitities, BMD of hip and spine, CBTAVG, and deltoid tuberosity index were analyzed using univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent factors affecting the fracture severity.  Univariate analysis showed age, gender, medical morbidity, CBTAVG less than 6mm was related to the severity of fracture. In multivariate analysis, age and CBTAVG were the independent risk factors for fracture severity.
