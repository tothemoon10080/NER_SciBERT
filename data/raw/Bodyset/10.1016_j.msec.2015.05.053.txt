A novel calcium silicate borate Ca11Si4B2O22 ceramic was firstly prepared by the conventional solid-state reaction. In vitro hydroxyapatite mineralization was investigated by soaking the ceramics in simulated body fluid (SBF) solutions at body temperature (37°C) for various time periods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) measurements were applied to investigate the samples before and after the immersion of ceramics in SBF solution. The elemental compositions of a hydroxyapatite layer on the ceramics during the mineralization were confirmed by X-ray energy-dispersive spectra (EDS). Meanwhile, the bending strength and elastic modulus of Ca11Si4B2O22 ceramics were also measured, which indicate that the biomaterials based on Ca11Si4B2O22 ceramics possess bioactivity and might be a potential candidate as biomaterials for hard tissue repair. The bioactive mineralization ability was evaluated on the base of its crystal structural characteristics, i.e., silanol (Si–OH) and B–OH groups can be easily induced on the surface of Ca11Si4B2O22 ceramics soaked in SBF solutions.The demand for synthetic biomaterials to replace and repair bone tissue lost caused by injury or disease has significantly increased in the past ten years In recent years, more attentions have been paid to investigate new bioactive materials showing good surface HA formation ability For a bio-material used to replace and repair bone tissue, the chemical compositions of the candidate could exert important effects on its hydroxyapatite mineralization ability. Generally, silicate materials with high Ca contents possess improved hydroxyapatite mineralization in SBF solution. Ca In this work, Ca Ca To prepare the final Ca Finally several ceramic pellets with 20 Hydroxyapatite formation ability in SBF solutions is always used to evaluate the in vitro bioactivity of biomaterials for bone repair The bottle with SBF solution and Ca XRD patterns of the as-synthesized and soaked samples were taken on a Rigaku D/Max diffractometer (Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 40 The three-point bending strength (σf) and Young's modulus (E) were measured by a universal-testing machine (Instron-1195, USA) at a crosshead speed of 0.5 The as-prepared Ca  The bending strength of the Ca After each soaking, the ceramic sample was dried in an oven at 45 As observed in By the way, it seems that the diffraction peaks in  The surfaces of the ceramics become very coarse, on which some tiny sediment could be observed on the surface of Ca EDS was used to examine the elemental compositions of the soaked samples. The representative EDS spectra of two selected Ca For each socking with different days, the ion concentrations of B It has been suggested that the mineralization process in a bioactive ceramic belongs to the dissolution and deposition reaction. The prerequisite for hydroxyapatite formation on an implantable material in a living body is the presence of a type of functional groups that could act as effective sites for hydroxyapatite nucleation on its surface In the present work, Ca The linkage pattern of the BO Secondly, the bioactive properties could be due to the silanol (Si–OH) groups and B–OH groups. Actually, the structure of Ca Although the structure of Ca A new biomaterial of calcium silicate borate Ca This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the
