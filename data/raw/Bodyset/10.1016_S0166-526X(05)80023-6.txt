This chapter focuses on conventional solvent-extraction techniques used in multiresidue methods (MRMs) for the extraction of pesticides from non-fatty foods, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains. The chapter discusses the historical development of MRMs based on the use of acetonitrile, acetone, and ethyl acetate as extraction solvents. The factors affecting extraction efficiency—such as pH, the use of salts for drying solvent extracts, and the use of salts in liquid–liquid partition—are also discussed in the chapter. The chapter describes gel-permeation chromatography (GPC)—the most preferred clean-up technique in MRMs as it predominantly separates pesticides from co-extractives based on their relative molecular sizes. The differences in polarity between pesticides have no effect on their retention times on the GPC column, thus a wide range of analytes can be collected in one fraction without the need to adjust the polarity of the column eluent. In GPC, the gel is eluted clean and requires no reactivation so that large numbers of extracts can be cleaned-up in a series without the loss of efficiency.
