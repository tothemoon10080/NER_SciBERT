The separation efficiency and separation principles for Cu-Pb and Cu-Zn sulfide concentrates with conventional non-vibrating and non-pulsating HGMS, single vibrating HGMS, single pulsating HGMS, and complex vibrating-pulsating HGMS have been investigated. The experimental results show that each HGMS technology can achieve a better separation efficiency for Cu-Pb and Cu-Zn sulfide minerals. Especially by use of complex vibrating-pulsating HGMS, optimal separation efficiency could be attained.
