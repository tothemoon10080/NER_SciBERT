The dewatering of fine, flotation cleaned coals from Huaibei and Xuzhou (bituminous) and Yongcheng (anthracite) were studied. The supernatant and filter cake were examined to determine the rate and extent of flocculation and dewatering. A starch-based filter aid was used to increase flocculation and dewatering rates. The filtration constant, K, and compression index, s, of the Yongcheng slurry were measured under various conditions. A designed experiment was performed to determine optimum conditions for dewatering. The results showed that the filter aid enhanced flocculation and coagulation of the fine cleaned coal slurry, enhanced the structure of the filter cake and promoted dewatering of the cake. Moisture content in the cake was reduced to 17% after vacuum filtration.
