This research aimed to analyze the effect of fertilization of N, P and application of green manure of crotalaria to increase yield of maize plant in marginal dry land. The experiment was carried out at the dry land of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia from June to September 2013. This research was designed by using Split Plot Design. The main plot used green manures which consisted of two levels, i.e: without green manure and application of crotalaria green manure. The subplot was fertilization of N and P which consisted of three levels, without of fertilizer N and P; fertilization with a dose of 67.5kgN.ha-1+33kg P2O5.ha-1; 135kgN ha-1+66kg P2O5 ha-1. The results showed that fertilization of N, P and application of crotalaria green manure improved growth and increase the yield of maize. Fertilization with a dose of 135kgN ha-1+66kg P2O5 ha-1 with the application of Crotalaria obtained yield of maize as many as 7.234 tons ha-1 while fertilization at the same dose without the application of crotalaria obtained the yield as many as 6.172 tons ha-1.
