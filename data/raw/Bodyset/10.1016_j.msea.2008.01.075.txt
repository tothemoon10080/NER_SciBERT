Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), with simultaneous application of back pressure, has been applied to the consolidation of 10mm diameter billets of pre-alloyed, hydride–dehydride Ti–6Al–4V powder at temperatures ≤400°C. The upper limit to processing temperature was chosen to minimise the potential for contamination with gaseous constituents potentially harmful to properties of consolidated product. It has been demonstrated that the application of ECAE with imposed hydrostatic pressure permits consolidation to in excess of 96% relative density at temperatures in the range 100–400°C, and in excess of 98% at 400°C with applied back pressure ≥175MPa. ECAE compaction at 20°C (back pressure=262MPa) produced billet with 95.6% relative density, but minimal green strength. At an extrusion temperature of 400°C, the relative density increased to 98.3%, for similar processing conditions, and the green strength increased to a maximum 750MPa. The relative density of compacts produced at 400°C increased from 96.8 to 98.6% with increase in applied back pressure from 20 to 480MPa, while Vickers hardness increased from 360 to 412HV. The key to the effective low-temperature compaction achieved is the severe shear deformation experienced during ECAE, combined with the superimposed hydrostatic pressure.Alloys of Ti can have highly attractive and, in some cases, unique combinations of mechanical properties, achieved at a density approximately half that of steels. However, the production of both Ti metal and wrought Ti alloys is highly energy consuming and the resulting high cost of conventional solidification processing of Ti billets currently severely limits the potentially wider application of Ti alloys. The recent emergence of extractive processes promising lower cost Ti metal in powder form has stimulated a resurgence of interest in alternative powder metallurgy processes which might have significantly lower energy requirements and thus lower costs of production. An ideal secondary processing path might see direct net-shape forming of powder to manufactured product, most likely utilising pre-alloyed (PA) powder stock to ensure compacts with uniform composition and a high level of mechanical properties The most common of the various compaction processes for consolidating PA powder is hot isostatic pressing (HIP), in which a container filled with PA powder is hermetically sealed after an evacuation cycle and subjected to hydrostatic pressure at high temperature in a pressure vessel. The extent of sintering resulting from HIP depends on the packing density of the powder, which depends in turn on the shape and size distribution of the particles A report The present investigation was initiated to evaluate the potential for cost-effective, enhanced consolidation of pre-alloyed Ti–6Al–4V powder at temperatures of 400 The research utilised a pre-alloyed Ti–6Al–4V powder obtained by a common hydride–dehydride (HDH) technology Where necessary, heat treatment of the as-received powder was performed by encapsulating the powder in a quartz tube under inert (argon) atmosphere and heating to 730, 850 and 1065 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of as-received powder revealed individual particles to have an irregular, angular shape and roughened surfaces, with dimensions typically in the range 50–150 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out on the as-received powder in the temperature range between 20 and 500 ECAE with back pressure was performed using a specially designed unit, The vertical entry channel is 75 The green strength of the compacts was measured using a three-point bend test according to ASTM B 312-96, with the rig and test specimen scaled to 1/3 standard dimensions. Specimens were cut parallel to the extrusion direction with a length The size distribution of pores was measured by computer-assisted analysis of images obtained by light microscopy and SEM, respectively. The powder morphology, deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution were analysed using SEM (JEOL JSM-6300F at 15 The LECO analyser has been used to reveal the level of gas constituents after compaction. The feasibility of ECAE compaction of powder at room temperature was assessed by extruding at three different levels of back pressure 43, 175 and 262 Any increase of back-pressure led to improved pre-compaction in the vertical channel to an initial density of 89–91%, Representative reflected light micrographs of product extruded at room temperature, with a back pressure of 175 It has been demonstrated, in studies of hot isostatic consolidation The optical micrograph accompanying While these mechanisms, operating at room temperature, were sufficient to promote increases in the relative densities of the compacts to values in the range 95–96%, Increases in the temperature of processing beyond room temperature and up to 400 Improvements in both relative density and green strength of compacts produced by ECAE were achieved with both increasing temperature at a given level of applied back pressure, and with increasing back pressure for a given processing temperature, as shown in The green strength of compacts prepared by ECAE at 400 TEM micrographs of compacts produced by ECAE at 400 The microstructures of billets produced at different temperatures, but with a similar level of back pressure of 175  The increases in hardness that accompany increases in back pressure and/or temperature (up to 300 Pore closure and a change of pore shape under the combination of shear deformation and hydrostatic pressure experienced in ECAE has been studied previously A comparison was made of billets prepared by conventional compaction under uniaxial compression in a closed die and by ECAE at a temperature of 400 To gain some preliminary insight into the potential influence of post-extrusion thermal treatment on the structure and properties of ECAE compacts, a billet processed with a back pressure of 262 Given the evidence that plastic (shear) deformation, manifest in the form of significant changes in particle shape, plays an important role in improving powder compaction during ECAE, it is to be expected that any change in powder microstructure, such as the relative fractions of the α- and β-phase, which improve particle ductility, may potentially enhance consolidation. To explore this potential, an attempt was made to systematically vary the ratio of α/β-phase in as-received Ti–6Al–4V powder using three regimes of heat treatment: mill annealing (4 mill annealing (4 β-annealing (0.5 Scanning electron micrographs of the Ti–6Al–4V powder microstructure in as-received and one of heat treated conditions are compared in The heat-treated powders were each processed to billet by ECAE at 400 It has been demonstrated that the application of ECAE with imposed hydrostatic pressure permits consolidation of 10 Specific outcomes of the present work include: ECAE compaction of Ti–6Al–4V powder at 20 At an extrusion temperature of 400 The relative density of compacts produced by ECAE at 400 There is potential for further increase in relative density with increasing hydrostatic pressure. Equally, the effectiveness of consolidation might be enhanced by increasing the fraction of relatively ductile β-phase in the pre-alloyed powder charge. It has been demonstrated that an approximate doubling of β-phase volume fraction from 5.5% (as-received) to 10% (post-powder heat treatment) prior to consolidation leads to an increase in relative density from 98.3 to 98.9% post-compaction. Further improvement in relative density may be achieved by post-extrusion sintering under controlled atmosphere. The key to the effective low-temperature compaction achieved with ECAE is the severe shear deformation experienced by an ECAE compact during extrusion. This shear deformation promotes particle reorientation and rearrangement, and plastic conformation of adjacent powder particles, to enhance consolidation. It also produces a re-shaping of residual pores that aids closure under superimposed hydrostatic pressure.
