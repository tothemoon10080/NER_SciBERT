The leaching kinetics of extracting zinc and indium from synthetic indium-bearing zinc ferrite (IBZF) was studied and the influence of stirring, particle size, reaction temperature and sulphuric acid concentration were investigated. The results showed that the apparent particle size had no significant effect on the dissolution of the IBZF, but an increase in temperature, sulphuric acid concentration significantly enhanced the leaching efficiencies of zinc and indium. Sharp's method of half time of reaction was used for the determination of kinetic parameters and the rate controlling step. It was found that the empirical kinetic model, −ln(1−
                     α)=
                     kt applied well to the kinetics analysis and that both zinc and indium leaching were similar and controlled by chemical reaction with activation energies of 76.4kJ/mol and 68.8kJ/mol, respectively. The reaction orders with respect to sulphuric acid concentration were 0.79 for zinc leaching and 0.69 for indium leaching.Indium is most commonly found in association with zinc-bearing materials such as in solid solution in sphalerite or marmatite ( The hydrometallurgical extraction of zinc from zinc ferrite and the kinetics of acid dissolution of synthetic zinc ferrite samples have been studied by several researchers ( Because it is impossible to separate and enrich pure zinc ferrite from other minerals, the material used for this study was synthetic zinc ferrite with an indium content of about 0.3 Synthetic IBZF was prepared according to the following method. Analytical grade ZnO, Fe The sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku model D/max-2500) and all peaks matched the standard XRD pattern of octahedral structure zinc ferrite ( The leaching experiments were carried out in a 1000 Experiments carried out at stirring speeds in the range 100–800 In sulphuric acid solution, zinc ferrite reacts according to the following equation ( As shown from The influence of particle size on the zinc and indium leaching efficiencies was examined using four different particle size fractions: − The effect of the reaction temperature on the dissolution rate of IBZF was studied in the range of 70 to 90 To investigate the influence of H Understanding the mechanism of a leaching system is the main consideration. In order to determine the kinetic parameters and the rate-controlling step of the dissolution of IBZF in sulphuric acid solutions, Sharp's method of reduced half time of reaction was used to select the kinetic models ( It is possible to determine the values of the reaction half time and time for different degrees of leaching for each temperature and H In order to determine the activation energy, Eq. For indium leaching, the rate constants were slightly different and the activation energy was calculated to be 68.8 To establish the order of reaction with respect to H The dissolution kinetics of synthetic IBZF in sulphuric acid solutions is strongly dependent on temperature and H This work was financially supported by
