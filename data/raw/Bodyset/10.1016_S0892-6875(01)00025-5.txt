Absorption and desorption studies of Au(CN)2
                     - in the presence of KCN and KNCS were carried out to determine a possible way to prevent gold losses from aqeous solutions in the presence of shale materials. The results indicated that gold losses from aqueous alkaline solutions containing KCNS were less than the solutions containing KCN. Gold losses were dependent on the pH of the solution. Maximum recovery of the gold from the shale material was possible at a pH of 13 for a solution containing 5% KNCS.
