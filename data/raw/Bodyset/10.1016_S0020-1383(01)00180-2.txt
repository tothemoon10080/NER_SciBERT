Problems with conventional open reduction and internal plate fixation of distal femoral fractures are well established. These problems have been associated with extensile exposures of the fracture site. “Biological plating”, like intramedullary nail fixation, of distal femoral fractures preserves the soft tissues about the fracture, and is associated with early fracture consolidation and low rates of infection. Anatomical restoration of the articular surface continues to be the main goal in the treatment of these fractures regardless of the stabilization technique. Submuscular plating techniques, which provide for closed reduction of the diaphyseal/metaphyseal component of the fracture, have improved significantly.
