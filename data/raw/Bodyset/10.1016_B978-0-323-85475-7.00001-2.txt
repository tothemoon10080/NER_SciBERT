The elbow unites three different joints; the humeroulnar; humeroradial and proximal radioulnar joints, stabilized by strong collateral ligaments. The coronoid process is an important bony stabilizer and its integrity should systematically be checked on imaging.
               In children, ossification centers appear progressively along growth and the external condyle center fuses the last, around age 18.
               Most of elbow injuries result from a fall on the outstretched hand, less commonly from a direct impact (blow, fall on a flexed elbow). The most frequent elbow injuries are radial head fractures in adults and supracondylar humeral fractures in children. Those fractures are often undisplaced or poorly displaced, revealed only by a joint effusion or a malalignment, especially in children. Dislocations, usually posterior, affect preferentially older adults; the more severe form is the “terrible triad” with posterior dislocation, radial head and coronoid process fractures.Introduction Anatomy of the elbow Bones and joints Ossification centers Imaging strategy Radiographs CT MRI Radiographic anatomy Normal landmarks and alignments Fat pads and planes Mechanisms of injury Direct impact Fall on an outstretched hand Blow Distal humerus fractures in adults Overview Extraarticular fractures Partial articular fractures Complete articular fractures Distal humerus fractures in children Supracondylar fractures Lateral condyle fractures Medial epicondyle fractures Elbow dislocations Simple elbow dislocation Terrible triad injuries of the elbow Proximal radius fractures Radial head fractures Radial neck fractures Proximal ulna fractures Olecranon fractures in adults Transolecranon fracture dislocation Olecranon apophyseal injuries in children Coronoïd process fractures Forearm fractures Isolated shaft fractures Both bone fracture Galeazzi and Galeazzi-like fracture-dislocations Monteggia and Monteggia-like fracture-dislocations Essex-Lopresti References The imaging evaluation of elbow traumatism can be challenging because of the complex anatomy of the joint and the high frequency of subtle or undisplaced injuries The interpretation of radiographs in children are even harder because of multiple apophyseal and epiphyseal growth centers with consecutive ossification times The analysis relies on the knowledge of: frequency of injuries of the different bones ( normal landmarks normal relationships ossification sequence The elbow joint unites three bones, the humerus, radius and ulna, through three distinct joints surrounded by a common joint capsule ( the humeroulnar joint: between the humeral trochlea and the trochlear notch of the ulna the humeroradial joint: between the capitellum (or capitulum) of the humerus and the head of the radius the proximal radioulnar joint: between the radial notch of the ulna and the head of the radius Some authors consider the elbow as a structure of two columns (medial and lateral), that frame the trochlea on each side ( The distal humerus is flattened anteroposteriorly. It has two condyles (lateral and medial) and two epicondyles (lateral and medial). The lateral condyle bares the capitellum, a rounded structure that articulates with the radial head. The remaining portion of the distal humerus forms the trochlea, a spoon-shaped structure that articulates with the ulna. The epicondyles are two non-articulating ridges on each side of the distal humerus, the medial being more prominent. They are attachment sites for the flexor and extensor tendons and for collateral ligaments The distal humerus has two fosses: posteriorly, the olecranon fossa, a hollow area that receives the olecranon of the ulna during elbow extension anteriorly, the coronoid fossa that receives the coronoid process during elbow flexion The proximal extremity of the radius presents a head, a neck and a tuberosity The radial head is cylindrical and has a shallow cup (fovea) on its upper surface for articulation with the capitellum of the humerus. The circumference of the head is smooth, it articulates medially with the radial notch of the ulna, and with the annular ligament elsewhere. With the medial collateral ligament (MCL), the radial head is the primary valgus stabilizer of the elbow The radial neck is a rounded and constricted portion that supports the head. The neck is more commonly involved that the radial head in childhood fractures [ The radial tuberosity is an eminence on the medial aspect of the radius, beneath the neck. It is the attachment site for the distal tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. The proximal ulna has two processes, the olecranon and the coronoid process, and two articular cavities, the semilunar and radial notches The olecranon is a large eminence of the upper part of the ulna, that is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus during forearm extension The coronoid process is an anterior eminence of triangular shape that acts as a bony buttress to prevent posterior dislocation and is a major stabilizer of the elbow The trochlear notch is a large depression formed anteriorly by the coronoid process and posteriorly by the olecranon that accommodates the trochlea of the humerus. The radial notch is a narrow depression on the lateral side of the coronoid process that receives the circumferential articular surface of the radial head. The soft tissue stabilizers are the joint capsule and the medial (MCL) and lateral (LCL) collateral ligaments [ The capsule is attached: to the humerus, at the level of proximal margin of the coronoid fossa anteriorly and of the olecranon fossa posteriorly to the ulna, distal to the coronoid process anteriorly and along the olecranon posteriorly to the radius, below the neck posteriorly, and by merging with the annular ligament anteriorly The LCL is the primary varus and posterolateral rotational stabilizer of the elbow. It has three components the annular ligament: from the anterior the posterior margins of the radial notch of the proximal ulna, it surrounds and stabilizes the radial head the radial collateral ligament: from the lateral epicondyle to the annular ligament the lateral ulnar collateral ligament: from the lateral epicondyle to the proximal ulna The MCL is the primary valgus stabilizer of the elbow the anterior and posterior bundles: from the medial epicondyle to the sublime tubercle of the proximal ulna at the base of the coronoid process the transverse bundle At birth, distal humerus, proximal ulna and radius are entirely cartilaginous ( Ossification centers will appear and fuse sequentially, at defined ages ( Capitellum, medial epicondyle and radial head centers generally develop from a unique nucleus and have sharp margins In contrast, the olecranon and trochlea centers can have several separate nuclei, creating an initial fragmentation shape that can be mistaken for a fracture or loose intra-articular bodies ( The medial epicondyle is the most commonly affected center in trauma; its presence and position must be checked in every patient The mnemonic trick for sequential ossification is CRITOE: Capitellum, Radius (head), Internal epicondyle, Trochlea, Olecranon, External epicondyle. Radiographs are the first imaging modality in any elbow trauma Routine radiographic evaluation of the elbow includes at least ( an anteroposterior (AP) view with the elbow fully extended and the forearm supinated a true lateral view with the elbow in 90° of flexion and the forearm in neutral (thumb up) position In the setting of trauma, an oblique lateral view of the elbow, the radiocapitellar view (Greenspan view) is commonly added Indications for CT are in elbow trauma are: post-traumatic joint effusion without evidence of fractures on radiographs when a comprehensive assessment of the articular surfaces are required, for surgical planning when the reduction is incomplete, to look for intra-articular loose bodies Optimally, CT should be performed with the elbow placed above the patient head ( MRI is not routinely performed in the acute phase. In adults, it is generally ordered to status on ligaments integrity after a dislocation. In children, MRI is the modality of choice to assess the extent of transphyseal fracture or physeal injury It is of uppermost interest in elbow trauma to check whether or not the normal alignment of structures is maintained. In children, a change in alignment might be the only clue of a subtle or undisplaced injury. As the ossification is incomplete, fracture lines only involving the cartilaginous portion of bone can be undetected [ On the lateral view, the boundaries of the posterior margin of the coronoid fossa and the anterior margin of the olecranon fossa create a teardrop-like or hourglass appearance of the distal humerus above the capitellum ( A line drawn along the anterior border of the distal humeral shaft (anterior humeral line) should pass through the middle third of the ossification center of the capitellum ( On the lateral radiograph, the long axis of the humerus and the long axis of the lateral condyle form an angle of 40° ( A line drawn along the long axis of the radius should intersect with the capitellum, on any radiographic view and on any degree of elbow flexion ( In the standard AP view, the major landmark is the Baumann’s (or humeral-capitellar) angle: the angulation of the physeal line between the lateral condyle and the distal humeral metaphysis (normal range: 60-80°) ( The elbow joint has two intracapsular but extrasynovial radiolucent fatty collections, the anterior and posterior fat pads ( In the case of a joint effusion, those fat pads are displaced In the setting of trauma, an isolated fat pad displacement suggests an occult non-displaced fracture, usually a supracondylar fracture in children and a radial head fracture in adults [ In the absence of a fat pad sign, a significant articular injury is therefore highly unlikely in children [ A radiolucent fat plane located on the ventral aspect of the supinator muscle is virtually present on a normal lateral radiograph. It should run parallel to the proximal third of the radius ( The supinator fat pad can be displaced or blurred in the case of an elbow joint effusion, that generally wraps the radial neck. A displaced supinator fat plane is reported to be seen in up to 100% of the fractures of the radial head and neck, but its evaluation remains sometimes challenging Elbow injuries result from three main mechanisms: indirect trauma after a fall on the palm, direct impaction during a fall on the flexed elbow and direct blow ( In the general population, the most common cause of elbow fractures is a simple fall in the forward direction ( Like the wrist, most of the forearm and elbow injuries result from an indirect injury, a fall on the outstretched hand (FOOSH) with a reception on the palm ( The forearm is considered to be a ring structure, in analogy to the pelvis If the forearm ring remains intact, it can be pulled posteriorly to the humerus and the elbow dislocates. If a certain degree of arm hyperextension is present during the fall, the distal humerus can get involved If a valgus stress is present, the radial aspect of the humerus sustains compressive forces (capitellum and radial head fractures) while the medial aspect is distracted (medial epicondyle avulsion) ( Direct blow injuries are uncommon; they usually are isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft seen in defense against blunt trauma (“nightstick fracture”) In adults, distal humerus fractures represent approximately 2% of all fractures Fractures of the distal humerus are classified as ( Extraarticular (AO classification type A): supracondylar fractures (simple or comminuted) fractures of the epicondyles (mostly avulsion) Partial articular (AO classification type B) with persistence of some continuity between the humeral shaft and the articular segment: fractures of the articular surfaces (capitellum/trochlea): 10% of cases fractures of the condyles (lateral and medial) or transcondylar fractures: 5% of cases Complete articular (AO classification type C) with no continuity between the articular segments and the humeral shaft: dicondylar and intercondylar fractures (with T or Y shapes): 50% of cases comminuted: 30% of cases diacondylar with both capitellum and trochlea separation Extraarticular supracondylar fractures are relatively rare in adults, while they represent over 60% of elbow fractures in children ( Epicondyle fractures commonly result from an avulsion by flexor ( Condyle fractures result from an axial load transmitted either to the trochlear notch by the ulna (medial condyle fracture) or to the capitellum by the radial head (lateral condyle fracture) ( Partial articular fractures are due to shear injuries that separate the capitellum and a variable portion of the trochlea from the remaining humerus [ On the lateral radiograph, the fragment is classically displaced anteriorly and lies above the radial head. The “double arc” sign is characteristic of those fractures with one arc representing the subchondral bone of the capitellum and the other the lateral ridge of the trochlea ( On the AP view, the diagnosis is generally challenging to make and the best clue is the loss of definition of the articular surface ( Those fractures affect older patients that felt directly on the flexed elbow. The trochlear ridge of the ulna acts like a chisel against the humeral trochlear groove. The vertical fracture progresses then along the lateral margin of the trochlea. The horizontal fracture runs typically through or above the epicondyle level (supracondylar). The separated condylar fragments are pulled away and rotated under the action of the attached tendons ( Comminuted fractures are severe variants of T-shaped fractures Diacondylar fractures are fractures with a complete separation of both capitellum and trochlea ( Upper extremity fractures account for up to 75% of all fractures in children, as they try to break their fall themselves with their outstretched arms The most commonly injuried area of the upper extremity is the distal forearm and 7–9% of fractures involve the elbow The distal humerus is by far the most affected bone(over 80%) and the distribution of fractures is as follows: supracondylar fractures: 55–75% of the cases lateral condyle fractures: up to 20% medial epicondyle fractures: up to 15% Supracondylar fractures result from a FOOSH mechanism, in which the olecranon is tough to act as a fulcrum in the humeral condyles [ The fracture line can be subtle, and the only clues for a fracture may be positive fat pad signs and interruption of the anterior humeral line. Supracondylar fractures are classified according to (modified) Gartland ( type 1 fractures: nondisplaced or minimally displaced (<2 mm) generally greenstick and torus fractures, plastic bowing joint effusion (positive fat pad) ( type 2 fractures: posterior displacement with persistent contact, AHL anterior to the capitellum ( type 3 fractures: completely dislocated (no cortical contact) with extension in the sagittal plane and rotation in the frontal and/or transverse planes ( type 4 fractures: instability in both flexion and extension (the diagnosis requires fluoroscopy scanning under sedation) ( This injury occurs in FOOSH mechanisms, by either a varus force and an avulsion by extensor contraction or a valgus force with compression of the lateral condyle by the ulna Fractures can be complete (Salter-Harris type 4) or less frequently incomplete (Salter-Harris type 2). In the first situation, the fracture line commonly enters the joint at the level of the unossified cartilaginous trochlea and runs obliquely through the metaphysis. The fracture fragment is then composed of the capitellum, a lateral portion of the trochlea and a part of the lateral metaphysis ( In non-displaced incomplete fractures, the diagnosis can be challenging, as fracture lines are sometimes barely visible The medial epicondyle is the weakest structure of the immature elbow and the last ossification center to fuse with the distal humerus. In the majority of cases, forearm flexor tendons avulse the epicondyle during a FOOSH mechanism with valgus stress on the elbow A significant part of medial epicondyle fractures (up to 50%) are associated with elbow dislocations Due to the valgus force, the joint may temporarily open and the avulsed fragment may become entrapped in the joint (up to 20% of cases) An entrapment must be suspected when [ the medial epicondyle is not in its expected location, notably after a dislocation ( the ulnohumeral joint widens medially the ulnarhumeral joint is non-centered after reduction After the shoulder, the elbow is the second most commonly dislocated joint in adults. A simple elbow dislocation is definite as a dislocation without concomitant fracture The usual mechanism of elbow dislocation is a FOOSH with a forced posterior translation of the proximal forearm relative to the humerus Elbow dislocations are classified upon the displacement of the forearm in relation to the humerus. They are, therefore, in the vast majority posterior or posterolateral, while anterior or divergent dislocations are extremely rare ( During dislocation, capsuloligamentous injuries progress from the MCL to the LCL to finally involve the whole capsule After reduction, follow-up radiographs (AP and lateral views) must be repeated to secure an optimal reduction. The persistence of any “drop sign” (defined as an ulnohumeral distance over 3 mm) due to an initial joint effusion might reveal either incarcerated ligamentous tissue/loose cartilage bodies or a persistent instability secondary to severe ligamentous damage The “terrible triad injury” of the elbow is a severe disorder that associates [ a posterior elbow dislocation a fracture of the radial head (50% are displaced two-parts) or neck a coronoid fracture This injury occurs classically after a FOOSH, in which the trochlea induces a shear fracture of the coronoid (varus stabilizer) and a compression fracture of the radial head (valgus stabilizer) [ Fractures of the radial head and neck are the most common fractures of the elbow in adults, accounting for about 50% of all elbow fractures and 3% of all fractures [ They represent up to 15% of elbow fractures in children. In contrast to adults, most fractures of the proximal radius in children occur at the level of the neck [ Intraarticular radial head fractures are rare in children and adolescents because the immature cartilaginous head can absorb the load, in contrast to the weaker physis [ Most radial head and neck fractures result from low-energy mechanisms such as a FOOSH with some degree of elbow valgus Radial head (and neck) fractures are classified according to Mason ( type 1: non-displaced or fissure fracture type 2: minimally displaced (>2 mm) or angulated type 3: comminuted fracture type 4: radial head fracture with concomitant dislocation The majority of radial head fractures are isolated and minimally displaced injuries. Subtle fractures might only be seen in only one view ( The anterolateral quadrant of the radial head is most often involved. The outer cortex is interrupted, and the fragment might be depressed or slightly impacted ( Open reduction and internal fixation are generally required for fractures with an articular step-off of greater than 2 mm or involvement of more than 1/3 of the radial head surface. High-energy radial head fractures with severe displacement and high incidence of associated injuries are encountered in sports activities or motor vehicle accident ( The Essex–Lopresti injury associates an impaction of the radial head into the capitellum with rupture of the interosseous membrane and distal radioulnar joint ligaments The vast majority of neck fractures (up to 60%) are undisplaced Neck fractures typically induce an angular deformity of the head with the neck, so that any increase in concavity of the radial head–neck junction might represent a fracture [ In normal conditions, the transition between the head and neck is a smooth concave curve. In neck fractures, this curve is interrupted with a step-off at the head-neck junction, best seen on the lateral view In children, a variant of the neck fracture is the injury of the proximal radial epiphysis, usually a Salter-Harris type 2 or 3 fracture. The fragment is commonly slightly tilted but it can be found completely rotated, presumably after an episode of transient elbow dislocation [ Mason type 4 neck fractures are found in elbow dislocation ( Olecranon fractures account for approximately 10% of all elbow fractures in adults More complex fracture-dislocation patterns (transolecranon dislocation fractures, Monteggia and Monteggia-like lesions) result of an indirect mechanism such as a FOOSH. The Mayo classification is simple and reproducible [ type 1: undisplaced fractures (5% of the cases) ( type 2: displaced fractures with a stable elbow (85%) ( type 3: displaced fractures associated with elbow instability (transolecranon dislocation fractures, Monteggia and Monteggia-like lesions) (10%) ( Transolecranon fracture dislocation is a severe fracture of the olecranon in which the humerus is driven through the fracture gap The radioulnar joint is intact, while it is dislocated in the Monteggia fracture Apophyseal injuries of the olecranon occur almost exclusively in young athletes with a history of elbow overuse, in activities such as throwing or weight-bearing The normal apophysis and its separate ossification centers can be mistaken for a fracture ( Stress fractures can be challenging to detect, as radiographs can remain unremarkable for several weeks. A MR examination might be necessary to reveal the bone edema around the physis ( Isolated fractures of the coronoid are uncommon. They are generally seen in the context of elbow dislocations and fractures of the coronoid occur in up to 15% of patients with ulnohumeral dislocations Several classifications of coronoid fractures exist, the Moore classification being probably the easiest to reproduce from a radiologic point of view ( type 1: avulsion fractures of the coronoid tip type 2: involvement of less than 50% of the coronoid process type 3: involvement of more than 50% of the coronoid process The coronoid fragment usually appears as a bony piece of various sizes, generally displaced anteriorly to the humeral cortex ( As the ulna and radius are tightly linked together at their extremities by the proximal and distal radioulnar joints, the forearm can be considered as a closed osteoligamentous ring If this forearm sustained a compression load, typically during a FOOSH, the stress will be dissipated by opening the ring, generating two failure spots. Three presentations can be seen ( the load induces a fracture of the ulnar or radial shaft, it then propagates through the interosseous membrane to finally dislocate either the proximal or distal radioulnar joint (Monteggia and Galeazzi injuries). the load can involve the two shafts simultaneously, creating a both-bone fracture. the load is only transmitted along the radius axis. The radius is driven distally by breaking radioulnar joints and the interosseous membrane to finally impact the humerus (Essex-Lopresti injury). In contrast to combined forearm fractures seen in FOOSH injuries, isolated shaft fractures of either the radius or the ulna are usually the result of direct trauma ( Isolated ulnar shaft fractures are classically a consequence of a direct injury to the ulnar shaft while the arm is raised to protect the body from a blow Both-bone forearm fractures result almost invariably from a FOOSH injury during which a severe compression load is applied to the forearm ring. Fracture lines are located at similar levels along the ulna and radius shafts ( In children, bones can bow instead of breaking, resulting in a plastic bowing deformity ( Galeazzi injuries are rare and represent around 7% of adult forearm fractures The Galeazzi fracture-dislocation combines ( a radial shaft fracture in adults (or plastic bowing in kids) a dislocation of the ulnar head at the level of the wrist (DRUJ) During a FOOSH mechanism, the stress first breaks the radial shaft and then progresses distally by injuring both the interosseous membrane and the triangular fibrocartilage complex. The distal radioulnar joint is then unstable and the distal ulna can dislocate A variant of Galeazzi fracture-dislocation associates a capitellum fracture with an ulnar head dislocation. Monteggia-fracture dislocations represent only 1 to 2% of forearm fractures This injury combines ( a fracture of the proximal ulna shaft a dislocation of the radial head at the level of the elbow Both the radiocapitellar and proximal radioulnar joints are injured, allowing the radial head to dislocate The Essex-Lopresti fracture is a variant of the Galeazzi injury in which the distal radioulnar joint and the interosseous membrane are disrupted, in association to a fracture of the radial head
