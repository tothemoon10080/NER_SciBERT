We review the development of methods for the determination of dithiocarbamate fungicide residues in foodstuffs. We discuss all available methods, from colorimetric carbon-disulfide methods to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry. Our main focus is on the relevance of analytical methods with respect to routine use for food control and efficiency in meeting the requirements of current European legislation.LC-APCI-MS (positive-ion mode) Chromatography: Tosoh TSK-GEL-2500 GPC-column eluent: methanol Calibration graph in the high range of 2–20 mg/L High LOD LC-ESI-MS (negative-ion mode) Chromatography: Inertsil ODS-80A column (RP-18) eluent: acetonitrile/water (gradient) Sample preparation: by Gustafsson and Fahlgren method EBDs: mancozeb maneb zineb LOD: mancozeb 0.043 mg/L Recoveries at sub-ppb: 79% (RSD 29%) Extraction with chloroform Derivatization with methyl iodide (carcinogen) High RSD (29%) LC-APCI-MS (positive-ion mode) Chromatography: C8-column eluent: methanol/water (gradient) Sample preparation: chopping and homogenization matrix solid-phase dispersion with Carbograph, elution with dichloro- methane/methanol (80:20, v/v) Neutral DTCs: dazomet disulfiram thiram Metabolites: ETU PTU avocados cherries lemons nuts oat oranges peaches rice tomatoes LOQs: dazomet 0.5 mg/kg disulfiram 2.5 mg/kg thiram 2.5 mg/kg ETU 0.25 mg/kg PTU 0.25 mg/kg Recoveries at LOQ and 10xLOQ: 33–109% Unsatisfactory for fruits with high acid content (orange and lemon), thiram/disulfiram not recovered Unsatisfactory for nuts, disulfiram not recovered High RSD: 4–21% LC-APCI-MS Chromatography: Luna C18-column eluent: methanol/water (3:2, v/v) Sample preparation: treatment with alkaline EDTA/cysteine derivatization with dimethyl sulfate solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges tap water river water LOQs: DMD 0.2 μg/L EBD 0.11 μg/L Recoveries from distilled water at 0.25–5.0 μg/L: DMD 63% EBD: 74% LC-ESI-MS (negative-ion mode) Chromatography: ZIQ-pHILIC column eluent: acetonitrile/10 mM ammonia (gradient) Sample preparation: extraction with alkaline buffer (sodium hydrogen carbonate/DL-penicillamine) DMDs EBDs PBDs tomatoes grapes cucumbers rucola LOQs for tomatoes: DMDs 0.04 mg/kg EBDs 0.05 mg/kg PBDs 0.04 mg/kg Recoveries at 0.01–0.9 mg/kg: 90–100% (RSD 2%) Multi-analyte method No derivatization No clean up LC-ESI-MS Chromatography: column: no information eluent: no information Sample preparation: extraction with EDTA/cysteine methylation with methyl iodide clean up with C EBDs mancozeb maneb zineb nabam metiram apples grapes tomatoes lettuce wheat onions LOQs for apples, grapes, and tomatoes: 0.01 mg/kg Recoveries from lettuce, wheat, and onions at 0.01 mg/kg: 79–104% No multi-analyte method Use of methyl iodide (carcinogen) LC-ESI-MS Chromatography: ZIQ-pHILIC column eluent: acetonitrile/10 mM ammonia (gradient) Sample preparation: extraction with alkaline buffer (sodium hydrogen carbonate/DL-penicillamine) DMDs EBDs PBDs tomatoes grapes cucumbers apples pears cherry tomatoes papaya broccoli cocktail tomatoes tamarillos LOQs for tomatoes: DMDs 8 μg/kg EBDs 3 μg/kg PBDs 5 μg/kg Recoveries from tomatoes at 0.05–1 mg/kg: 97–101% (RSD 3%) Multi-analyte method No derivatization No clean up Introduced 40–70 years ago, dithiocarbamate fungicides (DTCs) still represent an important class widely used in agriculture. They are characterized by a broad spectrum of activity against various plant pathogens, low acute mammal toxicity, and low production costs. In combination with modern systemic fungicides, they are also used to manage resistances and to broaden the spectrum of activity. It therefore came as no surprise that the so-called “maneb group” (zineb, maneb, mancozeb, propineb, metiram) were some of the most frequently detected pesticides in the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, and that this group also had the highest frequency in exceeding maximum residue limits (MRLs) Besides agriculture, DTCs are largely used as slimicides in pulp and paper manufacturing, wood preservatives or vulcanization accelerators in the rubber industry, which may also be a critical source of non-residual contamination of food and feed samples during handling. Furthermore, DTCs are also used clinically for the treatment of chronic alcoholism and as anticancer and antitoxic drug agents DTCs can be categorized into three sub-classes depending upon their carbon skeleton [i.e. dimethyldithiocarbamates (DMDs), ethylenebis(dithiocarbamates) (EBDs), and propylenebis(dithiocarbamates) (PBDs)] ( Concerning chemical structures, dazomet is exceptional, and is used as soil sterilant (precursor of methyl isothiocyanate) as is metam, whereas DTCs are typically applied to the aerial parts of plants. DTC analysis was first reviewed by Engst and Schnaak, who covered the situation up to 1973 Szolar Our aim is to provide a comprehensive overview from the point of view of residue analysts with special emphasis on methods, that have had a practical impact in routine residue analysis of DTCs in food and feed. Without sodium salts, EBDs and PBDs forming polymeric chelates are almost insoluble in both water and organic solvents ( Apart from problems associated with solubility, there is another big problem in terms of low stability of DTCs in the presence of plant matrix. Especially when coming into contact with acidic plant juices, DTCs rapidly degrade, since free dithiocarbamic acids do not exist and will decompose into carbon disulfide (CS Against this background, for decades, DTC-residue analysis used hot-acid digestion, collecting evolving CS However, specific MRLs are increasingly set by European legislation for certain fungicides to be determined as they are applied (i.e. thiram, ziram, and propineb) With respect to the non-extractability of DTCs from homogenized plant samples, the development of residue-analysis methods used CS Following a method used in the rubber industry for the determination of vulcanization accelerators, first attempts used iodometric microtitration after absorption of evolved CS The first modifications were introduced by Cullen Concerning erratic recovery results for some DTCs and DTCs in presence of certain crops (tobacco, cottonseed, apricots, cereals), especially those having a relatively high organic sulfur content, which interfere with CS While in former studies diluted sulfuric acid was used for DTC hydrolysis, Keppel introduced hydrochloric acid (1.6 M) and added tin(II) chloride as reducing agent, which significantly improved recoveries of different DTCs from different crop samples. A first collaborative study found that Keppel’s method worked well, but disclosed some variables to be respected and to be investigated In following years, the method was adopted by official methods in many countries (e.g., the ‘DFG method S 15’ introduced in 1979 by the German Pesticides Commission Concerning special variables during the analysis, heating rate has to be especially respected. Clarke et al. reported that EBD can decompose yielding only one mole CS To determine CS The copper reagent meets its limit when residues below 0.1 mg/kg are to be determined, as is essential for dietetic food, including baby food, as well as for control of ‘organic’ food. DFG method S 15 needs to use a methanolic potassium hydroxide reagent, if it is to determine <50 μg CS During these studies, different pairs of scrubbing reagents were also tested So far, the digestion/distillation apparatus has comprised an assembly, horizontally mounted in series ( A ground-breaking new design was published by Caldas et al. Later, Schwack et al. presented a vertical digestion/distillation system, using two ‘solid-phase extraction’ (SPE) sintered glass-bottomed scrubbing traps arranged in a vertical set-up and filled with boiling chips wetted with sodium hydroxide solution (50%) and concentrated sulfuric acid, respectively CS To confirm spectrophotometric results and to replace spectrophotometry, evolved CS McLeod and McCully were the first to report an HS-GC method using both 10 M sulfuric acid and 4 M hydrochloric acid/tin(II) chloride for hydrolysis, but they found unsatisfactory recoveries for EBDs Following the method of McLeod and McCully, but heating the flask at 80°C overnight, Van Haver and Gordts found good correlation between Keppel’s method and HS-GC, both applied to 95 salad samples The British Panel on Determination of Dithiocarbamate Fungicides recommended 1.5% tin(II) chloride/5 M hydrochloric-acid solution and a water bath of 80°C for hydrolysis, under which conditions recoveries were satisfactory Ahmad et al. While these attempts – also adopted by a European norm The method is also used (e.g., by Zurich Cantonale Laboratory However, for hot-acid digestion inside a HS vessel, it is not only CS The procedure was re-evaluated and introduced as routine by the Central Science Laboratory, using trimethylpentane as extraction solvent, thus replacing the HS procedure HS-GC-ECD can also be used for confirmation of a spectrophotometric result. For example, a 4-mL aliquot of xanthogenate reagent solution was transferred to an HS vial, internal standard (ethyl bromide) and sufficient 0.35 M sulfuric acid (6 mL) were added, and the sample analyzed for liberated CS For residue analyses in general, nice recoveries do not demonstrate that one can correctly analyze real samples. During a proficiency test with incurred DTC residues in dried grape leaves, the best results were obtained with the xanthogenate method (median 3.44 mg/kg, RSD 36%), while the results obtained by different GC methods were significantly lower and accompanied by larger latitude (median 1.88 mg/kg, RSD 73%) In addition to the CS DTCs are non-systemic fungicides, so their residues remain on only the surfaces of fruits and vegetables Gustafsson and Fahlgren determined thiram, ziram, and zineb by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) on a reversed-phase column (Nucleosil RP-18) after two separate extraction techniques. Thiram was extracted by chloroform and directly injected into HPLC. Zineb and ziram were extracted from the surface of the crops with aqueous alkaline EDTA/cysteine solution; subsequently, the DTC anions were extracted into an organic solvent as ion pairs with tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and derivatized with methyl iodide in one step Many years later, Lo et al. used the same method, but for the analysis of EBDs (zineb, maneb, mancozeb) and PBD (propineb) in formulated fungicides only. EBD fungicides were distinguished by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) Bardarov et al. were the first to apply ion-exchange LC for determination of propineb (technical product) in air after aspiration through a filter and surface extraction of the filter with an aqueous alkaline EDTA solution, but they did not validate the method and apply it to food samples Ion-pair LC methods applying tetraalkylammonium salts [i.e. cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), tetrabutyl ammonium chloride (TBAC) or tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS)] have often been reported in literature. Irth et al. determined zineb and maneb in soil after extraction with an aqueous alkaline EDTA solution and selective pre-concentration as ion-pairs on a C18-pre-column, which was loaded on-line with CTAB Dhoot et al. separated metam-sodium and its metabolite, methyl isothiocyanate, in tap water and raw surface water on a strong anion-exchange column with methanol/buffered water containing 10 mM CTAB as eluent Determination of ziram residues on spinach by ion-pair LC using aqueous solution containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM TBAC as eluent was published by Atienza et al. with methanol/aqueous EDTA solution and subsequent liquid-liquid partition with hexane as clean up; and, with supercritical carbon dioxide containing methanol as organic modifier. Recoveries at high fortification levels obtained by extraction procedure b) were generally lower than those by a), especially when sample weights >0.25 g were used. At a fortification level of 0.7 mg/kg, recoveries of 96% and 20% were determined using method b) for 0.25-g and 1.0-g samples, respectively. Additionally, recoveries decreased with increasing fortification levels for method b). However, extraction method a) was not affected by sample amount or fortification level. LODs of approximately 0.05 mg/kg were reported. Applying ion-pair LC with chemiluminescence detection, Nakazawa et al. determined mancozeb and propineb in cucumbers and apples Van Lishaut and Schwack were the first to determine all three DTC sub-classes [i.e. DMD (ziram, ferbam), EBD (maneb, zineb, mancozeb), and PBD (propineb)] by a rapid ion-pair LC method with UV and electrochemical detection Three years later, Perz and Schwack reported an improved method using a new alkaline-stable reversed-phase column (XTerra RP18) and increased the stability of DTCs in alkaline-sample extracts by adding cysteine Aulakh et al. published an HPLC-UV method for the determination of thiram and thiourea in wheat grains and in a commercial fungicide (Thiram 75 WP) Garcinuno et al. determined maneb and its main metabolites [ethylenethiourea (ETU), ethylenebis(isothiocyanate) sulfide (EBIS) and ethyleneurea (EU)] in tomatoes, which were chopped and extracted using a mixture of acetonitrile, dichloromethane, and chloroform Özhan and Alpertunga also published a method for determination of maneb and its main degradation product (ETU) in different fruit juices using two reversed-phase columns (Luna CN and C18) with different retention mechanisms Compared to LC-UV, LC-MS is quite rarely reported in the literature ( Based on sample preparation and derivatization with methyl iodide introduced by Gustafsson and Fahlgren Several LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)-MS methods in positive-ion mode have been reported. Moriwaki et al. presented an LC-APCI-MS method for the determination of ziram, but only standards dissolved in chloroform (2–20 mg/L) were separated on a GPC column Blasco et al. also published an LC-APCI-MS method, which referred to the determination of neutral DTCs only (i.e. thiram, dazomet and disulfiram, including ETU and PTU) in different plants Crnogorac and Schwack published an LC-MS method for all three DTC sub-classes (i.e. DMD, EBD, and PBD) using a new alkaline-stable polymeric HILIC (hydrophilic interaction LC) phase and a simple mobile phase comprising acetonitrile and aqueous ammonia (10 mM) Concerning both selectivity and sensitivity, LC-tandem MS (LC-MS Hayama et al. determined fungicide polycarbamate in tap water and river water by LC-APCI-MS Brewin et al. published an LC-MS Employing an LC-MS Over the long period of usage of DTC fungicides, method development of residue analysis has been continually improved in terms of selectivity and sensitivity. Whereas digestion/distillation methods combined with spectrophotometry have the longest history and are still practically quite important, activities were especially initiated to introduce more rapid methods to circumvent distillation and result in HS-GC techniques, that are also having a practical impact. LC-MS and LC-MS Very recently, new rules for EU-harmonized MRLs for pesticides in food were published In addition, some DTCs were not included in Annex I In our view, there is at present no chance to control unauthorized fields of application as well as to control residues of distinct DTC compounds, so residue analysis of DTC fungicides faces quite a challenge to fulfill the requirements already regulated by European legislation, while still lacking potential analytical or validated methods. However, with the development of new column materials to be used effectively for LC separation of DTCs and detection by MS, we have clearly set out opportunities within the field of DTC-residue analysis. They promise very sensitive analyses while avoiding false-positive results, as reported for CS
