The present study aims to validate photogrammetry technique to reproduce geometrical volumes of objects from cultural heritage preservation sector. In this case, the objects are two ingots from “La Tortilla de Linares” foundry, which were found in the English Channel. For this purpose, two 3D dimensional measurements, photogrammetry and 3D scanning, have been carried out, using 3D scanning technique as reference. For obtaining photogrammetric data, a semi-automatic prototype developed by CETEMET, has been used. The results obtained with this technique are promising. This, along the advantages of the system make it a great alternative in 3D measurements in this type of pieces.
