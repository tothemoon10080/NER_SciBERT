The effect of aluminum content on the mechanochemical behavior of ternary system Al–B2O3–C to fabricate Al2O3/B4C composite was investigated. A mixture of boron oxide powders along with different amounts of aluminum and graphite was activated in a ball mill. The value of Al content varied from 2mol to 7mol compared to the stoichiometric mole ratios (4mol). Thermodynamics evaluation indicates that the value of Al content in the mixture plays a key role and overall reaction enthalpy and adiabatic temperature altered by variation of aluminum and carbon content. Experimental findings revealed that at low aluminum content (2mol Al), aluminothermic reaction proceeded in gradual mode and no carbothermal reduction took place. Increase in Al content up to 3mol led to a change in the mode of aluminothermic reaction to MSR (mechanically induced self-propagating reaction) and gradual occurrence of carbothermic reaction. By increasing the amount of Al (10/3–4mol Al), aluminothermic reaction provided sufficient heat for activating endothermic carbothermic reduction; hence, both reducing reactions happened simultaneously. Further increase in Al content (7mol Al) led to gradual aluminothermic reaction and excess Al acted as inert matrix.Due to high melting point, excellent hardness, low specific density (2.52 Hot-pressing and Self-propagating High Temperature Synthesis (SHS) techniques were investigated to fabricate Al Recently, reduction of many metallic oxides by solid aluminum reducing agents (aluminothermic reduction) has been significantly investigated. Having studied the effect of metallic aluminum powder on the production of boron carbide–alumina composite In addition to aluminothermic reaction, solid state carbothermal reduction of B Aluminothermic reduction of B The main purpose of the present work is to investigate the effect of Al amount in Al–B The general form of the total reactions taking place in ternary system Al–B It is believed that this reaction includes two stages: first, reduction of 2B    In the above reaction,   The precursor materials were aluminum (Merck, 99.7% purity, particles size 40 The precursor materials were milled in a planetary ball mill for various times at room temperature. Details of ball mill machine and milling conditions are given in For determination of remaining boron oxide content, at first, the obtained powder was weighed and taken as W XRD analysis was carried out using Cu-Kα radiation to identify different phases of the starting powders and mechanically alloyed powders. The diffractometer (Philips X-ray diffractometer) was operated at 40 The reaction process and features were also investigated by Thermal Gravimeter (TG model BÄHR 503). A small amount of reactants weighing about 50 Although the interpretation of thermodynamic behavior of in situ solid state reactions such as mechanical activation is not completely studied, using some usual thermodynamic relations could help to know the basic information about reactions and to estimate their behavior during the process. Where C Thermodynamic calculations were carried out based on two assumptions: (a) milling container vessel was sealed and isolated (b) the only possible phase in carbide formation reaction is assumed to be B Positive standard enthalpy of formation at 298 Depending on the milling conditions and enthalpy of reaction, mechanochemical reactions fall into two categories: progressive reaction and mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR) Calculated adiabatic temperature as a function of Al content is shown in In this work, the change in the remaining B A thorough explanation of the synthesis of ceramic matrix nanocomposite Al Also, the absence of tangible change in the amount of the remaining B In this case, the amount of aluminum content in the Al–B Based on thermodynamics calculation, it was expected that ternary mixture of Al:B Absence of free-carbon residue after a 4 According to a data from Apparently, the elemental boron B produced by aluminothermic reaction reacts with remaining C to form B But, no peaks corresponding to the formation of aluminum borate phase was observed in XRD pattern of sample milled for 4 In order to confirm the obtained results, three samples with 10/3, 11/3 and 4 In the sample with the composition Al:B However, regarding Gradual increase in carbothermal reduction may be related to the following reasons: (i) decrease in the diffusion distances by accumulation of defects and creation of fresh surface and distribution of particles during the ball milling process (ii) local temperature increase caused by heat generated from aluminothermic reaction, and (iii) uniform distribution of C powder. There is no trace of peaks corresponding to aluminum borate in XRD patterns of this case at various times (  Presence of peaks corresponding to Al in XRD pattern (  Formation of AlB As mentioned before, Al can act as a diluent to decrease T Considering reaction mechanism, the summary of the discussion is shown schematically in Both thermodynamic calculations and experimental findings revealed that Al amount, within a range of 2–7 Thermodynamic calculations indicate that by increasing Al amount from 2 to 4 Based on the value of Al in the Al–B  With 2 With Al content in the range of 3–10/3 With Al content in the range of 11/3–4 With 7
