This paper explains optimum arrangement of gauge tools and corner cutting picks for cutting head design of roadheaders. Full-scale simulation of roadheaders cutting heads of practical types with a wide range of tilt angles was carried out through laboratory linear cutting experiments. The trials showed that optimum tilt angle for corner cutting picks was approximately equal to the half breakout angle of the rock, and corner cutting picks acted as gauge tools after this value. Tilt angles greater than the optimum value were not recommended for both gauge and corner cutting picks, due to poor cutting efficiency and tool holder problems. Higher specific energy was found when the order of cutting sequences of unparalleled axis tools (the gauge tools) was arranged to start cutting from nose side of the cutting head than that of the opposite direction. The parallel axis tools on roadheaders cutting heads were, however, understood to be not affected by the order of cutting sequences. Furthermore, the effective area method which was previously suggested for tool force calculation of parallel axis tools was also verified for unparalleled axis tools investigated in this research study.Roadheaders have been widely employed in tunnelling operations in soft and medium-strength rock formations, as well as being used in mining and civil engineering. There are a number of parameters affecting performance of roadheaders. Among them, tool lacing or cutting head design which involves a proper arrangement of cutting tools on cutting heads of any geometry is very important for a successful performance ( The mechanics of cutting was well-summarized by Groove deepening (multi tracking arrangement) was emphasized to be inefficient and therefore not recommended ( Total number of tools generally depends upon both the type and the dimension of the cutting head, as well as tool spacing and depth of cut. Higher number of picks are recommended for roadheaders to obtain good-balanced cutting condition, provided that lines of picks do not cut simultaneously ( The circumferential pick spacing and angle of wrap have influence on the magnitude of individual tool forces, as well as cutting balance. The aspects of circumferential tool spacing were studied with respect to the number of cutting sequences, and possible combinations of angle of wraps for roadheaders and drum shearers were defined ( Research on the order of cutting sequences, i.e. whether the leading tool in a given sequence (spiral) starts to cut either from machine side or from corner side, is remarkably limited. Researches on tilt angles, gauge tools and corner cutting is also very small. The kinematics, dynamics and energetics of rock cutting machines were well investigated by Cutter arrangement of helical cutting mechanism based upon rock cutting theories was studied in consideration with rock and tool parameters ( In the published literature of tool lacing with drag picks, the author has found no comprehensive research work with conclusive findings on the dynamics and energetics of the gauge and corner cutting picks. Likewise, there is no extensive study comparing the order of cutting sequences, i.e. whether the cut should start from the free face (machine side) or from the corner (nose). This paper investigates aspects of gauge and corner cutting picks for cutting head design of roadheaders, through extensive laboratory linear cutting trials. Full-scale laboratory simulation of numerous roadheader cutting heads of actual size was carried out for corner cutting tools with tilt angles ranging from 20° to 90°, respectively. Each cutting head was also simulated for two different orders of cutting sequences (i.e. starting from free face to corner and vice versa), respectively. The results are presented and discussed with an analytic approach, in details. Optimum conditions for both gauge and corner cutting picks were defined, and a rational comparison of the order of cutting sequences is given. The laboratory full scale rock cutting trials were carried out by using a 0.66 m instrumented shaping machine with in-line thrust force of 50 kN, at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne in England ( A total of eighteen axial-type roadheader cutting heads of actual size were simulated. The maximum diameter of the cutting head considered for simulation trials was 0.44 m, due to the fact that cross-head of the experimental shaping machine could not be extended beyond this value. This diameter is in close proximity to those of equivalent practical cutting heads which is 0.50 m. Each cutting head was fitted with a total of 16 tools which are laced in two starts (two cutting sequences) in an overlapping pattern, with one tool per line (single tracking) concept. The circumferential spacing between the picks on the entire cutting head was kept constant. The advance per revolution of the cutting head was 12 mm, considering the capability of the shaping machine. The ‘spacing to depth ratio’ was taken as 3 (corresponding to 18 mm), with special regard to the finding of the first part of this research investigation which were conducted for parallel axis tools absolutely with the same rock, tool and experimental conditions ( A hemi-spherical cutting head combined with cylindrical body was considered in order to obtain a wide range of tilt angles from 0° up to 90°. Tilt angles of gauge tools and corner cutting picks were the only variables investigated under the same machine and operating conditions. The all parameters related to cutter tool, rock type and operating conditions were, therefore, kept constant throughout the simulation trials. The cutting heads for full-scale simulation trials were, then, constructed as shown in When cutting from machine side to nose, both cutting and normal forces measured for gauge tools exhibited a slow decrease at lower tilt angles and then diminished abruptly towards the higher tilt angles ( When cutting from nose towards the machine side, tool forces and specific energy for gauge tools exhibited higher values up to around 65 The average breakout angle obtained from unrelieved grooves cut on flat rock surface was measured to be 67.5°. Variation of measured parameters with tilt angles may be better explained if the relative cutting position of each tool on a given cutting head or a drum is evaluated. This may be achieved by constructing a ‘cutting (breakout) pattern’ which is the arrangement of cross sections of cuts formed by combining the cutting sequences with the spatial position of each tool tip during revolution of cutting head. The breakout pattern of the cutting heads which were simulated when cutting from machine side to nose is given in A breakout pattern of parallel axis tools which are located between the points F1 and A1 (as in         For parallel axis tools of this arrangement, the cutting perimeter is in the form of a straight line, and the cross-sectional areas swept by these picks are constant. Furthermore, the angle between the cutting head profile and the cutting perimeter, depicted as      The difference between the extent and the shape of the trajectories of the order of cutting sequences also indicates that the tool parameters when cutting from machine side to nose are likely to differ from that of opposite direction. By adopting a similar analytic approach, the above-mentioned tool parameters when cutting from nose to machine side may, then, be expressed as follows; The tool parameters may now be calculated through the equations derived above. The values of the angle It is very important to note that the tool forces when cutting from nose to machine side are greater than those of the opposite direction, despite the fact that they sweep the same cross-sectional areas in both cutting modes under identical conditions. This situation may be explained by comparing the relative cutting position of picks for each cutting mode. A similar issue was also the case with previous work, where different tool forces were exhibited, even though the picks which were arranged in groove deepening and relief cutting modes swept the same cross-sectional areas under equal conditions. This point was explained by adopting ‘Effective triangular area’ method based upon the value of breakout angle for a given condition ( The results indicate that the value of 67° tilt angle where the minimum specific energy occurs is the reference point for the corner cutting picks. It means that the cutting action is inefficient at any tilt angle before or beyond this value. This situation may be explained by the cutting action of point attack tools or heavy-duty radial picks with ridged base. The pick intends to form a ‘V’ shaped groove with respect to the position of its axis at the point where it hits the rock on a vertical plane perpendicular to the cutting direction ( Based upon this concept, the cutting positions of corner cutting tools at various tilt angles, as observed during the simulation trials are illustrated in The results indicated that the optimum tilt angle for a corner cutting tool corresponds the half breakout angle obtained from an unrelieved groove cut on a flat rock surface of a rock for a given tool and cutting condition. This research study demonstrated that the order of cutting sequences considered for cutting heads or cutting drums, can start either from machine side or nose side, provided that the last pick of the gauge tools, known as corner cutting pick, is positioned at a tilt angle not less than the half breakout angle of the rock as defined in this study. Tool forces and specific energy for parallel axis tools whose axes are perpendicular to the cylindrical surface of drum shell or conical surface of cutting head boss, do not change with the order of cutting sequences, whilst the opposite is true for gauge tools. With larger diameter axial-type cutting heads, the cut generally starts from nose to machine side in order to satisfy loading requirements, as well as to ease the clearing of cut material during sumping. However, with transverse type cutting heads this may not be necessary to a certain extent, since the cut may start from either side. In practice, during the manufacturing stage, it is generally difficult to place the tool holders at their predetermined location on the nose section of a cutting head, due to limited area in this portion. Overlapping of tool-holders is an important problem frequently arising from this issue. Previous underground trials on axial-type roadheaders demonstrated that the picks and tool-holders located around the frontmost line of the cutting head are very prone to damage, and utmost care should, therefore, be paid when lacing tools of this type ( The clearance ring cutters fitted on continuous miners which are extensively employed for underground in-seam tunnelling operations are of typical gauge tools which are generally arranged to cut from nose side by many manufacturers. The order of cutting sequences in the clearance ring cutters may also be arranged to start from machine side. This aspect was investigated during underground production operations at the above-mentioned coal mine in Turkey with shearer drums which exhibit very similar lacing to those of cutting drums ( Within the experimental conditions and the limits of the parameters described in this study, following conclusions may be drawn: Optimum tilt angle for corner cutting picks was found to be approximately equal to the half breakout angle of a rock material for a given condition. Higher specific energy would occur if the corner cutting picks are not positioned at this optimum tilt angle. The corner cutting picks are relieved and behave like gauge tools after this value. Specific energy for gauge tools was found to increase drastically after this optimum tilt angle. It may be beneficial to set the maximum tilt angle for both gauge and corner cutting picks at the half breakout angle of the rock material in order to obtain better cutting efficiency, increased tool holder protection and convenient manufacturing process for cutting heads. Higher pick forces were exhibited with gauge tools at tilt angles below the value of optimum tilt angle, when the order of cutting sequences was set to cut from the nose side of a given cutting head. Parallel axis tools such as vane picks on shearer drums and picks on the conical or cylindrical surface of cutting heads were not affected by the order of cutting sequences, i.e. cutting may start either from machine side or nose side. ‘Effective area method’ that was previously suggested for tool force calculation was also validated for unparalleled or tilted picks.
