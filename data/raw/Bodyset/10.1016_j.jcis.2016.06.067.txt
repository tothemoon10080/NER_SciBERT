In present study, heterojunctioned Bi2O3/BiOCl (BO/BOC) was synthesized via in situ chemical reduction and oxidation of BiOCl nanoplates. BiOCl was reduced to metallic Bi in KHB4 solution followed by oxidation in H2O2 solution to produce BO/BOC. The BO/BOC was supported over graphene sand composite and also on chitosan using wet impregnation method to report BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT nanocomposite. The morphology and compositional characteristics of BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT were investigated by FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, FTIR, XRD, EDX, RAMAN, BET and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectral analysis. The photocatalytic activity of BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT was performed for mineralization of ampicillin (AMP) and oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotics under solar light. The adsorption process had significant effect on photodegradation of AMP and OTC. The adsorption of both OTC and AMP onto BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT followed pseudo second order kinetics. Simultaneous adsorption and degradation process (A+P) resulted in higher degradation rate of investigated antibiotics. The applicability of power law model indicates the intricacies of mineralization process. During A+P process, OTC and AMP were mineralized to CO2·H2O, NO3

                     2− ions. Both BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT exhibited significant recycle efficiency.From the perspective of contemporary environmental photocatalysis, solar light assisted photocatalysis is emerging as a promising technology for the purification of wastewater In recent years among Bi based photocatalyst, BiOCl has gained more and more attention as a promising photocatalyst for photocatalytic energy conversion and environmental remediation On the other hand Bi Merely, photocatalytic activity of photocatalyst does no guarantee its applicability as an efficient photocatalyst. The complex filtration process and highly agglomerated turbid solution are major bottlenecks associated with nanosized nanoparticles for large scale water purification process Chitosan, a non-toxic, biocompatible and abundant biopolymer has emerged as an outstanding absorbent for heavy metals, organic and inorganic pollutants This research was focused on the synthesis of Bi Graphene sand composite (GSC) was prepared with modification in previous reports BiOCl was prepared using modified hydrolysis method The formation of Bi The adsorptional and photocatalytic activity of BO/BOC/GSC, BO/BOC/CT and BO/BOC was evaluated using double walled Pyrex vessel (ht. 7.5 The amount of antibiotic adsorbed onto catalyst surface is calculated by Eq. The pH of zero point charge was determined by previously reported method  The FESEM micrographs of pure river sand are shown in For further investigating the morphology of BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT, TEM images of samples are given in EDX spectra of sand (river sand), GSC, CT, BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT were recorded for elemental analysis. The EDX pattern of river sand confirmed the presence of Si, P, O and Cl as major element (Supplementary S1). In GCS, presence of carbon along with Si, P, Cl and O indicates the stacking of graphene with river sand FTIR analysis was used to detect main functional groups in BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT.FTIR spectra of GSC, CT, BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT are revealed in In chitosan spectrum, absorption band at 3429 UV–visible diffuse reflectance analysis and Tauc plots of BO, BOC, BO/BOC BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT are shown in Raman spectroscopy is an important technique to characterize carbonaceous materials. For the preparation of BOC nanoplates, citric acid was used as a capping agent that affected the nucleation, growth pattern and self-assembly of BOC nanoplates The catalytic efficacy of both BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT was verified for the removal of ampicillin and oxytetracycline antibiotics present in aqueous phase. During OTC removal, 86 and 90% of removal efficiency was observed for BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT, respectively. While in dark, 41 and 25% of OTC was adsorbed onto removal for BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT, respectively. The kinetic data for OTC and AMP adsorption onto BO/BOC/GSC, BO/BOC/CT and BO/BOC is represented in The initial pH of reaction solution affects the adsorption of liquid phase pollutants onto the surface of solid catalyst. The association/dissociation of surface functional group can be described by surface charge for electrostatic interaction and reactive sites for catalyst and antibiotic The photodegradation of organic compounds in aqueous is a surface phenomenon To explore the kinetics OTC and AMP degradation using solar light assisted BO/BOC/GSC/A From above discussion, it can be concluded that overall OTC and AMP photodegradation using BO/BOC/GSC/A During long term photocatalytic process, reaction kinetics is an important parameter to understand the overall antibiotic degradation process. The real degradation process can be represented as the combination of two parallel branches namely, photocatalysis and photolysis (Eq. When excited by solar light, the transition of electrons from valance band to conduction band of BiOCl resulted in generation of electron-hole pair To probe the role of hydroxyl radicals during photo degradation process, degradation experiments were conducted with hydroxyl radical scavenger On the basis of characterization and A The recycle efficiency of both BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT was probed for OTC and AMP removal. Both BO/BOC/GSC and BO/BOC/CT were separated from reaction solution through simple sedimentation process (30 Adsorbent supported photocatalysis is emerging as a potential wastewater treatment technology.
