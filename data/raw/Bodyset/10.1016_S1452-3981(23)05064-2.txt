In a present paper the results of pure metallic silver electrochemical recovery from the solution obtained by two-steps of chloride leaching process of Lubin, Poland copper flotation concentrate are discussed. Potential-controlled electrolysis (PCEl) was used as a promising method of silver electrochemical recovery from low concentration complex composition aqueous solutions. The studied solution contained approximately 50 mg/L of silver. The electroreduction of silver was studied using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry in two and three electrode configuration systems. The effect of several factors such as potential, time of electrolysis on selectivity of silver reduction was studied. Based upon conducted experiments the conditions of pure silver powders cathodic electrodeposition using PCEl method were determined.
