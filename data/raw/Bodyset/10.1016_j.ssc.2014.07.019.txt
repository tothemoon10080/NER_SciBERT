Polypyrrole (PPy) embedded RuO2 electrodes were prepared by the composite method. Precursor solution of RuO2 was coated on tantalum sheet and annealed at 260°C for 2.5h to develop a thin film. PPy particles were deposited on RuO2 films and dried at 80°C for 12h to form composite electrode. Microstructure and morphology of RuO2/PPy electrode were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Our results confirmed that counter ions are incorporated into RuO2 matrix. Structure of the composite with amorphous phase was verified by X-ray diffraction. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy reveals that during grain growth of RuO2/PPy, PPy particle size sharply increases as deposition time is over 20min. Electrochemical properties of RuO2/PPy electrode were calculated using cyclic voltammetry. As deposition times of PPy are 10, 20, 25 and 30min, specific capacitances of composite electrodes reach 657, 553, 471 and 396Fg−1, respectively. Cyclic behaviors of RuO2/PPy composite electrodes are stable.Electrochemical capacitor or supercapacitor is known to store energy by two different mechanisms. The first is associated with separation of electronic and ionic charges at electrode/electrolyte interface and is named as the double-layer capacitors. The second involves absorption or insertion of electro-active species into solid phase accompanied by charge transfer processes, and is named pseudocapacitors Thus the objective of this paper is to combine the high specific capacitance of RuO Tantalum (99.95 Tantalum sheet (∅27 Pyrrole monomers (0.1 RuO Existence of RuO XRD pattern of RuO SEM images of as-prepared electrode samples at different deposition times (10, 20, 25 and 30 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of RuO Galvanostatic charge and discharge for RuO The stability of RuO Amorphous RuO
