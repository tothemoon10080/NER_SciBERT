One of the major tasks of material scientists and engineers is to increase the strength of engineering materials. Particularly under the current pressure of carbon emission, automotive and aerospace industries not only require materials with high strength, but also need lightweight in order to improve the fuel efficiency through weight reduction. Thus, light alloys, aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys in particular, have attracted increasing interest to these industry sectors. To date, the highest yield strength reported for aluminium alloys is up to 1,000 Recently, Lu and co-workers Lu and co-workers This new work can be considered as groundbreaking. Firstly, it has successfully increased the size of materials near theoretical strength from previous nanometre scale to micrometre scale. Although the Mg-based SNDP-GC alloy fabricated has only 10 Although the strengthening mechanism was well-discussed in the paper The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.
