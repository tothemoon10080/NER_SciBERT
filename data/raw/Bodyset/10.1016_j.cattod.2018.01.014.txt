Ni-MnOx-Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (SDC) composites are synthesized and investigated as anode materials of solid oxide fuel cells fed with methanol. The lowest anodic polarization resistance is obtained when the molar ratio of Mn to Ni is 0.05:0.95. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the transfer of electrons from Ni to Mn and the increase of the content of the lattice oxygen in the anode. The single cell with that anode and SDC-carbonate composite electrolyte exhibits a maximum power density of 722 mW cm−2 at 700 °C. Mn also increases the resistance to carbon deposition of the anode due to the high lattice oxygen content and the redox cycle of the Mn species. The stability of the single cell is enhanced with the increase of the content of Mn in the anode.Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are one of the most promising devices for the direct conversion of chemical energy in fuels into electric power [ The Ni-based cermet has been considered as the most promising anode material for SOFCs fed with H Recently, Chen et al.
