Lithium compounds have many applications in industry, but the use is limited by the rarity of lithium in the earth's crust. Lithium is abundant as a trace element in seawater and in brines of salt lakes, but the exploitation is prevented by the high cost of extraction. Traditional methods of salt exploitation by fractional crystallization are not applicable in exploiting lithium in Dead Sea type of brines. Experimental methods can extract only small amounts of lithium and the costs are so high that the lithium so obtained cannot be marketed for profits. Hsü recognized that the problem of exploiting lithium from brines lay in the difficulty of separating a magnesium precipitate from the brine progressively enriched in lithium. Hsü invented an “assembly line” method. The residual brine of seawater or salt lakes after potassium exploitation is commonly supersaturated with magnesium chloride. Such brine can be induced to flow boustrophendonically in an evaporating pond—Helminthoid evaporator—that consists of a series of parallel troughs. Experiments carried out in the laboratory and in the field to verify the applicability of Hsü's method had found that the lithium compounds thus produced can be marketed for profit. This chapter finally concludes that the Hsü method is the only method so far that can be applied to extract lithium economically from brines in salt lakes of the Dead Sea type.
