The NdNi5 alloy was prepared via a direct electrochemical reduction of a solid mixture of NiO–Nd2O3 in molten LiCl. The effect of the cell voltage, reaction temperature, and mixture composition on the electrolysis has been determined in terms of the reducibility of Nd2O3. The reduction of the oxide mixture begins with the reduction of NiO to Ni, followed by the reduction of Nd2O3 on the pre-formed Ni particles to form the intermetallic NdNi5. The content of NiO in a NiO–Nd2O3 pellet is important in order to achieve a high reduction degree in the oxide mixture.Recently, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) has been widely used in rechargeable batteries as a power source for electric vehicles due to its higher electrochemical capacity, long lifecycle, and good overcharge/discharge characteristics The electrochemical reduction process of pure and mixed oxides to pure metals, alloys, or intermetallic compounds in molten salts has potential to be more economical and energy-saving for many metallurgical industries Although there are numerous advantages in the electrochemical reduction process, the electrochemical reduction of rare earth oxides remains difficult because rare earth metals have high oxygen affinity and extremely high thermodynamic stability In our previous study Nd In the experiments, anhydrous LiCl (purity ≥98.2%, Samchun, South Korea) was used as the electrolyte, and an MgO dense crucible was used to contain the electrolyte. An electrolysis cell was installed in a glove box, which was thoroughly controlled with high purity Ar gas. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a potentiostat (PGSTAT302N) in a three-electrode cell. An oxide particle (approximately 3 The electrochemical reduction of the oxide pellet was performed through applying cell voltages of 2.4–3.2 Although a carbon anode was used in the present work, the thermodynamic data of pure NiO, Nd  Constant voltage electrolysis was performed in order to prepare the NdNi  Although Δ As the applied voltage increased from 2.8 to 3.2 Therefore, the formation reactions of NdNi In order to investigate the reduction process at a higher temperature, a constant voltage electrolysis was conducted in molten LiCl at 750 The SEM-EDS analyses of the reduced pellet were performed in order to observe the surface morphology and identify the components after introducing 50%, 100%, 150%, and 200% of the theoretical charges in the molten LiCl at 750 Based on the data of the consumed charge integrated from the I-t curve and the mass of the obtained product, the energy consumption for the preparation of NdNi In order to determine the influence of the Nd:Ni ratio on the reduction process, mixed oxide pellets with different Nd:Ni atomic ratios were used as cathodes.  In this study, an electrochemical method for Nd–Ni alloy synthesis was proposed. The NdNi This research was supported by a grant (
