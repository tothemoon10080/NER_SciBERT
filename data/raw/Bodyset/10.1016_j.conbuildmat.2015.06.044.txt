Permanent deformation (or rutting) is one of the common distresses occurring in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. HMA is predominantly composed of aggregates and asphalt binder; and the asphalt binder plays a significant role in the HMA performance including permanent deformation and rutting resistance. In order to characterize the properties of the asphalt binder related to HMA rutting, the Superpave performance grade system uses the high-temperature grade, which is determined based on the complex shear modulus (|G

                      is not a performance-based parameter. Therefore, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed a performance-based PG binder test, the Multiple Stress Creep and Recovery (MSCR) test, to supplement the conventional DSR high temperature test. The primary objective of this laboratory study was to compare the two asphalt binder tests (the MSCR and the DSR high-temperature grade) and two HMA rutting related performance tests (the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test [HWTT] and the Repeated Loading Permanent Deformation [RLPD] Test) for characterizing the asphalt binder high temperature properties relative to HMA permanent deformation and rutting performance. For the asphalt binders and HMA evaluated, the MSCR showed a better correlation with the two rutting related performance tests (HWTT and RLPD) than the DSR high temperature grade. Thus, the MSCR test results shows promise to supplement or serve as a surrogate to the existing DSR test in characterizing the asphalt binder high temperature properties that are related to HMA rutting. However, more lab testing and field validation is still warranted to complement the results and findings reported herein.Simple and fast Good correlation with HMA rutting performance tests (i.e., HWTT and RLPD) Provide both non-recoverable and recoverable properties of asphalt binders Higher variability Data analysis consumes more time than DSR high temperature grade test Simple Good repeatability and low variability simple data analysis methods Inputs for Mechanistic-Empirical (M-E) models Time consuming (one sample needs about 1 Poor correlation with HMA rutting performance tests (i.e., HWTT and RLPD) Provide only linear elastic properties of asphalt binders Permanent deformation (or rutting) is one of the major distresses occurring in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements, which typically manifests itself as surface depressions along the wheel paths on the pavement surface. Among other potential problems, rutting can lead to poor ride quality and may cause hydroplaning with a high potential for traffic accidents. While, typically, the total pavement rutting can be a combination of the permanent deformation contributions of the individual layers (e.g. HMA, base, subgrade, etc.), this study focuses only on the HMA rutting. The primary mechanism of HMA rutting is shear deformation caused by large stresses applied to the upper portions of the HMA layers due to repeated traffic loading, particularly at elevated temperatures HMA is predominantly composed of aggregates and asphalt binder, and the asphalt binder plays a significant role in the mixture performance including rutting resistance. In order to characterize the property of asphalt binder related to HMA rutting, the Superpave performance grade system uses the high-temperature grade, which is determined based on the complex shear modulus (| The MSCR is a creep and recovery performance test conducted on asphalt binder samples. The test can characterize both the recovery and non-recovery compliances of the asphalt binder. Several studies Nevertheless, the current specifications are still based on the | The MSCR, DSR high temperature grading, HWTT, and RLPD test methods are illustrated in The MSCR test is a creep and recovery test performed on the asphalt binder sample using the DSR in accordance with AASHTO TP 70-10 The DSR is an AASHTO (M 320) standardized test used to characterize both the elastic and viscous behaviors of asphalt binders at intermediate to high temperatures The HWTT is most widely used to screen and discriminate the rutting resistance of mixes in the laboratory as it is a simple method to directly measure the rut depth in the compacted HMA specimens (as shown in The RLPD test was used to characterize the permanent deformation properties of HMA under repeated compressive haversine loading at a frequency of 1.0 Two asphalt binder tests (the MSCR and DSR) and two HMA performance tests (the HWTT and RLPD) were utilized in this study. As listed in This study focused on Type C and SMA because they are some of the most commonly used HMA in Texas for conventional flexible pavements, in particular the SMA for surface rutting and crack mitigation This section presents the laboratory results of the MSCR, DSR high-temperature grading, HWTT, and RLPD tests. However, it should be noted that these results and findings pertain only to the HMA materials and test conditions defined in this study. Therefore, the overall conclusions may not be exhaustive. MSCR testing includes two phases of creep and recovery in one cycle. In the creep phase, the strain increases rapidly with the loading time. In the recovery phase, the strain initially recovers quickly followed by a lower rate as illustrated in As can be seen in The  The RLPD test is widely used to characterize the permanent deformation properties and rutting resistance of conventional dense-graded mixes. However, the test may not be applicable to SMA mixes. Some studies have reported that the unconfined RLPD test, at high test temperatures, was not appropriate to sufficiently measure and capture the permanent deformation properties of SMA mixes that have high stone content, forming a gap-graded stone structure with high viscosity bituminous mastic, which is different from conventional dense-graded mixes Similar to the observation with the HWTT test results at 50 This section presents: (1) a comparative analysis of the test results, (2) comparative ranking of the HMA based on the four test methods evaluated, and (3) graphical correlations for the laboratory results. A comparative summary of the DSR and MSCR test methods is also presented and includes the following: (1) variability and repeatability, and (2) a comparison in terms of their advantages, applications, and challenges. In order to compare the MSCR and DSR test for evaluation of rutting resistance of HMA, the HWTT is used as a benchmark in the HMA ranking and correlation analysis. Based on the data previously presented, a comparative ranking of the HMA, in their decreasing rank order of predicted superior performance in terms of laboratory rutting resistance, is summarized in In  As stated previously, the RLPD test is also used to characterize the permanent deformation and rutting resistance of HMA in the laboratory. In Note that as stated in the preceding text, previous studies by these authors had yielded a good correlation between the RLPD at 40 This subsection provides a one on one comparative assessment of the DSR and MSCR test methods. Aspects assessed include variability, test repeatability, advantages, applications, challenges, and limitations of the test methods. Both the MSCR and DSR high temperature grade test are performed on the same-size asphalt binder sample in the same equipment (the DSR). However, some differences should be noted that the DSR high temperature grade test is a strain-controlled test that enables the response of the asphalt binder to be in the linear viscoelastic range while the MSCR test is a stress-controlled test that captures both the visco-elastic and visco-plastic responses of the asphalt binder. As can be seen from  The key findings and recommendations are summarized as follows: Although the DSR high-temperature grade based on The MSCR test is dependent on the temperature and loading stress levels. The The The study also showed that the HWTT is consistent with the RLPD for evaluation of the rutting resistance of HMA in the laboratory as both tests have exhibited good correlations with the MSCR test results. The COVs for the MSCR test are much larger than the DSR high temperature grade test in most cases that may be attributed to the stress-controlled mode resulting in large-strain deformations. However, this aspect needs further investigations. For the asphalt binders and HMA evaluated, this study has shown that the MSCR test has promising potential to supplement or serve as a surrogate to the DSR high-temperature grade based on Because of its good correlations with the HWTT and RLPD tests as was evident in this study, the and Disclaimer The authors thank TxDOT for their financial support and all those who helped during the course of this research work.
