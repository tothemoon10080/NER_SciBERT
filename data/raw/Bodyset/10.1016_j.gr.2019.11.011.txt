Investigation of gold metallogeny in the Paleozoic Meguma terrane (Canada) is conducted through LA-ICP-MS analysis of arsenopyrite collected from eight slate-belt style vein gold deposits using a novel approach integrating elemental distribution maps and their derived elemental paragenesis with multi-element binary plots. The data reveal two distinct gold events: 1) an early event characterized by a Co-Ni-Mo-Sb-Se elemental association related to initial growth of arsenopyrite that reflects the presence of invisible gold (>10 ppm); and 2) a second event, spatially associated with late fracture sets, that is characterized by an Al-Ti-V-Mn element association and reflects either remobilization or upgrading of primary invisible gold and is manifest as visible gold.
                  The results of this study indicate a complex and protracted history of gold mineralization which has important ramifications for the Meguma gold deposits, as well as other orogenic gold districts globally. In the case of the Meguma Terrane, it involves an initial gold event that is followed by element mobilization and, in the case of precious metals (Au, Ag), an upgrading through a zone refining process. In addition, the variable coupling and decoupling of elements is only revealed using in-situ derived LA-ICP-MS data.The Meguma Terrane of Nova Scotia (Canada) part of the larger Appalachian Orogen of eastern North America, hosts numerous orogenic gold deposits that equate to the slate-belt-hosted lode gold deposit type (e.g., The nature of these deposits has been well documented by various studies which, in addition to regional- and deposit-scale studies, includes structural analysis, lithogeochemistry, geochronology, stable (C, O, H) and radiogenic (Sr, Pb) isotopes, and fluid inclusions, as summarized by A considerable advance in our understanding of the complex evolution and paragenesis of many gold deposit settings, such as multi-stage mineralizing events and/or remobilization, has been revealed through integration of classic petrographic and imaging methods (e.g., EMPA, SEM-EDS) with quantitative laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) element distribution analyses (i.e., maps, traverses, spots) of Fe In order to further assess the gold metallogeny of the Meguma terrane, that is the potential source(s) of gold and mineralizing fluid(s) plus the nature of the gold events, we present the results of LA-ICP-MS mapping of grains and traverses of arsenopyrite combined with treatment of these data using the TSD approach for several gold deposits (see The Meguma terrane of southern Nova Scotia (Canada) defines the most easterly allochthonous part of the Canadian Appalachian orogenic belt ( The basement of the Meguma terrane (i.e., substrate to the Meguma metasedimentary rocks) is not well documented and remains equivocal. At the supracrustal level, some workers ( The Meguma lode‑gold deposits discussed below are present throughout the metasandstone dominant Goldenville Group with a few also at the base of the overlying, mudstone dominant Halifax Group ( The auriferous veins are generally dominated by a simple quartz ± carbonate ± sulfide mineral assemblage ( Given the similar settings, vein paragenesis, and fluid chemistry, as constrained by isotopes (S, O, D, C), fluid inclusions (i.e., aqueous carbonic, X As noted above, arsenopyrite is a common sulfide phase in the Meguma deposits in both mineralized and barren veins and in adjacent wall rock. Representative examples from among the various deposit sites are shown in As noted above, arsenopyrite is a common sulfide phase in the Meguma deposits in both mineralized and barren veins and in adjacent wall rock. Representative examples from among the various deposit sites are shown in  Arsenopyrite grains mounted in pucks or as polished thin sections were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS in Laurentian University's Chemical Fingerprinting laboratory. Areas of the sulfide grains free of mineral inclusions (i.e., other sulfides, oxides, silicates, visible gold) and with minimal amounts of fractures were selected for analysis in either raster or traverse mode, with the former providing the element maps referred to below. The selected areas were ablated with a Resonetics RESOlution M-50, 193 nm wavelength, 20 ns pulse duration ArF excimer laser ablation microprobe employing a Laurin Technic two-volume sample cell ( The raw data were quantified using the trace-element data reduction scheme of Iolite 3 ( The raw data were quantified using the trace-element data reduction scheme of Iolite 3 ( Element maps were stitched together using Iolite's “Image from Selections” functionality ( The analyses were performed on euhedral arsenopyrite grains with element distribution maps acquired for samples from the Beaver Dam, The Ovens, Dufferin, Touquoy and Cochrane Hill deposits, whereas element distribution traverses were acquired for samples from the Upper Seal Harbour, Tangier and Caribou deposits. Arsenopyrite grains were sampled from bedding parallel quartz veins, except for The Ovens, which were hosted in metasiltstone adjacent to a bedding parallel vein. The samples used for LA-ICP-MS analysis were are examined in both reflected light and also using the scanning electron microscopy coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM–EDS). Quantitative LA-ICP-MS element distribution maps and traverses ( We first note in regards to the elemental maps and related elemental paragenesis, that despite being located in different stratigraphic settings with respect to both potential facies variation and host-rock relative age in the Meguma stratigraphy, the studied samples and hence deposits reveal a very similar elemental paragenesis. The euhedral arsenopyrite grains studied show an early enrichment in Co, Ni, Te, Se, Mo, and Sb ( Selenium, Mo, Sb, and to a lesser extent Ni and Te all show similar distribution patterns, which either mimic or locally overprint the zoning of the host arsenopyrite. This elemental distribution also reflects a primary feature. Traverse and some map analyses show that the putative earlier background concentrations of Au appear to be relatively antithetic to Mo zonation (e.g., Beaver Dam, The Ovens, Touquoy, Cochrane Hill, and Caribou deposits; Several events that post-date the primary growth of arsenopyrite discussed above are recognized in all the samples, as illustrated by: 1) an early Bi, Pb, Cd, In, Se, Ag, Au and locally Zn (i.e., Beaver Dam, Touquoy and Cochrane Hill, Caribou deposits; Several events that post-date the primary growth of arsenopyrite discussed above are recognized in all the samples, as illustrated by: 1) an early Bi, Pb, Cd, In, Se, Ag, Au and locally Zn (i.e., Beaver Dam, Touquoy and Cochrane Hill, Caribou deposits;  The evaluation of original Au distribution in arsenopyrite (i.e., the primary gold event) and its potential upgrading can be assessed using binary element plots of Au versus Ag, which are further enhanced using color coding, as a proxy for concentration, for single elements or element associations ( The first group, illustrated by Beaver Dam and Touquoy deposits ( The first group, illustrated by Beaver Dam and Touquoy deposits ( A second group, which includes The Ovens and Dufferin deposits ( A second group, which includes The Ovens and Dufferin deposits (  Based on the observations for the various binary element plots discussed above, at least two distinct gold events are identified: 1) the first is associated with primary sulfide growth and reflects a continued Au input, at times increasing until the latest stage of arsenopyrite growth (i.e., coincident with Mo-Se-Sb endowments); and 2) a second event, which varies in its gold tenor and is similar (Beaver Dam and Touquoy) or dissimilar (other deposits) regarding its Au:Ag ratio and is associated with an Al-Ti-V-Cr-Mn elemental assemblage. This latter association reflects upgrading of the tenor of Au and is seen in all the deposits along with a good correlation between primary and late-stage secondary element associations (e.g., Importantly, strong to good correlation between Bi-Pb-Cd-In and Al-Ti-V-Cr-Mn element associations with respect to Au ( Quantitative element distribution data from traverses, rather than elemental maps, were acquired for samples from the Upper Seal Harbour, Tangier and Caribou deposits. These data show elemental distributions similar to those seen in the Beaver Dam and Touquoy deposits ( Quantitative element distribution data from traverses, rather than elemental maps, were acquired for samples from the Upper Seal Harbour, Tangier and Caribou deposits. These data show elemental distributions similar to those seen in the Beaver Dam and Touquoy deposits ( In this study, arsenopyrite samples from several gold deposit sites across the Meguma terrane of Nova Scotia were studied in order to constrain several important aspects of gold metallogeny in general and metasedimentary-hosted deposits specifically. The application of data derived from element distribution maps, element profiles based on traverses, and a variety of multi-element plots using TSD data derived from continuous LA-ICP-MS analysis provides the basis for addressing several important issues that pertain to the nature of the gold mineralization: 1) elemental paragenesis and element associations; 2) nature of gold and its possible remobilization or upgrading; 3) significance of the Au:Ag ratio; 4) possible wall-rock influence inferred from the whole-rock, isotopic and mineralogical data bases; and 5) the implications of the data for the source of gold and gold mineralizing processes in a gold metallogenic province. The integration of petrographic observations and SEM-EDS imaging with the elemental maps and the traverses together with the multi-element plots provide the basis for establishing elemental paragenesis. Comparison of the paragenesis of the eight studied deposits indicates very similar features and suggests their common evolution and thus strongly argues for a similar fluid history ( The arsenopyrite grains studied reveal a protracted and complex growth history with two very distinct early mineralizing episodes (i.e., primary events). An initial stage of primary growth is reflected by oscillatory changes in the Co-Ni(-Te) contents during the initial stage of arsenopyrite nucleation and subsequent development. This type of zonation has been reported in other studies of arsenopyrite (e.g., Thus, the integration of the elemental maps with ore petrology and SEM-EDS observations provide evidence for ore-system longevity and complexity, in this case across an entire metallogenic terrane based on our sampling (regarding geochemistry of the arsenopyrite grains). The establishment of such elemental associations and paragenesis has not previously been possible and, as shown here, provides the means to demonstrate a commonality to mineralizing processes among similar ore deposit settings within a given metallogenic terrane. The previous use of bulk-rock chemistry via traditional whole-rock analysis is clearly flawed in terms of establishing elemental associations, as illustrated by the complexities revealed in the elemental maps shown above. Elemental paragenesis established from both the element distribution maps and traverses and the derived Au versus Ag plots using the TSD data suggest two distinct gold events: 1) the first is evident from the presence of invisible gold or inferred nanoparticles; and 2) the second is seen as an association of Au enrichment, sometimes as visible particles, with an Al-Ti-V-Cr-Mn elemental association concentrated along fractures (i.e., the F2 set). The first Au event coincided with the growth of arsenopyrite, which was monitored by using Ni and Co as proxies of primary growth. In this early stage of arsenopyrite, gold is inferred to have been deposited either as invisible gold (e.g., The second Au event shows higher gold contents, but is variable in its tenor ( Two additional points are noted in the context of these two gold events. Firstly, for both of the events identified, the Au:Ag ratio is uniform at 10:1 in some of the deposits, which is a common value in orogenic gold deposits and must therefore be reflective of a geologically meaningful and relevant process (e.g., Independently, the Au versus Ag plots show Au-rich versus Ag-poor values (i.e., In addition to the two gold events noted above, a third event is identified based on the Bi-Pb-Cd-In-Ag elemental association in the Au As discussed previously, the Au versus Ag plots from the studied deposits indicate that, where best defined by the abundance of data, the two gold events (i.e., primary versus secondary) show similar Au:Ag ratios of 10:1. This observation is consistent with the fact that both gold events likely relate to similar metamorphic processes and similar fluid compositions (i.e., an aqueous carbonic composition, X Independently, the fluid responsible for the Bi-Pb-Cd-In-Ag element assemblage shows variable Au:Ag ratios that range from 1:10 to 1:10000. This Ag event is not associated with new introduction of Au in the system, but only with remobilization of Au of the first gold event. Importantly, it should be noted that the Au:Ag ratios observed could potentially also be influenced by systematic resampling of previously ablated material in the form of ejecta or condensate on the sample surface. However, each dataset includes a minimum of 28,000 data points (i.e., Cochrane Hill dataset) and each deposit shows an internally consistent trend and ratio values. Thus, the demonstrated consistency of the Au:Ag ratios of the analyzed materials is considered to validate the interpretations presented herein. The influence of the immediate wall rock to mineralized veins and, at a broader scale, the host stratigraphy on the geochemical signature of the mineralizing fluids has previously been discussed for the Meguma gold deposits based on extensive analysis of δ In order to further assess the influence of the immediate host stratigraphy on the arsenopyrite geochemistry, a compilation of whole-rock geochemical data from the western part of the Goldenville and Halifax groups ( It has been noted in earlier discussions of the Meguma gold deposits (e.g., Quantitative element distribution maps and traverse analysis of arsenopyrite grains from eight bedding-condordant quartz vein systems in the Lower Paleozoic Meguma gold deposits localized through the Meguma terrane (Nova Scotia, Canada) have been used to a investigate a variety of aspects of these gold deposits. The integration of the element maps, petrography and SEM-EDS imaging and analysis with time slice domain (TSD) provide a new and powerful means to assess elemental paragenesis in these and other gold system globally. Meanwhile, the TSD data provide a means to examine the geochemical signature of the sulfide analyzed and also the chemical evolution of the mineralized system. Importantly, the methodology used in this study is equally applicable to other (i.e., non‑gold) hydrothermal ore deposit settings. In this study elemental paragenesis was first determined for each deposit setting. Results indicate that, despite covering a large geographic area (i.e., 300 km long) and several deposits, the paragenesis is similar and hence it follows that like fluids and processes operated across this terrane. Since the samples used reflect two distinct thermo-tectonic events (i.e., regional metamorphism and widespread felsic(-mafic) magmatism), the results imply that fluids with similar metal contents can be generated at more than one time, which has important implications for gold metallogeny. The use of the TSD provides the means to generate meaningful multi-element diagrams. The Au versus Ag plot is used to track Au mineralization and in this case two or more gold events are recognized. The early gold event has up to 100 ppm Au present in the sulfides, likely as invisible Au or nanoparticles. The subsequent gold events are recorded by an upgrading due to zone refining of the early Au with it either having a similar Au:Ag ratio or a much higher one. This plot also revealed a distinct Ag rich event with associated Bi-Pb-Cd-In association. This study represents the first application of LA-ICP-MS mapping to gold metallogeny by studying representative samples across a large part of a gold mineralized terrane. Whereas some of the interpretations may be controversial, the results clearly demonstrate that the method has the potential to provide insight into processes not previously possible. It is hoped that this project provides the impetus for other such studies to be undertaken both in gold deposits and other hydrothermal settings.
