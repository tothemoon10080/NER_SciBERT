The ability to measure dielectric properties over wide ranges of frequency, which was developed for agricultural applications, attracted interest from the mining industry, so efforts were made to provide assistance in solving some of the problems facing that industry. Thus, research findings on dielectric properties relating to mining interests are included. Dielectric properties of coal and coal–pyrite mixtures were measured to identify frequencies for selective heating of pyrite to enhance magnetic separation for reducing pollution from burning coal. Also, dielectric properties of 10 pulverized and purified mineral samples were measured from 1 to 22GHz to provide information useful in research on rock fragmentation by microwave heating for recovery of minerals. Microwave dielectric properties of pulverized coal and limestone samples were measured in support of mine safety research for the prevention of explosions, and a resonant cavity technique was developed for measuring coal–limestone dust mixture proportions. Dielectric mixture equations were tested, and their utility was extended in conducting this research. Coal has been an important energy source in the past and is expected to be essential for energy requirements many years into the future. However, environmental problems are associated with the use of coal, especially in the burning of coal with high sulfur content. Current coal beneficiation technology does not permit the separation of finely disseminated pyrite microcrystals from coal. Improved methods for removing pyrite would help in meeting air pollution control standards. One potential method involves finely grinding coal and using magnetic separation techniques. Heating coal can enhance the magnetic susceptibility of the pyrite ( For identification of the best frequency ranges for selective dielectric heating of the pyrite, information on the frequency dependence of the dielectric properties of pyrite and coal was needed. Suitable coal samples were obtained for measurements of dielectric properties over a range of frequencies. Materials were obtained as fresh face samples at the coal mines, processed through jaw crushers and roll mills, and air-dried before being pulverized to pass through a US Standard 6O-mesh sieve. Coal from five coal beds or mines was selected for study. The pulverized samples were separated by heavy-media gravitational techniques to obtain materials with high and low pyrite contents, and the fractions were oven-dried before measurement of dielectric properties. Dense fractions containing most of the pyrite consisted of materials that sank in a liquid of 2.0 specific gravity (designated 2.0 Sink), whereas light fractions (designated 1.3 Float) floated in a liquid with a specific gravity of 1.3. The 12 samples selected for study included run-of-mine (ROM) samples and The dielectric properties of the pulverized coal samples from identified sources were measured at 22°C over the frequency range from 1 Similar measurements of the dielectric properties of 18 coal samples from different mines, separated into ROM and light and dense fractions, were made over the same frequency range ( The dielectric properties of the 18 pulverized coal samples were measured over the frequency range from 1 Several studies have shown that the magnetic susceptibility of pyrite can be enhanced by heating ( Research was conducted on microwave heating of coal containing pyrite at 2.45 Additional research was conducted on selective heating of pyrite in coal and magnetic separation before and after 2.45-GHz microwave heating ( Under the US Bureau of Mines program of advanced mining technology, new and more efficient ways of rock fragmentation and mineral processing were being investigated. Methods were being developed for extracting the desired components and for remote internal heating for rock fragmentation ( These properties are also essential in modeling electromagnetic wave propagation and interaction in layered earth problems (gas and oil exploration), remote sensing of ore deposits ( Pulverized samples of 10 minerals, which are major or minor minerals common to rocks and ores being investigated for their response to microwave heating, were prepared for determination of dielectric properties ( Several samples were easily concentrated by hand at very coarse sizes, whereas others required gentle crushing and screening, followed by tedious and careful handpicking. Concentrates were carefully rechecked to remove any remaining middlings and tailings. Then they were gently Dielectric properties of the pulverized mineral samples were measured at 24°C and at frequencies of 1.0, 2.45, 5.5, 11.7, and 22.0 Dielectric properties for the ten minerals, amphibole (richterite), chlorite (clinochlore), feldspar (labradorite), mica (muscovite), mica (phlogopite), pyroxene (salite), goethite, hematite, ilmenite, and manganese oxide (hollandite) were published for five different bulk densities and the solid minerals, along with complete descriptions, chemical analyses, and particle-size distributions ( Measurements at 24°C at frequencies from 1 to 22 Interest in the permittivities or dielectric properties of coals and minerals arises from their influence on electromagnetic wave propagation in exploration ( Measurements of permittivities were made on pulverized samples of Pittsburgh coal, rock dust (limestone), and a 35–65% mixture of coal and limestone ( Pulverized samples of Pittsburgh coal and limestone (more than 90% calcium carbonate), with most of the particle diameters ranging from 5 to 100 Particle densities Results of the permittivity measurements and sample bulk density determinations on the coal and limestone samples are shown in It was shown earlier ( The necessary value for The cube roots of the dielectric constants of the three pulverized samples (see Linear regression analyses showed very high coefficients of determination ( Since the point ( When the linear regression of the cube root of the dielectric constant on bulk density, provides an Values provided by the regression equations for the dielectric constants of the three material samples are given in The mean values of the solid material permittivities calculated with the Landau and Lifshitz, Looyenga mixture equation for the permittivity measurements at each bulk density, as illustrated for coal in Permittivity values for the pulverized coal in It is interesting to check the One can note that the Values of both the dielectric constants and loss factors of coal and limestone were sufficiently different to justify further studies aimed at determining rock dust content in coal and rock dust mixtures by dielectric sensing techniques. Rock dusting in coal mines is required to reduce explosion hazards by providing at least 65% noncombustible content in the combined coal dust and other dust in the mines ( At 11.7 Resonant cavity measurement techniques are convenient for measuring the relative dielectric complex permittivity Pulverized samples of Pittsburgh coal and limestone (greater than 90% calcium carbonate), with most particle diameters ranging from 5 to 100 The resonant frequency of the empty rectangular-waveguide cavity was 2.473 A series of resonant cavity measurements was taken to provide a calibration curve. Powdered coal–limestone mixture samples of 0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% coal were used to develop the calibration curve as shown in The performance of the calibration was checked with additional coal–limestone mixture samples prepared with 10% increments for the 0–60% coal range. The tests showed that the proportion of coal in the mixtures was determined with a standard error of performance of 1.8%. Thus, the resonant cavity measurement technique, based on the resonant frequency shift
