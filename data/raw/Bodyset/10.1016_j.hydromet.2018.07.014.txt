Two kinds of precipitation processes: ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media and ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media from the stripping solution of N235-P507 synergistic extraction system were investigated. Both of them were found to be feasible for the high-efficient and selective extraction of vanadium from vanadium-bearing shale combined with N235-P507 synergistic extraction system. During the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media, the crystal of sodium vanadates formed in the vanadium precipitate and the purity of the V2O5 product was affected when Na was 23 g/L. The vanadium precipitate was washed by 2% NH4Cl solution after ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media and high quality product contained 98.431% V2O5 was obtained by the calcining of refined vanadium precipitate. During the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media, Na had no significant effect while P had a great impact on the precipitation rate and purity of V2O5 product. After P was removed by MgSO4, the precipitation rate of vanadium was more than 99% and purity of V2O5 product was 99.761% by the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media.Vanadium plays significant roles in high-tech fields such as alloys, catalyst, vanadium redox battery and aerospace for its unique and excellent physical and chemical properties ( New kinds of extraction process and system for vanadium extraction have also drawn more and more attention. Synergistic solvent extraction, which means to extract ions using the mixture of two different extractants rather than a single extractant, has led to increasing attention as it could improve the extraction efficiency or selectivity ( In this research, two kinds of precipitation processes: ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media and ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media from the stripping solution of N235-P507 synergistic extraction system were investigated. Various technical conditions were optimized to get high purity V The stripping solution of N235-P507 synergistic extraction system obtained from vanadium-bearing shale was prepared under following processes: roasting vanadium-bearing shale at 850 °C for 1 h and leaching with 20% ( Trialkylamine N235 with a general formula R The vanadium concentration was determined by ferrous ammonium sulfate titration ( The ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium experiments were conducted in a thermostatic water bath equipped with electromagnetic stirring. Sulfuric acid was used to adjust the pH of stripping solution to a definite value and ammonium salt was added into the solution. Then the solution was mechanically shaken to carry on the reaction of precipitation. After solid-liquid separation, ions concentrations in residual liquid were determined by ferrous ammonium sulfate titration and ICP–OES. And the dried vanadium precipitate was calcined to get the product of V The stripping solution of the N235-P507 extraction system is alkaline (pH about 9.5). In order to reduce the acid consumption, the experiment was conducted to explore if the vanadium could be precipitated in the alkaline media. After optimization of process parameters, precipitation rate of vanadium could reach 99.52% under the following conditions: NH Even though the precipitation rate of vanadium is reached 99.52% by the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media, the V In order to exclude the impact of other impurities, the simulation solution contained 3–23 g/L Na and 18 g/L V was used in this experiment. After the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media under the optimal conditions, the precipitation rate and purity of V With the increase of Na concentration, the vanadium precipitation rate kept stable and the purity of V According to the XRD analysis, some sodium vanadates (Na According to the results, the Na concentration should be reduced to about 8 g/L to get high quality of V In order to improve the quality of the V After adjustment and optimization, 2% NH V Due to the high yield and purity, the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media is widely used in the preparation of high-purity V As shown in In order to exclude the impact of other impurities, the simulation solution contained 8–28 g/L Na and 18 g/L V was used in this experiment. After the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media under the optimal conditions, the precipitation rate and purity of V Within the experimental concentration range, the Na concentration had no significant effect on the vanadium precipitation rate and purity of the V According to In order to exclude the impact of other impurities, the simulation solution contained 50–300 mg/L P, 23 g/L Na and 18 g/L V was used in this experiment. After the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media under the optimal conditions, the precipitation rate and purity of V With the increase of P concentration, the vanadium precipitation rate and purity of V The XRD pattern ( Meanwhile, as shown in In summary, the presence of P will have a great impact on the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media. Therefore, the P in the stripping solution should be removed before ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media. The chemical precipitation method is usually adopted for removing P in industry. Impurity removal reagent such as calcium salt (CaCl After P was removed, precipitation rate of vanadium was more than 99% under the following conditions: NH V  Ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline/acidic media was found to be feasible for the high-efficient and selective extraction of vanadium from vanadium-bearing shale combined with N235-P507 synergistic extraction system. Ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media is an efficient method to obtain 98 standard V During the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in alkaline media, the crystal of sodium vanadates formed in the vanadium precipitate and the purity of the V During the ammonium salt precipitation of vanadium in acidic media, Na had no significant effect while P had a great impact on the precipitation rate and purity of V This work is financially supported by the
