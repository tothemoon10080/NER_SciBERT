As a world-class molybdenum province, the Qinling orogenic belt is characterized by voluminous Mesozoic granitoids, which are attributed to the closure processes of the Paleo-Tethys and the collision between the South China and North China blocks. The middle segment of the South Qinling orogenic belt is marked by widespread Triassic granitoids. Several small intrusions, occurring as porphyry stocks or apophyses, are associated with Mo mineralization that occurred at ca. 200 Ma, as constrained by molybdenite Re−Os dating. To delineate the differences between ore-hosting and barren granitic intrusions, in this contribution, we report new laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U–Pb ages, and element and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope data. The granitoids were emplaced episodically from 215 to 203 Ma, with the lithologies evolving from quartz diorites through granodiorites to monzogranites. They are metaluminous to peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline rocks transitional to shoshonites, showing arc-affinity geochemical traits, such as enrichment in LILEs and depletion in Nb, Ta and Ti. The ore-hosting intrusions are monzogranites with high SiO2 contents (>68 wt.%), whereas the barren ones are quartz diorites and granodiorites with low SiO2 contents (60.7–64.6 wt.%). Compared to the barren quartz diorites and granodiorites, the ore-hosting monzogranites show much lower Mg#, lower contents of transition metals (e.g., Sc, Ti, Co and V), and much stronger depletion of Sr, Ba, Eu, Ti and P. The isotopic ratios of the ore-hosting monzogranites (I

This suggests that the ore-hosting magmas originated from a slightly more juvenile source, but were much more fractionated, which is also supported by their younger ages compared to the barrens. Therefore, the prolonged fractional crystallization is a feasible mechanism for the formation of the ore-hosting monzogranites. In addition, the U−Th correlation and Zr/Hf ratios indicate that the fluid process was responsible for the formation of quartz veins in both the barren and ore-hosting intrusions. Consequently, a combination of fractional crystallization and fluid action may have played a crucial role in the development of the Mo mineralization.Granitic magmatism is one of the major mechanisms for the formation of continental crust ( The east–west striking Qinling orogenic belt (QOB) in central China is one of the main Mo-bearing regions in the world ( The QOB is characterized by abundant Triassic granitoids, especially in its western part ( The QOB extends approximately 1,000 km from west to east and is bounded by the San-Bao Fault to the north and the Longmenshan-Dabashan Fault to the south ( The SQL, which is situated between the Shang-Dan suture to the north and the Mian-Lue suture to the south, is characterized by a Precambrian basement and the overlying strata ( The early Mesozoic granitoid intrusions are heterogeneously distributed in the QOB and generally occur to the west of 110°E, mostly in the NQL and SQL, with only a few intrusions in the HXB ( The early Mesozoic granitoids in the SQL ( Coinciding with the large-scale early Mesozoic magmatism, extensive mineralization occurred in the SQL ( The Lanbandeng pluton, an important member of the Ningshan batholith in the middle segment of the SQL that also contains the Laocheng and Yanzhiba plutons and was emplaced into Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sediments in the SQL, forms the northeastern part of the Yanziba pluton and is exposed over an area of ~ The Liyuantang pluton, hosting Mo mineralization, outcrops over 2 km In this study, thirty-two representative samples were collected from road-cuts for the barren plutons and from an open pit for the Mo-bearing intrusions. After microscopic investigation, unaltered or the least altered samples were stringently selected for the whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotope analysis. Major and trace element contents were determined at the Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, Ministry of Education, Peking University, China. A THERMO ARL ADVANT XP Whole-rock Sr and Nd isotopic compositions were obtained using on a Finnigan Triton thermo-ion mass spectrometer at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (GPMR), China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, following the methods of Zircon grains from four samples (11LY1-18: Liyuantang ore-bearing monzogranite, 11XY1-6: Lanbandeng ore-bearing monzogranite, 11JK1-2: Dongjiangkou ore-barren granodiorite, and 11NS1-2: Laocheng ore-barren quartz diorite) were separated by standard density and magnetic separation techniques followed by hand-picking under a binocular microscope for purification. Prior to analysis, transmitted and reflected light photomicrographs were taken under an optical microscope, and cathodoluminescence (CL) images were acquired with a Quanta 650 FEG high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope housed at the Key Laboratory of Orogenic Belts and Crustal Evolution, Ministry of Education, School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University, in order to characterize internal structures and inheritance. One sample (11XY1-6) was analyzed via LA-ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research (MDR), Nanjing University and three samples (11LY-18, 11JK1-2 and 11NS1-2) were analyzed via LA-ICP-MS at the GPMR. At MDR, the zircon U–Pb analysis was performed on an Agilent 7500a ICP-MS equipped with a New Wave Research 213-nm laser ablation system with a beam diameter of 25 μm. The samples were analyzed in runs and each run comprised 10–12 sample analyses corrected by four GEMOC/GJ-1 (608 Ma) standards. An additional well-determined reference zircon (Mud Tank, 735 Ma) was also analyzed to control for reproducibility and instrument stability. The detailed analytical procedures, precision and accuracy were the same as those described by The zircon Hf isotope analysis was performed in situ using a Lambda Physik Geolas 2005 excimer ArF laser-ablation microprobe attached to a Thermo Fisher Scientific Neptune Plus multi-collector (MC)-ICP-MS at GPMR. The detailed operating conditions of the laser-ablation system, the MC-ICP-MS instrument, and the analytical method were the same as those described by Five disseminated molybdenite samples were extracted from the internal/external contact zone of the host rocks and from within the Lanbandeng pluton. The selected molybdenite separates were fine grained (less than 2 mm) in order to avoid the decoupling of Re and Os within large grains ( The whole-rock analyses for major and trace elements of the ore-hosting and barren intrusions are presented in The trace element data reveal a similar distinction between the ore-hosting and barren intrusions. As typical for calc-alkaline rocks, the chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns are characterized by enriched light REEs relative to heavy REEs for all samples ( Whole-rock Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd isotope compositions were determined for twelve samples ( The zircon crystals from four samples (11LY1-8, 11XY1-6, 11JK1-2 and 11NS1-2) are subhedral to euhedral, prismatic to elongated prismatic, 70–300 μm long with aspect ratios of 1:1–3:1, and generally display oscillatory zoning with occasional banded zoning or core-rim structure in CL images ( The analyses of twenty-five individual zircon crystals from the ore-hosting Liyuantang pluton (sample 11LY1-8) form a single concordant age group and yield a mean Twenty-three zircons were analyzed from the ore-hosting Lanbandeng pluton. Excluding the four youngest Twenty-three of the twenty-four spots measurements for zircons from the barren Dongjiangkou pluton (sample 11JK1-2) yield a single Twenty-five analyses of zircons from the Laocheng barren quartz diorite (11NS1-2) plot in a group on the concordia curve and return a weighted mean Molybdenite Re–Os analyses have been performed on five samples collected from the Lanbandeng deposit ( The CL images and Th/U ratios of zircons from samples 11LY1-18 and 11XY1-6 from the ore-hosting Liyuantang and Lanbandeng monzogranite plutons indicate that the zircons were crystallized from magma, and thus the zircon U–Pb ages represent the emplacement time of the granitic rocks, i.e., at ~ The Re–Os isotopic analyses of the five molybdenite samples from the Lanbandeng Mo deposit define a weighted mean age of 198.0 ± 2.6 Ma and an isochron age of 198.1 ± 7.2 Ma, which unambiguously indicate that molybdenite precipitated at ca. 198 Ma. This Re–Os age broadly coincides with or slightly younger than the crystallization age of the Lanbandeng pluton (203 ± 1 Ma) within error, which is identical to porphyry Mo systems in the other areas, as exemplified by those in Dabie Shan ( To sum up, the middle segment of SQL accommodated intensive granitic magmatism and associated Mo mineralization in the period of 215 The granitoids in SQL include two groups, and their petrological and geochemical differences are listed in The barren rocks have high MgO contents (3.34–4.90 wt.%) and Mg# values (64–68), as well as higher contents of the transition metals (Sc, Ti, Co and V) ( The ore-hosting rocks are geochemically different from the barren intermediate rocks. They comprise a range of compositions with SiO In addition to mineral fractional crystallization, a combination of other processes seems to be responsible for some geochemical features. In the ore-hosting rocks, the Rb concentration decreases with increasing differentiation ( To date, the abundance and capacity of mineralization in the SQL has remained poorly defined and unconstrained. As mentioned above, the fact that these ore-hosting intrusions are associated with pegmatites, aplitic dykes, and quartz veins is of particular relevance because these features record late-stage volatile fluids derived from the felsic magmas. The existence of hydrothermal alteration features within the intrusions (e.g., sericitized plagioclase and chloritized biotites) also serves as a typical trait of mineralized felsic intrusions. The data presented above support the description of the Lanbandeng and Liyuantang deposits as the calc-alkaline granodiorite-type molybdenum deposits ( Compared with the barren intrusions, the ore-hosting granitoids occur as smaller intrusions, i.e., stocks or apophyses, and have higher SiO  The LA–ICP–MS zircon U–Pb isotopic analyses reveal that the barren Laocheng quartz diorite and Dongjiangkou granodiorite and the Mo-bearing Liyuantang and Lanbandeng monzogranites formed at 215–200 Ma. ICP-MS-based rhenium and osmium isotopic dating of molybdenites from the Lanbandeng deposit yielded an isochron age of 198.1 ± 7.2 Ma, which is similar to the Re Compared with the barren granitoids, the Mo-bearing granitic rocks have lower Mg#, lower Sc, Ti, Co, V, Ba, Sr, Zr and LREE contents, and greater Ba, Sr, P, Ti and Eu depletions, and are typical of highly fractionated I-type granites. This indicates that a combination of prolonged fractional crystallization and fluid action is a feasible mechanism for the formation of Mo-bearing granitic rocks. This study was co-funded by the
