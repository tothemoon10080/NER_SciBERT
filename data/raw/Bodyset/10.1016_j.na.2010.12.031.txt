The system under investigation describes the evolution of particles dispersed in a viscous compressible fluid and is expressed through the conservation of fluid mass, the balance of momentum and the balance of particle density often referred as the Smoluchowski equation. The coupling between the dispersed and dense phases is obtained through the drag forces that the fluid and the particles exert mutually by the action–reaction principle. We show that solutions exist globally in time under reasonable physical assumptions on the initial data, the physical domain, and the external potential. Furthermore, we prove the large-time stabilization of the system towards a unique stationary state fully determined by the masses of the initial density of particles and fluid and the external potential.Fluid–particle interactions arise in many practical applications in biotechnology, medicine Here, we focus on a particular system derived by formal asymptotics from a mesoscopic description. This is based on a kinetic equation for the particle distribution of Fokker–Planck type coupled to fluid equations. Different macroscopic equations can be obtained as scaling limits; see The well-posedness of this kinetic–hyperbolic coupled fluid–particle system has been addressed in In all the above mentioned studies, the viscosity of the fluid was neglected although it is the source of the drag forces. The viscosity is present in the dimensionless systems although negligible, as noted in Summarizing, the state of such flows in this macroscopic description is, in general, characterized by the variables: the total mass density In this section, we present the primitive conservation equations governing fluid–particle flows in the bubbling regime. These equations express the conservation of mass, the balance of momentum, and the balance of particle densities often referred as the In this paper, we require the potential to satisfy suitable confinement conditions ( Another macroscopic effect is that the total pressure function in the momentum equation depends on both the particle and the fluid densities Indeed, it can be shown that the sequences The main ingredients of our approach can be formulated as follows: A suitable  A suitable approximating scheme is introduced for the construction of the solution based on a two-level approximating procedure: the first level involves an Physically grounded hypotheses are imposed on the domain High integrability properties for the density need to be established for the limit passage in the family of approximate solutions and in particular in taking the vanishing artificial pressure limit. We remark that in the present context, the potential We remark that both the total fluid mass and the total particle mass are constants of motion. In particular, we are able to conserve the total masses also in the large-time limit allowing us to uniquely determine the long-time asymptotics (cf The paper is organized as follows. In Section In this work, we analyse the existence and large-time asymptotics of certain kinds of weak solutions to the two-phase flow problems Given a domain ( (  The confinement assumption ( when when when Let us now specify the kinds of weak solutions for the two-phase flow system  Let us assume that  The balance of momentum holds in a distributional sense, namely All quantities appearing in  All quantities appearing in Given the total free energy of the system     We can now completely characterize the large-time behaviour of free energy solutions to   This section is devoted to the proof of the existence result (  Taking Fix any By the various uniform-in-time bounds (cf. In the remaining parts of this section we prove The approximation scheme is realized in two layers. In the first layer we add a regularization term to the pressure. For a given The second layer of approximation is a discretization of the equations in time. To define this layer of approximation, we shall make use of the space Let The time discretized continuity equation, The time discretized momentum equation with artificial pressure, The time discretized particle density equation, In the above equations, For each fixed The next two subsections treat the existence of a well-defined approximation scheme in both relevant cases, To prove the existence of a solution to the time discretized approximate equations Observe that for a fixed The existence of functions       For each Let the sequence Since Next, since  Since We now prove that   We will prove the existence of a fixed point by verifying the postulates of the Schauder corollary to the Schaefer fixed point theorem First, we observe that the operator Next, we prove that the operator Now, we claim that in fact To prove this claim, we first note that compactness of We continue proving compactness of the operator Before we proceed to prove strong convergence of We are now in a position to prove that Now, since Finally, let We can now conclude the proof since we have proved that the operator At this point we have proved that the approximation scheme is well-defined on bounded domains.
