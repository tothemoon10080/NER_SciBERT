Spherical as well as rod shaped CuxCe1−xO2 (x = 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) nanostructures were produced by microwave refluxing technique. The shape of the particles were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The prevalence of surface oxygen vacancies and progressive increase of their concentration with increased Cu content have been identified by Raman and PL spectroscopy analysis. Magnetic measurements have shown room temperature ferromagnetic (RTFM) behavior for the samples and their MS values were 0.0027, 0.012 and 0.001 A m2/kg for x = 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 respectively. The relatively smaller MS values for these samples as compared to undoped sample may be attributed to the presence of anti-ferromagnetic interactions amongst Cu-ions. The sudden rise in the MS value for x = 0.03 could be due to the presence of ferromagnetic clusters in the sample.Cerium oxide (CeO There are a few reports available in literature exclusively on the variations of oxygen vacancy concentration of CeO The reports on magnetic properties of M The intrinsic magnetic properties of CeO For the production of Cu Identification of phase purity and estimation of crystallite size was done by X-ray diffraction analyses of Cu doped CeO X-ray diffraction patterns for nanocrystalline Cu  The morphology of the Cu Typical HRTEM images ( The advent of the Raman active peak at 460 cm The optical absorbance for Cu substituted CeO The optical bandgap values were estimated by the equation The PL spectra for all the samples consisted of emission bands at 366, 396, 423, 480 and 493 nm (  The oxidation states of Ce, Cu and O elements present in the Cu However, Cu 2p envelop ( The coexistence of para- and ferromagnetic components in Cu It has also been noticed that the M RTFM behavior of the samples aroused due to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies which was also demonstrated by Raman and PL spectra.
