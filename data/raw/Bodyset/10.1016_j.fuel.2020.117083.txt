Coalbed methane (CBM) reservoir is generally believed to be under the uniaxial strain condition. Because of this stress/strain controlled boundary, the horizontal stress is passively changed with gas depletion. This dynamic stress evolution has great impact on permeability and stability of the CBM reservoir. Even though it is generally known that the stress depletion is both poromechanics and desorption controlled process, however, how the gas pressure and the gas type affect the horizontal stress profile and its induced coal failure is still unclear. In this work, we experimentally simulated the uniaxial strain condition in the lab. Both the horizontal stress and permeability were continuously monitored during of different gases (He, N2, CH4 and CO2) depletion. The results show that regardless of gas type, the horizontal stress decreases with the reduction of gas pressure. And gas with a higher adsorption capacity corresponds to a greater horizontal stress loss. During the depletion, the effective vertical stress rises, while effective horizontal stress show various trends for different gases. The effective horizontal stress increases during helium depletion, which leads to a reduction of the permeability. And it decreases during methane and carbon dioxide depletion, which corresponds to a significant increase of the permeability. While for nitrogen, the permeability decreases first and followed by a slight uptick. Both the lab test and modeling results show that a significant non-linearity exists in effective horizontal stress change during adsorptive gas depletion, which is expected to affect the reservoir stability. To evaluate the reservoir stability during depletion, a stability factor (SF) was put forward, and the influencing factors on this parameter were analyzed. With this parameter, the critical reservoir pressure indicating reservoir failure can be determined with appropriate geomechanical parameters input. This research will advance the understanding of the geomechanics change during CBM production.Coalbed methane (CBM) development started in U.S. in the early 1980s, and thereafter it attracted enough attention worldwide during the last decade Coal seam permeability is one of the key factors controlling the CBM production For the in-situ CBM reservoir, it is generally believed to be under the uniaxial strain condition, of which the lateral boundaries are fixed (zero lateral strain), and the vertical stress keeps constant because of the unchanged overburden during CBM depletion (see Although the uniaxial strain boundary was commonly adopted in permeability modeling, the coal permeability test in the laboratory had not been conducted under this condition until 2012, when Mitra et al. During CBM production, the lowering of the reservoir pressure can result in shear failure of the coal seam, which in turn leads to wellbore collapse and enhanced production of coal fines For the problems faced above, Liu and Harpalani The stress variation and its induced failure of the coal reservoir will inevitably change the permeability of the coal seams, which will, in turn, affects the CBM production. Feng et al. The analyses above indicate that research on geomechanical properties and permeability change of CBM reservoir under uniaxial strain condition is inadequate. Although some work has been conducted in recent years, the roles of adsorption capacity and matrix shrinkage on the “excess” horizontal stress loss, the effective stress, the change of permeability and the reservoir stability have not been fully understood. For example, what is the relationship between the adsorption capacity and “excess” loss of the horizontal stress? How does the effective stress and permeability change with the decrease of the pore pressure for different absorbing gases? How does the reservoir stability evolve during CBM depletion? To answer these questions, in this work, we first measured the adsorption capacity and adsorption-induced deformation of the coal with different gases. Then the stress change and permeability evolution were obtained under best replicated Coal collected from Hongliulin Coal Mine in Shanxi Province, China, was adopted in this work. Cylindrical coal cores, 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length were drilled for the basic mechanical properties tests and the geomechanics research under uniaxial strain condition. Among them, one of the coal core was further cut into coal quadrants for the measurement of volumetric strain with different gases injection under hydrostatic condition. Some of the end pieces were ground into coal particles with size of 60–80 mesh for the isothermal adsorption tests.   The average uniaxial compressive strength, average elastic modulus and average Poisson’s ratio of this coal are 27.8 MPa, 1200 MPa and 0.24, respectively. In this section, isothermal adsorption experiments were conducted following the volumetric method (MT/T 752–1997 in China) to establish the isotherms using pulverized coal with a size of 60–80 mesh. A high-pressure adsorption instrument (isorb-HP1, U.S.) produced by Quantachrome Corporation was adopted in this test. All the three gases CO After the tests, data obtained was fitted by the Langmuir equation shown in Eq. Matrix swelling/shrinkage under hydrostatic pressure condition was measured on coal quadrant. The setup used in the test was shown in In order to reveal the horizontal stress change and its impact on coal permeability under uniaxial strain condition, experiments simulating gas depletion were conducted in the Unconventional Geomechanics Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. This experiment is complicated and time-consuming. However, the results provide values of several parameters and establish important relationships, such as the pressure-dependent permeability and stress path during He/N The setup used in this experiment consists of a triaxial cell, modified to allow entry and exit of fluids, and a load frame for application of vertical load to replicate the The coal core was first stressed vertically and horizontally to replicate the Using the measured flowrate for each pressure step, permeability was finally calculated. Hence, a complete pressure-dependent permeability relationship was established. Since the changes in horizontal stress was recorded throughout the experiment, the stress path was established as well.  The coal core was first stressed at about 14 MPa vertically and 9 MPa horizontally. Then helium with a pressure of about 8 MPa was injected into the coal core. After the mechanical equilibrium was achieved, depletion was conducted in a stepwise manner with a pressure drawdown of about 1.4 MPa in each step. For each step, the horizontal stress imposed on the coal core was adjusted to ensure the zero strain in the horizontal direction, and then the mechanical equilibrium was achieved. The above analyses show that for all the gases, He, N For an elastically deformed coal, its mechanical behavior can be described by a poro-elastic constitutive equation. By considering the pore pressure and the matrix swelling/shrinkage induced by gas adsorption/desorption, the stress–strain relationship for a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium can be given as Then the normal stress–strain relationships in the horizontal directions ( Under the uniaxial strain condition, no strain in horizontal direction is allowed, so Under the uniaxial strain condition, the vertical stress keeps constant, Substituting Eq. From Eq. The Poisson’s ratio of the coal tested under uniaxial compression is 0.19–0.27 with an average of 0.24. By matching Eq. During the depletion, the gas flowrate was monitored in each step to calculate the permeability of the coal core. All the permeability is normalized with the initial permeability since our goal is to investigate the variation trend of the permeability. Assuming a bundled matchstick geometry, the permeability of the coal can be given as Substituting Eq. By adjusting the cleat compressibility, the fitting results between the model and lab test results have been shown in The lab test results show that with the CBM depletion, the horizontal stress of the reservoir reduces gradually. The previous research demonstrated that the desorption-induced “excess” loss of the horizontal stress may lead to shear failure of the coal formation Here, we assume that the CBM reservoir is under the normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress is larger than the horizontal stresses Such a relationship in Eq. And the increment of the Mohr’s circle radius can be given as From Eq. The center of the Mohr’s circle can be given by Eq. And the increment of the Mohr’s circle center can be expressed as During the depletion, the increment of the center coordinate is co-determined by the poroelastic shrinkage and matrix shrinkage. When The analyses above show that during CBM depletion, coal failure may occur, and the probability increases with the pressure drawdown and varies with the adsorbability of the reservoir. In this section, the stability of the CBM reservoir was quantitatively evaluated with a newly defined stability factor ( When From Eq.        In this work, the in-situ boundary condition of the CBM reservoir was replicated in the lab based on the uniaxial strain assumption. Under the uniaxial strain condition, both the stress change and the permeability variation were lab monitored and modelled for different gases, and the reservoir stability during depletion was also discussed. The main conclusions were presented as follows. Regardless of the gas type, during depletion, the horizontal stress decreases gradually, but the gradients of the horizontal stress reduction are different. For helium, nitrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, the gradients are 0.581, 0.944, 1.441 and 2.852, respectively. This difference is believed to be related to the adsorption capacity of the coal to different types of gas. During the depletion, the effective vertical stress rises, while effective horizontal stress show various trend for different gases. The effective horizontal stress increases during helium depletion, which leads to a reduction of the permeability. And it decreases during methane and carbon dioxide depletion, which corresponds to a significant increase of the permeability. While for nitrogen, the permeability decreases first and followed by a slight uptick. Both the lab test and modeling results show that a significant non-linearity exists in effective horizontal stress change during adsorptive gas depletion. An index named stability factor (SF) is proposed to evaluate the stability of the reservoir during depletion. It shows that the stability of the reservoir is mainly affected by the initial stress regime (  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
