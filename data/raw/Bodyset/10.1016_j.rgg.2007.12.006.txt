Electrical resistance measurements, thin-section, chemical, thermal differential, and thermal gravity analyses have been applied to study samples of chromite and the host serpentinite from the Podenny and Kurman deposits in the Alapaevsk ophiolite and from the Piany Bor and southern deposits in the Klyuchevskoi ophiolite. Samples from the four sites exhibit similar patterns of activation energy E
