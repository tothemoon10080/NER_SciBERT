DMLS (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) Additive manufacturing allows building topological optimized geometries with good mechanical properties and low weight. These features are appropriated for the aeronautical industry because the reduction of weight involves saving costs per trip. However, the manufacturing cost using SLM (Selective Laser Melting) or DMLS, is also high since titanium alloys powder is expensive. Therefore, this work aims to explore the possibility of using 15-5PH stainless steel powder to balance the mechanical properties, weight and cost of the part.
