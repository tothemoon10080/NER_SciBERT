The solvent extraction of La, Nd, Eu, Ho and Lu with thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) and the quaternary ammonium salt Aliquat 336 in chloride (QCl) or perchlorate (QClO4) form in CHCl3, C6H6, CCl4 and C6H12 has been studied. On the basis of the slope analysis data, the composition of the extracted species was determined as Q+[Ln(TTA)4]− (Q+ is the quaternary ammonium salt cation). The values of the equilibrium constant and the separation factors were calculated. The effect of the diluents on the metal extraction and separation has been discussed.Thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) has been used for the solvent extraction of lanthanides alone The interaction between the chelating extractant and the ammonium salts during the extraction process has been investigated by several authors. Some authors The present work was undertaken to study the effect of the diluents (C HTTA (Merck, p.a.) was used as supplied, Aliquat 336 (methyltrialkyl (C The diluents were cyclohexane (Merck, p.a.), carbon tetrachloride and chloroform (Fluka,p.a.). The other reagents used were also of analytical grade purity. Equal volumes (10 cm The solvent extraction of lanthanides with HTTA alone has been studied by several authors The lanthanide extraction with the quaternary ammonium salt alone in its chloride and perchlorate form was negligible under the experimental conditions of the present study. The synergistic extraction of the metals was studied by an examination of the variation of On the basis of slope analysis data, the synergistic extraction of the metals can be described by the equation: Formation of complex Q[Eu(TTA) The overall equilibrium constant The formation of mixed complexes in the organic phase synergistic reaction can be expressed by the equation: The equilibrium constant The values of log The data of log It is seen that for a specific diluent the values of the overall equilibrium constant log The change of the anion of the synergistic agent causes a considerable decrease of log The effect of the diluents on the metal extraction with HTTA–QCl(ClO The metal separation can be assessed using separation factors. The separation factors of the pairs Nd/La, Eu/Nd, Ho/Eu and Lu/Ho were calculated as a ratio of the overall equilibrium constant The diluents effect on the synergistic solvent extraction of La, Nd, Eu, Ho and Lu with HTTA–QCl(ClO
