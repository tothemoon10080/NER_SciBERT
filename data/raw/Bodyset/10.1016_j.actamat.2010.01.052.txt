Being able to predict the grain formation process and attendant grain size has been a central topic in solidification. Such an analytical model is presented for constitutional supercooling (CS)-driven grain formation with several simplifications. The model links the nucleation of new grains to the growth of a larger neighbouring grain. The average grain size (

                     cs) necessary to establish sufficient CS (ΔTn
                     ) for nucleating new grains, and the spatial mean distance (

Two distinct fundamental approaches are used, which result in identical descriptions of

The model is compared with literature data produced under various conditions and demonstrated on aluminium alloys as an example.Modelling of solidification on a microstructural scale may be classified into two broad categories: probabilistic (stochastic) and deterministic (continuum). The advantage of stochastic models is their ability to predict microstructure formation in general and ease of treating complex problems of, for example, geometry or the effects of crystallographic anisotropies. In contrast, deterministic models have the merit of correlating with measurable macroscopic (or even microscopic) parameters and, consequently, are more straightforward for quantitatively predicting/validating/explaining experimental measurements. Both approaches are important means of modelling and are often used collectively because of their complementary nature in many cases A few predictive models of the deterministic nature have been developed over the years for grain formation. One such example is the Maxwell–Hellawell (M–H) model Turnbull’s transformation nucleus model The constitutional supercooling (CS)-driven nucleation model was proposed by Winegard and Chalmers Following the CS-driven nucleation mechanism, Easton and StJohn The model was tested on the inoculation of aluminium alloys with TiB The purpose of this work is to develop an analytical model for grain formation and grain size prediction in cast alloys, where CS has assumed a prime role in grain nucleation. The growth of the nucleated grains is first treated in a similar fashion following the M–H model The birth of the CS concept A crystallite formed by nucleation in an undercooled liquid can be assumed to be nearly spherical in the beginning. The growth of a spherical crystal in an undercooled pure liquid (without solute) was analysed by Mullins and Sekerka (M–S) Based on these considerations, a grain nucleation and formation model is proposed, which is depicted in Referring to In a real three-dimensional (3D) situation, active nucleants exist in the vicinity of a growing crystal at various distances in all radial directions, as illustrated in The chief issue to determine the average grain size The determination of The invariant-size approximation model was formulated for the diffusion-controlled growth of a spherical precipitate of radius The restriction of inequality The growth rate of a metallic crystal (continuous growth) in an undercooled liquid generally increases with increasing undercooling Δ According to the stationary interface growth model For the growth of a crystallite in a metallic melt, following Maxwell and Hellawell In many practical situations of a solidifying melt, the temperature gradient is usually not significant in the bulk of the melt. To relate the solute composition to Δ Substituting In the early stages of growth, when a spherical crystallite is small, it is often necessary to include the curvature undercooling Δ Note that Δ The value of The formulation of Eqs. Differentiating Eq. The growth of a grain in an undercooled metallic alloy melt is typically controlled by solute diffusion (continuous growth). For continuous growth, the growth rate is approximately proportional to the undercooling Δ As can be inferred from The solute profile in the liquid ahead of a planar advancing front of velocity Re-arranging Eq. Similarly, when Δ In most cases, Δ The two fundamentally different approaches provide a rigorous validation of the model developed. The applicability of the concept or model and its limitations in the prediction of the final grain size are discussed below. The latent dependence of the grain size on alloy variables such as Thus, the model confirms the previously realized strong relationship between grain size and The system that is best studied for this verification is Al alloys inoculated with Al–Ti–B grain refiners. This is because there is detailed experimental information available about the grain refinement response to solidification conditions. The diffusivity of metal elements in liquid Al is known to be on the order of 10 The undercooling Δ The growth velocity Given that The knowledge that Despite the strong support of the literature data produced under different conditions An analytical model has been developed for CS-driven grain formation on a rigorous fundamental basis. The model links the nucleation of new grains to the growth of a larger neighbouring grain.
