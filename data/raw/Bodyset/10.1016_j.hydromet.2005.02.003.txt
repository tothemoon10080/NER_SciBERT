The Third International Symposium on Iron Control in Hydrometallurgy will be held in Montreal, Canada from October 1 to 4, 2006; it will bring together plant operators, engineers and researchers to discuss the theory and practice of the iron control problem as it relates to the processing of base and precious metals, the leaching of nickel laterites and bauxite, and the treatment of pickle liquors. The key role of iron precipitation in impurity element containment will also be considered. The symposium will provide a forum for the international metallurgical community to review the recent technological developments in iron control, stabilization and disposal. The meeting will facilitate a better understanding of the theory and practice of iron control in hydrometallurgical processes and the identification of innovative iron control technologies. Key topics to be considered include: Iron control technologies and plant descriptions Iron control during the leaching of nickel laterites and bauxite Treatment of pickle liquors and iron solutions Iron precipitation for impurity control Emerging iron control technologies Fundamental aspects of iron control Uses and applications of hydrometallurgical iron Thickening and filtration of iron precipitates Stabilization and disposal of iron residues and precipitates, including red muds Environmental considerations, trends and regulations related to iron residue disposal. The symposium will be complemented by a one and one-half day short course which will provide an in-depth study of the fundamentals and practice of iron control in hydrometallurgy. A post-symposium technical tour will highlight new iron control technologies.  Submission of abstracts: September 30, 2005 Submission of papers: March 31, 2006  Dr. J.E.
