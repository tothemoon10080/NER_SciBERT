Bilateral symmetrical periarticular trauma is a completely different situation from the usual solitary or multiple fractures. It is rarely encountered during the usual practice of an orthopaedic surgeon. We report a case with such fracture combination due to seizure attack. An 80-year-old man was admitted to a nephrology ward due to UGI bleeding and seizure complicating end-stage renal disease. Days later, the orthopaedic section was consulted due to ecchymosis and painful manipulation of both shoulders and hips. The diagnosis of bilateral symmetrical periarticular fractures, including four-part posterior fracture-dislocation of the glenohumeral joints and Garden-IV femoral neck fractures, was made once the films were inspected ( The remarkable characteristics of this case included simultaneous, bilateral, symmetrical, periarticular trauma, which is different from usual cases of orthopaedic trauma which involve solitary long-bone shaft fracture or multiple asymmetrical shaft fractures. Violent muscle contraction is responsible for such injuries. The early observation on victims of electroconvulsive therapy related with this pattern of injuries turned to those on seizure patients later. Proximal humerus fractures, especially fracture-dislocation or dislocation of the posterior type, are the most common injuries that happened to those patients In conclusion, the presented case is a rare pattern of fractures. It is distinctly different from usual fracture cases. The diagnostic implications of fracture should be well appreciated.
