A systematic investigation on the effect of milling time on carbothermic reduction of ilmenite was carried out by a combination of thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle size analysis. It was shown that the graphite crystalline structure was easily destroyed along the (002) crystal plane during milling process. The particle size of ilmenite/graphite mixture was largely decreased and a fully mixed composite structure was obtained after milling for 4 h at high milling intensity. Milling exerts positive effect on the decreasing temperatures of ilmenite reduction and gradual deoxidizing of titanium oxides was completed.
