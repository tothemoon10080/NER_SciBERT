Background
                  A retrospective group study was done to evaluate the effect of the small AO external fixator in the management of acute intra-articular fractures of the distal radius.
               
                  Methods
                  Between January 1995 and December 1996, 70 consecutive patients with articular fractures of the distal radius were treated by closed reduction and external fixation with small AO external fixators. The mean age at the time of surgery was 58.9 years (range, 14–87 years). There were 58 Colles' Barton's fractures and 12 Smith's Barton's fractures. The follow-up period was 104 months (range, 92–118 months).
               
                  Results
                  All fractures united in a mean of 5.8 weeks (range, 4–10 weeks). At the final follow-up, the average range of motion was 56.3 ± 11.6° in flexion, 58.6 ± 10.7° in extension, 21.5 ± 4.2° in ulnar deviation, 9.1 ± 2.9° in radial deviation, 71.5 ± 8.5° in pronation, and 67.3 ± 9.2° in supination. Compared with the normal side, the average grip force was 87 ± 6%. The overall clinical and functional outcomes, according to the scoring system of Gartland and Werley, showed that 22 patients (31.4%) had excellent results, 36 (51.4%) had good results, 9 (12.9%) had fair results, and 3 (4.3%) had poor results.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Closed reduction and external fixation with the small AO external fixator is useful and effective in the management of displaced comminuted articular fractures of the distal radius.
