A pyrite concentrate with a grind size P80 of 14μm was oxidized in an alkaline medium at an oxygen overpressure between 10 and 40psig, at a temperature of 80°C. Sodium hydroxide was used to neutralize the acid produced as a result of pyrite oxidation. When the pH was maintained above 12.5, there were three dominant sulphur oxyanions detected in the solution, thiosulphate, sulphite and sulphate.
                  The focus of this study was the calculation of thiosulphate yield as a function of sulphide sulphur concentration of the pyrite in the feed. This calculation included the effect of other sulphur oxyanions on the thiosulphate yield since it is well known that thiosulphate oxidizes fairly rapidly to tetrathionate and trithionate and higher sulphur oxyanions under high alkalinity conditions. The transient formation of tetrathionate and trithionate can only be estimated when the mechanism of formation of these oxyanions is known. Various schemes involving branching of the reaction pathways can be found in the literature but unfortunately, no widely accepted mechanism has emerged from these studies.
                  In the present study, the transformation mechanism is based on the least electron transfer principle and assumes that the transformation reactions occur in series. Based on this approach, linear equations were derived and used to set up a kinetic model of the system with respect to thiosulphate yield. In determining the kinetic constants, the presence of unseen and unmeasured intermediates was assumed and calculated based on the corresponding reaction stoichiometry. A single rate expression combining kinetic constants of all the metastable oxyanions was derived to predict the thiosulphate yield as a function of the known pyrite sulphide sulphur concentration under the experimental conditions that were adopted.

                              }Pyrite is an abundant sulphide mineral that often contains gold as extremely fine (<1 Extensive studies of the solid products formed during atmospheric alkaline oxidation of pyrite at temperatures from 50 to 85 The oxidative conversion of the sulphide sulphur in pyrite is complex in NaOH solution, and the reaction is generally far from being in equilibrium. The occurrence of several metastable aqueous sulphur species has been reported by various researchers ( The oxidation of sulphide to sulphate is an 8-electron process, but it is unlikely that more than two electrons are transferred in any one reaction step ( An important factor for achieving a favourable species distribution in a non-equilibrium system is the rate of conversion of one species to another. In pursuing a maximum thiosulphate yield for effective gold leaching, the most important reactions to consider are the oxidation of thiosulphate and the hydrolysis of tetrathionate and trithionate. The oxidation of thiosulphate reduces the available thiosulphate for gold leaching while the hydrolysis of tetrathionate and trithionate regenerates thiosulphate. The oxidation of thiosulphate at elevated temperature and pressure produces sulphate as a final product. However, the course of the reactions leading to sulphate is largely dependent on kinetic factors rather than thermodynamic consideration, as reported by The hydrolysis of tetrathionate generates thiosulphate and trithionate under alkaline pH conditions ( Studies investigating the hydrolysis reactions of tetrathionate and trithionate as a single reaction, observed a significant increase in the rate with an increase in pH. It was even reported that the rate was so fast as to be impossible to measure (by initial rate method) when running experiments at pH 12 and higher ( In this paper, a simple network of reactions that are all of first order with respect to sulphur oxyanions is proposed as the oxidation pathway of pyrite sulphide sulphur to the final product of sulphate. To explain the kinetics of each reaction, it is assumed that a sequence of elementary reactions occurs, but the intermediates formed cannot be measured because they have short lifetime and are only present in very minute quantities due to rapid transformation. Development of rate equations was based on theoretical consideration (linear change of oxidation state through least electrons transfer and published stoichiometry of reactants) as well as an empirical curve-fitting procedure. The value of the rate constants of the kinetic equations was estimated by calculating the unobserved intermediates by following the concentration (yield) of each species during the pyrite oxidation reaction. Pyrite concentrate with a grind size P The oxidation of pyrite was conducted in a batch reactor at various oxygen overpressures. Intermediate soluble sulphur species as well as residual sulphides were measured and results are given in When the progress of the reaction is unaffected by the product layer then the rate becomes directly proportional to the available surface of unreacted sulphides. If the mole flux An excellent straight line fit was obtained when plotting conversion versus time. The times for total conversion estimated from the slopes of the lines in A simple network of reactions is presented for the hypothetical route of pyrite sulphide conversion under oxidative conditions. The rate equations are all first order and so development of performance expression does not involve complex mathematics. The conceptual model is presented in The reactions describing the stoichiometric relationship between these species ( The rate of each reaction is a function of alkalinity and oxygen overpressure. The rate of change and the yield of each intermediate species in these reactions can be described as the sum of the individual rates: fractions formed minus fraction disappeared in the following reaction. Due to multiple occurrences of thiosulphate in this sequence, the ultimate performance equation will include the fraction formed due to sulphur oxidation (2 and 3), the fraction oxidized forming tetrathionate (4), the fraction formed as a side product in the hydrolysis reactions of tetrathionate (5) and trithionate (6) as shown in Eq. Sulphate as the most stable end-product does not react any further. By inserting the rate of sulphate formation When intermediates are present at very small concentrations that cannot be measured, their rate of change can be taken to be zero; for example the transient formation of aqueous sulphide under the alkaline oxidative conditions. After inserting the concentrations of species from Eq. Furthermore, species in the rate equations in series can be replaced by known parameters such as the initial sulphide sulphur (pyrite), alkalinity (NaOH) and oxygen pressure The thiosulphate yield can be calculated by inserting the corresponding relationships from Eqs. Thus, Eq. To test whether the thiosulphate yields predicted by the kinetic equation corresponds to experimentally generated data, it was necessary to estimate the rate constants for formation of the intermediate species. Knowing that intermediates are highly reactive, their concentrations (fraction formed that is not consumed in the following reaction) have been calculated using the relationships given in Eqs. As it can be seen from The rate of sulphides conversion and unobserved intermediates were estimated as slopes of species concentrations given in All reaction constants and orders were estimated by plotting logarithms of concentration change ( Using the constants from The equation predicted thiosulphate yields are compared to the measured yields in An equation predicting thiosulphate yield as a product of rate constants and an oxygen pressure dependent term has been derived in this paper. The derivation was based on a conceptual model for the progress of a series of reactions in which sulphide sulphur is transformed to various soluble oxyanions under oxidative conditions. The transformation mechanism was constructed on the least electron transfer principle and assumed that the reactions occur in series. Such a model may be simplistic and imprecise in terms of the individual kinetic constants employed, yet the thiosulphate yield predictive power of the model was reasonable and could be useful for further studies in this field.
