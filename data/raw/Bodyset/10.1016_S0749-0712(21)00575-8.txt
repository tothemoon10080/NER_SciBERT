Proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations are complex, potentially disabling injuries for any patient, especially the competitive athlete. Dorsal fracture dislocations are fairly common and volar fracture dislocations are rare. Stable injuries often heal with minimal functional deficit, whereas unstable injuries can result in limitation in range of motion, joint incongruity, and degenerative joint disease. A number of surgical procedures have been described to treat the unstable dorsal fracture dislocation, including ORIF, extension block pinning, external fixation, dynamic traction, and volar plate arthroplasty. Volar fracture dislocations are usually amenable to closed or open reduction and internal fixation. The results of treatment of both volar and dorsal fracture dislocations can be unpredictable.
