Dye sensitized solar cells were made on TiO2 scaffold anodes of rutile particles. These TiO2 scaffold anodes were grown from rutile seeds by using a molten salt synthesis technique. Different thickness coatings of mixed amorphous titanium hydroxide and NaCl–KCl eutectic salt mixture on the rutile seeds were heat treated at different temperatures. The rutile whiskers of different aspect ratios were grown depending on the growth temperature. The best photovoltaic performances were obtained for the device made from the scaffold of 20–50nm diameter and 0.5–1μm length nanowhiskers obtained at 700°C for 5h of treatment.It is a well accepted fact that in order to increase the overall efficiency of dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) enhancement of photocurrent collection could be one of the many possibilities. For spherical/equiaxed nano-TiO For the preparation of the TiO These electrodes are annealed at 500 The electron microscopy images ( The thickness of the seed layer or the titanium hydroxide and NaCl–KCl eutectic salt mixture did not change the microstructure or the dimensions of the whiskers in particular, while treatment temperature had very distinguished effect. For the samples grown at the temperatures below 700 Photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs made from the electrodes grown at different temperatures and of different thicknesses were measured. Best results ( Increasing thickness decreases the V Below 700 We have successfully made DSSCs on rutile TiO
