Preparation of Fe–TiC composite from mixtures of carbon black and two different titanium bearing minerals (black sand ilmenite and natural rutile) was studied. Milled (mechanically activated) and unmilled carbon containing mixtures were prepared and then heated at temperatures 1200°C and 1300°C for 3h under an inert atmosphere. The reaction progress, as well as reaction products, was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The feasibility of producing Fe–TiC composites from titanium bearing materials mixed with carbon black was proved. Fe–TiC could be produced by carbothermic reduction of mechanically activated black sand ilmenite containing mixtures milled for 50h and heated up to 1200°C. On the other hand, 60h milling followed by heating up to 1300°C was needed in case of natural rutile containing mixture. The morphology of the Fe–TiC produced from black sand ilmenite showed a homogeneous distribution of Fe and TiC enriched areas, while the Fe–TiC produced from natural rutile showed intense distribution of TiC phase with traces of iron and lower titanium oxide.Recently, particle reinforced iron matrix composites have been a focus within the scope of new materials. Due to the fine wettability with liquid iron, TiC particles with high hardness and chemical stability are widely used as a reinforcing phase for iron matrix composites TiC can be synthesized by direct reaction between Ti and carbon under vacuum at high temperature of 1900 The present paper describes a one-step process to produce Fe–TiC composites directly from different titanium bearing materials and carbon black via mechanical activation followed by reduction reactions under argon atmosphere at relatively lower temperature. The effects of mechanical activation time and reduction temperature on the formation of iron–titanium carbide were also studied. The starting materials were black sand ilmenite and natural rutile with mean particles size ( Each material was first mixed with an appropriate amount of carbon black (C/O molar ratio was kept at 1.5) to provide sufficient carbon for full reduction of oxides of titanium and iron present in the raw materials according to the following reactions: These mixtures were milled in a vertical planetary ball mill with an agate cell containing silicon nitride balls of 20 The carbothermic reduction process is often monitored by thermogravimetric analysis ( Unlike the unmilled titanium bearing mixtures, the milled mixtures started to react quite early at 100   Similarly, XRD patterns ( XRD patterns of natural rutile and reduction products of mixture thermally treated for 3 Further increased reduction temperature to 1300 On comparing the above results with ilmenite concentrate results On the other hand, natural rutile has different behavior than the aforementioned results. Unreduced lower titanium oxide (Ti  The morphology of the sample synthesized at 1300 It is feasible to produce Fe–TiC powder from titanium raw materials mixed with carbon black through mechanical activation followed by reduction under an inert atmosphere. The results indicated that the formation of Fe–TiC powder from black sand ilmenite was obtained by milling for 50 For natural rutile, Fe–TiC formed with traces of lower oxide of titanium (Ti The morphology of the Fe–TiC produced from black sand ilmenite showed a homogeneous distribution of Fe and TiC enriched areas, while the produced Fe–TiC from natural rutile showed intense distribution of TiC phase with traces of iron and lower titanium oxide.
