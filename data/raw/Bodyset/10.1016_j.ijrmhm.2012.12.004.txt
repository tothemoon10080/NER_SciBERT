Dense high volume fractions of different molar TiB2/TiC ratios reinforced Fe matrix composite were successfully fabricated through the SHS reaction assisted with pressure. The reaction mechanisms for three systems were dissolutionâ€“precipitation. The TiB2 morphology changed from plate-like to clubbed and further to cubic with decreasing TiB2/TiC ratios from 2:1 to 1:2. The composites with 2:1 and 1:1 ratios of TiB2/TiC have a similar highest Vickers hardness and flexural strength while the composite with 1:1 ratio of TiB2/TiC has the best fracture toughness. The improvement of the fracture toughness was attributed to the reduction of thermal stress and the modification of TiB2 morphology. The optimal ratio of TiB2/TiC was recommended to be 1:1.Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction assisted with the pressure offers a technically simple and economically attractive process to fabricate the dense and high-strength ceramic composites However, several limitations associated with the simultaneous use of TiC and TiB Commercial powders of Ti (99.5% purity, ~ The corresponding raw materials were mixed in a Turbula mixer for 60 Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model Netzsch 409CD) was used to the feasibility of SHS reaction.
