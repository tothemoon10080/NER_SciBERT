Rhenium (Re) was recovered as high purity ammonium perrhenate (APR) from a scrub liquor produced by a pilot plant treating 2000m3/h of a fume discharged from a molybdenite roaster. The hydrometallurgical process adopted incorporates first a neutralisation stage using lime to remove most of Mo, all Cu, As and other minor contaminants to produce a liquor containing 260–280mg/L Re and 80–90mg/L Mo. Solvent extraction was subsequently used to first load the Re and Mo into a 10
                     v/v.% tertiary amine (Alamine 304–1), 10
                     v/v.% Isodecanol in 80% Anysol-150. The organic phase which contained typically 6.2g/L Re and 1.29g/L Mo was stripped with 30% ammonium hydroxide to yield a liquor containing 29.9g/L Re and 5.63g/L Mo. High purity APR (>99.8% purity) was recovered from this liquor by adding sulphuric acid to pH6.8. The whole process would provide an efficient method to recover at least 85% of Re produced from the roaster, with some loss probably incurred due to the re-condensation and/or re-crystallisation of gaseous Re oxide in the cool part of the fume extraction circuit.Rhenium (Re) has found important application in petroleum and aerospace industries. The world consumption of Re according to Most rhenium occurs as rheniite (ReS Ion exchange resins containing tertiary amines such as Amberlite IRA910 and Hostarex A324-loaded resins have been used in several plants for recovering Re ( Several techniques have been proposed for recovering Re from wet scrubbing acid liquors generated during the roasting of molybdenite to produce molybdenum trioxide used in ferro-moly alloy production ( In our previous study, using activated carbon to recover Re (155–240 The SeAH ferro-moly alloy plant (Gwangyang, South Korea) is producing 10,000–12,000 tpa Mo trioxide by roasting a molybdenite concentrate from Chile. The fume extraction system operates at a capacity of 20,000 The compositions of typical molybdenite concentrate feeds used for roasting and the waste dust collected from the bag house in the current plant operation are shown in The acidic scrub liquors obtained from 2 pilot plant campaigns (400 All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. Double-distilled de-ionised water was used for all tests in the laboratory. The solvent used for this study was a tertiary amine, Alamine 304-1 (from BASF). The diluent, Anysol-150 and Isodecanol modifier were from Samsung Total Petrochemical Co. Using a 30 The organic phase used in solvent extraction was a mixture of 10 The stripped liquors (30% ammonium hydroxide) containing Re and Mo were adjusted to reach pH Molybdenite roasters are normally operated at 600 to 700 The concentration profiles of the dissolved metals in the scrubbed liquor samples collected over a period of 7 Two batches of 400 As demonstrated in our previous studies ( Stabcal modelling shows that Mo could be effectively removed from the acidic liquor L2 by adding clear lime liquor to reach pH The modelling of the stability of a stripped liquor containing 29.9  A lime slurry (30 Alternatively, a one-step lime neutralisation to pH After neutralisation, the liquor pH was adjusted to pH The solvent extraction of rhenium from the liquor received after lime neutralisation (Liquor L2N, The reactions involved during Re solvent extraction are illustrated by the following equations:  The stripping of rhenium from the loaded organic was also evaluated using 30 % ammonium hydroxide solution and the results obtained for different O/A ratios (1:1–5:1) are also tabulated in  The precipitation of APR was conducted with the stripped liquor containing 29.9 The precipitation of APR immediately took place when the liquor pH was slowly lowered from pH The XRD pattern ( A pilot plant was built to treat a molybdenite roaster fume, using a water scrubber to capture Re and Mo in acidic sulphate scrub liquor, which also contains other impurities such as Cu and As.
