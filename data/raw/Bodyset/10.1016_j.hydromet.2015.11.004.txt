Improved atmospheric acid leaching (AL) of complex, low grade nickel (Ni) laterite ores warrants greater knowledge of the exact processes underpinning Ni and pay metal cobalt (Co) extraction rates, acid consumption and pulp handleability. In this study, the influence of agitation rate (600–1000rpm) and temperature (70 and 95°C) on the isothermal, batch acid leaching and rheological behaviour of saprolitic Ni laterite slurry (40wt.% solid) was investigated over 4h at pH1. The leaching behaviour was distinctly incongruent and reflected strong temperature-dependent Ni/Co extraction, acid consumption and the proliferation of gangue minerals' constituent elements (e.g., Na, Mg, Al, Fe). Whilst the total mass of acid consumed per ton of dry ore processed was greater at higher temperature, the total kg acid consumed per kg Ni and Co extracted was markedly lower. In all cases, the slurries displayed time-dependent, non-Newtonian, shear thinning rheological behaviour. The pulp viscosities and shear yield stresses were generally greater at lower than at higher temperature, with both increasing dramatically in the course of 4h leaching. Agitation rate in the range 600–1000rpm had no noticeable impact on Ni and Co leaching rates, confirming the insignificance of volume diffusion limitation. Although high pulp shear viscosities in the range 37–120mPas were observed in the course of leaching, they did not have an impact on Ni and Co leaching mechanisms and kinetics from the saprolitic laterite ore. The mechanism of saprolitic laterite ore leaching appears to follow a chemical reaction controlled, shrinking core model with apparent activation energies of 75.5±3.8 and 81.2±4.1kJ/mol, respectively, for the release of Ni and Co.Complex, low (< Atmospheric acid leaching (AL) in agitated vessels is a preferred processing method for low grade Ni laterites ( Recent studies of the leaching behaviour of Ni laterite ores in sulphuric acid have revealed a strong mineralogy and chemistry dependent behaviour ( The effect of ore mineralogy on the column leaching performance of three low grade Ni laterites (saprolitic, siliceous goethitic and goethitic) has been investigated at ambient temperature ( Unravelling the exact leaching mechanisms and kinetics of low grade laterites is challenging due to the complex nature of the ore and the presence of different Ni/Co-host gangue minerals and associations ( On the mechanism of AL of saprolitic ores, it has been shown to involve partial decomposition of the Ni host Mg-silicate structure with very little silica release ( Depending upon the controlling acid leaching mechanism, several kinetic models have been developed ( Despite the advancement in knowledge and understanding of acid leaching behaviour of saprolitic (SAP) laterite ores by reported studies, there is persistence of a dearth of fundamental knowledge vital for marked improvement. In this work, isothermal, atmospheric acid leaching mechanism and kinetics of Ni/Co and gangue mineral elements from a Western Australian saprolitic ore, as well as the concomitant pulp rheology, are investigated. Specifically, the effect of batch leach time (up to 4 Polydispersed, − Isothermal, batch leaching tests were conducted for 40% ( The solid residues were first washed with pH Rheological measurements were carried out on the samples removed from 40% ( For direct yield stress measurements, the Vane technique was used. The advantage of this method is the minimized slip effect particularly for structured dispersions ( Mineralogical analyses of the ore as revealed by quantitative x-ray diffraction analysis (QXRD) and QEMSCAN is given in To understand the effect of 4 Chemical composition analysis of the ore before and after leaching showed a decrease in the concentration of all species upon acid leaching except that of Si ( To investigate the effect of time and temperature on leaching behaviour at pH  The correlation between extraction of Ni and Co and those of selected major gangue metal species (Fe, Mg and Mn) are displayed in  The acid consumption exhibited by the SAP ore is due to the greater acid neutralization capacity and dissolution rate of its smectite and Mg-bearing silicate host minerals ( The impact of mechanical shear forces due to agitation at 600 The BET specific surface area (SSA) of particles leached for 4 To understand the effect of dynamic pulp chemistry of 40% ( The more accurate pulp yield stresses directly measured by the vane technique are also shown in The rheology displayed by the SAP ore in this study is consistent with the behaviour of its dominant individual oxide and clay minerals ( The 4 Although the pulp viscosities observed in the present work (bounded by broken chain lines in To determine the most probable mechanism for the leaching of the SAP ore, the leaching data obtained were fitted to the shrinking core (SC) models (Eqs. By fitting the apparent rate constants obtained at 70 and 95  Likewise, Ni and Co associated with goethite are released when protons react with the FeOOH particle surface and break down the Fe–O bonds, releasing Fe species as well. For Ni and Co associated with smectite clay mineral, H The results in this study provide insights on the influence of time (4 Temperature is shown to have significant impact on the leaching behaviour whilst slurry agitation rate in the range 600–1000 The overall acid consumption was significantly greater at higher (640 Slurry viscosity and shear yield stress dramatically increased with time in a manner reminiscent of gelation and this is attributed to changes in pulp chemistry due to leaching. The rheology enhancement, however, did not have a noticeable impact on the overall leaching kinetics. The leaching of Ni and Co from the SAP ore followed a first order, chemical reaction-controlled, shrinking core mechanism with apparent E The financial support of the
