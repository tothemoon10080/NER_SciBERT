Solubility data of solutes in supercritical fluids (SCF) are crucial for designing extraction processes, such as extraction using SCF or micronization of drug powders. A new empirical equation is proposed to correlate solute solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2) with temperature, pressure and density of pure SC CO2. The proposed equation is ln

                     3 are the model constants calculated by least squares method, P (bar) is the applied pressure, T is temperature (K) and ρ is the density of pure SC CO2. The accuracy of the proposed model and three other empirical equations employing P, T and ρ variables was evaluated using 16 published solubility data sets by calculating the average of absolute relative deviation (AARD). The mean AARD for the proposed model is 7.46 (±4.54) %, which is an acceptable error when compared with the experimental uncertainty. The AARD values for other equations were 11.70 (±23.10), 6.895 (± 3.81) and 6.39 (±6.41). The mean AARD of the new equation is significantly lower than that obtained from Chrastil et al. model and has the same accuracy as compared with Bartle et al. and Mèndez-Santiago–Teja model. The proposed model presents more accurate correlation for solubility data in SC CO2. It can be employed to speed up the process of SCF applications in industry.average-absolute-relative deviation constants in Eq. constants in Eq. constants in Eq. the model constants in Eq. effective hydrogen bond acidity constants in Eq. effective hydrogen bond basicity the curve-fitting parameters in Eq. the model constants in Eq. enhancement factor ( sum of the enthalpies of vaporization and solvation of solute (J enthalpy of sublimation of the solute (J individual absolute relative deviations constants in Jafari Nejad et al. model, Eq. linear salvation energy relationship the model constants in Eq. the number of experimental data points pressure (bar) sublimation pressure of solute (bar) standard pressure of 1 constants in Eq. density (kg a reference density assumed as 700 reduced density ideal gas constant (J the dipolarity/polarizability solubility (kg supercritical fluid extraction supercritical fluid supercritical carbon dioxide temperature (K) reduced temperature McGowen's intrinsic volume for the solute (m the molar volume of the solid (m molecular weight of supercritical fluid (kg molecular weight of solute (kg the mole fraction solubility of the solute in the supercritical phase the calculated solubility of solute the experimental solubility of solute the solubility parameter of SC CO solubility parameter of the solid (bar In the past two decades, there has been an increasing interest in the use of supercritical fluids (SCFs) as an alternative to the use of organic solvents in many industrial applications, such as in chemical and biochemical reactions, extraction and purification processes, particle production or, more recently, in materials and polymer processing. Supercritical fluid technology is becoming increasingly popular in the chemical and pharmaceutical areas. In addition to applications in food, petroleum and chemical industries, there are a number of applications in the pharmaceutical industry including particle size reduction of drugs, preparation of drug-loaded microspheres and microemulsions ( Carbon dioxide is the most commonly used supercritical fluid. The critical temperature and pressure of carbon dioxide are relatively low (304 Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) using an extractant supercritical CO Solubility data in supercritical fluids are important information for the design of extraction process. Mathematical modeling of solubility data in supercritical fluids could also provide better understanding of the dissolution phenomenon and can be used for solubility prediction at interested pressures and temperatures after measuring a minimum number of experimental data, which could speed up the development of a supercritical fluid process. In the mathematical modeling of solubility data in supercritical fluids, one should keep in mind that the solubility systems can be categorized in three groups, a single solute in a supercritical fluid, mixed solutes in a supercritical fluid and a single solute in mixed supercritical fluids or supercritical fluid plus an organic solvent. Different aspects of the solubility of mixed solutes in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO Models derived from equations of state need complicated computational procedures that are not provided in commonly used commercial software. Also, these models employ the solute properties, such as critical properties, acentric factor, molar volumes and vapor pressure, which often cannot be easily determined experimentally. The numerical values of the solute properties can affect solubility predictions using models derived from equations of state. For example, The empirical models are based on simple error minimization using least squares method and, for most of them; there is no need to use physicochemical properties. In this study, our focus was on calculating the solubility of a single solute in SC CO The solubility (   Although  Based on the theory of dilute solutions, The next model correlates the mole fraction solubility of a solute (     Reviewing published experimental solubility data in SC CO Non-linear relationship between ln Non-linear relationship between ln Linear relationship between ln Considering the terms mentioned and in order to provide more accurate solubility calculations, the following empirical equation is proposed: The individual absolute relative deviations (IARD) of calculated solubilities from observed values are used as an accuracy criterion to compare the calculated solubilities with experimental values. IARD was calculated by: The average-absolute-relative-deviation (AARD), defined as: In this equation, The available solubility data (in mole fraction) of compounds have been collected from the literature. The details of the data and their references are listed in In order to compare the accuracy of the proposed correlation with the other models, it is assumed that all the experimental data are correct. In this study, just the solubility data of TBP ( It should be noted that in this study the constants of different models are calculated by least squares method. Jouyban et al. obtained an equation empirically from correlating density of pure SC CO In In Careful examination of In conclusion, the proposed model produces reasonably accurate correlation of the mole fraction solubility of solutes in SC CO
