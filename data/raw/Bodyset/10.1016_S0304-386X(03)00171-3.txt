This special issue contains selected papers among the 156 presented at the International Biohydrometallurgy Symposium—IBS 2001, held in Ouro Preto, Brazil, on September 16–19, 2001. The 14th symposium of the IBS series provided an international forum in which the progress and applications of biohydrometallurgy were addressed by representatives of five continents. Within the various topics covered during the symposium, we may highlight the progress in understanding the bioleaching processes and applying new ideas to commercial applications. The increasing role of biohydrometallurgical processes in reducing the environmental impact of industrial activities was also apparent. We wish to express our appreciation to authors and participants. Acknowledgments are also due to the reviewer corps who took the time to carefully read and constructively criticize the contributions to this special issue. The high technical standard of this volume should also be credited to their important collaboration. Finally, we hope that this special issue provides not only a record of the recent progress but also become a basis for further advancement in this field of biohydrometallurgy.
