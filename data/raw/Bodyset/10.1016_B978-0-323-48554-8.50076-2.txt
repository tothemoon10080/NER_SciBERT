 Type I = comminuted fractures due to axial loading; stable if contralateral side is intact Type II = occipital condyle fracture with skull base fractures; most of these are stable Type III = avulsion fracture due to tensile force on alar ligaments; may show occipitocervical instability Recent data (Maserati 2009) suggests that initial evaluation should be primarily concerned with identification of craniocervical malalignment. Fusion or halo used in patients with initial scans show fracture and malalignment with rigid cervical collar with delayed imaging follow-up for all others. Complete (disassociation) or partial (subluxation) ligamentous disruption between occiput and C1, which can occur in 1 of 3 directions: (1) Anterior superior displacement of cranium relative to spine most common; (2) pure distraction injury with superior displacement of cranium; or (3) posterior dislocation of cranium which is least common. Numerous measurement techniques have been used to assess craniovertebral junction trauma, many of which were 1st defined in the plain film era. Many of these measurements have been superseded by the direct soft tissue visualization afforded by CT and MR. There is reasonable literature support for use of the following measurements.   Single side condylar distance measurement of > 2 mm is also considered abnormal in adults. The 2-mm upper limit of C0-C1 spacing also applies to children up to 18 years of age. Other measurements such as the Powers ratio and Lee lines do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to recommend their use. The Harris “rule of 12” for the BDI and basion-axial interval are for plain film use only and so are very limited given the use of CT for acute trauma evaluation.  Anterior arch = vertical or transverse with avulsion from longus colli Anterior arch bilateral fractures with posterior atlantoaxial dislocation = plow fracture Lateral mass = stable if lateral ring intact; rare Posterior arch = common Jefferson = combined lateral mass displacement relative to C2 of 6.9 mm indicates disruption of transverse ligament and potential for instability  Nonphysiologic motion between C1-C2 Wide variety of causes → transverse ligament rupture (most common) → odontoid fracture → unstable Jefferson fracture → fracture of lateral mass of C1 or C2 → unilateral alar ligament rupture → alar and tectorial membrane rupture  Type I = rotation about dens without anterior translation [no increase in atlantodental interval (ADI)] Type II = rotation about 1 lateral mass with anterior translation of 3-5 mm (ADI) (transverse ligament injury) Type III = rotation about lateral mass with anterior translation > 5 mm (transverse and alar ligament injury) Type IV = posterior dislocation of C1 behind dens (rare, usually fatal)  Type I = avulsion at tip of odontoid Type II = transverse fracture of dens above C2 body Type III = fracture involving superior portion of C2 body  Type I = bilateral pars fractures with < 3-mm anterior subluxation (stable) Type II = displacement of pars fracture + anterior translation of C2 with discoligamentous injury Type III = pars fractures with C2-C3 facet dislocations  Type I = extension teardrop fracture of anterior inferior endplate of C2 Type II = horizontal shear fracture through body (more caudal than type III odontoid fracture) Type III = C2 body burst fracture Type IV = unstable sagittal cleavage fractures  Simple compression fracture Anterior subluxation = posterior ligament disruption Bilateral interfacetal dislocation = unstable Flexion teardrop fracture = unstable Clay shoveler's fracture: Avulsion of spinous process of C7-T1  Unilateral facet dislocation (locked facet) May have associated facet fracture Radiograph shows forward displacement of vertebra < 1/2 AP diameter of cervical vertebral body  Pillar fracture  Jefferson fracture = fractures of both anterior and posterior rings with 2, 3, or 4 parts with radial displacement Burst fracture = middle column involvement with bony retropulsion  Hyperextension dislocation C1 anterior arch avulsion fracture = longus colli insertion around anterior tubercle of C1 Extension teardrop fracture of C2 C1 posterior arch fracture = compressed between occiput and C2 spinous process Lamina fracture = between articular mass and spinous process Hangman's fracture = bilateral pars fractures of C2 Hyperextension fracture: Dislocation = bilateral facet fracture ± dislocation  Uncinate process fracture  3 major components including morphology of spinal column disruption, integrity of discoligamentous complex, and neurologic status Within each component, subgroups are graded from least to most severe  Superseded by Denis classification Anterior column = anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), vertebral body, disc, posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) Posterior column = skeletal and ligamentous structures posterior to PLL  Anterior = ALL, anulus, anterior vertebral body Middle = posterior wall of vertebral body, anulus, PLL Posterior = facets, posterior elements, posterior ligaments 3 column model also relevant to lower cervical injuries   Axial load force;
