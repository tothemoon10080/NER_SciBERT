The pyrolysis kinetics of three different kinds of fresh biomass (grass: triple A, wheat straw, corn straw) in nitrogen flow were studied by thermogravimetric analysis at five different heating rates. The kinetic parameters of the pyrolysis process were calculated using the method of Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and the mechanism of reactions were investigated using the method of Popescu. It was found that the values of activation energy varied in different temperature ranges. The pyrolysis processes are well described by the models of Zhuravlev (Zh) and valid for diffusion-controlled between 200 °C and 280 °C, by Ginstling-Brounshtein (G-B), valid for diffusion-control between 280 °C and 310 °C, for first-order chemical reaction between 310°C and 350 °C, by Zhuravlev (Zh) valid for diffusion-control between 350 °C and 430 °C and by the one-way transport model when temperatures are over 430 °C.
