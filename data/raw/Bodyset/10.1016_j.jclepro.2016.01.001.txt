Swift development of electric vehicle (EV) absolutely produces enormous amounts of spent EV Li-ion batteries (LIBs), hence more studies should be performed to seek cheap, efficient, safe and eco-friendly ways for the recovery of spent EV LIBs. In this work, release of valuable Li, Co, Mn and Ni from three typical spent EV LIBs cathode LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 by bioleaching at 1% pulp density was explored for the first time. The results showed the maximum extraction efficiency of Li occurred in the sulfur–At system, indicating that Li release was due to acid solution by biogenic H2SO4; whereas the mixed energy source-mixed culture system harvested the highest dissolution yield for Co, Ni and Mn than other systems, suggesting these metals were mobilized by a combined work of Fe2+ reduction and acid dissolution. Moreover, a non-contact mechanism accounted for Li extraction, while a contact mechanism between the cathodes and cells was essential for mobilization of Co, Ni and Mn. Due to the enhancement effect in cell growth, pH adjustment greatly improved bioleaching performance, an average extraction efficiency of 4 valuable metals from the resistant LiNixCoyMn1−x−yO2 reached more than 95%, especially the release efficiencies of Co and Ni rose from 43.5% to 96% and from 38.3% to 97%, respectively. The rather high extraction efficiencies of the valuable metals suggest that the cheap autotrophic bioleaching is capable of recovery of the spent EV LIBs.Rapid development of electric vehicle (EV) industry strongly boosts the application of power batteries, leading to inevitable production of obsolete power batteries in large quantity ( Since invented by Sony in 1992, LIBs have been widely used in consumer electronics (CE) ( Hydrometallurgical processes are the most extensively used to release valuable metals from spent batteries ( Up to now, there are a great number of studies about the recovery of Li and Co from LiCoO Bioleaching is regarded as a promising technology to replace conventional acid-based chemical leaching owing to its low cost, high safety and environmental friendliness ( In this work, the cheap autotrophic bioleaching was employed to recover the valuable metals from EV LIBs for the first time. Three aspects were conducted for the purpose: (I) Extraction behavior of Li, Co, Ni and Mn from three typical EV LIBs cathodes LiMn The obsolete EV LIBs were kindly provided by an EV LIBs manufacturing company (CITIC GUOAN MGL, Beijing, China). In order to ensure the experiment safety, the EV LIBs were fully discharged for 24 h with 5% mass fraction NaCl solution and then air dried naturally ( The sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and iron (II)-oxidizing bacteria (IOB), which were isolated from a mine site in Shanxi Province, north China, and were identified respectively The bioleaching media were obtained by adding energy sources into the basic medium containing (NH The three types of bioleaching systems were used to extract Li, Co, Ni and Mn from three EV LIBs cathodes LiNi During extraction of Li, Co, Ni and Mn from LiNi One gram of spent LiNi The MS-MC leaching system generated H In this work, the pH value of the MS-MC leaching system was kept at 1.0 by adding exogenous H The pH value of media was determined using a precise pH meter (HI8424, Hanna, Italy), the ORP value (Eh) (HI2221, Hanna, Italy) was determined by portable ORP meter (Ag/AgCl electrode as reference one). The metals release content was detected by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Optima 8300). The total iron concentration, Fe The extraction efficiency of Li, Co, Ni and Mn from three typical EV LIBs cathodes LiNi Different spent EV LIBs cathode requires different bioleaching system for the purpose of recovery. Of the tested three cathodes, LiMn For analyzing bioleaching mechanisms of LiNi The release of Li by a direct acid dissolution and extraction of Ni, Co and Mn by a coupling reaction of reduction and acid dissolution consumed a large amount of H Different from Li, the maximum extraction efficiency of Mn, Co and Ni occurred in the MS-MC system, higher than that in the sulfur- Accompanying with variation in pH, ORP, Fe Extraction efficiency comparison of 4 target metals from LiNi In order to further prove the hypothesis that Li extraction was due to acid (H Although the MS-MC system achieved high extraction efficiency of 92% for Li and 93% for Mn, low release efficiency of 43.5% for Co and 38.3% for Ni were attained. Based on bioleaching mechanisms exploration, poor extraction performance might be due to the poor growth of cells which adversely affected the production of H It was observed that pH adjustment evidently promoted the bioleaching performance, average extraction efficiency of the 4 valuable metals reached above 95%, especially the release efficiency of Co and Ni remarkably increased from 43.5% to 38.3%–96% and 97%, respectively ( In contrast, owing to possible consumption of Fe The growth and activity of the bioleaching cells require suitable pH, temperature and aeration. As acidophilus cells, a lower pH is especially of importance for their growth and activity. Because the spent batteries cathodes always contain a high concentration of alkaline matters as oxides or hydroxides, the acid consumption in bioleaching of spent batteries is much more than that in bioleaching of other solid materials such as ores or polluted soil. As a result, a sharp rise in pH always occurs in spite of biogenic H In the past studies, the bioleaching of spent batteries is generally conducted using pure culture such as The bioleaching easily extracted the valuable metals from both LiFePO The cheap autotrophic bioleaching is qualified for tackling the spent EV LIBs at 1.0% of pulp density. The sulfur-A.t system harvested 98% of Li release from LiFePO We highly appreciate financial support from the
