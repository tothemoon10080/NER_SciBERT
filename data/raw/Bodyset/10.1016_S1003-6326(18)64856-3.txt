Pilot scale chlorination of TiO2 was carried out with CO as reducing agent. The experimental analysis and modeling of chlorination process of TiO2 in the presence of CO and Cl2 in a semi-continuous fluidized bed reactor were aimed. Chlorination process was continuously monitored by measuring the amount of produced TiCl4 with time. The effects of different operating parameters including chlorination temperature, feedstock particle size and size distribution, amount of feedstock and Cl2 and CO flow rates on the conversion were systematically investigated. A gradual increase in chlorination temperature led to monotonous increase of conversion rate. Conversion decreased with increased particle size of feedstock. An increase in loaded feedstock led to a decrease in reaction conversion. A model was proposed to predict conversion, particle size distribution and mole fraction of components in gas phase as reaction proceeds. A good agreement between conversions predicted by the model and experimental data under various operating conditions was observed.
