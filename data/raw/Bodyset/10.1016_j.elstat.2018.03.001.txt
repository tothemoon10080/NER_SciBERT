A numerical model in which OpenFOAM® is used to model the electrostatic field resulting from corona discharge in single-channel wire-plate electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) was applied to systematically study the shielding effect that can arise between adjacent discharge electrodes. It is shown that the OpenFOAM model is capable of accurately quantifying the extent of shielding, and that the degree of shielding is predicted to increase as the spacing between the cylindrical discharge electrodes is decreased. This increase in the degree of shielding consequently resulted in a reduction of the discharge current. The numerical model was also used to quantify the effect of various other ESP parameters on the degree of shielding by studying the space charge density and current density distributions, and the plate-to-plate spacing was found to be the most influential parameter. By incorporating the electrostatic field obtained from the OpenFOAM model in a CFD model based in Star-CCM+®, it is further shown that a decrease in particle collection efficiency is predicted to occur when the shielding intensity increases. Such a systematic study to quantify the extent of shielding and its effect on ESP performance in terms of particle collection efficiency has not received much attention in the literature to date. Predicting the incidence and extent of shielding as a function of geometric ESP parameters are also invaluable to avoid laboratory or pilot scale results that are biased because of the occurrence of shielding.Electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are still widely used for the removal of particulate matter (PM) from industrial gas streams since these units offers advantages such as long service life, low maintenance requirements, excellent reliability, and relatively flexible operation compared to fabric filter units [ To date, numerical modeling studies of ESP processes have mainly focused on the solution of the governing equations involving the complex corona discharge for small laboratory-scale ESPs using methods such as the finite element (FEM)-method of characteristics (MoC) [ One way of increasing the particle charging rate and therefore the particle collection efficiency is by increasing the discharge (corona) current (I) achieved under a specific applied discharge electrode voltage (V). This may be accomplished by changing the discharge electrode design [ This paper is aimed at addressing this shortcoming, and therefore a previously validated 3-D numerical model [ The open source code, OpenFOAM The governing equations used for modeling the electrostatic field, the continuous phase fluid dynamics, the particle dynamics, and particle charging as well as boundary conditions are summarized in The corona current and current density distributions at the collector plate were validated against the published experimental measurement results of Kasdi [ Following the validation of the numerical model using the case studies from literature ( The boundary conditions for gas flow, electric potential, space charge density and particles are summarized in Apart from model validation results using three sets of literature data, the effect of varying wire-to-wire spacing, plate-to-plate spacing, number of discharge wires and applied discharge electrode voltage on the intensity of shielding is reported. Subsequently, the relative influence of the shielding effect, as a function of the abovementioned parameters, on the particle collection efficiency is also reported using the previously validated CFD model [ Although the results of all parameter variations, as summarized in The simulation results for current density at the collecting plate surface (calculated as the average value across the collecting plate surface corresponding to a particular discharge electrode voltage) as compared with the experimental results of Lawless [ The electrostatic (OpenFOAM) model was further validated against the experimental results obtained by Kasdi [ The reduction in the corona current with decreasing wire-to-wire spacing as shown in It is clear from From the preceding results, it is clear that the current numerical model yielded accurate results that were in good agreement with previously published experimental measurements and numerical modeling results. The numerical model used in this study was therefore subsequently applied to systematically study the influence of various ESP parameters on the degree of shielding and its effect on ESP performance. This was done using the single-channel ESP parameters as summarized in To study the incidence of shielding as a function of the ESP plate-to-plate spacing, simulations were performed for three plate-to-plate spacings (p) of 220, 160 and 100 mm respectively. A fixed number of four discharge wire-electrodes were used with a constant discharge electrode voltage of 45 kV. In all cases, a fixed wire-to-wire spacing (w) of 116 mm was simulated. The current density distribution resulting from the corona discharge is a combination of the ion mobility, electric field magnitude, and the space charge density. In addition to the current density distribution, the space-charge density distribution was therefore also investigated of which representative results are shown in The associated one-dimensional space charge density and current density distribution along the length of the ESP channel (longitudinal, or It is also clear from A higher discharge electrode voltage is generally required (even in the absence of shielding) to achieve a constant discharge current with increasing plate-to-plate spacing, as also attested by the corona onset voltage, which increases as the plate-to-plate spacing is increased. Since the above analysis was performed at a constant discharge electrode voltage, the increase in the degree of shielding with increasing plate-to-plate spacing ( The influence of the wire-to-wire spacing on the degree of shielding was studied using a constant plate-to-plate spacing (p) of 100 mm, an applied discharge electrode voltage of 45 kV and four discharge wires. Wire-to-wire spacings (w) of 50, 80 and 116 mm were simulated, and the resulting space charge density, current density, and corona current vs. discharge electrode voltage is shown in From the results shown in Comparing The effect of the number of discharge wire-electrodes on shielding and the corona discharge characteristics was investigated for plate-to-plate spacings of 100 and 160 mm, at a constant applied discharge electrode voltage of 45 kV, and by varying the number of discharge wires between 4 and 8. In these simulations, the positions of the two outer discharge wires were fixed, and since the ESP (collecting plate) length was also fixed ( Again, the space charge and current density distribution results as given in To avoid the negative effects of shielding, it is therefore clear that the wire-to-wire and plate-to-plate spacing together with the electrode type, i.e. the resulting discharge characteristics, need to be carefully considered when increasing the number of discharge electrodes with the aim of increasing the corona current. This is because the suppression of the corona current through shielding caused by an ineffective plate-to-plate spacing and a diminishing wire-to-wire spacing when increasing the number of wire-electrodes would lead to a reduction in the particle collection efficiency as shown in Section The current density vector plots as shown in It is evident from The effect of the applied discharge electrode voltage on the degree of shielding was analyzed by varying the applied discharge electrode voltage while keeping the plate-to-plate spacing fixed at 100 mm and using five wire electrodes. It was found that the magnitude of the current density increased as the applied discharge electrode voltage was increased, but that the degree of shielding (the ratio of the peak value of current density at the outer wires to that of the peak value of the current density at the inner wires) was not affected significantly with increasing applied discharge electrode voltage ( Simulations were also performed to study the influence of shielding as a result of varying plate-to-plate spacing and a varying number of discharge wires, or in other words a varying wire-to-wire spacing. Particle injection, charging and collection were simulated using the previously published simulation method [ The simulated particle collection efficiencies obtained when using plate-to-plate spacing of 100 mm as a function of the number of discharge wires and applied discharge electrode voltage is shown in From the collection efficiency results of It was shown that the current numerical model yielded accurate results that were in good agreement with previously published experimental measurements and numerical modeling results of corona discharge in ESPs. The model was subsequently applied to quantify the influence of various ESP parameters on the degree of shielding, and by analyzing the current density and space charge density distributions it was found that the plate-to-plate spacing had the most significant influence. Nonetheless, the wire-to-wire spacing and number of discharge wires were also found to have a noticeable effect on the degree of shielding. In contrast, the applied discharge electrode voltage was found to have a negligible influence on the degree of shielding. Due to the incidence of shielding, it was also shown that particle collection is markedly reduced when the number of discharge wire-electrodes is increased beyond a certain threshold. It was therefore shown in this study that the plate-to-plate spacing should be reduced to accommodate a larger number of discharge wires to achieve an increased discharge current and to avoid or reduce the detrimental effects of shielding on corona current and particle collection. In essence, the current model provides a means of quantifying the extent of shielding and its effect on ESP performance, an aspect that has not received much attention to date. Although only simple cylindrical discharge electrodes were analyzed in this study, the numerical model may also be extended to analyze shielding effects that arise with more sophisticated discharge electrodes, provided that the discharge current produced by each individual discharge electrode in a multi-electrode assembly is measured.
