The author of this papers regrets that there was an error in the University name which was left unnoticed. The correct name of the university is “University of Sistan and Baluchestan” but in the paper the name was incorrectly written as University of Sistan and Bluchestan. In other words the word “Bluchestan” is not correct. The correct spelling is “Baluchestan”.
