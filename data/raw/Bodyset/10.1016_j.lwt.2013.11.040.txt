Dried fruits and nuts are considered as healthy snacks and they are often consumed together in the Turkish diet. In order to investigate the effect of codigestion of dried fruits (figs, apricots, raisins) together with nuts (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts), total phenolics (TP) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) have been evaluated spectrophotometrically at different phases of simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestion, using an in vitro model. TP, ABTS and CUPRAC results revealed that for all fruit–nut mixtures, the amount recovered in the dialyzed fraction was lower than the recovery of fruits or nuts alone, indicating an antagonistic effect. On the other hand, DPPH results showed that for fig–walnut, fig–hazelnut and apricot–hazelnut mixtures the quantity recovered in the dialyzed fractions were 35–107% higher than the recovery of fruits or nuts alone, representing a synergistic effect. Similarly, FRAP results also demonstrated a synergistic effect in case of fig–walnut, apricot–walnut and apricot–hazelnut mixtures (10–74% higher recovery). Current study provides valuable insights into the changes taking place during in vitro GI digestion of dried fruits and nuts.Epidemiological studies have shown that the high intake of fruits and vegetables has been associated with a reduced the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancer. These potential beneficial effects have been attributed to the presence of bioactive compounds, such as phenolics, that show antioxidant properties by acting as free radical scavengers or metal chelators, reducing the reactions that produce reactive oxygen species ( According to FAO statistics 2011, Turkey is the world's leading producer of many fruits and nuts including figs, apricots and hazelnuts ( Different methodologies have been employed to evaluate the  Dried fruits and nuts are considered as healthy snacks and they are often consumed together in the Turkish diet. To our knowledge, no previous study evaluated the impact of consumption of dried fruits together with nuts on bioaccessibility of polyphenols using an The different dried fruits and nuts were collected as triplicates from a local market in Istanbul, Turkey. The varieties and origins of the samples are specified in In this study, chemicals with analytical purity were used. For simulation of Three independent extractions for each sample were carried out as described previously by The The total phenolic content (TP) was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent as described previously by The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was estimated by four different assays. The 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assays were performed according to For each assay, samples were analyzed in triplicate and average values were reported. Data were collected from three independent experiments and reported as mean ± SD. For multiple comparisons, data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software (version 20.0) for the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Duncan's new multiple range test was used to analyze differences between treatments ( The impact of GI digestion on TP is shown in The influence of GI digestion on free radical scavenging activity determined by ABTS assay is shown in Free radical scavenging activity initially present, as determined in methanolic extracts by the DPPH assay, was lower compared to PG fractions for almost all samples (walnuts, hazelnuts and raisin–nut mixtures are exceptions) ( As shown in Confirming the results obtained for TP and other TAC assays (ABTS, DPPH and FRAP), CUPRAC assay also showed that initially the highest level of TAC was found in walnuts, while the lowest was in almonds with 27-fold difference ( The correlation coefficients ( Differences were observed between the two radical scavenging assays (ABTS and DPPH). Theoretically, alterations in the structure of antioxidants following digestion may affect their reactivity with the formation of nitrogen radical which is biologically less relevant in the DPPH assay, leading to the underestimation of TAC ( Comparing No studies to date have reported the consequences of codigestion of dried fruits and nuts on TP and TAC following the This study was financially supported by the
