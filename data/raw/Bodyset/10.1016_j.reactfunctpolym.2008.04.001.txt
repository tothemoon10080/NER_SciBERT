Cyphos® IL 101, a tetraalkyl-phosphonium chloride salt, (ionic liquid, IL) was immobilized in capsules prepared by ionotropic gelation in calcium chloride solutions. These resins were tested for Pd recovery from HCl solutions. The sorption performance is slightly controlled by the concentration of HCl, in the range 0–2M, with maximum sorption capacities close to 130–145mgPdg−1 resin (i.e. 1.2–1.4mmolPdg−1 resin or 0.96–1.07mmolPdmmol−1 Cyphos IL-101).

Decreasing the amount of IL immobilized in the resin improves the rational use of the IL (higher molar ratio Pd/IL). The presence of other anions, for example nitrate, or other chloro-metal complexes,

                      decreases Pd binding, while other metals that do not form anionic complexes under the selected experimental conditions (for example Cu or Ni) do not interfere with Pd uptake. The pseudo-second-order rate equation was successfully used to model the kinetic profiles. Kinetics are mainly controlled by intraparticle diffusion resistance (low effect of agitation speed on the kinetic profiles). Crank’s equation was used to model intraparticle diffusion, giving intraparticle diffusivities close to 0.7–1.5×10−12

Desorption of the metal loaded resins can be performed using thiourea (in 0.1M HCl solution) or HNO3 (5M). The recycling and re-use of the resin was successfully demonstrated over three cycles; at the third desorption step a partial degradation of the resin was observed.The recovery of precious metals from leachates produced by the treatment of waste materials is a challenge for the development of catalyst-based industries. Limited resources and the increasing demand for precious metals make it important to recycle these strategic metals for the automotive catalyst and chemical synthesis sectors Many resins have been designed for the uptake of metal ions from acidic solutions containing imidazole Biopolymers and derivatives have been tested for the removal of a number of metal ions Ionic liquids have recently received a great deal of attention due to their unique properties The present work focuses on the evaluation of Pd sorption properties for a new resin based on the immobilization of an ionic liquid (Cyphos The Cyphos The synthesis of the Cyphos-impregnated capsules was performed in two steps: 25 The composite solution was then extruded through a nozzle (internal diameter 0.6 The beads were maintained in the coagulation bath overnight before being rinsed with 0.1 The characterization of the resins was performed according to the following procedures. The water content of the resin was determined by weight loss at 60 For the evaluation of equilibrium performance a volume of acid solution (30 Sorption isotherms were plotted by mixing fixed amounts of resin (i.e. 20 Uptake kinetics were investigated by adding, under agitation, a known amount of resin (i.e. 100 Desorption was performed by 24  The influence of the concentration of HCl on Pd binding was investigated over the range 0.1–5 Chloro-anionic species are the only species present in the solution: To evaluate the respective contributions of protons and chloride ions to the impact of HCl concentration on Pd recovery, a second series was performed with the HCl concentration fixed at 0.1 The distribution coefficient reached a maximum at 0.5 The effect of HCl concentration is thus the result of the combined impacts of chloride anions and protons, with a much greater effect of protons. To evaluate more precisely the impact of HCl concentration, complete sorption isotherms were performed at three HCl concentrations: 0.1 Increasing HCl concentration decreased the maximum sorption capacity ( Langmuir model: Increasing the concentration of HCl had a limited (less than 15%) but detectable impact on the sorption isotherms. The maximum sorption capacity reveals the partitioning of the metal between the aqueous phase and the resin at saturation of the material. Taking into account IL content ( The extraction may involve 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometric ratio between IL and Pd(II) depending on metal speciation and species affinity for IL. Additionally, the binding could occur through interaction between phosphonium cation and an ion pair formed of tetrachloropalladate species partially bound to proton. The weak effect of HCl concentration is consistent with the results obtained with Cyanex 301 encapsulated materials To verify the stoichiometric relationship between Pd and the IL, several resins were prepared with different contents of ionic liquids ( For practical reasons, most of the experiments were performed with dry resins, the reproducibility of experiments being easier with dry particles. Additionally, high water content represents a serious drawback for industrial applications (low volumetric sorption capacity, based on wet resin mass). It is important to check how drying could influence the sorption performance. Does drying limit the availability and/or accessibility of reactive sites? As pointed out in  The sorption kinetics may be controlled by various diffusion mechanisms: (a) bulk diffusion, (b) film diffusion, and (c) intraparticle diffusion. The agitation speed is one of the experimental parameters of critical importance for film diffusion. The agitation speed was varied between 150 Two models were used for the description of kinetic profiles based on the pseudo-second-order equation described by Ho where The intraparticle diffusion coefficient ( And The change of agitation velocity did not significantly affect the order of magnitude of kinetic coefficients ( The next step in the study of uptake kinetics consisted in varying Pd concentration in the solution and also the conditioning of the resin. The second important piece of information obtained from The differences between the series are essentially detectable in the second section of the kinetics: within the first two hours of contact the differences are not very marked. Intraparticle diffusivity was not significantly affected by Pd concentration (i.e. between 0.7 The resistance to intraparticle diffusion does not appear to be controlled by initial metal concentration (at least at low metal concentration, below 30    The recovery of Pd from industrial effluents may be controlled by the presence of competitor ions, including anions (chloride, see above; nitrate or metal complexes) or other metal cations. The addition of sodium nitrate slightly influenced Pd sorption. In the range 0.1–1 The addition of copper and nickel did not affect Pd sorption whatever the concentration in the investigated range (i.e. below 5 Since PGMs readily form chloro-anionic species it is possible to anticipate a competition effect from platinum. In HCl solutions, platinum also forms chloro-anionic species that may compete with palladium anionic species by reacting with phosphonium groups in the capsules. A series of sorption experiments was performed with different molar Pd/Pt ratios in 0.1  Desorption of loaded resins is a key step in the evaluation of the potential of a resin. Some sorbents designed for Pd and Pt recovery have proven to be quite difficult to recycle, limiting their interest for industrial applications. The impossibility of releasing sorbed metals usually leads to the degradation of the sorbent; this can be justified economically for raw and cheap materials, but it is prohibitory in the case of sophisticated and expensive sorbents. Several eluents were tested including 0.1 In a first step, the eluents were tested for different liquid/solid ratios, L/S ( Concentrated nitric acid (5 These preliminary results clearly demonstrate that these resins can be efficiently used for Pd binding over a minimum of three sorption/desorption cycles maintaining high sorption levels and desorption yields greater than 90%.
