A CaO sorbent with high reactivity for cyclic high temperature CO2 capture was synthesized using a standard sol–gel process with citric acid as the chelation agent. The cyclic CO2 capture performance of the new sorbent was compared with that of the sorbents derived from commercial micro- and nano-sized CaCO3. The new CaO sorbent achieved a high CO2 capture capacity of 0.51gCO2/gsorbent under mild calcination conditions and retained an acceptable CO2 capture capacity of 0.20gCO2/gsorbent under severe calcination conditions after 20 cycles, much higher than those of the sorbents derived from commercial CaCO3 under the same reaction conditions. In addition, the new sorbent had a very rapid reaction rate at the initial reaction stage, achieving a calcium conversion ratio of 60% within 20s. Microscopic images showed that well-dispersed particles with an average size of about 200nm were formed within the sorbent. The new sorbent also had a better sintering-resistant property than the other sorbents tested during multiple calcination/carbonation cycles.Calcium looping has recently received an increased amount of attention as a promising post combustion CO Several synthesis methods have been proposed to prepare calcium-based sorbents with high reactivity for calcium looping cycle ( We have proposed a sol–gel combustion process to synthesize CaO/La A standard sol–gel process was used to synthesize new CaO sorbents as follows:      In order to investigate the effect of the sol–gel process on the resulting sorbents, a simplified method was also applied to make a comparison. Predetermined amounts of analytical reagent-grade calcium nitrate tetrahydrate and citric acid monohydrate (or urea) were added to distilled water at a water to metal ion molar ratio of about 10:1 and a citric acid to metal ion molar ratio of 1:1 at room temperature. Then, the mixture was continuously stirred at 80 The main difference between the simplified and standard methods is that the both the sol and gelatin durations were significantly shortened in the simplified method. Also the amount of water in the simplified process is much less than that in the standard sol–gel process. For further comparison, analytical reagent and micrometer-grade CaCO The cyclic calcination/carbonation performance of the calcium-based sorbents was tested in a tube furnace with two compartments including a carbonation reactor and a calcination reactor, as described previously ( The microstructure of the calcined samples was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FSEM; SIRION200, FEI Inc.) with 20 The effect of the sol–gel process and different celation agents on the cyclic performance of the sorbents is shown in However, the carbonation conversions of the sorbents derived from the standard sol–gel method after 20 cycles were 38% and 47% respectively, for the sorbents using urea or citric acid as the chelation agent. Therefore, the chelation agent was one of the key factors determining sorbent performance when the sorbent was made using the standard sol–gel method. This was confirmed by further testing of lanthanum-doped sorbents, with results shown in The cyclic performance of the CaO sorbents derived from the standard sol–gel process (denoted as New-CaO) and that of the sorbents derived from micro- and nano-sized CaCO An reactivity decay model proposed by ( The results of curve fitting are compiled in  The effect of carbonation and calcination conditions on the performance of New-CaO is shown in  Preparation of the calcium-based sorbents using the proposed sol–gel process consisted of a number of physical processes and chemical reactions. The powder products obtained after the combustion presented a black and brown color as shown in The morphology of New-CaO was investigated by FSEM test and compared with those of commercial MC-CaO and NC-CaO, as seen in The BET surface area data are given in The proposed sol–gel method could be a useful method to produce high reactivity and sintering-resistant calcium-based sorbents for high temperature cyclic CO The standard sol–gel process using citric acid as the chelation agent is a potentially useful method for manufacturing calcium-based sorbents for high temperature cyclic CO The authors are grateful to the financial supports from
