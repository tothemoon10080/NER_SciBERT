The boundary conditions for an axial diffusion model were overviewed and then modified concerning the pulp layer boundaries in a flotation column. It has been confirmed through the transfer function representation that the four general boundary conditions for an axial diffusion model correspond to the particular cases of Wehner and Wilhelm's, which considers not only the reaction section itself but also those of its top and bottom sides.
                  Various mathematical models have been proposed for the pulp layer in a flotation column and the most popular one may be an axial diffusion with first order reaction model of one stage. They are, however, unable to estimate the behaviors of free particles which have not attached to bubbles at the pulp-froth interface.
                  In this study, therefore, the authors, represented the transportation of free particles in the pulp layer of a flotation column by the two-stage axial diffusion with first order reaction model. The Wehner and Wilhelm's, as well as Danckwerts' boundary conditions have been partly modified and then applied to the feed point, the pulp-froth interface and the tailing discharge point of the flotation column. The proposed models and their boundary conditions made it possible to estimate the behaviors of free particles at the pulp-froth interface.
