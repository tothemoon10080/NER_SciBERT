Recent studies on selective permeation of specific cations through a cation-exchange membrane in electrodialysis, modification of the membrane and electrodialysis method, are reviewed. The studies are classified (1) to prepare the composite of the cation-exchange membrane with other polymers such as conducting polymers and cationic polyelectrolytes, (2) to change cation-exchange groups from sulfonic acid groups, which are used in conventional membranes, to other groups such as phosphonic acid groups, and (3) to electrodialyze the mixed salt solution in the presence of chelate-forming agent such as poly(ethylene glycol), crown ethers, etc. Though the formation of the layers of the conducting polymers on the surface of the cation-exchange membrane is effective on selective permeation of monovalent cations to divalent cations through the membrane, mechanism of the selective permeation is different depending on species of the conducting polymers: due to sieving of sodium ions from multivalent cations by a tight polypyrrole layer and due to stronger electrostatic repulsion force of the cationic charge in a polyaniline layer to multivalent cations than to the monovalent, which is similar to the membrane having a cationic polyelectrolyte layer on the surface. When cation-exchange groups such as phosphonic acid groups, which are strongly interacted with divalent cations, are introduced in the membrane, monovalent cations selectively permeate through the membrane. However, current efficiency in electrodialysis decreases due to strong binding of divalent cations to the groups—inactivation of cation-exchange groups. Electrodialysis in the presence of chelate-forming agents is effective on the selective permeation of specific cations that have low complex formation constants with the agents through the membrane without any decrease in the current efficiency.Although various separation membranes such as membranes for microfiltration, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, pervaporation, gas separation and liquid membranes, etc. have been studied and industrially used, the ion-exchange membrane is one of the most advanced separation membranes among these separation membranes. The essential property of the cation-exchange membrane and anion-exchange membrane is to selectively permeate cations or anions through the membrane. Since the first publication of the preparation of the ion-exchange membrane, more than half a century has passed. The performance of the ion-exchange membranes has been extremely improved during this period due to extensive studies. For example, current efficiency of caustic soda production in chlor-alkali membrane process is more than 95% in the production of 35% (ca. 12N) caustic soda solution using ultrapure sodium chloride solution (concentrations of Ca The ion-exchange membrane is generally used in the solutions containing multi-ions: electrodialytic concentration of seawater to produce sodium chloride, desalination of saline water to produce potable water, demineralization of whey, acid and alkali recovery from waste acid Separation of specific cations from the mixture by electrodialysis is also important in hydrometallurgy together with acid recovery by membrane Many efforts to prepare cation-exchange membranes having permselectivity for specific cations and to find electrodialysis methods to separate specific cations from the mixture have been made for long-term by many researchers. In this work, recent studies on selective permeation of the specific cations through the cation-exchange membrane in electrodialysis, modification of the cation-exchange membrane and electrodialysis methods, were reviewed. Permselectivity among components in a mixture through non-porous separation membranes is governed by the difference of the affinity of respective components with the membrane and the difference of migration speed of the components in the membrane phase, e.g. gas separation membranes, membranes for pervaporation process, membranes for diffusion dialysis, which are also quite the same for reverse osmosis membranes. Permselectivity among cations through cation-exchange membranes in electrodialysis is also governed by the affinity of the cations with the membranes (ion-exchange equilibrium constant) and the difference of the migration speed of the respective cations in the membrane phase (mobility ratios among the cations). To simplify the system, a standard cation is decided (sodium ions are generally used as the standard cation) and the ratio of the permeated equivalent of a given cation to that of the standard cation is examined. Namely, permselectivity of a given cation is evaluated by the permeated equivalent of the cation when one equivalent of sodium ions permeates through the membrane. The permselectivity between cation M When a diffusion boundary layer exists at the membrane–solution interface of the desalting side, Ion-exchange equilibrium constants between cations have been studied in detail on cation-exchange resins. In general, multivalent cations more selectively ion-exchange with the resins than the monovalent and the cations with large atomic number selectively ion-exchange with the resins when the valence of the cations is the same. And these tendencies are emphasized with increasing cross-linkage of the resins Monovalent cation and anion permselective ion-exchange membranes have been industrially used for electrodialytic concentration of seawater to produce edible salt in Japan and other countries: to protect the precipitation of calcium sulfate in and on the anion-exchange membrane and to increase the efficiency of the production of sodium chloride. In the initial stage of the research, sieving of sodium ions from multivalent cations was tried by making the membrane matrix dense or by forming dense layers on the membrane surface, because the decrease in permeation of sulfate ions through the anion-exchange membrane was achieved by forming thinly dense layers on the membrane surfaces To make the membrane structure dense, phenol content, cross-linking agent, was increased in condensation type cation-exchange membrane composed of phenol, sodium Conducting polymers such as polyacetylene, polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc. have been actively studied and tried to use them to various fields due to their interesting properties: batteries When the cation-exchange membrane of sulfonic acid type was immersed in an aqueous pyrrole solution until equilibrium and then immersed in an aqueous oxidizing reagent, ferric chloride, solution, the membrane becomes extremely brittle so as to be impossible to measure permselectivity between cations It is apparent from above results that an asymmetric cation-exchange membrane, of which one surface of the membrane has a polypyrrole layer, can be prepared by contacting one surface of the ferric ion form cation-exchange membrane with aqueous pyrrole solution.  It was reported that a polypyrrole membrane, which is doped with anions of high molecular weight during electrochemical oxidation polymerization, changes in anion permselective or cation permselective by oxidation or reduction of the polypyrrole because polypyrrole has secondary amino groups Aniline also easily polymerizes and changes in a conducting polymer, polyaniline  It was proved from the remarkable decrease in the permeability coefficients of neutral molecules that sieving of sodium ions from calcium ions by the tight polypyrrole layer is a main reason of the decrease in When electrodialysis was carried out facing a polyaniline layer of the cation-exchange membrane with a single layer to the cathode side, Though both conducting polymers, polypyrrole and polyaniline, remarkably change permselectivity between cations, mechanism of the change is different each other.  To use this type of cation-exchange membranes is one of the key-technology to produce sodium chloride by electrodialytic concentration of seawater Though the layer having the similar structure to that shown in Cations having higher valence and smaller hydrated ionic radius become difficult to ion-exchange with the cation-exchange membrane having the cationic charged layer during electrodialysis due to stronger electrostatic repulsion force compared with cations with lower valence and larger ionic radius. Thus, The cationic charged layer formed by adsorption or by electrodeposition of the cationic polyelectrolyte on the surface of the cation-exchange membrane is detached from the surface during continuous long-term electrodialysis. Thus, many studies have been made to bond the cationic charged layer on the cation-exchange membranes by stable chemical bonding This type membrane also selectively permeates hydrogen ions compared with other cations Although a cation-exchange membrane composed of a thick layer with sulfonic acid groups and a thin layer with carboxylic acid groups (bilayer membrane) is used in chlor-alkali industry, sulfonic acid groups are used as cation-exchange groups in conventional cation-exchange membranes. However, the interaction between the cation-exchange groups of the membranes and cations should change depending on the groups, which ought to bring the change in the mobility ratio and ion-exchange equilibrium constant between cations. The cation-exchange membranes prepared by the condensation polymerization of salicylic acid, which acts as chelate-forming agent, phenol and formaldehyde was reported to examine such effect Phosphonic acid groups are also interesting as cation-exchange groups because the groups are dibasic and a major component of many biological systems. Many studies on cation-exchange resins having phosphonic acid groups  The ion-exchange equilibrium constant between alkaline earth metal cations and sodium ions of phosphonic acid membrane is higher than that of sulfonic acid membrane, and the mobility of the cations to sodium ions of the phosphonic acid membrane is lower than that of the sulfonic acid membrane. Accordingly, the current efficiency of the phosphonic acid membrane in electrodialysis is thought to decrease due to strong binding of the phosphonic acid groups to the alkaline earth metal cations, which causes inactivation of the groups. This is a similar phenomenon with the case of the cation-exchange membrane having imino acetic acid groups Because phosphonic acid groups strongly interact with alkaline earth metal cations, a cationic charged layer is formed on the membrane surface to protect ion-exchange of the alkaline earth metal cations with the membrane. Consequently, permeation of the alkaline earth metal cations through the phosphonic acid membrane remarkably decreases due to the rejection of the cations on the membrane surface and low mobility of the small quantity of the cations entered in the membrane phase, and the current efficiency increases in the same level as that of sulfonic acid membrane. When cation-exchange groups, which strongly interact with specific cations, are introduced in the membrane, migration speed of the specific cations through the membrane decreases and the ratio of the specific cations in the membrane phase increases. The transport number which both factors are canceled each other is observed. In some case, the current efficiency decreases and voltage drop across the membrane is also affected by the specific cations. The cationic polyelectrolyte was reported to be continuously or periodically added in the feed seawater to form a cationic charged layer on the surface of the cation-exchange membrane in the industrial process of electrodialytic concentration of seawater Because oxygen of ether compounds is negatively polarized Poly(ethylene glycol) of the low molecular weight has good affinity to the anion-exchange membrane, which causes the remarkable weight increase of the membrane by immersing the membrane in poly(ethylene glycol) When electrodialysis was carried out using the cation-exchange membrane impregnated with poly(ethylene glycol), the glycol in the membrane elutes from the membrane during electrodialysis and therefore the effect of the glycol on transport number between cations cannot be observed. Thus, after the membrane was immersed in the glycols until equilibrium, a mixed salt solution containing the glycols of a given concentration is electrodialyzed as the desalting side solution for the glycols to exist in the membrane equilibrating with the concentration of the glycols in the solution    To clarify the reason of the decrease in the transport number of alkaline earth metal cations relative to sodium ions, electrical resistance of the cation-exchange membrane measured in sodium chloride and calcium chloride solution, mobility ratio between calcium and sodium ions in the membrane and ionic ratio during electrodialysis in the membrane ( Similarly, existence of ethylene glycols in the solution and in the membrane is thought to affect the transport number of potassium ions relative to sodium ions. Separation of potassium ions from sodium ions using a mosaic ion-exchange membrane was reported Many studies on selective permeation of specific cations through liquid membranes To evaluate the effect of the crown ether on transport number of potassium ions relative to sodium ions, electrodialysis of a 1:1 mixed salt solution containing crown ether (only in desalting side solution) is performed after the crown ether was adsorbed on the cation-exchange membrane Separation between cations is important in not only hydrometallurgy, but also in general separation technique. Ion-exchange method using ion-exchange resins and extraction using liquid ion-exchangers have been mainly used in industry. Electrodialysis using ion-exchange membranes can be continuously performed at room temperature and does not require acids, alkalis and organic solvents, and the amount to permeate through the membrane is controllable by current density under a limiting current density. However, methods to prepare cation-exchange membranes having permselectivity for specific cations and electrodialysis methods to permeate specific cations through the membrane are not established. In this review, recent studies on this subject are classified in three category: composite membranes of the cation-exchange membranes with other polymers, changing ion-exchange groups of the membranes and electrodialysis in the presence of chelate-forming agents. In industrial applications, the cation-exchange membrane should have high permselectivity for specific cations together with high current efficiency and low voltage drop across the membrane. The cation-exchange membrane having a cationic charged layer, which selectively permeates cations with lower valence and larger hydrated radius, and also proton, is only practically usable. The cation-exchange groups, which have strong interaction with specific cations, cause the decrease in the current efficiency and the increase in voltage drop across the membrane, e.g. phosphonic acid groups. Introducible cation-exchange groups are limited: sulfonic acid, carboxylic acid and phosphonic acid groups, etc. If there are various cation-exchange groups that have different interaction with cations, a new development can be expected in this research. It is well known that boric acid has an interesting ability to form reversible covalent complexes with compounds having diols such as sugars like glucose, fructose, etc. in aqueous solution In recent years, molecular imprinting technique has been actively studied to prepare resins and membranes having high selectivity for specific molecules and inorganic ions
