Multi-walled CuO nanotubes (NTs) were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method followed by a low temperature thermal oxidation process without the use of any catalysts, surfactants or substrates. Pure multi-walled CuO NTs were obtained after hydrothermal treatment at 100°C followed by a calcination process at 400°C. It was shown that the obtained multi-walled CuO NTs with high purity and crystallinity had 3nm inner and 7nm outer diameters and showed a strong antibacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.Nano-sized metal oxides with controlled morphology, structure and size have gained significant technological and scientific interest because of their unique optical, electronic, physical and chemical properties that are neither characteristics of the individual atoms nor of the bulk counterparts due to the large surface area to volume ratio of nano-structures Copper (II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO The antibacterial effect of CuO NTs against A Miniflex600 desktop X-ray diffractometer by Rigaku was used for the X-ray scans at a fixed voltage of 40 The TEM images of as-prepared CuO NTs are shown in The XRD patterns of the obtained CuO NTs before and after calcination at 400 The SEM image of CuO+Cu Antibacterial effect of the CuO nanotubes (a) and CuO nanowires (b) on Overall, it is shown that multi-walled CuO NTs can be prepared by a simple hydrothermal treatment at 100 Financial support from
