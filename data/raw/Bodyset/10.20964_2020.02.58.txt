An anatase-type one-dimensional TiO2 nanowire was successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method, on this basis, a flexible, uniform CuSx@TiO2 composite electrode was prepared by electrophoresis combined with vulcanization at high temperature. The successful loading of CuSx particles on the TiO2 nanowires was verified by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses. The electrochemical tests show that the prepared flexible CuSx@TiO2 composite electrode has good electrochemical performance. The coulombic efficiency can be maintained above 98% at a high current density of 400 mA g-1. After 80 cycles, the reversible capacity can still reach 380.1 mAh g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance stems from a synergistic lithium storage process between the CuSx and TiO2, which not only improves the specific capacity of the material, but also effectively alleviates the volume expansion of CuSx during the storage of lithium, thus prolonging the cycle life of the battery.
