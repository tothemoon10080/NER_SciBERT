Now-a-days, Generation of Electrical Energy has become a more vital factor in the Power System because of the incremental demands for day-by-day with the population growth in the Electrical Distribution System. Hence, we all knew that Power Generation can be done in much number of ways using different techniques. Many Electrical Professionals developed different technologies for Electrical Energy Generation, which are all frequently fuel consuming apparatus. Here there is a new technique for Generation of Electrical Energy using Piezo Sensors from unwanted ground vibrations which may affect the nearby structures or may cause sound pollution. Here with the help of a number of vibratory plates which are well said to be Piezo Sensors, the frequency of different unnecessary vibrations will be converted into Alternating Supply; and then it will be furtherconverted into Direct Supply with the help of Ultra-Fast Switching Diode. The obtained output can be well stored in a Battery for further usage or it can be consumed directly for Loads. Thus, without any Economic Fuel consumption the Electrical Power simply can be generated by utilizing the unwanted vibrations.
