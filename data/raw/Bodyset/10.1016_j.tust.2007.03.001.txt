I have read the subject paper with interest, and would like to congratulate the authors for providing valuable information on the influence of brittleness on rock excavation, which is a highly complicated subject and much discussed over the years. My contribution to the paper in question will be particularly directed to suggesting an alternative methodology of examining the relation between TBM penetration rate and rock brittleness. Below you will find some explanations which I hope will clarify my arguments for a need of an alternative methodology. If we examine The curves determined by non-linear regression analysis illustrated in It is important to note that in regression analyses there is a range of application for each of the independent variables due to the range of experimental data used for the regression analysis. Since the maximum value of UCS of the encountered granites in the excavation of TO5 and TO6 tunnels is 250 Although no quantitative mention of water inflow rate for the encountered rocks is made in the subject paper, from the brief geological descriptions of the tunnels, one may infer that underground water is primarily responsible from the weathering of encountered granites. The paper quotes that Finally, the authors’ quoting that “ The penetration rate almost increases linearly with increasing rock brittleness index. I hope that the authors find the preceding remarks valuable.
