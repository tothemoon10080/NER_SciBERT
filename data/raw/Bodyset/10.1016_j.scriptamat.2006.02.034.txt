This study compares the effect of heating mode on the densification, microstructure, strength and hardness of austenitic and ferritic stainless steel. The compacts were sintered in a radiatively heated (conventional) and a 2.45GHz microwave furnace. Both 316L and 434L compacts couple with microwaves and heat up to the sintering temperature rapidly (∼45°C/min). The overall processing time was reduced by about 90% through microwave sintering. While the microwave sintered compacts exhibit a finer microstructure, there is no corresponding improvement in densification and mechanical properties. This has been correlated with elongated and irregular pore structure.In recent years, there has been an increasing trend to use powder metallurgical (P/M) processed stainless steels for automotive and structural applications The present study investigates the microstructural, densification, and mechanical property response in straight 316L (austenitic) and 434L (ferritic) stainless steel consolidated using both microwave as well as conventional furnace sintering through the supersolidus sintering route. The as-received gas-atomized 316L [Fe–16.5Cr–12.97Ni–2.48Mo–0.93Si–0.21Mn–0.025C–0.008S (in wt.%)] and 434L [Fe–17Cr–1Mo–0.2Mn–0.02C–0.02S–0.02P] stainless steel (Ametek Specialty Metal Products, USA) powders were uniaxially compacted at 600 The sintered density was obtained by dimensional measurements. The sinterability of the compact was also determined through a densification parameter which is expressed as The microstructural analyses of the samples were carried out using an optical microscope. The pore size was estimated by measuring the pore area, while pore shape was characterized using a shape-form factor, Vickers bulk hardness measurements were performed on the samples at 2     This study compares the effect of conventional and microwave heating on the densification, microstructural, and mechanical properties of 316L and 434L stainless steel sintered at 1400
