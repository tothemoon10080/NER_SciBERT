The study described in this paper investigated the effects of a mega-thrust subduction earthquake on the seismic performance of moderately ductile concentrically braced frame multi-storey office buildings (MD–CBF) located on Site Class C in Victoria, B.C., Canada. Using data from the 2011 Mw
                     9 Tohoku subduction earthquake in Japan and worldwide crustal earthquakes, nonlinear dynamic analyses were performed on detailed numerical models developed in the OpenSees framework. It was found that the effect of Trifunac duration on the nonlinear seismic response of 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF office buildings is particularly significant in terms of the strain accumulated in the fibers of hollow structural section braces causing low-cycle fatigue fracture. In addition, assessment of the likelihood of collapse safety of the studied multi-storey MD–CBF buildings found that the collapse margin ratio (CMR) value and the adjusted collapse margin ratio (ACMR) value are approximately 150% greater under the crustal record set than under the subduction record set. Among the three buildings studied, only the 12-storey MD–CBF building subjected to the subduction record set failed to meet the collapse safety criterion of ACMR

                     10%. Consequently, the CMR value needs to be increased by strengthening the structural system. Therefore, particular attention should be given when designing MD–CBF multi-storey buildings located in the proximity of subduction fault, such as buildings in Victoria that lie within the Cascadia subduction zone.The building stock in Victoria, B.C., Canada, is susceptible to crustal earthquakes and the mega-thrust Cascadia subduction earthquake with a predicted moment magnitude To reliably assess the collapse risk of steel concentrically braced frame buildings (CBF) subjected to a potential mega-thrust Cascadia subduction earthquake, a comprehensive knowledge of building safety is required. In the proposed framework, sets of both crustal and subduction records are employed in order to conduct a comparison of performance matrices based on maximum and residual interstorey drift, as well as the damage index measuring the accumulated strain in cross-sectional fibers of hollow structural section (HSS) braces. Further, employing incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) gives practitioners the ability to assess the likelihood of collapse safety of CBF buildings based on the computation of median collapse capacity, collapse margin ratio ( The main objective of this study was therefore to rigorously investigate from brace yielding to brace fracture the effect of a mega-thrust The innovative features of this study are as follows: i) employing the main-shock records from the In this study, 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey fictitious MD–CBF office buildings located on Site Class C (firm soil) in Victoria, B.C. are considered. The plan view and north–south (N–S) elevation of numerical model built for half of the building in OpenSees (McKenna, 1997) The MD–CBF system was designed according to the NBCC 2010 The HSS chevron braces were sized to carry the axial tension–compression forces developed from the projected storey shear resulting from the dynamic analysis in addition to the associated dead and live load. For designing the MD–CBF beams, columns and brace-to-frame connections according to Following these scenarios, the W-shape beams of the MD–CBF systems were designed to carry the bending moment due to gravity loading in addition to that developed from the applied unbalanced force triggered by braces, as well as the associated axial tension or compression forces. The MD–CBF columns were designed to carry brace capacities in addition to the tributary gravity load component. To select suitable records for Site Class C in Victoria, B.C., knowledge of typical geotechnical profiles is required. A study by Molnar et al. The seven The set of crustal ground motion records was selected from the PEER-NGA ground motion database and is given in The studied buildings are symmetrical in plan and elevation and the seismic force resisting system in each direction consists of two identical MD–CBFs. Based on the symmetry feature, only half of the building was simulated in the OpenSees framework In order to consider the accumulation of damage while preserving a reduced volume of computations, Uriz To solve this drawback, Lignos and Karamanci However, at the upper floors of multi-storey CBFs, HSS braces with larger slenderness ratio than 85 are required. In general, in seismic areas, stocky HSS braces (kL/r It is noted that Eq. Furthermore, to simulate the behavior of brace-to-frame gusset plate connection in OpenSees, two rotational springs and one torsional spring were defined in the zero-length element that connects each end of the brace to a rigid link ( To emphasize the differences in the nonlinear response of multi-storey MD–CBF buildings subjected to mega-thrust subduction records compared to crustal records, the following response parameters were investigated: interstorey drift, residual interstorey drift, strain developed in the tensile and compressive fiber of HSS brace cross-sections at the location of plastic hinge formation, as well as the accumulated strain causing low-cycle fatigue fracture. It is noted that the first and second vibration mode periods of the studied buildings resulting from nonlinear dynamic analysis using OpenSees are provided in For the 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings, the interstorey drift profile across the building's height obtained under both subduction and crustal ground motion sets scaled to match the 2%/50 In the case of the 8-storey MD–CBF building, the peak interstorey drift is concentrated at the 2nd floor, as well as at the 5th floor where the ratio In the case of the 12-storey MD–CBF building, the interstorey drift shows a large concentration at the bottom two floors although the ratio The distribution of residual interstorey drift over the height of 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings is shown in Residual displacements are larger in traditional systems due to the tendency to preserve the inelastic displacement upon unloading. When residual interstorey drift is larger than 0.5% Herein, The summary of the median peak interstorey drift The desirable failure mode of CBFs is the ductile fracture of the HSS braces due to low-cycle fatigue The largest strain accumulated in CBF brace's cross-section fibers occurs at floors experiencing the peak interstorey drift. For all studied buildings, the damage index computed for the outermost compression fiber of HSS brace's cross-section at each floor is shown in Detailed nonlinear response of the 4-storey MD–CBF building subjected to mega-thrust subduction record FKS010 versus the #787 Loma Prieta crustal record is shown in In the case of the 8-storey MD–CBF building, the largest interstorey drift demand occurred at the 2nd floor under both subduction FKS005 (e.g. Detailed nonlinear seismic response of the 12-storey MD–CBF building subjected to MYG004 subduction record and #776 Loma Prieta record is presented below. By comparison, the maximum amplitude of scaled subduction record ( Preliminary HSS brace size selection was made to satisfy the strength, slenderness, and ductility design criteria such as: The nonlinear seismic response of the 8-storey MD–CBF building with variant “A” and “B” braces subjected to MYG004 record is shown in The main objective of this study was to evaluate the collapse safety of 4-storey, 8-storey, and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings subjected to crustal and mega-thrust subduction records, whose amplitudes were scaled to reflect the design spectrum for Site Class C in Victoria B.C. The collapse capacities of MD–CBF buildings are evaluated in order to determine whether the system designed according to current code and standard provisions provides adequate collapse safety under both sets of ground motions. According to the procedure detailed in The first step in the methodology of collapse capacity assessment is to employ the incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) To assess the likelihood of collapse safety for each MD–CBF building subjected to both ground motion sets, the following parameters are computed: the median collapse capacity, To possess enough collapse safety at the design level, the adjusted collapse margin ratio ( The value of The effect of mega-thrust subduction records versus crustal records was studied by analyzing the nonlinear response of 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings using OpenSees. The findings are as follows: The criteria considered for the selection of subduction records from the available The detailed numerical model incorporating the proposed low-cycle fatigue model calibrated to capture the brace fracture was able to replicate the nonlinear seismic response of 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings from yielding to failure under both record sets. In the case of the 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings, the largest demand occurred mostly at the same floors with a dominant at the bottom two floors under both crustal and subduction record sets. However, in the case of the 4-storey MD–CBF building the largest demand occurred at the top floor under the subduction record set and at the bottom two floors under the crustal record set. At the design level (2%/50 For similar earthquake intensity, the studied MD–CBF multi-storey buildings experienced similar peaks of strain time-history series or strain range under both record sets. However, under subduction ground motion set, the accumulated compressive strain in the outermost compression fiber of the HSS brace is about two times larger than that resulting from the crustal ground motion set. Thus, the brace damage index incorporating strain accumulation causing low-cycle fatigue is a reliable parameter. The simplified equation proposed in ATC 58-2 to estimate the median peak residual interstorey drift was validated for MD–CBF buildings with a fundamental period The IDA curves computed for the 4-storey, 8-storey and 12-storey MD–CBF buildings subjected to subduction record set show significant softening at a decreasing slope, which means that damage accumulates at grater rates than when the buildings are subjected to crustal records. To assess the likelihood of collapse safety, the methodology proposed in FEMA P695 was applied. It was found that the collapse margin ratio ( Financial support for this study from the
