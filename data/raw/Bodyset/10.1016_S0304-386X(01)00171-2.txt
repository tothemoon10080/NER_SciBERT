The effects of HCl concentration and temperature on the dissolution of La2O3 in aqueous (HCl–H2O), mixed-aqueous (HCl–CH3OH–H2O) and non-aqueous (HCl–CH3OH) solvents have been studied. Increase of methanol in solvents was determined to cause corresponding decreases in conductivity, E

                     R values and better results were obtained for dissolution in the order non-aqueous>mixed-aqueous>aqueous solvent systems. Increase in dissolution was attributed to the prevention of lanthanum hydroxide precipitation in non-aqueous medium. Lanthanum compounds formed in non-aqueous medium at 25°C were isolated and identified using X-ray diffraction, thermal and chemical analysis methods and the thermal changes observed in these compounds between 25°C and 1100°C were investigated.

Methanol was completely removed around 200°C with formation of LaCl3 and some LaOCl and due to the decomposition of LaCl3 above 200°C, LaOCl was detected as the only stable phase above 700°C.Hydrochloric acid and aqueous chloride media are widely used for various purposes (leaching, crystallization, ion-exchange, solvent extraction, etc.) in rare-earth technology. In this respect, attention has been paid to the dissolution characteristics of rare-earth chlorides, oxides and carbonates in water, hydrochloric acid and alcohol solutions. Dissolution characteristics of hydrous and anhydrous rare-earth chlorides in water were observed to increase in the temperature range 0–100°C with a corresponding decrease in pH of solutions, as the chloride ion concentration was increased Solubilities of anhydrous rare-earth chlorides are increased with increase of temperature in hydrochloric acid solutions but, for all temperatures, sharp decreases in solubilities are observed with the increase of HCl concentration The solubility and complex formation of rare-earth chlorides in alcohols have been investigated in several studies The purpose of this study is to investigate the dissolution behavior of La La HCl–CH La was analyzed at low concentrations using ICP and XRF techniques and at high concentrations by gravimetric analysis based on oxalate precipitation The leaching experiments were carried out in a 200-mL three-necked Pyrex reactor equipped with a reflux condenser, a thermometer (or pH electrode) and a thermocouple to maintain the temperature within ±0.5°C. One hundred milliliters of solvent and a known amount of rare-earth oxide were added to the reaction vessel, the mixture was stirred magnetically to keep all the particles in suspension and leaching was continued for 6 h with continuous monitoring of the solution temperature. Upon completion of the reaction, the residue was separated from the filtrate by GD120 type borosilicate micro filter paper and pH, electromotive force ( The results of the dissolution experiments of La    Considering maximum solubility in non-aqueous medium, 25 g of La The thermal decomposition curve of the lanthanum compound(s) formed in HCl–CH The evaluation of the XRD results together with chemical analysis and weight loss values shows the presence of the lanthanum compounds given in The dissolution of La Contrary to the formation of LaCl The decomposition behavior of the reaction products can be utilized for the preparation of anhydrous LaCl
