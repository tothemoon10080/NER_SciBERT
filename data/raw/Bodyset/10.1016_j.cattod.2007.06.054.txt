A multivariate analysis using experimental design techniques was performed to determine the effect of iron, hydrogen peroxide and titanium dioxide in the solar photodegradation of dichloroacetic acid in a combined TiO2/photo-Fenton process. The study was carried out at pilot-plant scale, using TiO2 supported on silica as the heterogeneous photocatalyst to facilitate separation of the solids after the reaction, and iron concentrations of less than 3mgL−1 to avoid removal of iron from the effluent. The results show that iron is the most important factor influencing the reaction rate, which suggests that in strongly acidic solutions, the Fenton mechanism controls the process even at such low iron concentrations. Under these conditions, the expected synergism between TiO2 and iron degradation pathways seems to be negligible compared to the antagonistic effect between hydrogen peroxide and TiO2, which reduces the activity of the combined system. However, in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, the activity achieved by the combined Fe/TiO2 system is similar to that of the photo-Fenton process, with the advantage that H2O2 is replaced by a reusable TiO2-based catalytic material. Consequently, the analysis of pilot-plant operation economics took not only the degradation rate, but also the cost of chemicals into account.The use of photochemical technologies has been shown to be a promising alternative for the detoxification of industrial effluents One of these resistant chemicals is dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a widely used industrial pollutant also identified as an intermediate in the biological degradation pathway of many chlorinated hydrocarbons, and as one of the potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBP) formed in chlorination of water with traces of natural organic matter A previous work has studied Fe/TiO This work focuses on the study of TiO Titanium dioxide was incorporated into a commercial porous silica (INEOS ES70Y, Iron sulphate (FeSO Photocatalytic reactions were carried out under solar irradiation in compound parabolic collectors (CPC) at the Plataforma Solar de Almería (latitude 37°N, longitude 2.4°W).

Degradation therefore seems to take place through one of the following overall reactions, depending on the oxidizing species present in the medium: Stoichiometric consumption of 2  Analysis of the experimental DCA photodegradation rates followed the steps below, as described previously The two-level factorial design consisting of Experiments 1–8 and the three replications of the centre point were done first. The estimated experimental error calculated from the standard deviation of these three replications and the Student's test parameter for a 95% confidence level and two degrees of freedom is 0.090 Second, model linearity is verified by calculating the curve as the difference between the average of the eight experiments of the factorial design and the average of the centre points. This was found to be 0.458 Finally, a multiple linear regression was used to fit the experimental results to a 10-parameter model including the 3 effects of every variable, the 3 binary interactions, the 3 quadratic effects and an offset, neglecting the possible influence of XY The final mathematical model that best fits the experimental response of the reaction rate of DCA solar photodegradation as a function of the concentration of TiO Similarly, for the hydrogen peroxide consumption, the following mathematical model was obtained:   Prior to any mechanistic discussion of the response surfaces, some general considerations about the TiO In view of the analysis in  The factor that most influences the Finally, the unexpected, almost negligible influence of hydrogen peroxide concentration on the DCA photodegradation rate is worth mentioning. With Fe/TiO Summarising, results show that iron concentration controls the kinetics observed in the solar photodegradation of DCA even at concentrations as low as 1 Pilot-plant performance optimization must therefore consider system economics. On one hand, a high degradation rate is desirable to reduce the costs of investment amortization, energy and labour. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide consumption, as the major chemical cost, must be kept as low as possible. The cost of iron may be considered negligible (below 5 A price of Application of the Newton optimizing algorithm to Eq.
