This paper presents an analysis of the effect of utilizing crushing bodies of special shapes as grinding medium. The crushing bodies utilized in this study were modified spheres with a concave portion.
                  Grinding efficiency is expected to increase with the increasing available surface area of the grinding medium. A grinding ball with concavity has a smaller volume than a sphere of the same radius. Therefore, the convex-concave ball has a smaller mass with the same surface area, providing a larger specific surface area and a greater charge density. In the case of contact between the convex and concave surfaces, the probability of a crushing action over larger particles is higher than for smaller particles, causing preferential grinding of larger particles.
                  Experiments were carried out in laboratory and consisted of batches of the same feed, ground first with conventional grinding balls. Part of the grinding medium of conventional grinding balls was then replaced by special concave-convex balls, increasing the specific surface area of the grinding balls. The results of the grinding experiments showed an effective selectivity of the grind, and in some cases, an increase in the fineness of the ground product, for a percentage of the concave area in the charge up to about 10%. Increasing the percentage of the concave bodies, the relative motion of the charge units became more irregular, causing a negative impact on grinding efficiency.
