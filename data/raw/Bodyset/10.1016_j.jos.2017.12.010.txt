Background
                  To report our experiences with the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing in the field of orthopedic trauma.
               
                  Methods
                  This retrospective study enrolled 24 patients from three university teaching hospitals in whom 3D printing technique was applied: 14 patients with acetabular fractures and 10 patients with clavicular shaft fractures. We summarized our experiences with 3D printed bone models.
               
                  Results
                  Three-dimensional printed acetabular models improved understanding of complex acetabular anatomy and fracture pattern to plan the optimal positioning of a reduction clamp and the trajectory of screws. Pre-bending of a reconstruction plate could reduce operative time. We also recorded fluoroscopic images of a simulated surgery for percutaneous screw fixation of the acetabular posterior column, with the optimal positioning of the guide wire determined during the simulation used as a reference during the actual operation. This surgical simulation was performed by a resident and served as a helpful training method. For fractures of the clavicle, we identified the optimal position of anatomical plates using 3D printed clavicle models.
               
                  Conclusion
                  In our experience, 3D printing technique provided surgeons with improved understanding of the fracture pattern and anatomy and was effectively used for preoperative planning, education of surgical trainees, and performing simulations to improve intra-operative technical outcomes.
