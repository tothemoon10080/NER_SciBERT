Reliable analysis of transportation networks is crucial for design and planning purposes. A pipeline network system could range from simple to very sophisticated and complex arrangement: from a single pipe transporting fluid from a place to another or elaborated as an interconnected set of fluid networks for intra-state or international transportation. As the complexity of the network system grows, the solution for the network model complicates further. For a natural gas network system, the resulting set of fluid flow governing equations is highly non-linear. In such situations, the customary method employed for the solution of a set of non-linear equations is the multivariable Newton–Raphson method despite its potentially negative drawbacks. Newton–Raphson solution protocols demand a good initialization (i.e., a good initial “guess” of the actual solution) for satisfactory performance because convergence is only guaranteed to occur within a potentially narrow neighborhood around the solution vector. This prerequisite can become fairly restrictive for the solution of large gas network systems, where estimations of “good” initial gas load and nodal values across the domain can defy intuition. In addition, some Newton–Raphson formulations require pre-defining flow loops within a network system prior to attempting a solution, which proves to be a challenging task in an extensive network. We propose an alternate, simple yet elegant method to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed solution methodology retains most advantages of the Newton-nodal method while removing the need for initial guesses and eliminating the need for expensive Jacobian formulations and associated derivative calculations. The resulting linear-pressure analog model is robust, reliable and its execution and convergence is independent of user-defined initial guesses for nodal pressures and flow rates. This allows the simulation study of a steady-state gas network system to be efficiently and straight-forwardly conducted.Gas transportation and distribution networks around the world involve a remarkable set of highly integrated pipe networks which operate over a wide range of pressures. The ever increasing demand for gas makes it vital to adapt and expand these systems while at the same time ensuring safe delivery and cost-effective engineering. Model simulation and system analysis play a major role in planning and design stages as they enable engineers to optimize the pipeline networks and decide on the location of non-pipe elements such as compressors ( Most practical situations in fluid transportation involve systems of pipelines that are interconnected forming a network. Natural gas network simulation entails the definition of the mathematical model governing the flow of gas through a transportation and distribution system ( A steady-state network problem can be formulated in a number of ways, but in general, it consists of a system made up of “ Gas network analysis entails the calculations of flow capacity of each pipeline segment ( In a nodal-loop formulation, network governing equations are articulated via the application of mass conservation principles applied to each “ Following Once mathematical closure has been attained (number of equations = number of unknowns), a mathematical solution strategy is formulated, which is the subject of the solution of network equations section in this manuscript. Please note that the loop-node formulation requires the user to pre-define or identify all flow loops within the system in order to formulate network governing equations. In a loop formulation, network equations are written in terms of the principles of energy conservation around a loop stated in Equations Two different sets of flows are defined in a In a nodal formulation, network equations are written on the basis on the principle of nodal mass conservation (continuity) alone. This yields “ In Equation A network problem is eventually expressed in terms of a set of highly non-linear equations that must be solved simultaneously in terms of the desired target unknowns. The Nowadays, the application of the multivariate Newton–Raphson method is rather the norm applied in the simultaneous solution of the large systems of non-linear network equations. However, the most significant limitation of Newton–Raphson methods is their unfortunate tendency of hopelessly diverging when not initialized sufficiently close to the actual solution (i.e., their “local convergence” property). To alleviate this problem, the quadratic local convergence of Newton–Raphson is typically coupled with a globally convergent strategy that can better guarantee progress and convergence toward the solution (see, for example,  In order to circumvent network solution convergence problems of currently available methods and their potentially costly implementation, this study proposes the implementation of a linear-pressure analog model for the solution of the highly non-linear equations in natural gas transportation networks. The method consists in defining an alternate, analog system of pipes that obey a much simpler pipe constitutive equation, i.e., a linear-pressure analog flow equation, which is written for horizontal pipes as follows: Linear-pressure analog conductivities are straightforwardly calculated as a function of actual pipe conductivities according to the following transformation rule: In Equation This analog-pipe transform is a dimensionless quantity that enforces the flow-rate equivalency of Equations Upon application of the linear-analog transform, all unknown nodal pressures in the network can be calculated by solving the resulting linear set of algebraic equations. Since actual pressure ratios ( Once a first set of estimated nodal pressures become available during the first iteration, interim pressure ratios Note that the value of For this case study, the horizontal network system depicted on  By moving all known-pressure node matrix entries ( The inexpensive, steady convergence nature of the proposed protocol is depicted in Similar analog transformations can be proposed to extend the linear-analog model to network systems with inclined pipes. The constitutive gas flow equation from Note that the analog-pipe conductivity transform for inclined pipes is identical to that of horizontal pipes, and only the pressure ratio definition is slightly modified with the elevation correction for the downstream pressure. Case Study 2 considers an identical network and scenario as the one presented in Case Study 1 (illustrated in Based on the implementation of the solution protocol in In the new It is also possible to redefine the linear-analog transform for inclined pipes in order to preserve the symmetry of the characteristic matrix This alternative approach would lead to linear algebraic equations with a symmetric characteristic matrix. All proposed analog methods are summarized in A linear-pressure analog has been proposed which for the solution of the highly non-linear equations typical of natural gas network transportation modeling. The approach does not need any type of initial guesses or user-provided pressure or flow rate initializations, as opposed to current standard practice that heavily relies on the application of Newton–Raphson based protocols. The iterative method relies on the solution of successive interim, well-posed liquid-network problems and it is thus shown to be well-behaved, reliable and stable throughout execution. The proposed linear-analog method does not require the formulation of loop equations, and solely relies on nodal connectivity information, contrary to other network methods such as the loop and loop-nodal formulations.
