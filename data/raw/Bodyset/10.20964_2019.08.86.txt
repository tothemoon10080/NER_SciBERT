The present paper has utilized nanoparticles of fibrous Dy2Ce2O7. The catalytic strength of fibrous Dy2Ce2O7 was used as an electrocatalystin the case of methanol oxidation reaction. The fibrous Dy2Ce2O7 NPs are completely in vestigated by taking advantages of AFM, XRD, EDS, BET, TEM, FESEM and FT-IR analyses. The fibrous Dy2Ce2O7 indicated high stability forreaction without considerable loss of some property like activity.
