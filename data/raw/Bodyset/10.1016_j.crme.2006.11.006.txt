The present bone remodelling model describes, at the trabecular scale, the spatial and time changes of the resorption, apposition and mineralization processes within spongy bone tissue. Osteocytes, randomly distributed within the deformed trabeculae, send a signal to the surface, which regulates the catabolic activity of osteoclasts and anabolic activity of osteoblasts. The mineralization phase is modelled by an evolution law of the elastic modulus. The results show a non-uniform bone remodelling propagation within the tissue which depends on geometrical and mechanical properties of the constitutive trabeculii. This propagation is a bottom line for the remodelling dysfunctions in many bone pathologies.
