The Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic ore field, located at the westernmost end of the Cathaysia Block in South China, is one of the largest tin polymetallic ore fields in the world. It is associated with magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming processes triggered by deeply seated structures and concealed granites. The Bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) was used to decompose gravity data covering an area including the Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic ore field in the west and the Bozhushan silver-lead-zinc polymetallic ore field in the east, which yielded three two-dimensional intrinsic mode function (BIMFs) images and one residue (Res(m, n)) image that depict four layers of geological architectures at different wavelengths within the study area. The high-pass filtered gravity component image (BIMF1) is interpreted to depict the shallow geological architecture, which indicates that the skarn alteration and tin-copper mineralization with positive gravity anomalies are distributed around the granites characterized by negative gravity anomalies. The band-pass filtered gravity component image (BIMF2) is interpreted to depict the middle-shallow geological architecture, which indicates that the outcropped granites in the western Gejiu ore field bounded by the Gejiu fault may extend to the eastern Gejiu ore field to form one integrated granitic complex in the subsurface. The other band-pass filtered gravity component image (BIMF3) is interpreted to depict the middle-lower geological architecture, which indicates that there may be an EW-trending granite zone with negative gravity anomaly at middle-lower depth connecting the Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic field to the Bozhushan silver-lead-zinc polymetallic field, displaying the existence of an EW-trending regional polymetallic ore-forming zone within the study area. The low-pass filtered gravity component image (Res(m, n)) is interpreted to depict the lowest geological architecture within the study area, which reflects that there may be a pair of the NW-trending uplift zone of the mantle and/or the basement with positive gravity anomaly and the depression zone of the mantle and/or the basement with negative gravity anomaly. The Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic deposits and the related granites are located at the transitional zone between the uplift and depression, whereas the Bozhushan silver-lead-zinc polymetallic deposits and the related granites are situated within the depression zone, which implies that the diversity of the Late Yanshanian granites and the related polymetallic deposits in the study area may be controlled by the complexity of the crust-mantle interaction at depth.With exhaustion of near surface mineral resources, we are forced to explore deeply for discovering new mineral resources. The exploration and evaluation of concealed mineral deposits represent a frontier in exploration for which geophysical methods are particularly well suited ( The Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic ore field, located approximately three hundred kilometers south of Kunming city, the capital of Yunnan Province, SW China, is one of the largest tin polymetallic ore fields in the world. The ore field comprises five Sn–Cu–Pb–Zn polymetallic deposits, namely Malage, Songshujiao, Gaosong, Laochang and Kafang, containing approximately 300 In this paper, the bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) method is used for decomposing the gravity data surveyed at a scale of 1:200,000 of the Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic ore field and the adjacent Bozhushan silver-lead-zinc polymetallic ore field. The extracted gravity components are related to deeply buried geological architectures and granites associated with the tin polymetallic mineralization and provide evidence for prospecting deeply buried orebodies. Effective use of gravity fields, like other geophysical fields, for mineral exploration, depends on establishment of a set of signatures that characterize forms, sizes and depths, as well as masses of various geological objects and their relationship to mineralization ( The primary challenge to geophysical interpretation is that a measured anomaly may represent any of a number of overlapped geologic features and usually exhibit nonlinearity and nonstationarity ( More recently, Assume that To extract the BIMF during the bi-dimensional sifting process, the neighboring window is used to detect the extrema and the multiquadric method is used to compute the surface interpolation of envelopes ( The 2D sifting process can be influenced by the determination of The 2D sifting process algorithm used in this study, first proposed by Initialization: Extraction of the Initialize and make Detect all the points of local maximum ( Compute the upper (lower) envelope of the local maximum and local minimum point, respectively; Calculate the envelope mean:   Repeat steps (ii)–(vi);  Go to step (2), when the extrema number of  The For the 1D EMD method, orthogonality is considered satisfied if the Filters such as high-pass ( In this study, a The world class Gejiu tin-copper polymetallic ore field is located on the western margin of the South China Block. Bounded on the northwest side by the NE-trending Mile-Shizong Fault, it is adjacent to the Yangtze Block, and bounded on the southwest side by the NW-trending ASRR Fault, it is adjacent to the Indo-China Block ( In addition to the Triassic lavas, the Mesozoic igneous rocks in the Gejiu field include gabbro, mafic microgranular enclave (MME) - bearing granites, porphyritic biotite granite, equigranular biotite granite, alkaline rocks and mafic dikes. SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS zircon ages ranging from 77.4 The deposits in the Gejiu ore field are mostly underlain by the mid-Triassic Gejiu Formation, which consists primarily of light gray to gray limestone, with minor banded and lenticular calcareous dolomite. Greisen (quartz–muscovite), muscovite, sericite and skarn alterations were intensively developed on the margins of the cupola and in the contact zone between granite and carbonate. Skarn-sulfide ores occur along the contact zones between granite and limestone and/or dolomite, and are characterized by disseminated, veinlet and massive structures. The primary skarn minerals are pyroxene, garnet and scapolite. Tourmaline and fluorite are common hydrothermal alteration minerals overprinting skarn ores. The ores are associated with retrograde skarn minerals (actinolite, tremolite and chlorite). The major ore minerals include arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, cassiterite, chalcopyrite and marmatite, with lesser amounts of pyrite, scheelite, native bismuth, molybdenite and magnetite ( The gravity data surveyed at a grid of 2000 The original gravity image ( The above-mentioned BIMFs have distinct geological implications.
