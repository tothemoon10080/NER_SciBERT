Distal radius fractures are common, and internal fixation for operative management of these injuries is widely accepted. Although use of the volar approach for plate fixation has become more popular, benefits of the dorsal surgical approach include the potential for direct reduction and assessment of articular alignment, evaluation and management of concomitant intrinsic intercarpal ligament injury, and initiation of early range of motion. For certain fracture patterns, dorsal plate fixation is the preferred surgical technique. Improvements in implant design, in particular the use of low-profile dorsal plates, has decreased the rate of complications seen previously with this technique. Here, we provide an overview of the evaluation of patients with distal radius fractures, as well as the surgical indications and contraindications, techniques, and complications after dorsal locked plate fixation of intra-articular distal radius fractures.
