The effect of galvanic coupling between magnetite and iron on their dissolution was investigated in aqueous solutions containing oxalic acid in the presence and absence of ferrous ion. Four different area ratios between iron to magnetite were studied: 1:1600, 1:400, 1:100 and 1:25 (marked as couple1 through couple 4 hereafter). The objective was to simulate the case of magnetite film partially removed from iron surfaces in the course of chemical cleaning when coupling conditions occur with variable area ratios with time. Measurements of the couple's potential (Ecouple) and individual currents of magnetite (Imag) and iron (IFe) (marked as mag1 through mag 4 and Fe1 through Fe4 hereafter) have revealed that as the iron area increases the dissolution of magnetite is accelerated, and the mixed potential for the couple shifts to more positive values; and become nearer to potential of magnetite electrode at same conditions. There was no pronounced effect of the added ferrous ions on the dissolution rate of magnetite. This can be attributed to the dissolution of iron metal in couples in the absence of added Fe2+, which can be provided the solution by the ferrous ions.
