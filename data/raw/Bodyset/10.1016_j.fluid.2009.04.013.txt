The new electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF excess Gibbs function is obtained for calculation of the activity coefficient of the binary electrolyte solutions. The excess Gibbs energy of the model consists of the Pitzer–Debye–Hückel equation, describing the long-range electrostatic contribution and the electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model to account for the short-range contributions. With two adjustable parameters per electrolyte, the new model is applied to correlation of the mean activity coefficients of more than 130 binary aqueous electrolyte solutions at 25°C. Also the binary parameters, obtaining from regression of mean activity data, are used for prediction of osmotic coefficient data for the same electrolytes. The results are compared with various local composition models such as the electrolyte-NRTL, electrolyte NRF-Wilson, electrolyte-NRTL-NRF, N-Wilson-NRF models. The comparison of the results with experiment demonstrates that the new model can correlate the experimental activity coefficient data and predict the osmotic coefficient data of binary electrolytes accurately.Electrolyte systems represent an important part in chemical, gas and petroleum industries such as natural gas treatment, extractive distillation, crystallization, desalination of water, hydrometallurgy, etc. In most electrolyte-local composition models such as electrolyte-NRTL At this work, following approach of Haghtalab and Asadollahi Following the general approach of the electrolyte-local composition models, the excess Gibbs energy of a binary electrolyte solution includes the contribution of two terms as: The short-range effects are originated by molecule–molecule, molecule–ion and ion–ion interactions. So at this work, following Haghtalab and Vera By substitution of Eq. Using the relation The combinatorial term is identical to the term used in the traditional UNIQUAC equation, but we use the effective mole fraction instead of mole fraction. So the Guggenheim combinatorial term is written By differentiation of the excess Gibbs functions for the long-rang and the short-range terms, the activity coefficient of ionic or molecular species in a binary electrolyte system can be written as: The new present model is applied to correlation of the experimental data of the mean ionic activity coefficient for the single-electrolyte solutions that were collected from the literature The volume and surface parameters of the ions are calculated by using the radius of the species and the following relations The structural parameters, Using an optimization program based on Nelder–Mead algorithm, the binary interaction parameters for binary electrolyte systems are obtained. The new model has been used for many uni-univalent and nonuni-valent electrolyte systems at 25 As A new electrolyte-local composition model, E-UNIQUAC-NRF, based on an ionic framework, was developed. The model was adopted for representation of the short-range contribution of excess Gibbs energy of electrolyte solutions so that the structural parameters of the ions such as volume and area of ions were taken into account. For the long-range contribution, the Pitzer–Debye–Hückel model has been used. The present model has two adjustable parameters per electrolyte and by correlating of mean ionic activity coefficients, the binary parameters were determined for more than 131 aqueous electrolyte solutions at 25 Debye–Hückel constant Gibbs energy function internal energy function molar excess internal energy energy interaction parameter ionic strength on mole fraction basis molality molecular weight of water universal gas constant absolute temperature mole fraction effective mole fraction coordination number charge number of ionic species moles of species volume parameter of species surface parameter of species activity coefficient osmotic coefficient stoichiometric number closest approach parameter standard deviation for mean activity coefficient standard deviation for osmotic coefficient nonrandom factor interaction energy parameter between two ions interaction energy parameter between ion and solvent effective area fractions of effective local area fractions of j around effective volume fraction calculated experimental excess long-range short-range unsymmetrical convention infinite dilution reference state combinatorial residual anion cation ion water any compound mean
