In this study, the MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 spinel ferrites nanoparticles were synthesized via a practical co-precipitation route to investigate the zinc removal from aqueous solution. The synthesized magnetic adsorbents were characterized by XRD, VSM, FE-SEM, BET, EDS, and DLS analyses. The synthesized adsorbents had a diameter range of 20–80 nm. The specific surface areas of adsorbents were found to be 84.5 and 50.4 m2/g for MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4, and the saturation magnetization were 61.39 and 37.54 emu/g, respectively. The effects of initial pH, contact time, metal ion concentration, and temperature on Zn (II) adsorption were precisely investigated. These nanoparticles could remove Zn (II) by following the Langmuir isotherm model at optimum pH = 6, with the high adsorption capacities of 454.5 and 384.6 mg/g for MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4, respectively. The results of kinetics studies were well fitted by pseudo-second-order, with the determination coefficients of 0.999 for both adsorbents. The thermodynamics studies showed that the zinc (II) adsorption was an exothermic and spontaneous process. Furthermore, the reusability and the desorption capability of adsorbents were also investigated.The term “heavy metal” is a definition for a group of metals and metalloids with a density of more than 5 g/cm As far, several conventional methods have been used for heavy metals removals, such as ion exchange In this study, due to the high net magnetization and easy separation of MnFe All the chemical reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and used without more purification. FeCl For the synthesis of both MnFe The adsorption reactions were performed by adding 0.2 g/l magnetic nanoparticles (sonicated for 10 min.) to the Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml of zinc solution and rotating at 250 rpm. The adsorption behavior of nanoparticles was investigated at different pH values ranging from 2 to 7. The pH was adjusted by adding either 0.1 M NaOH or H To investigate the desorption capability of adsorbents, the experiments were performed, followed by achieving the best solution between HCl, H Crystal structure and elemental information of synthesized nanoparticles were obtained by X-ray powder diffraction with Inel-Equinox 3000 diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The particle size, surface morphology and chemical composition of nanoparticles were studied with a MIRA3 TESCAN field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) along with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The magnetic properties of nanoparticles were analyzed by a Meghnatis Daghigh Kavir Co. (Iran) vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature (298 K). The specific surface area measurements and pore size distribution of nanoparticles were carried out by a multiple-point Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with the adsorption and desorption isotherms of N The XRD patterns of synthesized nanoparticles of MFe The surface morphology and particle size of MnFe The EDS results of nanoparticles are presented in The hysteresis loops of MnFe The curve and the results of the multi-point BET analysis of nanoparticles (adsorption and desorption of N The zeta potential of nanoparticles at different pHs is illustrated in Since pH by determining the chemistry of metals and changing the surface charge of nanoparticles, affects the removal of metal ions from aqueous solutions, finding the optimum adsorption pH is very necessary The relation between initial pH and the amount of adsorbed metal with MnFe The effect of contact time on zinc (II) adsorption by MnFe The results of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics models are presented in In general, the adsorption isotherm is a valuable curve that describes the manner of adsorption equilibrium between an adsorbate and a solid-phase at a constant temperature and pH The Freundlich isotherm as an empirical and the earliest model assumes that the multi-layer adsorption phenomenon occurs at a heterogeneous surface with the interaction between the adsorbed molecules, and the adsorption energy changes exponentially at the adsorption centers of adsorbates The Temkin isotherm model Another model to studying the adsorption isotherm is the Dubinin-Radushkevich model that specifies the physical and chemical mechanisms of metal ions adsorption by its mean free energy (the energy for transferring a molecule to the sorption space from infinite distance in the solution) As the amount of calculated E was between 8 and 16 kJ/mol, the adsorption follows the chemical ion-exchange process while the amount of below 8 shows the physical adsorption The zinc (II) adsorption data for MnFe In addition, there is a dimensionless factor called separation factor (R The thermodynamics studies were carried out to investigate the feasibility and spontaneous of the adsorption. To obtain the thermodynamic parameters, the Gibbs free energy and Van’t Hoff equations are used respectively The results of thermodynamic calculations are listed in As shown in Finally, as shown in The cubical MnFe The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Supplementary data to this article can be found online at The following are the Supplementary data to this article:
