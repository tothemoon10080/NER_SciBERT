Thick films of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3–Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZT–PZN) with additional PbO-TiO2-ZrO2-SiO2-Bi2O3 glass-ceramics were fabricated using a sequential process of screen-printing, drying, pressing, and firing. PZT–PZN paste containing the glass-ceramics was formed into thick films by firing it at temperatures above 700°C, where the glass-ceramics enhanced the densification of the films by liquid-phase sintering. Press-treatment of the printed film done before firing also enhanced the densification. Dielectric constant, remnant polarization, and coercive field of the films were investigated as a function of the firing temperature, which ranged from 700 to 950°C. The best properties were obtained for films fired at 800–850°C. Piezoelectric actuations were demonstrated using unimorph cantilevers made from the films fired above 700°C.Ceramic materials of Pb(Zr,Ti)O A powder consisting of Pb(Zr To evaluate the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, a unimorph cantilever, which has a metal–insulator–metal capacitor structure, was prepared, as shown in We investigated the effect of adding glass-ceramics on the sintering of PZT–PZN thick films.
