Copper is the major impurity dissolved in silver electrorefining which potentially accumulates in the electrolyte during the process and co-deposits onto the cathode surface, decreasing the product quality. The study investigated the dissolution kinetics of copper in silver electrorefining as a function of wt%

Kinetic models of copper dissolution related to the effect of The increase of The established concentration limitation of Synthetic silver electrolyte parameters were selected in such a way as to simulate industrial silver electrorefining process conditions: Copper electrodes of 99.99% grade were prepared by coating with an inert resin (Struers Aps, Denmark) and polished, so that only the cross-section of the electrode was exposed to the electrolyte bath. This freshly polished copper was then immersed into a 10% HNO Voltammetry measurements were conducted with a Gill AC 1516 potentiostat (ACM Instruments, UK), with an Ag/AgCl (Mettler Toledo, USA) reference electrode and a platinum (99.999%, Kultakeskus Oy, Hämeenlinna, Finland) counter electrode with temperature control using a thermostatic MGW Lauda MT/M3 circulating water bath. Voltammetry measurements were conducted in reverse from 1000 to −100 mV vs. According to the phase diagram of Ag Due to the presence of copper or copper-rich formations within silver anodes, the anodic current applied is used for the dissolution of both copper and silver. In contrast, the reaction on the cathode remains as silver reduction only, with reported current efficiencies >92% [ where + To correlate Eq. The empirical modelling of Cu dissolution current density was based on several models developed in a previous study [ Linear model (A) Power model (B) Concentration logarithmic (C) Full logarithmic (D) With the assumption that particles are in the form of spheres, the radius after polishing ( The average surface area can therefore be calculated based on the specific atom radius as in Eq. As the major constituents of silver anodes are Ag-Au-Cu, as shown in For the variable of The current density operation of silver electrorefining can be divided into a moderate current density of 200–600 A/m The current density values from The concentration logarithmic model C is also in agreement with the Ag dissolution model of a previous study [ As can be seen from Electrolyte circulation is conducted to maintain a constant level of Through purification and mixing, the inlet electrolyte composition has a certain composition of remaining Recently published purification methods are copper hydrolysis [ By using a mixed flow reactor assumption [ Similarly, the balance of Cu can be written as Eq. At a critical With the  The presence of copper in silver anodes as the major dissolved impurity in silver electrorefining poses a challenge due to the co-deposition of Cu in the silver crystal product, thus reducing the product quality. While copper is easily and rapidly dissolved, the large difference in reduction potential between copper and silver allows operation even at a Arif. T.
