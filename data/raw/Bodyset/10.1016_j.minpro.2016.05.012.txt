The present study aims to investigate effect of the extent of pre-reduction of γ-Fe2O3 (maghemite) on the synthesis of Fe3C (cementite). Initially, pre-reduced powders with oxygen contents of 12.36, 3.26 and 0.59wt.% were obtained at 800K in H2 atmosphere for 2.5, 5 and 10min, respectively. Carburization behaviors of these pre-reduced powders were then explored using undiluted CH4 at 800K. Mass change measurements, XRD and SEM analyses were used to characterize the samples. It was found that single Fe3C phase was obtained from the pre-reduced powders containing 3.26 and 0.59wt.% oxygen for carburization periods of 15 and 30min. The kinetic data for the carburization under pure CH4 indicates that there are essentially two successive distinct regimes: reduction of the remaining oxides and Fe3C formation. When the pre-reduced powder with oxygen contents of 3.26 and 0.59wt.% are used, CH4 pyrolysis rate suffices for the reduction of the remaining oxides and carburization. The pre-reduced powder with the highest oxygen (12.36wt.% oxygen) did not yield Fe3C, but iron and iron oxides, because the extent of the reduction by CH4 is found to be too small for such high oxygen content. It was postulated that the reduction product H2O vapor hinders the formation of Fe3C. The carburization process was discussed in terms of reaction pathways using equilibrium thermodynamic analysis and reaction kinetics.Fe Scanty information has been reported on Fe For the first time, the present study reports synthesis of single phase Fe The experimental setup employed for the reduction and carburization studies essentially consists of a hot-wall furnace with SiC heating elements, a quartz tube (20 An alumina boat with the gas entrance side cut to allow smooth gas flow was loaded with ~ Powder morphologies were examined by JEOL 5600 and JEOL 6335 Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM).

It is also possible that steam may oxidize C adsorbed on Fe particle surfaces. When the oxide reduction is completed as in the case of the low oxygen content powders, meaning that there is no steam remaining in the powder bed, iron particles are then carburized by the C atoms adsorbed on them via the following reaction: The aforementioned discussion may explain the time elapsed before the carburization starts to form significantly because of the retarding effect of H Effect of the extent of pre-reduction of γ-Fe Pre-reduced powders with oxygen contents of 12.36, 3.26 and 0.59 The pre-reduced powder with 12.36 Pre-reduced powders with 3.26 and 0.59 The carburization process under pure CH It was postulated the presence of the reduction product, water vapor, in the powder bed inhibits Fe The extent of CH The discrepancies between the thermodynamic prediction and experimental results are attributable both to open tube flow and to sluggish CH This work was supported by
