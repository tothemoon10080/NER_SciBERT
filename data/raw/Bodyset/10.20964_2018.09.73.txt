In an electrochemical metal refining process, the deposit quality and purity are dependent on the current distribution over the surface of the working electrode within an electrochemical cell. A uniform current distribution leads to an increased refining performance. A comprehensive approach was applied to the copper electrodeposition model in a rotating cylinder Hull (RCH) cell configuration. The secondary current distribution in the RCH cell is investigated using a numerical calculation. Dimensionless Wagner numbers were three-dimesionally simulated in a CFD-based model and compared with an analytical equation from the Tafel kinetics approximation as a guide to a uniform deposition for a practical scale-up design.
