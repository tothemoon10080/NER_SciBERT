Abstract
                  A partition curve is used in dense medium separation to determine the efficiency of the separation of clean coal from discard. The method used to determine a partition curve in coal beneficiation is float and sink analysis. The float and sink dry masses are determined at each density fraction only after complete separation of the material has taken place. This means that the partition curve is a form of a steady-state model. A dynamic model for a dense medium separation circuit is available from first principles. This paper shows how a steady-state model is derived from the dynamic model to generate a partition curve. This partition curve is compared with plant measurements taken from a plant operation.
