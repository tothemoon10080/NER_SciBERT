Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays of sunflower oil cake (SuOC) were carried out to research the effect of different particle sizes and their chemical composition on methane yields and kinetics. Particle size ranges of (1) 0.355–0.55mm, (2) 0.710–1.0mm and (3) 1.4–2.0mm in diameter were evaluated. The highest methane yield 213±8mLCH4
                     g−1 VSadded was obtained for the largest particle size analyzed (3), against 186±6mLCH4
                     g−1 VSadded obtained for particles 1 and 2. This may be attributed to the different lignocellulose compositions of the various particle size ranges studied and to organic matter removals (47.2% for 3, against ∼41.5% for 1 and 2). The evolution of propionic acid concentration was found to be fundamental for explaining the lowest rate of biogas production for the smallest (1) particle size studied, with a specific rate constant k of 0.45±0.02d−1, while values of 0.61±0.02d−1 and 0.50±0.01d−1 were obtained for particles 2 and 3, respectively.The worldwide production of sunflower oil for 2008–2009 was 32.80 million tons with a production of around 42% of the by-product sunflower oil cake (SuOC), which means that 13.4 million tons of this waste were generated A characteristic of SuOC is its high concentration of lignocellulosic material It is generally accepted that hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in the anaerobic digestion of organic vegetable solid waste. Due to the chemical and physical construction of lignocellulose, its microbial hydrolysis is a slow and difficult process. Furthermore, the surface area and particle size are important characteristics in determining its initial degradation rate The size of the feedstock should be reduced, otherwise it would result in the clogging of the digester and in the difficulty for microorganisms to digest it. A reduction in the size of the particles and the consequent enlargement of the available specific surface can support the biological process, in the event that there would be substrates with a high fibre content and low degradability, their comminution yielding an improved digester gas production Little research has been carried out into the effect of particle size of agricultural wastes on methane yield The influence of the substrate composition related to the different particle sizes on methane production has not previously been studied or reported in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of particle size and chemical composition on the extent and rate of the anaerobic digestion process of SuOC. In this way, biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests with three different particle sizes of SuOC (0.355–0.55  The full composition and main features as well as the fractional composition of the fibre of these three fractions of SuOC are shown in  Anaerobic digestion experiments in batch mode are useful because they can be performed quickly with simple and inexpensive equipment, and are helpful in assessing the extent to which a material can be digested. The experimental design consisted of a multiflask batch system and was fully described elsewhere The reactors, which were maintained at 35 The methane released was measured by volume displacement (the carbon dioxide was removed previously by flushing the gas through a 2 Every experiment consisted in 14 fed SuOC replicates, 4 blank controls (two initials and two finals) and 2 cellulose positive controls. All the experiments were run for 7–8 days, until no significant gas production was observed, (last day the production was lower than 2% of the accumulate methane produced), suggesting that biodegradation was essentially completed, as control of cellulose (370    Every one or two days, two of the digesters were sacrificed and their contents analyzed (one for VS analysis, using the whole working volume of the reactor (250 To assess the organic matter balance in each BMP test system as a function of volatile solid removal (VS The degradation efficiency, expressed as VS In the case at hand, the increase in the available specific surface achieved with the smallest particle size, which theoretically improves the area where the microorganisms can reach and adhere, did not improve organic matter removal. This might be explained by the different chemical composition of the each fraction. As expected Llabrés-Luengo and Mata-Álvarez Sharma et al. Moorhead and Nordstedt Although the ranges studied in the experiments carried out may seem very undersized, the reason is simple – after oil extraction, SuOC is a by-product that is small in size. So, it would be interesting to compare the results obtained with those achieved by other authors using the same size ranges. Angelidaki and Ahring Izumi et al. Therefore, in all the above-mentioned experimental studies, the biogas or methane yield was the same or slightly higher when the particle size diminished, except in the case described by Izumi et al. In the case at hand, SuOC in the range 0.355–2.0 Although grinding resulted in smaller particle sizes and consequently a higher surface area, enhancing the susceptibility of cellulose to bacterial and enzymatic attack, in this case, the highest particle size studied (1.4–2.0 The lower methane yield obtained in experiments with small and mean particle, as compared to large particle, is related with CODs as will be explained below. The lower protein content could also be the cause for the lower methane yield obtained with the particles small and mean Traditionally, BMP assays focus exclusively on methane yield. Moreover, very little data is available from the literature on the evolution of chemical parameters for their comparison with the results obtained in the present experiments. The evolution of the chemical-control parameters: VS, pH, TA, SAN, CODs, carbohydrates and total VFA (TVFA) in the digestate, has been outlined in       Identification of the individual VFA formed is important, since it may provide valuable information on the metabolic pathways involved in the process The relevant data derived from the present study are summarized as follows: Particle size of 0.355–0.55 Particle size of 0.710–1.0 Particle size of 1.4–2.0 In order to characterize each experiment kinetically and, thus evaluate the effect of the particle size of SuOC on the methane yield, the following first-order kinetic equation for methane production can be used The adjustment by non-linear regression of the pairs of experimental data ( The high values of the coefficient of determination, From the results obtained it can be observed that the apparent kinetic constants of the process are related to the evolution of VFA concentration in general and HPr in particular. The highest Batch anaerobic digestion experiments of SuOC with different particle sizes revealed that this did not affect final pH, total alkalinity, soluble ammonia nitrogen or CODs, although the largest size (1.4–2.0 A first order kinetic model was used to obtain the specific rate constant of each size range; the slow HPr removal could explain the lowest The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Spanish Ministry of “
