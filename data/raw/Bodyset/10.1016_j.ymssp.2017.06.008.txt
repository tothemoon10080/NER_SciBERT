Frequency spectral data of mechanical vibration and acoustic signals relate to difficult-to-measure production quality and quantity parameters of complex industrial processes. A selective ensemble (SEN) algorithm can be used to build a soft sensor model of these process parameters by fusing valued information selectively from different perspectives. However, a combination of several optimized ensemble sub-models with SEN cannot guarantee the best prediction model. In this study, we use several techniques to construct mechanical vibration and acoustic frequency spectra of a data-driven industrial process parameter model based on selective fusion multi-condition samples and multi-source features. Multi-layer SEN (MLSEN) strategy is used to simulate the domain expert cognitive process. Genetic algorithm and kernel partial least squares are used to construct the inside-layer SEN sub-model based on each mechanical vibration and acoustic frequency spectral feature subset. Branch-and-bound and adaptive weighted fusion algorithms are integrated to select and combine outputs of the inside-layer SEN sub-models. Then, the outside-layer SEN is constructed. Thus, “sub-sampling training examples”-based and “manipulating input features”-based ensemble construction methods are integrated, thereby realizing the selective information fusion process based on multi-condition history samples and multi-source input features. This novel approach is applied to a laboratory-scale ball mill grinding process. A comparison with other methods indicates that the proposed MLSEN approach effectively models mechanical vibration and acoustic signals.Accurate measurement of difficult-to-measure key production quality and quantity parameters within heavy mechanical devices, such as load parameters of a ball mill in the mineral grinding process, is essential for operational optimization control of complex industrial processes Theoretically, mechanical vibration and acoustic signals of industrial mechanical devices have non-stationary and multi-component characteristics. For example, a ball mill is a heavy high-energy-consuming mechanical equipment The normally used time/frequency transform method uses fast Fourier transform (FFT) on original mechanical vibration and acoustic signals. In This finding shows that the single-scale and the multi-scale frequency spectra include hundreds or thousands of frequency variables with a high-frequency resolution (e.g., 1 Normally, at least two types of information exist in the complex industrial process. One type is the information that comes from different sources, such as mechanical vibration and acoustic signals and other easy-to-measure process variables used in the process control system. Another type is the information that comes from multiple conditions, such as samples in different working conditions and running phases. The former can be denoted as “column direction information,” i.e., different feature subsets or different measured signals from multiple different sensors. The latter can be denoted as “row direction information,” i.e., different training samples from multiple working conditions. In industrial practice, domain experts encounter these two types of information simultaneously. Most industrial process parameters are estimated accurately under the human brain cognitive model, that is, the domain experts judge these process parameters based on their own experiences and knowledge by selecting valued information from the two types of information. In nature, expert cognitive process is a selective information fusion problem. How to selectively fuse the interesting information and integrate them by using machine learning algorithms is still an open issue, which is one of the focuses of this study. The adaptive weighted fusion (AWF) algorithm can obtain the optimal observation value in terms of minimum mean square error in a multi-sensor system Motivated by the above problems, a new mechanical vibration and acoustic frequency spectra data-driven industrial process parameter modeling approach based on selective fusion multi-condition samples and multi-source features is proposed in this study. The model has three types of models, namely, sub-sub-model (candidate sub-model of the inside-layer model), SEN-sub-model (inside-layer model, candidate sub-model of the outside-layer model), and SEN model (outside-layer model). The inside-layer SEN-sub-model uses GASEN and KPLS algorithms based on single-scale frequency spectrum feature subsets or multi-scale ones. Candidate sub-models of the outside-layer SEN are built by using the inside-layer SEN-sub-model. The outside-layer SEN uses BB and AWF with the global viewpoint-based learning parameter selection strategy. Thus, the learning parameters of the inside-layer SEN-sub-model candidate sub-models, the ensemble sizes of different inside-layer SEN-sub-models and the ensemble sub-models of the outside-layer SEN, and their weighting coefficients are selected jointly. The row and column direction information are fused selectively. The proposed method is similar to that which was used by experts to estimate difficult-to-measure process parameters on the basis of their experiences. This approach is applied to model mill load parameters of the ball mill in the mineral grinding process. Shell vibration and acoustic signals of a laboratory-scale ball mill are used. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can perform reasonably well in the estimation of mill load parameters. The contributions of this study in comparison with those of previous ones are as follows: A universal mechanical vibration and acoustic signal-based multi-layer SEN (MLSEN) modeling strategy is proposed in terms of the simulation of domain expert cognitive process. In The new strategy is suitable for single-scale and multi-scale frequency spectra data. Thus, users can select a suitable method with different objectives in terms of faster, simpler, or clearer explanation. In All the learning parameters of the MLSEN model are commonly selected. This presentation simplifies the selection process and overcomes the diversity problem of different candidate ensemble sub-models as in This paper is divided into the following sections: Section In this section, the EMD techniques, KPLS regression, GASEN method, and BB and AWF algorithms are briefly introduced. Nonlinear and non-stationary data can be decomposed into some IMFs with the EMD technique. The whole data must satisfy some assumptions      Following the above process, the original signal These IMFs are ordered from high frequency to low frequency with different time scales. The residual can either be a mean trend or a constant. The PLS algorithm constructs a linear multivariable regression model by extracting LVs from the original input/output data space. For high-dimensional linearity spectral data, the number of LVs is much lower than that of the original input features. Thus, PLS is used widely in spectral data modeling. However, the application of PLS is limited by its linear assumption. Many nonlinear PLS approaches have been developed to solve the nonlinearity problem of the observed data. By extending a nonlinear item (using “kernel trick”) to the input matrix, the KPLS algorithm constructs a nonlinear model by using LVs in the kernel feature space. Assume that the input data Then, linear PLS is performed in this high-dimensional feature space. Effectively, this finding means that the nonlinear model of the original input data is obtained. With the use of the so-called “kernel trick,” The KPLS algorithm is outlined as follows: Let Repeat for          After extracting the desired KLVs, the corresponding prediction values on training samples can be denoted as The above kernel matrix To improve the prediction performance of the neural networks, a neural network ensemble method was proposed The realization of GASEN is outlined as follows: The training and validation datasets are denoted as           After obtaining the desired ensemble size and ensemble sub-models, we calculate the prediction outputs of the testing dataset BB search is a widely used method for solving combinatorial optimization problems and is also used to address the feature subset selection problem Assuming that a subset of features from a larger set of ( The BB needs to construct a search tree with different levels (branches). The root represents the set of all the candidate Recently, BB has been used for the SEN problem The AWF algorithm can adaptively obtain the optimal fused observation values based on the criterion of minimum mean square error of the measured values from different sensors and is widely used for information fusion of multi-sensor systems Obtaining the optimum weights of multi-source observation values can be formulated as follows: The optimal fused observation value is calculated by On the basis of previous findings, a new mechanical vibration and acoustic frequency spectrum data-driven industrial process parameter modeling strategy based on selective fusion multi-source features and multi-condition samples is proposed for simulating the expert cognitive process. In nature, the proposed modeling strategy is a multi-layer selective ensemble modeling approach. This modeling strategy consists of ensemble construction module based on mechanical vibration and acoustic feature subsets, candidate SEN-sub-model (inside-layer SEN-sub-model) building module based on feature subsets, and ensemble SEN-sub-model selection and combination module based on BB and AWF, whose structure is shown in In Good prediction performance of the inside-layer SEN-sub-model does not indicate good prediction accuracy of the outside-layer SEN. Thus, one of the problems is the selection of different inside-layer SEN-sub-model learning parameters, such as kernel type, kernel parameters, KLVs, and population size, to improve the outside-layer SEN generalization performance. However, many model learning parameters should be selected. In this study, common learning parameters are selected for different sub-models. This method can improve the diversity among different candidate sub-models. Therefore, the MLSEN strategy should solve the following optimization problem: The ensemble construction module produces the mechanical vibration and acoustic feature subsets as ensembles, which can be considered the “manipulating input features” method. More importantly, the multi-scale frequency spectra are also taken as feature subsets. The inside-layer SEN-sub-model module constructs SENs based on the “sub-sampling the training examples” approach for different feature subsets. The ensemble SEN-sub-model selection and combination module constructs MLSEN by selecting and combining the outputs of the inside-layer candidate SEN-sub-models, that is, two different ensemble construction methods, namely, “manipulating input features” method and “sub-sampling the training examples” method, are integrated. From the viewpoint of the simulation process of domain experts to determine difficult-to-measure process parameters, the proposed strategy can be used to realize the selective information fusion process based on multi-condition samples and multi-source input features. Details are shown in Section Remark 1: Sub-signals obtained based on EMD techniques can be considered multi-source and multi-sensor information. In theory, sub-signals contain local information with different physical meanings, whereas the original mechanical signals consist of different sub-signals. Thus, these multi-scale frequency spectra based on these sub-signals can also be considered feature subsets, as shown in The first problem for building an effective SEN model is the construction of ensembles. Strong mechanical vibration and acoustic signals contain valued information. These signal frequency spectra have a direct relationship with some difficult-to-measure process parameters. To address the multi-component mechanical vibration and acoustic signals, the “manipulating the input features”-based approach is focused. The single-scale frequency spectrum feature subsets are selected or extracted by using the methods we discussed in our previous article The relationships between the original mechanical vibration and acoustic signals and their frequency spectral feature subsets can be represented as In this study, different feature subsets are considered different ensembles for constructing candidate SEN-sub-models. The motor current of the mechanical device can also reflect changes in these process parameters. These feature subsets can be denoted as The contributions of different training samples with each mechanical vibration and acoustic feature subset should be considered in the construction of SEN-sub-model candidates. Soft sensor models based on SEN have better prediction performances than those based on a single model. Thus, GASEN is employed in this paper. KPLS, which is called GASEN-KPLS, is used to replace BPNN to overcome the disadvantages of BPNN. KPLS includes a candidate sub-sub-model construction sub-module based on Bootstrap and KPLS, an ensemble sub-model selection sub-module based on GAOT, and an ensemble sub-model combination sub-module based on simple weighting average.   Bootstrap method is used to produce the training sub-samples. Taking The prediction outputs based on the The process of effective fusion prediction outputs of the insider layer SEN-sub-models is similar to the optimal observation value fusion problem of multi-source sensor systems. Evidently, the AWF algorithm based on minimum mean square error criterion is suitable to solve this problem. Moreover, the candidate sub-model selection problem is similar to the optimum feature selection problem The inside-layer SEN-sub-model for each feature subset was constructed. Then, the outputs of the inside-layer SEN-sub-models can be represented as The outside-layer SEN aims to select the output of some inside-layer SEN-sub-models and combine with the AWF method optimally. Thus, the inside-layer SEN-sub-models are regarded as the candidate sub-models of the outside-layer SEN model, which are sorted by the following criterion: The criterion of ensemble sub-models selection and combination based on BB-AWF is defined by Then, the optimized outside-layer SEN model can be selected with ensemble size Thus, the output of the MLSEN can be represented as             Therefore, the MLSEN algorithm based on mechanical vibration and acoustic signals can compactly combine the column direction information and the row direction information. This process corresponds to the procedure used by domain experts to determine difficult-to-measure process parameters based on different working conditions and multi-source input features in industrial practice. Two-stage closed-loop grinding circuit is usually adopted in mineral processing plants in China to liberate valuable minerals with maximum economic efficiency. The grinding circuit is mostly controlled at a fixed point of the fitness to maximize the grinding production rate (GPR) The inlet load of the ball mill includes fresh ore, mill water, recycled hydrocyclone, and the periodically added balls, and the outlet load includes mineral slurry. However, these loads cannot be calculated accurately because the abrasion and corrosion of the ball load, as well as the wear and tear of the mill liners, cannot be measured correctly. Moreover, the instruments used to measure density, pressure, and flow rates for the mineral slurry are not as precise as expected, and the grinding process contains intricately mixed minerals with randomly varying properties (grain size, mineral content and associations, and micro-cracks and surface characteristics distribution). The size, size distribution, and pulp viscosity density of the ball are also difficult to measure. These uncertain factors affect the mill load and the grinding process. A ball mill is a heavy rotating mechanical device that produces strong mechanical vibration and acoustic signals. The valued information is buried in a wide-band random noise signal called white noise in the time domain Most grinding ball mill circuits use dual microphone-measured acoustic signals to detect the load volume inside the mill The experiments were performed on a laboratory-scale ball mill (XMQL-420 The ball load, which does not change within a short time, is added periodically in the practice grinding process. Only the mineral and water loads are controlled. Many assumptions on the mill operating conditions are made for mechanical vibration and acoustic at different grinding conditions to find the effect of every possible load and operating parameter of the mill load. Therefore, experiments under four different operating conditions are performed to simulate the industrial wet ball mill. Experimental details under different grinding conditions as described in The original shell vibration and acoustic signals are preprocessed to decrease computation time and increase the precision of FFT. The numbers of the training and testing samples for constructing MBVR, PD, and CVR model are 13 different. Standard Welch’s method is used to calculate the power spectral density (PSD) of these signals. Feature subset selection based on MI and feature subset partition based on clustering algorithm that we used in our previous studies, which are same as those in The proposed MLSEN approach is used to construct soft sensor models of mill load parameters after selecting and extracting the feature subsets. Four learning parameters of the inside layer, namely, kernel type, kernel parameters, KLVs, and population size of the SEN-sub-model, should be optimized and selected. In this case, only kernel parameters and KLVs are selected using the grid search method. The other learning parameters are selected based on the experience of experts. A total of 10 different  The radius of KLV and kernel are selected as 9 and 10, 6 and 6000, and 10 and 10,000, for the MBVR, PD, and CVR models, respectively, based on the result in In inside-layer SEN, the “sub-sampling training examples”-based method is used to construct ensembles. Thus, the maximum and minimum selected times of the training samples for different inside-layer SEN-sub-models should be determined statistically.  Unlike in        Knowing which feature subsets are selected for constructing MLSEN is necessary to clearly understand the relationships between multi-source feature subsets and mill load parameters.  The inside-layer SEN-sub-models with the former three maximum selected times is analyzed.  Multi-scale frequency spectra are obtained based on four mill rotating periods data of the shell vibration and acoustic signals by using EMD and FFT as in A larger number of KLVs corresponds to a deeper feature extraction level. Ten KLVs are used to build the soft sensor model of the mill load parameters. With the use of grid search, the kernel parameters of MBVR, PD and CVR model are selected as 500, 400, and 400, respectively. Similar to the process in Subsection      The proposed method is compared with single-model Lasso (original vibration and acoustic frequency spectrum), single-model KPLS (selected serially combined feature subsets of single-scale frequency spectrum), single-model LS-SVM (features of single-scale frequency spectrum)  The proposed approach for the soft sensor model based on single-scale frequency spectrum has the lowest average prediction error (0.1153) among all the single model and SEN model methods. In the Lasso and The proposed approach for soft sensor model based on multi-scale frequency spectrum using EMD and FFT has the lowest prediction error (RMSRE With regard to the select times of these feature subsets and multi-scale frequency spectra, soft sensor models for different mill load parameters have different statistical results. The average number of the selected feature subsets for the PD and CVR models is 2 and 3, respectively. The common feature subsets for PD and CVR model are 15 (MI-VSUB) and 5 (VFULL), respectively. All these selected feature subsets come from the shell vibration frequency spectrum with full global information. However, the average selected feature subsets for MBVR model is 6, which is twice that of PD and CVR models. The same feature subsets are 7 (ALF), 8 (AMF), 10 (AFULL), and 16 (MI-ASUB). These results show that MBVR has a strong relationship with acoustic frequency spectrum. Shell vibration is a source of acoustic signal. The issue now is why the shell vibration frequency spectral feature subsets are not selected for the MBVR model. MBVR models use VIMF4, VIMF2, and VIMF6 to construct the final model. Thus, these sub-signals may be sources of acoustic signals. Moreover, in this study, only two sub-signals (VIMF4 and AIMF2) are used to build the MBVR model. Only VIMF4 and VIMF2, whose ranges are 1000–8500 Mean squared error prediction of testing datasets is normally used to estimate the regression model prediction performance. However, a training dataset has to be used on the condition that the adequately large testing samples are unavailable. Leave-one-out cross-validation, K-fold cross-validation, and bootstrap estimate and its variants can be employed as performance estimators. Moreover, these estimators have been compared extensively under the condition that the input features are fewer than the training samples To assume Unlike the method in Section  The selected times of different feature subsets and IMF sub-signals for building the CVR model based on the proposed method for 20 repeated running times are shown in  With regard to the soft sensor model based on single-scale frequency spectrum, the most selected feature subsets are VLF and VFULL, which were both selected a total of 17 times. Acoustic signal-based feature subsets were selected only 13 times. This conclusion is consistent with most of the former studies, as shown in For the soft sensor model based on multi-scale frequency spectrum, the most frequently selected sub-signals are VIMF2, VIMF 3, and VIMF4; they were selected 12, 11, and 10 times, respectively. However, AIMF sub-signals were selected only 12 times. This result is also consistent with the findings of most previous studies. As shell vibration is one source of the acoustic signals, selecting local single AIMF sub-signals is also reasonable. From another viewpoint, the FFT-based single-scale frequency spectrum and the EMD-FFT-based different local-scale ones represent the global and local mechanical vibration information, respectively. Combining these spectra features, such as that of the image processing The above analysis shows that the proposed method is suitable for both single-scale frequency spectrum based on FFT and multi-scale frequency spectrum based on EMD and FFT. This study provides a new modeling structure for mechanical vibration and acoustic frequency spectra data-driven process parameter soft sensor methods. An in-depth study of multi-scale frequency spectra-based approaches, such as adaptive selection of kernel parameters, detailed interpretations of different sub-signals based on mathematic simulation model and laboratory-scale ball mill experiments, and industrial application research, can be performed. This paper studies modeling vibration and acoustic signals produced by mechanical devices in complex industry processes. This problem is solved by using selective fusion multi-condition samples and multi-source feature subsets with a multi-layer selective ensemble strategy. The inside-layer SEN-sub-model constructs different candidate SEN-sub-models of the outside-layer SEN with GA and KPLS. BB and adaptive weighting fusion algorithms are used to select and combine the outputs of the inside-layer SEN-sub-models to construct the outer layer SEN model. Ensemble construction of the inside-layer SEN-sub-models and outside-layer SEN models is realized by using the “sub-sampling the training examples” and “manipulating the input features” methods, respectively. The selective information fusion process of the cognitive process of domain experts is simulated to a certain degree. Therefore, different information in multi-condition training samples and multi-source feature subsets is simultaneously fused selectively. The proposed approach is successfully validated by a laboratory-scale wet ball mill used for the mineral grinding process. Future research will integrate the mathematical simulation model and laboratory-scale ball mill experiments that will be validated based on the industrial-scale ball mill.
