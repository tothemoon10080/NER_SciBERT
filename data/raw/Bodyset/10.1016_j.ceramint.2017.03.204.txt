High temperature solid state is reported the most common synthesis technique for Ca2SnO4 ceramics, nevertheless it requires high thermal treatment temperature and long synthesis time. Our previous studies indicated that Ca2SnO4 was much easier to form if SnO2 and CaCO3 were roasted under CO-CO2 atmosphere at relatively low temperatures. In this study, the reaction mechanism between SnO2 and CaCO3 under 15vol% CO/(CO+CO2) atmosphere and air atmosphere were firstly investigated by using XRD, SEM, XPS, etc. In addition, the Eu-doped Ca2SnO4 was synthesized by low-temperature solid state reaction under CO-CO2 atmosphere. The results indicated that the crystal structure and photoluminescence properties of the products were similar to those of samples synthesized under air atmosphere, whereas the synthetic temperature was reduced by more than 300°C.Alkaline earth stannates have advantages of stable crystalline structure and semiconducting properties, which are widely used as ceramic dielectrics, gas-sensing materials, electrode bodies, photocatalysts, ferromagnets, battery anode, photoluminescence materials, etc. Perovskite-type structure of CaSnO High-temperature solid state method was the most common synthesis technique for RE-doped Ca Our previous studies indicated that Fe In this investigation, the major objectives were: 1) to compare the formation mechanisms of Ca The purity of the raw materials of analytical pure reagents (CaCO The phase constituents of the roasted samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550PC, Japan Rigaku Co., Ltd) with the step of 0.02° at 10° In order to compare the formation mechanism of Ca  The XRD patterns of the products roasted under 15 SEM-EDS analysis was used to observe the morphologies of the roasted products, and the results of Based on the XRD results in  The results in   Previous studies have indicated that it was difficult for the solid state reaction between CaO and SnO However, the formation temperature of Ca In addition, SnO was easily generated as Eq. Based on the above discussion and previous studies It was found that Ca  In order to verify the fluorescence property of the synthetic Eu-doped Ca  The reaction mechanism between SnO The intermediate product of SnO was found to be the critical factor affecting the formation of Ca Eu-doped Ca The authors would express their heartful thanks to
