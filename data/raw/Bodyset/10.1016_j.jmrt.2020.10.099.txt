Friction stir lap welding (FSLW) was employed to weld dissimilar joints of zirconium and stainless steel for the first time. The microstructure, evolution mechanism of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) and mechanical properties of joint were investigated. Discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) occurred in zirconium, while DDRX occurred in stainless steel during FSLW. The formation sequence of IMCs at the interface was FeZr3, FeZr2, Fe2Zr, and Fe23Zr6. The crack nucleated at the hook zone on the advancing side (HookAS), and IMCs in the Zr/SS mixed zone accelerated crack propagation. The fracture surface exhibited ductile-brittle mixed fracture characteristic.Zirconium (Zr) alloys are widely used as fuel cladding and structural materials in nuclear industry because of low thermal neutron absorption cross section, good high-temperature mechanical properties, and excellent corrosion resistance. Moreover, cost-effective stainless steels (SS) are often used as out-of-core structural materials owing to good corrosion resistance and strength [ Heat input affects the type and quantity of IMCs formed in Zr-steel dissimilar joints. Fe Annealed R60702 industrial pure Zr (Western Titanium Technologies Co., Ltd) and cold-rolled 316LSS plates (Shanghai Medium Nickel Industrial Co., Ltd) with dimensions of 100 × 75 × 3 mm Microstructure samples were cut along the transverse direction (TD) with dimensions of 20 × 5 × 4.5 mm           During the tensile-shear test, Hook In this study, a defect-free welded dissimilar zirconium (Zr)-stainless steel (SS) joint could be successfully obtained by friction stir lap welding for the first time. The grains of stir zones on the side of Zr and SS were significantly refined by the dynamic recrystallization. A continuous and nonuniform intermetallic compound (IMC) layer with thickness of 2–25 μm was formed at the Zr/SS interface, and IMCs with a formation sequence of FeZr We declare that we do not have any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the work submitted.
