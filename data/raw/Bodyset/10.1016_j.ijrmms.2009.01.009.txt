Compressional (P) and shear (S) wave velocities were measured in a set of clay-rock samples subjected to a desaturation phase during which the samples were dried at ambient temperature conditions, with a median relative humidity equal to 37%, followed by a heating phase during which the same samples were heated to five different temperature levels, ranging from 65 to 105°C. The recorded data shows that when the degree of saturation is decreased, both P and S wave velocities increase, thereby lying in the range (0–50%). The increase in S wave velocity following desiccation, by as much as 10%, and the associated increase in dynamic shear modulus, suggests the presence of desiccation-driven hardening, which is commonly observed in clay soils. The existence of such a phenomenon, which is not observed in other sedimentary rocks over such a range of saturation values, proves that the classical models (e.g., the Biot–Gassmann equation) used to study the effect of saturating fluids, fail to correctly assess the influence of variations in water content on seismic velocities measured in clay-rocks.There has been a recent and growing interest in the study of desiccation and rehumidification effects on the mechanical parameters of clay-rocks, for at least two reasons. Firstly, the hydric state of these rocks controls the short-term, as well as the long-term stability of numerous earthflows associated with clay-shale basins (e.g., However, the effects of desiccation on the mechanical parameters of clay-rocks are poorly understood, and the rare data relevant to this issue seems to suggest contradictory results. Ramambasoa On the other hand, on the basis of mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements, and observations by confocal microscopy, Gasc-Barbier and Tessier Clearly, there is a lack of adequate data for correct assessment of the impact of desiccation on the mechanical properties, especially on the elastic moduli, which control the bulk compressibility of clay-rocks. In geophysics, an efficient and simple means of monitoring and controlling both water content changes and dynamic elastic moduli changes consists in measuring the rock's seismic properties (e.g., In this paper, we provide new compressional ( A set of three core samples was taken from the Callovo-Oxfordian argillite formation situated at the MHM-URL laboratory in Eastern France. The mineralogy of this argillite formation is on average The samples were taken at different depths, from borehole EST205, and measured 10 In order to desaturate the samples, we follow the experimental procedure described by Cosenza et al. In the second step (hereafter referred to as the heating phase), the same samples were successively heated (in an oven) up to five distinct temperatures: 65, 75, 85, 95 and 105 The last temperature level (105 For each step, the degree of saturation, The laboratory velocity measurements were carried out on the core samples, using an ultrasonic (1 Emitter and receiver transducers were mounted at opposite ends of the core samples, in the The mean values of the  The P and S wave velocities measured during the desaturation and heating phases, are shown in Firstly, it should be noted that the largest initial elastic velocities (   The results presented above show two remarkable features, which were not observed in other sedimentary formations (e.g., sandstones and limestones) subjected to low mechanical pressures and to saturation paths involving the same narrow range of water content(e.g., The first feature (i.e., increase of The second feature should be also discussed, since a 10% increase in The desiccation-driven hardening is characterized by two essential features. Firstly, this phenomenon is clearly associated with the clay matrix. In particular, it was not observed in “clean” sandstones with the same range of water content at low mechanical pressures (e.g., It should be noted that the first point suggests that clay-rocks would show a hygro-mechanical behaviour similar to that of clayey soils, since in both cases clay is the main solid phase constituent. Indeed, many experimental studies indicate that desiccation leads to the consolidation of clayey soils under conditions of negative pore-water pressure (i.e., suction) (e.g., With regard to the second feature of the desiccation-driven hardening described above, it may be reasonable to assume that microstructural isomorphic modifications are involved, rather than reorientations of microstructural units, since the initial anisotropy is not significantly enhanced ( Nevertheless, it is intuitively understandable that the desiccation-driven hardening observed in the case of our experiments would not necessarily occur for other thermal and mechanical sequences, i.e., for sequences differing from our experimental protocol, which was based on moderate temperature levels and the absence of mechanical loading. Indeed, sample EST-624, which was heated to a temperature of 150 Our experiments have demonstrated desiccation-driven hardening of clay-rock samples: the dynamic shear modulus increases when the degree of saturation decreases in the range 0–50%. This remarkable feature, which has not been previously observed in other sedimentary formations, proves that classical models (e.g., the Biot–Gassmann equation), used to study the effect of saturating fluids, fail to account for the influence on seismic velocity of variations in water content. In other words, in the case of clay-rocks subjected to very low confining pressures and high desiccation conditions (high ventilation rates), new models which explicitly account for textural changes in clay will need to be developed. Moreover, our study has shown that the The research work described in this paper was supported by the GDR FORPRO.
