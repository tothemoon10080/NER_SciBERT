Treatment of copper–gold concentrates using hydrometallurgical methods is beginning to make inroads into the traditional field of smelting in selected circumstances. A range of low temperature and atmospheric processes all the way to high temperature and pressure processes have been developed in the sulfate and chloride systems to treat these mineral concentrates. A number of commercial installations have arisen along with numerous pilot plant tests. The state-of-the-art development of the treatment of copper–gold concentrates using hydrometallurgical methods is reviewed.Conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates involves smelting, converting, and electrorefining to produce a copper cathode product. Sulfur in the copper concentrates is oxidized to sulfur dioxide during smelting and converting and is normally used to make byproduct sulfuric acid. Iron in the copper concentrates reports to the slag, along with many impurity elements. Precious metals (Au, Ag, and platinum-group metals [PGMs]) are recovered from the anode slimes produced by the electrorefining operation. The conventional treatment of copper concentrates by this method works well and recovers copper and precious metals as high-value products. The conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates does have some compelling reasons to seek an alternative hydrometallurgical process for recovery of concentrate values. These include the following:        Copper hydrometallurgy has been extensively studied as an alternative route to chalcopyrite concentrate treatment. Historically, a large number of hydrometallurgical treatment processes have been developed to treat copper concentrates ( These processes have all failed to achieve sustained commercial production due to one or more of the following list of shortcomings: Low copper recovery in the primary leach step Copper loss due to copper coprecipitation with iron hydrolysis products Difficult or incomplete gold, silver, and PGM recovery from leach residue Unconventional and difficult electrolysis step Difficult elemental sulfur recovery step from leach residue Excessive corrosion (especially chloride circuits) Difficulty in fixing toxic byproducts in a stable waste product Large energy requirements for mixing and oxygen dispersion Poor-quality copper product that requires electrorefining In addition, a number of other barriers have mitigated commercial success. New technology risk and the cost of commercial licensing have effectively stopped a number of promising developments. Against this backdrop, significant advances have been made over the last few years in advancing the use of hydrometallurgy for copper ore and concentrate treatment. A number of commercial plants have operated successfully in the treatment of copper concentrates using hydrometallurgical processing:        On the chloride side, Outokumpu commissioned a 1-tpd Cu pilot plant for the hydrocopper process. The hydrocopper process produces chlorine, caustic, and hydrogen using a conventional chloroalkali cell ( The methods for copper recovery from copper-gold concentrates are therefore increasingly well established. In each of the sulfate process cases cited, precious metals are not present in economic quantities in the feed material. In general, the recovery of gold and other precious metals from such copper–gold concentrates has yet to achieve commercial success. The CESL group have developed the CESL Gold Process ( The leaching of sulfide minerals can proceed via a variety of routes. These include oxidative, reductive, and nonoxidative chemistries. Reductive and nonoxidative chemistries, while interesting and potentially very useful, are beyond the scope of this chapter. With oxidative leaching, sulfide minerals can be oxidized by various oxidants including, for example, molecular oxygen, ferric sulfate or ferric chloride, or cupric chloride or chlorine. The sulfide mineral oxidation and the reduction of the various oxidants are governed by the thermodynamics of the system. One way of picturing the thermodynamics of a particular system is to draw a potential-pH diagram. This figure shows that chalcopyrite is stable at reduced potential. On oxidation under acidic conditions, chalcopyrite will alter to bornite, chalcocite, covellite, and finally to copper ion in solution. It should therefore be possible to leach chalcopyrite under acid-oxidizing conditions. In practice, chalcopyrite is one of the most difficult sulfide minerals to leach. Various experimental studies and reviews of chalcopyrite leach chemistry have been conducted ( Chalcopyrite chemistry can be described in the chemistry of the individual elements of Cu, Fe, and S. Copper is typically leached in sulfate media to form copper sulfate in solution. Iron may be leached as either ferrous or ferric sulfate and may subsequently hydrolyze as ferric hydroxide, goethite, jarosite, or hematite. Sulfide sulfur in chalcopyrite may oxidize to elemental sulfur or through to sulfate sulfur. The overall chemistry of leaching can be dramatically impacted by the final state of the copper, iron, and sulfur. Acid and oxidant consumption can be affected. This is shown in the following series of chemistries. Chalcopyrite leaching with ferrous sulfate and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with ferric sulfate and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with ferric hydroxide and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with goethite and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with jarosite and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with hematite and elemental sulfur reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with ferric sulfate and sulfate reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with ferric hydroxide and sulfate reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with goethite and sulfate reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with jarosite and sulfate reaction products: Chalcopyrite leaching with hematite and sulfate reaction products: With elemental sulfur as a reaction product, the use of oxygen varies between 1 and 1.25 The sulfuric acid balance is interesting. According to the various chemistries shown, acid is consumed when elemental sulfur and/or ferric sulfate are produced. Whenever sulfur is oxidized to sulfate and iron is precipitated, acid is produced as a net reaction product of leaching. In the case of jarosite precipitation, the production of acid is reduced due to the incorporation of sulfate in the jarosite iron precipitate structure. The kinetics of chalcopyrite leaching is often slow in sulfate systems. At lower temperatures (<110 At medium temperature (∼150 At higher temperature (>180 Based on the chemistry of chalcopyrite dissolution just reviewed, it is now possible to look at different case studies for copper–gold concentrate treatment processes. The sulfate processes for copper recovery from copper–gold concentrates that have been commercialized or are under active development are listed in The Activox Process ( The total pressure–oxidation process ( Pyrite Oxidation: Pyrrhotite Oxidation: Nickel Sulfide Oxidation:  The use of total pressure oxidation for chalcopyrite concentrate treatment results in significant oxygen consumption (more than 2 The Phelps Dodge company (now Freeport) has now pioneered the large-scale application of total pressure oxidation at the Bagdad plant in Arizona (  The washed autoclave residue is neutralized with lime in four stages. If precious metals were present (very low precious metals in the Bagdad concentrate), the neutralized residue could be cyanide leached. The total pressure–oxidation process is very suitable for application where the acid from pressure leaching can be used beneficially. The process has been commercially demonstrated at a large scale and could easily be scaled up to larger size if required. Total pressure oxidation for copper concentrate treatment should now be regarded as “proven” technology. The BIOCOP process was developed by the BHP Billiton biotechnologies group based in Johannesburg, South Africa ( The BIOCOP™ flowsheet has a number of interesting features. Oxygen is used for bioleaching. This necessitates the provision of an oxygen plant. Previously, bioleach plants for gold and base metal applications were operated with air blowers. Arsenic may be removed in a separate step to produce a residue for disposal. Copper may be recovered by SX-EW. Excess acid may be used in heap leaching if appropriate. The Alliance Copper joint venture group (BHP Billiton and Codelco) commercialized the process in Chile. A 20,000-tpa Cu plant was built close to Chuquicamata with the long-term goal of treating arsenical concentrates from the Mansa Mina deposit. The plant was integrated with a copper heap-leach circuit to allow for an acid credit back to the bioleach plant. The BIOCOP™ process is therefore similar to the Total Pressure Oxidation Process described above in It is expected that for treatment of arsenical copper–gold concentrates a cyanidation circuit for recovery of gold from the biooxidation residue would logically be applied. This would be augmented by “lime boil” if justified by lockup of silver in jarosite. The Outokumpu Hydrocopper™ Process ( The copper-bearing solution is purified by pH adjustment to precipitate cupric ion (for recycle to the leach), cementation (aided by soluble mercury salt) for silver removal, base-metal precipitation using sodium carbonate, and then finally an ion-exchange process for polishing minor impurities (using C-467 resin from Duolite). The purified cuprous solution is then treated with sodium hydroxide to precipitate cuprous oxide for hydrogen reduction to metal. The three major reagents needed for this process are chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. These are all produced using a standard chloralkali cell. The use of electrochemistry for chemical manufacture, rather than for metal winning, is a major step forward in application of chloride technology. Chloralkali cells are typically operated at 3000–6000 The main reactions (for chalcopyrite leaching) are shown below. Chalcopyrite Leach: Gold Leach: Copper Precipitation: Copper Reduction: Chloralkali Cell: The products from the chloroalkali cell are exactly balanced with the requirements for copper leaching, purification, and copper reduction. Successful leaching of gold requires a sufficiently high oxidation potential to form the auric tetrachloride complex species. The process does not oxidize pyrite, so only gold that is exposed to solution in the concentrate/leach residue will be recovered by this method. Silver is directly leached into solution as a silver chloride species and can be recovered by cementation on a mercury-coated copper granule. The mercury coating forms a silver amalgam upon cementation of silver. Outokumpu have commissioned an approximately 1 metric ton of Cu per day demonstration plant in Finland for this technology. The Anglo American Corporation/University of British Columbia (AAC/UBC) Copper Process (  The Anglo American Corporation/University of British Columbia process was evaluated in a continuous, fully integrated pilot-plant trial ( The consumption of NaCN was largely due to formation of NaSCN in the cyanidation with a minor contribution from formation of copper and zinc cyanide complexes: The consumption of lime is due to reaction with elemental sulfur (and perhaps sulfates) in the oxidation residue. The “lime–sulphur” reaction is shown below with formation of thiosulfate and pentasulfide ion at high pH value: The gold and silver extraction results are, unfortunately, representative of “direct” cyanidation of elemental sulfur–containing autoclave residues. Gold recovery is often poor due to locking in unoxidized sulfides, sulfur coating or the presence of coarse gold (sometimes formed by overmilling of concentrate to improve reactivity). Silver losses to jarosite are routinely encountered. Finally, the two reactions for consumption of cyanide and lime result in a significant economic penalty to the precious-metal recovery process (not to mention the environmental challenges posed by formation of large concentrations of thiocyanate and thiosalts). All sulfate-based processes that result in formation of elemental sulfur in the copper leach residue face the same challenges in precious metals recovery. A number of alternative methods for precious-metal recovery from elemental sulfur containing residues have had both historical and current interest. Thiosulfate leaching is a natural process for consideration ( The PLATSOL™ process ( The PGMs, which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium, typically occur in nature in close association with base-metal sulfides, such as those of copper and nickel. Gold, although not traditionally included as one of the PGMs, is also frequently found in these ore bodies, typically in minor concentrations. There are a number of situations in which it is undesirable or uneconomic to treat gold-bearing concentrates by the conventional route. In these situations, direct oxidative pressure leaching of a concentrate to dissolve the base metals may provide the best process economics. Treatment of “lean” concentrates containing mixed base metals and relatively dilute quantities of precious metals. Treatment of “dirty” concentrates containing deleterious elements such as Bi, As, Se, and Te, for which smelting has a limited tolerance or may be unsmeltable at high levels. Smaller resource may not justify the capital cost of a stand-alone smelter facility, or concentrate transportation costs to a custom smelter may be prohibitive. The PLATSOL™ process ( Gold Oxidation/Chlorocomplex Formation: Platinum Oxidation/Chlorocomplex Formation: Palladium Oxidation/Chlorocomplex Formation: Au and PGM can be easily recovered from solution using NaHS addition, which drops the redox potential of the solution, resulting in reductive precipitation of the precious metals onto finely divided sulfide precipitates. These can then The process has been tested at both bench and pilot scale. The bulk concentrate from Northmet had the assay, 15.5% Cu, 3.69% Ni, 0.15% Co, 28.7% Fe, 25.6% S, 2.8 The PLATSOL™ process also offers a noncyanide process treatment option for recovery of copper and gold from copper–gold and gold–copper concentrates. PLATSOL™ for copper–gold or similar ores may comprise an initial base-metal recovery step, followed by a PLATSOL™ treatment to recover remaining base metals and precious metals. If elemental sulfur is formed during the base-metal leaching step, then it would be advantageous to remove at least a portion of this sulfur prior to the PLATSOL™ leach step. This could be done by a variety of methods including flotation/hot filtration of sulfur. The Galvanox™ process was developed based on the use of galvanic catalysis ( Leaching of copper from chalcopyrite with oxygen in an acid ferrous–ferric sulfate solution can be written in terms of stepwise reactions and an overall reaction. Ferrous Oxidation with Oxygen: Ferric Reduction on Pyrite (Cathode Process): Chalcopyrite Oxidation (Anode Process): Overall Reaction: Iron can be removed by oxyhydrolysis as hematite. Copper is recovered by SX-EW, which completes (with iron precipitation) the regeneration of acid for leaching in the overall reaction. The complete process is shown in Testing of the Galvanox™ leaching chemistry typically involves controlled potential leaching of chalcopyrite in the presence of variable amounts of pyrite ( The final residue produced by Galvanox™ leaching contains a mixture of elemental sulfur and pyrite along with any other gangue minerals and precious metals (e.g., Au and Ag). There are a number of potential process options for recovery of gold and silver from this residue including direct or high-intensity cyanidation, thiosulfate leaching, or chloride/bromide leaching. The Kell process has been patented ( Of relevance to this chapter is application of Kell process to treatment of copper–gold and other refractory gold feedstocks ( Hydrometallurgical treatment of copper and copper–gold concentrates using chemical and biological leaching has begun to make inroads to the field traditionally dominated by smelting and refining. The field has tended to advance thus far by necessity or unique opportunity. The Mt. Gordon and Sepon processes were developed to recover copper from ores that were not easily amenable to conventional flotation. Phelps Dodge has commercialized the total pressure oxidation process where the acid from the total oxidation autoclave can be beneficially used in the stockpile leach process at Bagdad, Arizona. The BIOCOP™ process has been applied to a unique opportunity at the Chuquicamata complex in Chile. Copper concentrates containing high arsenic concentrations (not easily treated through a smelter) were for a period be treated through the commercial bioleach plant with byproduct weak acid solutions used for associated heap-leaching operations. The AAC-UBC and PLATSOL™ processes will continue to develop for selected applications including copper and copper–gold concentrate treatment. The AAC-UBC process niche appears to be a situation where partial oxidation of sulfur to sulfate is desirable (sort of a total oxidation “lite” process). This may be attractive where a modest quantity of acid can be used in an associated heap leach operation or where the cost of acid neutralization is low and economically feasible. If acid can be used on a heap leach, a small acid credit would then be applied back to the concentrate treatment process. This situation is believed to be behind the choice by Phelps Dodge/Freeport to install the medium-temperature process (similar process to the AAC-UBC process) at the Morenci site. The PLATSOL™ process is still part of the development plan for application at NorthMet ( It is predicted that further niche applications of hydrometallurgy for concentrate treatment will continue into the future. However, the industry is still waiting for a technology that can demonstrably compete on an operating cost/capital cost and metal recovery basis with the conventional smelting/refining process. The difficulty with all sulfate-based processes appears to be the oxidation of some elemental sulfur to sulfate during leaching. The costs associated with the sulfur oxidation process and then the process of sulfate control (e.g., neutralization), makes it difficult to achieve a low operating cost for copper production, except where the acid sulfate is used to offset an existing acid consumption for an associated heap leach. The recovery of precious metals from sulfate-based process residues can also be challenging. Cyanidation recovery of gold and silver from a residue containing elemental sulfur and silver jarosite is difficult due to consumption of cyanide and lime by reaction with elemental sulfur and poor silver extractions due to refractory silver jarosite. The chloride processes for concentrate treatment offer some promise in meeting the challenge of conventional smelting and refining technologies. Chloride processes are attractive due to rapid copper leaching, high solution strength, very low sulfur to sulfate oxidation, and low-temperature/atmospheric pressure operation. The INTEC process continues to be developed for copper concentrate treatment. The most challenging step for INTEC is the use of electrowinning for metal recovery. Formation and recovery of copper metal dendrites by deposition in the INTEC electrowinning cell can be difficult. The Outokumpu hydrocopper process has the attraction of use of electrochemistry for reagent synthesis (chlorine hydrogen and sodium hydroxide). It is significant that hydrocopper is able to extract and recover gold from copper–gold concentrates using selective gold leaching in strong brine solutions. Application of the sequential sulfate chloride Kell process at Sedibelo Platinum Mines is at definitive feasibility level, with potential construction of a full-scale plant under assessment.
