The data on Δ As seen from Itoh and Azakami The data for Bi Risold The data reported in the present work are considered to be very reliable since this involved a large number of equilibrium measurements over a wide range of temperature and was carried out after extended periods of equilibration. Measurements could be extended to temperatures close to the melting temperature of bismuth using RuO The authors acknowledge Dr. G.
