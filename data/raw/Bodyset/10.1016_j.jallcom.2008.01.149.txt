The sintering behavior of molybdenum (Mo) nanopowder was investigated in comparison to that of commercial Mo powder. At a sintering temperature of 1400Â°C, the relative density of Mo nanopowder (94%) was found to be higher than that of commercial powder (74%). In samples of the same relative density, the measured hardness values were 2.34GPa for nanopowder and 1.87GPa for commercial powder. The sintered Mo nanopowder exhibited greater hardness compared with the commercial powders. The sintering mechanism and hardness are discussed based on the linear shrinkage behavior and observed microstructural characteristics.Molybdenum (Mo) has a body-centered cubic crystal structure with a melting point of 2610 Generally, powder metallurgy (P/M) has been used for the production of bulk Mo components Recently, densification using ultrafine Mo powder (particle size of several micrometers) and high compaction pressure has been proposed to enhance the sinterability Commercial MoO The prepared Mo nanopowder and commercial Mo powder were compacted under a pressure of 250 In order to analyze the effect of the initial powder size on the microstructure and hardness of the sintered compacts with the same relative density, the nanopowder and commercial powder were sintered under a heating rate of 10  Linear shrinkage curves for nanopowder and commercial powder are shown in In addition, the nanopowder exhibited a high shrinkage rate at low temperature as shown in   Mo nanopowder and commercial Mo powder were sintered at 1200  The dependence of strength or hardness, The densification behavior of Mo nanopowders and their properties were evaluated by the analysis of linear shrinkage, microstructure and hardness. At a sintering condition of 1200 This work was supported by a Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD) (KRF-2005-042-D00380).
