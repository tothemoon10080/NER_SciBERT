Equilibration of a Ni/La2O3–αAl2O3 catalyst has been studied with the aim of using it in ethanol steam reforming (ESR) under reaction–regeneration cycles. The runs have been performed in a fluidized bed reactor, with the reaction steps being carried out at 500°C and 700°C, with a steam/ethanol (S/E) molar ratio of 6 and low values of space time (from 0.001 to 0.06gcatalysth/gEtOH), for which there is fast deactivation by coke formation. The catalyst is regenerated between steps in the reactor itself by coke combustion with air at 550°C for 2h. Reproducible performance of the catalyst in the successive reaction–regeneration cycles requires a severe equilibration treatment consisting in a reaction–regeneration cycle, with the reaction step at 700°C. Several analytical techniques (XRD, H2 chemisorption, TPR, and XPS) allowed proving that the catalyst undergoes partial Ni sintering in the equilibration treatment, which explains its lower activity compared to the non-equilibrated catalyst.Ethanol steam reforming (ESR) is one of the routes with best perspectives for the large-scale sustainable production of H The ESR reaction occurs in the 300–800 Furthermore, secondary reactions leading to by-products and related to catalyst deactivation occur. Among these reactions there are i) ethanol decomposition to CO, CH Noble metal catalysts are highly active and selective for the reforming steps Although Ni catalyst deactivation cannot be totally avoided, its main cause (encapsulating coke) is attenuated by tailoring support properties and incorporating promotors, such as La Given that deactivation by coke cannot be avoided completely, large-scale operation would require the operation in reaction–regeneration cycles, which entails catalyst regenerability as the key factor in order to attain a reproducible behavior. In spite of its significance for the viability of the industrial process, the regenerability of Ni supported catalysts in the ESR reaction has been scarcely approached in the literature. Oar-Arteta et al. established the need for catalyst equilibration of a bifunctional catalyst with CuFe Based on this background, this paper deals with the behavior of a Ni/La The Ni/La This catalyst (denoted as 10Ni/LaAl) has been equilibrated by subjecting to a reaction–regeneration cycle under severe conditions in the reaction step (700 Prior to the experimental runs, both catalysts are reduced Surface area, pore volume distribution, and average pore size have been determined from the N X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been carried out using a Philips X'PERT PRO diffractometer at 40 The oxidation state of the metal on the catalyst surface has been determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in a SPECS system equipped with a Phoibos 150 1D-DLD analyzer and Al Kα monochromatic radiation (hν, 1486.6 The nature of the metal phases and their reduction temperature have been determined by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), in a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 using a stream with 10% volume of H The metal surface and the catalyst dispersion have been determined by H The experiments were carried out in automated reaction equipment (Microactivity reference-PID Eng & Tech) provided with an isothermal fluidized bed reactor (22 The catalytic bed is constituted by the catalyst (particle diameter between 0.15 and 0.25 The kinetic behavior has been quantified based on the following reaction indices: Conversion of ethanol (X), calculated from its molar flow-rate (F) at the reactor inlet and outlet (non reacted ethanol): Yield of hydrogen (Y The operating conditions for the reaction–regeneration cycles were as follows: The reaction steps were carried out at 500 The regeneration between reaction steps was carried out by coke combustion  The temperature programmed reduction profiles (TPR) for the catalyst prior and subsequent to equilibration ( The position of the reduction band in the 400–700 The metal properties of the catalyst in the two states (  XPS analysis has been conducted to the samples prior and subsequent to the equilibration treatment (once they have been reduced in both cases) in order to determine the impact of this treatment on the surface chemical composition of the catalyst. The parent catalyst has been analyzed by    At 700 The results shown in the previous section evidence that the catalyst should be equilibrated for attaining a reproducible behavior in successive reaction–regeneration cycles. Therefore, it has been equilibrated by reproducing the conditions of reaction–regeneration in  The reproducibility of the catalytic behavior is also observed in The 10Ni/LaAl catalyst undergoes a steady deactivation in the ESR reaction carried out in reaction–regeneration cycles (with regeneration by coke combustion with air at 550 The characterization results for the catalysts prior and subsequent to the equilibration treatment show a significant change on the catalyst's metal surface subsequent to this treatment, with partial Ni sintering occurring, which decreases dispersion and increases crystal size. The decrease in the dispersion estimated for the equilibrated catalyst may also be explained by the lower amount of Ni on the catalyst surface (which is then less accessible for H Although the reducing capacity of Ni is increased, equilibration has as counterpart a lower activity of this catalyst in the ESR reaction than the parent catalyst due to sintering and to the lower content of Ni on the surface. Nevertheless, this lower activity is a minor problem because it may be solved by using a higher amount of catalyst to compensate this effect. The equilibration treatment allows obtaining a catalyst that may be used uninterruptedly in reaction–regeneration cycles with a reproducible behavior, which is essential for large-scale implementation of the ESR process, with this being carried out based on two alternative strategies as follows: i) use of several fixed bed reactors (one in the regeneration step and the others in the reaction step), similarly as the Lurgi process for the production of olefins from a mixture of methanol and dimethyl ether The Ni/La Although the equilibrated catalyst has a significant activity, it is lower than that of the parent catalyst. Based on several techniques, this loss of activity has been proven to be caused by a decrease in surface Ni content and partial Ni sintering, and therefore the equilibrated catalyst has a lower dispersion and larger Ni crystals. Furthermore, the remaining Ni crystals have a great capacity for reduction.  Pore average size, Ǻ. BET surface area, and metal surface area, respectively, m Pore volume, cm Ethanol conversion, Eq.
