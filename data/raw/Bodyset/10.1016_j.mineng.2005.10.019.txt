Gold mining industries produce a considerable amount of waste streams containing cyanide and small quantities of copper, gold and other heavy metals. This effluent is usually treated by the AVR process, in order to recycle the cyanide to the leaching operation, however, this process is not efficient for the treatment of stable cyanide complexes. In this paper, the feasibility of copper electrowinning, and eventually residual gold, in a flow-by cell with nickel foam or a reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) cathode and a cationic membrane was investigated. This process has shown to be environmental-friendly and despite the low average current efficiency and high energy consumption, it permitted the recovery of about 99.6% of the copper and the recycling of 99.4% of cyanide present in the effluent.Cyanide leaching is a very efficient process for gold extraction, being capable of recovering more than 90% of gold from ores containing just a few grams per metric ton and, despite its toxicity, is used in almost all gold mining operations. The success of cyanidation, for more than a hundred years, is due to its availability and ability to dissolve gold through the formation of a stable complex with Au(I). However, some environmental problems are associated with gold mining and processing. Among them, the huge amount of tailings and spent leaching solutions containing cyanide, heavy metals, such as copper (up to 300 There are a number of papers dealing with the electrowinning of copper, silver and gold from cyanide solutions. Some of them deals with gold leaching solutions, containing a hundred to a few mg/L of gold and silver and hundreds of mg/L copper ( Electrolytic processes have been used for metals recovering from cyanide leach solutions and electroplating effluents and come up as an alternative to treat spent gold leaching solutions in order to recover metals and oxidize or even recycle the cyanide for reuse, overcoming the negative consequences of copper-cyanide reactions during gold leaching. This paper aimed at evaluating the possibility of recovering copper and eventually the residual gold from gold plant waste streams by electrowinning, releasing the cyanide from the metal complexes to be recycled to leaching process. An EG&G PAR model 273 A schematic of the electrowinning reactor and solution flow circuit is presented in Sodium or potassium cyanide salts are quite soluble in water producing cyanide ions, which hydrolyze in water to form molecular hydrogen cyanide, with an increase in pH, according to reaction Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid ( Gold forms strong acid dissociable complexes with cyanide, where the main complex is Considering that CuCN can exists only as a solid phase, for a copper-cyanide solution with [CN The overall formation constants Based on the data presented in It can be observed in the diagram of Free energy data available in the literature ( The first reaction presented in The influence of cyanide concentration on the equilibrium potentials of copper and gold cyanide complexes, for Cu(I) and Au(I) concentrations of 300 It can be seen in  Cyclic voltammograms in a 0.1 molar NaOH solution containing 300 Cyclic voltammograms in a 0.1 molar NaOH solution containing 300 The concentration–time relationships of copper and cyanide ion during potentiostatic electrowinning tests at −1300 and −1600 The concentration–time relationship of copper and cyanide ion during a constant current experiment ( The effect of the number of passes of the catholyte through the flow-by cell on copper recovery and cyanide recycling, for a current of 6.0 The influence of catholyte flow rate on copper recovery for an electrowinning test with a current of 6.0 The summary of the results obtained with constant current electrolysis for an initial copper concentration of approximately 600 Voltammetric tests allied to equilibrium diagrams indicated that for a free cyanide concentration of about 0.0115 Electrowinning tests with copper in a flow-by cell with a RVC cathode separated of the anode by a cation exchange membrane permitted the recovery of 99.6% of copper with the liberation of 99.4% of the cyanide as free ion for recycling. Additional research is needed to improve the energy consumption and current efficiency of the cell and finding an optimum point for the balance between copper recovery and specific energy consumption.
