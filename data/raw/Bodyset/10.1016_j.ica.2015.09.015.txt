The factors, including ionic liquid:water ratios, temperature, solvent:solute contact times, and the effect of dissolved rare earth metal ions on the [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O thermometric phase change are determined to develop a process for separating the light from the heavy rare earth metal oxides in [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O mixtures. The relative solubility data for three light (La2O3, Nd2O3, and Eu2O3), two heavy (Y2O3 and Yb2O3) rare earth metal oxides (REOs), and Gd2O3 at different temperatures and different solute:solvent contact times are reported for 1:1 [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O. The light REOs dissolve easily at 57°C with the La and Eu reaching maximum solubility within minutes while the heavy REOs have very low solubilities at this temperature with negligible amounts being dissolved for contact times less than 80min. Gd2O3 dissolves more slowly than the La, Eu, and Nd oxides at 57°C reaching maximum solubility only after 160min. Changing the [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O ratio from 1:1 to 16:1 increases the time required to dissolve the REOs. The times taken to reach maximum solubility decrease for all of the REOs up to 95°C, resulting in the separations between the light and heavy rare earth elements, and Gd becoming less distinct. The presence of rare earth metal ions in [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O results in a reduction in the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of the solvent from 55.6°C to as low as 31.8°C with Gd3+. The best separation of light from heavy REOs is achieved at 57°C but better separation of Gd from the light REOs is achieved at 40°C, below the solvent UCST. The best conditions for a one-step separation of light from heavy REOs in [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O mixtures is achieved with 1:1 [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O at 57°C using short contact oxide:solvent times (maximum 5min). Separations of light from heavy REOs, in waste phosphor samples, containing La2O3, CeO2, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb3O4 and Y2O3, are also achieved even in the presence of high concentrations of heavy REOs using short contact times. The use of [Hbet][Tf2N]:H2O as a means of separating light and heavy REOs is aided by the ease of recycling the solvent which can be recycled and reused at least five times with little loss of solvent quality or efficiency.The rare earth (RE) elements (the lanthanide elements, yttrium and scandium), classified as light or heavy (based on their electronic configuration), have distinctive metallurgical, chemical, catalytic, electrical, magnetic and optical properties that are exploited in electrical and electronic applications such as permanent magnets, rechargeable NiMH batteries, fibre optics, LEDs, catalysts and phosphors. With alternatives to RE elements limited, and demand for them increasing dramatically in recent years Conventional industrial processing to separate RE elements from RE oxide ores involves a combination of hydrometallurgy and solvent extraction Ionic liquids are a class of solvent usually consisting of organic cations and inorganic anions with melting points below 100 We now report on a study of the interactions between RE oxides and mixed [Hbet][Tf All chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and used without any further purification.
