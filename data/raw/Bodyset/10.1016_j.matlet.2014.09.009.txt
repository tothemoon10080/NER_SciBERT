Three-dimensional foam structure LiFePO4/C composite has been successfully synthesized via evaporative self-assembly assisted by polyethylene glycol. The morphologies, structures and properties of bare LiFePO4 and LiFePO4/C are investigated by X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. LiFePO4/C composite exhibits high capacity of 150mAhg−1 at the 1C rate, and excellent rate performance (120mAhg−1 at the 20C rate). The improved properties can be attributed to a unique three-dimensional foam structure constructed by facile evaporative self-assembly. Furthermore, the unique structure can increase the electrochemical reaction surface, enhance the electrochemical conductivity and promote lithium ion diffusion.LiFePO Various carbon resources have been developed to prepare homogeneous LiFePO LiFePO LiFePO The crystal structure has been confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000) with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-6700F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-3010). Thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out on an STA 449C instrument (NETZSCH, Germany) using a heating rate of 5 The working electrode was prepared by mixing the active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 75:15:10 using N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. The resulting slurries were cast onto aluminum foils, then dried at 120 The XRD patterns of samples are shown in    LiFePO This work was supported by the
