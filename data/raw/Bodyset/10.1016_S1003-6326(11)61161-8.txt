The role of several parameters on gangue recovery in froth was investigated. Effects of frother type and collector dosage on flotation performance were tested at pH 10. The results were evaluated statistically by two-way analysis of variance without replicates, sample range and sample standard deviation. Hydrophilic mineral was recovered mainly by entrainment through hydrophobization of Ca+2-activated quartz from tap-water in the presence of Na-oleate as collector; entrapment and slime coating were also proposed as recovery mechanisms in minority. Degree of gangue-entrainment in froth product increases by reduction in liberation size. The experimental results state that selectivity would be improved by increasing collector concentration and reducing the flotation time.
