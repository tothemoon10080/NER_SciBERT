This study investigated the effect of tempering temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Cr14 ultra-high-strength steel. The steel was first normalized at 1223K for 1h, cold treated at 200K for 1h, and then tempered at five different temperatures between 723K and 833K for 4h. The microstructures of the Cr14 steel were characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The tensile strength, impact toughness, and fracture toughness properties of Cr14 steel at different tempering temperatures were evaluated. Results show that inclusions in the steel mainly comprise MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 and a (Mo, W)C precipitated phase. With increasing tempering temperature, carbides became increasingly segregated and exhibited a chain-like distribution. In addition, the tensile strength increased and the yield strength, elongation, impact toughness, and fracture toughness decreased with increasing tempering temperature. For tempering temperatures in the range 753–773K, the volume fraction of austenite decreased rapidly from 20% to approximately 12% while the mechanical properties changed rapidly as well.Ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) is a key structural material for aerospace technology and has become widely used after decades of development During the tempering process, a large number of carbide particles precipitate in secondary-hardening UHSS, producing changes in the steel microstructure. Thus, the tempering process plays an important role in the manufacture process of secondary-hardening UHSS, and therefore, many studies have been conducted related to this topic Previous studies on secondary-hardening UHSS mainly deal with Aermet 100 steel, with some dealing with A1410 steel The Cr14 steel under investigation was melted at 1873 To select the optimal temperature, quenching experiments were performed by heating samples at 1123 A metallographic specimen named “E1” was cut with dimensions of 10 After the tempering process, specimens with a diameter of 5 To better observe microstructures using the optical microscope, the specimen was etched with a solution of 1.5 Inclusions have an important influence on the mechanical properties of UHSS The main types of inclusions are MgO–Al In the early stage of Cr14 steel smelting, inclusions in molten steel mainly comprise Al The microstructures formed after different quenching temperatures are shown in The purpose of tempering after cold treatment is to obtain a stable tempered martensite and induce the retained austenite in the steel. During the tempering process, secondary phases are precipitated and the material properties improve    Tensile strength tests were performed in 6 groups according to different tempering temperatures. The results of tensile testing are shown in As seen from Impact toughness reflects the resistance of metal materials to external shock loads. Steel with a poor toughness has a low impact toughness value Fracture surface analysis by SEM (as shown in Fracture toughness represents the performance of a material in resisting crack propagation Fracture analysis was performed on the 753 Precipitated phases occurring in chain shapes were observed in both the 753  Temperatures in the range 753–773 In the tempering temperature range of 723–833 In the studied specimens, the larger second-phase particles comprise MgO–Al The authors would like to thank
