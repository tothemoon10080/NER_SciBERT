Pre-processing is a crucial step to ensure the efficiency of subsequent processes and the quality of recyclates. The efficiency of pre-processing can be affected by high losses to undesignated output fractions. Standard batch tests usually provide mass balances and are a good proxy for bulk materials balances (iron/steel, aluminum, plastics).
                  This article aims at harmonizing methodologies and recommends a strategy for further study in pre-processing on a plant scale. We have developed an “extended batch test” method, which should help to

                  A methodical approach was compiled with common material flow analysis methods and an extended set of methods, which improve the reliability via the assessment of uncertainties. This applies to systematic effects and random effects. This extended batch test was performed with a 40Mg Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) batch to trace the flows of industrial base metals, precious metals and critical metals in a WEEE pre-processing plant.
                  Results show that one-third of the input was separated and sorted manually, while the remaining material was subsequently crushed and automatically sorted. Copper and precious metals are distributed to various output fractions but are most concentrated in the sorting residues. Critical metals like cobalt and rare earth elements are mainly concentrated in the manually sorted materials but also appear in the ferrous metals scrap and the shredder light fraction.describe the fates of materials and elements, assess the quality of output fractions, identify access points for critical metals and other valuable elements to enable their recovery. Pre-processing is one of the central steps in the recycling chain of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) as well as of other complex products. Through liberation and separation, secondary raw materials are channeled into designated recovery processes. Generated outputs have to be either processed further or can be used directly in final recovery operations. To fulfill the regionally mandatory recycling quotas, current recycling strategies target industrial base metals like copper, iron, and aluminum, and also plastics, as bulk materials ( The overall WEEE recycling efficiency can be measured at three levels: 1. collection rate, which represents the ratio between generated WEEE and WEEE collected for recycling. 2. recycling process efficiency rate, which is the quotient of a recycled material and that material collected with WEEE for recycling. 3. (element-specific) recycling rate, which generally refers to functional recycling and is defined by the ratio of recycled material (or element) and the total amount of this material (or element) in generated WEEE ( Although Reuter and van Schaik highlighted that recovery rates could only be assessed by considering the overall process chain, an assessment of the performance at the pre-processing level is a useful tool to identify design-related reasons for resource losses due to insufficient liberation ( In process engineering, mass and energy balances represent essential tools for checking the efficiency of processes. Recycling efficiency is usually tested with batch tests. Due to local legislation, recycling schemes or internal quality management, plant operators are increasingly required to perform such batch tests ( Experimental material flow analysis has been introduced as a systematic approach to track goods/materials and substances to understand their origin and fate in investigated processes. It is based on the same procedures used for conventional batch tests, which means a mass balance of goods. Also, the MFA can focus on individual substances (chemical elements, alloys, compounds, etc.) which is often called substance flow analysis (SFA) ( In order to compare commonly used methodologies and the quality of the results of MFA on a substance level, various studies using experimental batch tests have been compared in Some conclusions from previous MFA studies can be summarized as follows: Assessment of uncertainties and an appropriate uncertainty propagation received only minor attention. In order to generate data with a high level of detail, a combination of various methodologies has to be used. Through this, uncertainties like systematic effects can be reduced. Furthermore, it is important to validate results. One possibility is the sampling of the input material in order to match the results of input and output. Dissipation of lower value critical metals in pre-processing has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the objective of this article is to demonstrate a suitable methodology for WEEE pre-processing that supports improvements in recycling efficiencies for bulk and trace materials along the recycling chain with particular attention to CRM, which presently has low recycling rates. For this, we took the standard WEEELABEX batch test ( describe the fate of materials and elements during pre-processing, assess the quality of output fractions from pre-processing relative to the subsequent process steps and identify options for further concentration of CRMs and other valuable elements to enable their recovery Furthermore, this article should help to harmonize existing methodologies and recommend a useful strategy for further study in pre-processing on a plant scale. For this study, a batch test was conducted in a WEEE pre-processing plant. The processes used covered liberation and manual and automated sorting, which can be regarded as typical in the pre-processing sector. The input material was 40  Target metals of this investigation include ‘industrial base metals’ (IBM) like aluminum, iron and copper, ‘precious metals’ (PM) gold, silver, palladium and platinum and a selected ‘set of critical metals’ (S-CRM) like cobalt, gallium, indium, tantalum and the WEEE relevant REE (neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, lanthanum, cerium, europium, lutetium, etc.). Various experimental MFA have been conducted in recent years with different objectives and waste streams. Based on the information in Based on a chemical characterization, the composition of all input and output materials can be assessed. For output fractions consisting of whole devices or components, disassembly prior to chemical analyses might be necessary. Additional sorting and sieving analyses represent adequate tools to increase information density and enable a validation of data. Chemical analyses of all output fractions are not always possible. In such cases, sufficient data must be available from own studies or external research. This secondary data has to be calculated with the experimental data within an appropriate mathematical model. Through this, the overall flows and stocks can be assessed. Uncertainties are usually not part of MFA studies ( In this study, sampling followed the method of LAGA PN 98, which represents the only national regulation for the sampling of waste materials in Germany. It provides a general guideline for procedures for the investigation of physical, chemical and biological properties of waste ( Relevant parameters were established prior to the batch test, to obtain information about the homogeneity of the materials to be sampled, predicted volume and mass per output, bulk density and grain size distribution. From this, a minimum number of single samples of equal volume and the total size of the sample taken per output were calculated. The amount of single samples taken was divided by the duration of the batch test (cf. Supporting information S3). The pre-assessment revealed a high inhomogeneity for particular output materials. According to The sampling of single devices and components of input material and material deriving from manual separation is unusual in sampling procedure. As these flows represent no continuous stream, LAGA 98PN suggests a single sampling of these fractions. Therefore, material from the manual separation was sampled in high quantities, to carry out product-centric recyclability assessments with disassemblies and partial chemical analyses ( In order to provide sufficient representative material for the characterization of the output fractions, the samples taken were split for chemical analyses, sieving analyses and sorting analyses, with some partial samples retained. The division of the samples was carried out using a ripple divider for handling large sample volumes (cf. Supporting information S4). The chemical analyses were conducted in up to three laboratories, depending on the elements to be measured and the complexity of the sample. Characterization of output materials provides the database for the MFA. The information was gathered through physical and chemical characterization of the input materials and output fractions from manual sorting (MS) and automated sorting (AS). A full analysis is not always possible or feasible. Therefore, different methodologies were used.    The Supporting information S6 shows the disassembly protocol draft. The composition data assessed for small household tools, loudspeaker drivers, and e-motors is depicted in S7.  Due to high shares of fines between 0.25 and 5.0       Laboratory 1 applied a fire assay and remelting with a recuperation of target elements. An X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) and a wet-chemical digestion with a subsequent determination through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were carried out. Laboratory 2 analyzed smaller sample sizes to compare the results with laboratory 1. For sample preparation, samples AS4–7 were milled in a cross beater mill (Retsch SK1) and an ultracentrifugal mill (Retsch ZM1) with the addition of dry ice in the case of a high plastics content to <0.2 Laboratory 3 received the prepared single pieces of the cast AS1 sample from laboratory 2. Here, an optimized determination for gold was carried out. For this purpose, the sample was digested in microwave-assisted aqua regia at 215 A measurement has imperfections, which lead to a discrepancy between the measured value and the real (unknown) value. Traditionally, this phenomenon consists of two components, namely, a random effect and a systematic effect ( Uncertainties have to be assessed for own measurements and data from literature research. Due to this, an uncertainty propagation with an appropriate mathematical model has to be applied, which provides one value for overall uncertainty (see In this extended batch test study, systematic effects were identified via (1) redundancy of chemical analyses, (2) a comparison of material and element distribution, (3) case-specific methods, and (4) a comparison of the input-output loads.     Literature research gave an indication of gold loads for connectors. By estimated surface areas covered and a layer thickness of 0.02–0.08 In this study, random effects were determined via (1) calculation of sampling uncertainties, and (2) determination of measurement uncertainties.  Calculation of the sampling uncertainty following (  For the assessment of all other necessary parameters, the material was investigated prior to the extended batch test. With this information, a sampling uncertainty was calculated for each output fraction from automated sorting and only for those elements which were listed as target elements for this study and were over the detection limit in the chemical analyses. The Supporting information S9 depicts an example calculation for the output fraction AS1 and the sample mass for laboratory 1.  External sources always carry particular uncertainties since the data gathering method is frequently not well described and uncertainties not quantified. The use of various methodologies on different sample types by other research teams produces random rather than systematic effects. Following The general approach for determining the mass balance on the elemental level is described in Formula 2. Formula 3 shows the calculation of element specific transfer coefficients following Calculation of mass balance on element level Calculation of element specific transfer coefficients  Due to the methods used for sampling and analysis, only one value is provided by the chemical analyses of the output fractions. The approach used cannot give any insight in the statistical distribution of the sampled output fraction. Following usual practice, we assume a normal distribution ( The uncertainty calculation is performed separately for manually sorted and automatically sorted materials (cf. Formula 4 and Formula 5). Formula 6 describes the calculation of the overall input quantity. Calculation of uncertainty for manually sorted materials Calculation of uncertainty for automatically sorted materials Calculation of uncertainty for overall input quantity  This kind of error propagation usually adds a covariance coefficient. The variables are completely independent, which results in a nullification of the correlation and covariance coefficients. Thus, the covariance coefficient was not included. With the information from the sorting analyses, the results of the chemical analyses could be validated. To this end, mass fractions of target metals in the sorted materials were assumed. The detailed list is attached in the Supporting information S13. For IBMs like Fe and Al, the results were almost in the same range. For substances applied only in low concentrations in the original components or devices, some of the findings from the sorted materials differed substantially from the results of the chemical analyses. This effect was also noticeable for cobalt and REE. Here, a significant share was possibly contributed by magnet material (mostly NdFeB magnets). These components were pulverized during the shredding processes. Occasionally, single clots of magnetic material stuck together with ferrous metals were found in the ferrous metals scrap. A closer examination with an XRF handheld (Thermo Fisher/Analyticon XL3 air) revealed high contents of REE and Co and identified this material partially as NdFeB magnets. As this material was highly contaminated, it was not sorted as a separate material fraction in the sorting analysis carried out.  Due to higher findings using the chemical analyses, trace metals were suspected in the fines of the output fractions, as only material over 5 The determination of the element gold was related to high systematic effects. This applied in particular to the sample AS1. Here, laboratory 1 determined mass fractions of about 67 Using the example of gold, the input and output loads of the extended batch test were compared. Approximately 210 Using Formula 1 as presented above and the sample masses, a sampling uncertainty was calculated for each target element and output fraction of the automated sorting process. According to  With the validated data, not only the general mass flows in the extended batch test, but also the flows of the elements studied, along with corresponding uncertainties, can be presented. The transfer coefficients calculated are a highly important tool for the evaluation of the data generated. Supporting information S12 shows the data in detail. More than one-third of the material was separated manually before mechanical processing. These manual sorting fractions consisted of whole devices like IT devices MS8 (smartphones, tablets, notebooks, etc.) or tools MS1 and single components like drivers from loudspeakers MS3, batteries MS7 or power supplies MS4-2. The other two main quantities were ferrous metals scrap AS1 and the sorting residues AS5, which consisted mostly of plastics. About 47% of aluminum ended up in the non-ferrous scrap AS3, up to 15% in the sorting residues AS5 and 17% in the manually sorted IT devices MS8. Most of the copper was separated manually before mechanical processing, but 20% still ended in the sorting residues AS5. Due to the very efficient magnetic separator, 45% of iron was removed in manual separation, and 65% from the ferrous metals scrap AS1. PMs like silver were distributed to all output fractions. Most of the significant loads of gold and palladium were separated during the pre-sorting but were distributed to almost all output fractions in the automated sorting. Highest loads were found in manually sorted materials, but also in low magnetic materials AS2 and in particular in the sorting residues AS5. ΣREE and cobalt represented the highest share of the S-CRMs. Most of it was concentrated in the pre-sorting step (ΣREE 38%, Co 46%) due to battery removal (MS7). SLF (fluff) AS6 also contained a significant share of Co, at 20%. Over 30% of Co and about 60% of ΣREE was enriched in the ferrous metals scrap AS1.  Except for copper, all elements investigated were mostly concentrated in the automated sorting materials. The main reason for this was the high mass share of about two-thirds that went to the mechanical processing but was also due to the high mass fractions of elements in one of the output fractions. Depending on the aims of the sorting process, the agglomeration of compatible elements in output fractions is to be desired, but the presence of some other elements can have a contaminating effect on the material. For example, iron was concentrated in the ferrous metals scrap but was related to high loads of Co and ΣREE. Also noticeable was the high transfer of PMs as well as copper and aluminum to the sorting residues AS5, which consisted mostly of mixed plastics. As in the case of ferrous metal scrap AS1, these sorting residues were significant in quantity and contained a high load of target elements even with low determined mass fractions. The two plant output fractions ferrous metals scrap (AS1) and non-ferrous scrap (AS3) showed a purity above 92–93% of designated materials, while other output fractions had much higher contaminations from undesignated materials. In particular, in shredded PCBs (AS4) contaminations existed in all grain sizes. Carriers of target metals like PCBs for PMs, tantalum or gallium or batteries for cobalt and REE were found in various output fractions. PCB pieces were dispersed amongst almost all plant output fractions, despite the fact that AS4 and AS2 (low magnetic materials) were the intended routes to ensure the recovery of PMs. Also, 1.5% of the sorting residues AS5 and about 0.8% of AS3 also consisted of these materials. Batteries accounted for a mass share of 3.5% in AS2 (see Results show that the mass fractions of S-CRMs and PMs were partially higher in smaller grain sizes. However, the overall share of fines in output fractions from the automated sorting was usually low, with an average of 8.5% for the samples AS1-5. Exceptions were filter dust and SLF (fluff). IBMs were distributed more evenly in the single sieve ranges. For example, copper was usually evenly concentrated in larger screen sizes. In contrast, the CRMs were located more in the smaller grain sizes. In general, 30–50% of the S-CRMs and up to 90% of the PMs enrich in grain sizes below 5 mm. The Supporting information S11 depicts the results for all other studied output fractions regarding IBMs, PMs, and S-CRMs. Supporting information S10 shows the results of the sieve analysis. As shown, target elements were scattered to various output fractions. To assess the potential to separate and recover them, plant output fractions were given an element specific assessment based on their “grade” and the “transfer coefficient” plotted in a hotspot diagram (cf. Supporting information S7, S8, and S12).  Most of the tantalum probably derived from alloys and tantalum capacitors used in PCBs. Relevant output materials for tantalum were mainly located in the pre-sorted materials. The highest share of over 40% of the total tantalum loads, with a grade of nearly 1400 In addition to this output, laptops and desktop PCs also held a significant share of the tantalum loads, with between 25 and 30%. However, the total weight of the laptops and PCs reduced the relative mass fractions. This would appear to be another useful source, but a subsequent separation of the PCB from the device is necessary. This processes did not take place in the plant investigated and is not a part of this study. Other devices like mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets have high mass fractions but were related to low transferred masses due to low collection rates.  Indium is applied mostly in display devices and was only detected in the manually sorted materials. The various indium mass fractions in the flat screen/TFT displays and the screen dimensions directly influence the indium loads. The highest mass fractions of indium were found in tablets (MS8-2), mobile phones (MS8-6) and smartphones (MS8-7). Due to the low collection rates of these devices and, more specifically, to the low amounts in this batch, the highest indium loads were contributed by laptops. The impact of monitors and TVs was limited. The distribution figures for PMs (gold, silver), copper and the S-CRM gallium are shown in the Supporting information S14. Iron and aluminum were dispersed among all output fractions investigated. A presentation in the same form would not be feasible. Recycling of the investigated elements from the output fractions generated in the pre-processing of WEEE is not always possible or economically feasible. Therefore, a recyclability assessment for each element and output fraction was carried out. Supporting information S15 presents the results. Due to the application of a variety of methodologies summarized to one data set to investigate the flows of particular elements, some approaches have to be discussed. Taking single samples and cumulating them into one total quantity in order to sample continuous material streams can lead to unexpected failures. The characteristics of the single samples investigated represent only a small share of all the material processed. During sampling breaks, significant variations in the composition and subsequently in the mass fractions measured can take place. This “nugget effect” is a chaotic component and can be considered as the variance of an entirely random component ( An approach with much more statistical power could be premised on a sampling methodology based on many single samples taken randomly over time that are subsequently chemically analyzed. By using a large amount of single values, the variability of each material investigated can be determined ( In this study, Gy’s formula was used to determine sampling uncertainties. This methodology focused initially on compact materials. As the shredder light fractions have a very fluffy appearance with some very long fibers, there were doubts about whether the calculations were suited to this kind of output. Similar application problems are known to have arisen for other formulas in some areas ( The sample masses directly influence the quality of the results. Based on the physical and chemical properties of the material to be analyzed, uncertainty can be calculated. This has been done for all output fractions sampled in this study. However, the sampling uncertainty for the chemical analyses is not considered. For a wet-chemical digestion and a subsequent chemical analysis, usually a mass between 0.1–1 The main focus for the extended batch test described is the chemical characterization of all flows. However, varying results based on random or systematic effects can lead to much higher or lower loads of the element being investigated. This particularly applies to flows with large shares of the total input. Examples in this study are the ferrous metals scrap AS1 and the sorting residues output AS5. Also, the detection limits of measurement devices raise similar problems, as element mass fractions below those limits are not considered mass flows. Consequently, total flows can be systematically underestimated for the overall MFA if this flow is set to zero, or systematically overestimated if the limit of detection (LOD) is considered as the average value. In order to improve the sensitivity of the analysis, a further fractioning of waste fractions through sorting, sieving, and disassembly might be useful prior to a chemical characterization to achieve fractions above the detection limit and to identify hotspots. MFA studies aggregate data from multiple data origins with accompanying uncertainties. Different methodologies and sources can provide such uncertainties in various data formats. However, usually, the applied mathematical model is limited regarding the handling of extended uncertainty information like variability or inherent randomness and unpredictability, which cannot be expressed in a simple value for the mean and standard deviation ( Case specific mathematical models need to be developed for each application. However, appropriate mathematical operations able to handle these data sets are not yet available in a structured way. The models currently in use result in a high-level aggregation of data. The related losses of information are the reason why societal MFA are sometimes criticized for an overly simplistic treatment of material flows and processes ( Further research is needed on the topic of mathematical models, particularly regarding uncertainty propagation using extended uncertainty information. A consistent guideline on the use of appropriate tools for case-specific models should be provided. To avoid major systematic and random effects, sampling procedures, sample preparation, and chemical analyses play key roles in the execution of experimental MFA studies. A method comparison with other MFA studies (cf. The main function of the sample preparation for chemical characterization is the homogenization associated with comminution and/or remelting. Prior tasks can include sorting, sieving, disassembly, etc. Such processes greatly influence the volatility of particular substances to be measured. Due to a usually uniform application of one chosen sample preparation procedure, process related losses remain unnoticed, which leads to an underestimation of results. The same applies to the subsequent chemical characterization. Some studies used only one methodological approach for the chemical analyses, meaning the use of just one measurement device and also the same laboratory sample preparation, e.g. acid digestion for wet chemical analyses. As a result, the determination of systematic effects related to the method used is not possible. In most cases, the systematic effect was assessed by an input-output comparison. This can prove the overall correctness. However, if the input and output are characterized using the same methodologies, the same systematic effects can occur on both sides, which leads to an incorrect mass balance. Therefore, appropriate methods, like those shown in this study, need to be adopted for validating single measurements. In general, the determination of systematic and random effects plays a minor role in most of the studies reviewed. The application of an uncertainty assessment at all levels of an MFA, like the determination of sampling uncertainties or systematic measurement uncertainties with an appropriate uncertainty propagation, is not usual but is hugely important. Extending the scope of recycling efficiency assessment for pre-processing from bulk materials like IBMs to trace materials like PMs and S-CRMs requires expanded test methodologies to produce meaningful results. Standard methodologies have not yet been established. This applies to sampling, sample preparation, chemical analysis and statistical evaluation. Batch tests applied for WEEE processing as in the context of WEEELABEX certification can be extended by combining various analytical tools to input and output fractions. This increases the statistical significance of the results and also provides additional information to assess recyclability and technical processes adaptations better. Some methodological core findings can be summarized as follows: Gy’s sampling theory is principally applicable for determining sampling strategies and sample sizes but requires a thorough knowledge of the particle characteristics of the batch to be sampled. Additional characterization of batch input material by sorting and dismantling helps to identify the systematic effects of the output sampling and the subsequent chemical analysis. Literature data on material composition can support the assessment of the input composition. Sorting analysis with particle characterization of pre-processing output fractions (recyclates) supports the evaluation of the material matrix relevant to the recyclability assessment and also identifies deficiencies in the selectiveness of separation steps during pre-processing. The combination of sieve analysis with chemical analysis helps to identify hotspots of trace metal distribution. On the one hand, this approach supports lower detection limits for the overall batch. On the contrary, it provides the fractioned chemical analysis with valuable information for further processing to increase the concentration and the purity of output fractions. Chemical analysis of PMs and S-CRMs is very sensitive to matrix effects due to the presence of accompanying elements that can lead to an over- or underestimate of elements. Element and matrix specific adaptation of analytical methods is required. This study further revealed a good separation of the bulk materials for the pre-processing plant investigated. However, valuable materials like copper and PMs are not sufficiently selectively separated. Instead, they are distributed to various output fractions, mainly to the manual sorting output fractions, or to two fractions from automatic sorting (shredded PCBs and sorting residues). Neither necessarily results in an irreversible loss as these materials can be recovered in subsequent processes. The S-CRMs are mostly separated during the manual sorting, with recovery depending on the subsequent processing steps. Exceptions are cobalt and REE. Large proportions of these are concentrated in the ferrous metals scrap and to a lesser extent in the SLF, from which recovery is not feasible. The systematic methodological assessment approach provided to improve element-specific recycling efficiency is to a large extent based on Finally, we want to highlight that element extended batch testing can support specific recycling efficiency assessment, but the results represent only a one-off snapshot of a specific plant, for a specific pre-processing configuration and a specific material input. Results should not be generalized and extrapolated.
