The aim of this work is to study the effect of the thermal cycling on the stability of SME and to follow the loss of SME as a result of DSC cycling. The structural evolution was examined by SEM, DSC and X-Ray diffraction using a heating holder that allows heating the samples. Different alloy compositions have been studied. There is a thermal degradation of the transformation because of the presence of equilibrium phases that change with cycling. A decrease of the transformation temperatures was found. Also the results show that the dependence of the amount of transformation with cycle number is not dependent of the composition for Ag contents from 4 to 15 wt%.
