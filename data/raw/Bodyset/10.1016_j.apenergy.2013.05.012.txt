The Ca-Looping (CaL) technology, based on a dual gas-fluidized bed system of CaO/CaCO3 particles operated at high temperature, is a viable technological process for highly efficient pre-combustion and post-combustion CO2 capture. In this paper we show a lab-scale experimental study on the carbonation/decarbonation of a fluidized bed of CaO particles at CaL conditions as affected by the application of a high-intensity acoustic field. The results obtained demonstrate that both carbonation and decarbonation are remarkably enhanced for sound intensity levels above 140dB and frequencies of about 100Hz.

                     ∼100μm) are entrained in the oscillating gas flow induced by an acoustic field of such low frequency, which yields a strong agitation of the bed and improves the gas–solid contact efficiency. On the other hand, an intense convection of gas flow (acoustic streaming) is generated on the surface of larger particles unmovable by the sound wave, which promotes the heat/mass transfer at the gas–solid boundary in this case. Either of these mechanisms, whose relative importance will depend on the average particle size and sound frequency, will contribute to increase the carbonation and decarbonation rates of CaO fluidized beds in the CaL technology.The Ca-Looping (CaL) process involves the separation of CO A main application of the CaL technology is the post-combustion capture of CO Natural limestones are considered as the most suitable candidates as CaO precursor to be employed in the CaL process due to their low price and wide availability Enhancing the fast capture capacity and regenerability of Ca-based sorbents would represent a substantial benefit on the CaL process performance as long as it would allow for a reduction of the solid circulation rates and energy requirements in the calciner We describe in the present manuscript the use of a noninvasive physical method to promote CaO carbonation/decarbonation in a fluidized bed at CaL conditions, which basically consists of the application of a high-intensity sound wave of low frequency to the fluidized bed. The aim of our work is to analyze the improvement of gas–solids contact efficiency and heat/mass transfer as caused by this technique. Application of high-intensity acoustic fields (sono-processing) has been already proven as a simple and feasible technique to enhance a diversity of processes carried out in a wide range of conditions and scales Two diverse physical mechanisms can be identified as mainly responsible for the intensification of gas–solids processes in fluidized beds by means of sound waves. If the frictional force exerted on the particles by the oscillations of the gas molecules provoked by the sound wave becomes large as compared with particle inertia ( If particles have sufficiently high inertia not to be moved by the sound wave, the heat and mass transfer between the gas and the particles is enhanced as due to The physical mechanism dominant in a sono-processed fluidized bed will depend on whether the particles are entrained in the acoustic field or not, which may be assessed by solving the equation of motion of a particle immersed in the oscillating fluid. The drag force on a spherical particle subjected to an oscillating fluid flow is given by In our experimental work we will investigate the effect of low frequency acoustic fields ( The setup used in our fluidized bed carbonation/decarbonation experiments is schematized in The sound generation system consists of a digital signal generator that produces an electric sine wave of fixed frequency, which is sent to an amplifier rated up to 500 Measurements of the differential gas pressure Δ  In the case that the fluidizing gas velocity is below the minimum fluidization velocity, the particles are constrained in permanent positions by interparticle contact stresses (fixed bed) and cannot be entrained in the acoustic field. The increase of the frictional force on their surface would yield an increase of the gas pressure drop Δ A further remarkable observation is that when sound is applied to the fixed bed in the absence of a fluidizing gas flow a slight compaction of the bed is observed (of just a few millimeters), which can be attributed to the compressive stress caused by the gas flow generated by the sound wave (the so-called CO Note in The effect of the acoustic field on CO  Gas pressure drop measurements obtained for a CaO sample after it has suffered a carbonation/calcination cycle are plotted in The above results demonstrate the enhancement of fast carbonation by means of sono-processing as it was the main scope of our research. A further advantage brought on by sono-processing might be the acceleration of CaCO In this section experimental results on a natural limestone of the type employed in CaL pilot-scale plants Gas pressure drop data as a function of the gas velocity for the natural limestone powder are plotted in  CO  In our work a loudspeaker is used to generate sound, which would imply and additional consumption of electrical energy. On the other hand, the increase of carbonation rate would bring about a saving of energy as the time needed for capturing a given amount of CO These estimations are based on results derived from our lab-scale experiments. As far as energy cost is concerned, it must be taken into account that the additional energy requirement for gas heating and pumping in ordinary conditions depends linearly on the gas flow rate whereas the excess of energy needed for sound generation is quite insensitive to it. Thus, it might be envisaged that energy saving derived from sono-processing would be magnified for post-combustion CO The experimental results reported in this manuscript show that both carbonation and decarbonation of CaO in a fluidized bed, either synthetic or derived from natural limestone and in a wide range of particle sizes, are remarkably enhanced by application of high-intensity acoustic fields. As regards the range of gas velocities employed in our work, the CaL technology finds an application in SE-SMR pre-combustion process, where fluidized beds are operated at low gas velocities (between 1 and 10 Large-scale CO In large-scale applications a further cause of sound intensity attenuation would be the divergence of the wave. At a large distance As already stated, the industrial competitiveness of sono-processing has been demonstrated elsewhere in high-temperature applications mainly related to large-scale pyrometallurgy processes involving the entrainment of particles in rapid gas flows Lab-scale experimental results described in this work suggest that application of high-intensity acoustic fields would be a highly effective method to improve the efficiency of the CaL technology for CO Experimental tests have been carried out using fluidized beds at low gas velocities as those employed in pre-combustion CO Since the application of acoustic fields does not involve any material modification, it is rather cheap and could be easily implemented from the technical point of view, it is foreseen that sono-processing might be competitive at the industrial level. Pilot-scale experiments and modeling should be carried out as a next step to further assess the efficiency of the technique envisaged from our work.
