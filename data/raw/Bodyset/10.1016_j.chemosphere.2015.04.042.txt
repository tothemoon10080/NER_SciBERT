In this study, a coupled photoelectrocatalytic/photoelectro-Fenton reactor was designed to enhance the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants and tested using the azo dye Orange G as a model compound. Pt-decorated TiO2 nanotubes were used as a photoanode with an air-diffusion polytetrafluoroethylene cathode for H2O2 generation. The sum of individual effects of coupling the photoelectrocatalytic and photoelectro-Fenton processes was evaluated as a function of the decolorization and mineralization of Orange G solutions. The dye solutions were only completely decolorized in more acidic conditions (pH 3.0). The mineralization of the Orange G solutions increased in the sequence photoelectrocatalytic<electro-Fenton<coupled photoelectrocatalytic/photoelectro-Fenton due to the gradual increase in the production of 
                        
                     OH radicals. Total organic carbon reductions of 80% for photoelectrocatalysis, 87% for electro-Fenton and 97% for the coupled processes were obtained when using an applied electric charge per unit volume of electrolyzed solution of 200mAhL−1. The Orange G decays for all treatments followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, suggesting the attack of a constant concentration of 
                        
                     OH radicals. Aromatics such as naphthalenic and benzenic compounds were formed as by-products and were identified using LC–MS/MS analysis. In addition, the generated aliphatic acids were identified using ion-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. The final by-products of oxalic and formic acid were identified as ultimate by-products and formed Fe(III) complexes that were rapidly mineralized to CO2 by UV–Vis irradiation. Then, according to the identified oxidation by-products, a plausible pathway was proposed for the degradation of Orange G dye by the coupled process.Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have widely been employed for the decontamination of wastewaters containing organic pollutants due to their versatility, high efficiency and environmental compatibility ( Recently, EAOPs based on Fenton’s reaction chemistry, such as electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes, have attracted increasing interest as promising alternatives for removing a wide variety of organic pollutants from waters ( In EF processes, small amounts of Fe The Fe The efficiency of the EF process can be improved by submitting electrolyzed solutions to an UV irradiation source simultaneously in the so-called PEF process ( In addition, UV irradiation can promote the homolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide, favoring the additional formation of Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) is also a technique used to generate The incorporation of metal nanoparticles, such as Pt ( This paper reports the application of the coupled PEC/PEF process using a Pt/TiO The azo dye OG (C.I. 16 The TiO All electrolytic experiments were conducted in an electrochemical reactor with a 500 In the PEC/EF experiments, the reactor was equipped with a Pt/TiO The effects of pH (from 3.0 to 6.0) on the degradation of OG by the EF and PEC/PEF processes were studied. To clarify the individual contributions of each individual process to the coupled process, PEC experiments for OG degradation were performed at the optimum pH for the EF and PEC/PEF processes using the reactor with a Pt/TiO The solution pH was controlled with a Corning 555 pH-meter. The absorbance decay of the OG solutions was monitored using a Hewlett Packard 8453 UV–Vis spectrophotometer adjusted at a wavelength of 480 The mineralization of OG solutions via PEC, EF and PEC/PEF processes was monitored from their TOC decay using a Shimadzu TOC-V CPN analyzer. By considering the overall mineralization of OG dye to CO The mineralization current efficiency (MCE) was estimated from Eq. Here, The OG decay was followed by reversed-phase HPLC using a Shimadzu 10 Avp LC fitted with a Spherisorb ODS2 5 The effects of pH (3.0–6.0) on the decolorization of 84.5  Although similar tendencies were observed as a function of pH for both processes, faster color removal was achieved by using the coupled PEC/PEF process (see  Thus, to determine the individual contributions of each process (i.e., EF and PEC) in the coupled process for the mineralization of 85.4  Briefly, the slower oxidation ability of the PEC process potentially occurred because the contaminants were only directly oxidized by highly oxidative holes ( The decay kinetics for OG degradation during the PEC, EF and PEC/PEF treatments were followed by monitoring the peak dye degradation identified by HPLC coupled with a diode array detector, where the dye displayed a well-defined peak at a retention time ( The inset panel of The previous results showed that the degradation process significantly modifies the chemical structure of OG, which was diagnosed by the total suppression of color and the high mineralization of the OG solutions. Thus, the formation of various by-products, such as naphthalenic, aromatic and aliphatic compounds, is expected during the degradation of OG solutions, which were identified by LC–MS/MS and HPLC techniques. Moreover, by considering that the dye is mainly attacked by  As shown in Thus, the subsequent oxidation of the aromatic compounds ( It has been demonstrated that the decolorization and mineralization abilities of OG solutions increased in the sequence PEC The authors are grateful to the Brazilian research funding agencies CNPq, CAPES and FAPESP (Process: 2011/21606-9) for financial support.
