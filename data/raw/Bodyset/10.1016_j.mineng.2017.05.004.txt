Electrical conductivity, an intensive property of materials, has been used in flotation for measuring important process variables such as froth depth, bias rate, solid and gas holdup. Most of these applications were based on a sensor that included a conductivity cell made up of metallic ring electrodes flush-mounted to the internal wall of a tube. The use of this approach in lab mechanical cells produces unreliable conductivity measurements as the introduction of the sensor in the relatively small volume of the unit significantly affects its hydrodynamics. A new approach was devised for measuring the conductivity of dispersions in the unit by using cell walls and impeller shaft as electrodes. The use of this approach led to the design of flotation cells that successfully measured the conductivity of sodium chloride solutions and slurries. Results demonstrated reproducible measurement of solution and slurry conductivities; calculations of solids holdup using Maxwell equation for slurries with pulp densities as high as 30% by weight showed relative holdup errors of about 2%. Testing of a cylindrical cell made with side-by-side cylinders of conducting stainless steel and non-conducting plastic, demonstrated that conductivity could be measured independently of the level in the cell, a result necessary for developing on-line measurement of gas holdup during lab flotation testing.The ability of water to conduct electricity has been often exploited in mineral processing to estimate the concentration of dispersed phases in liquid dispersions. Maxwell demonstrated that the conductivity of a liquid is affected by the volumetric fraction of dispersed phases suspended in the liquid and proposed an equation relating these variables ( Three flotation cells were designed and constructed to test the use of the cell-walls/impeller-shaft approach, to measure the conductivity of the fluid or dispersion in the cell: (i) a 2.5 Tests run on the rectangular cells ( Several components were required to accomplish the determination of cell electric performance of the cells ( Continuous tracking of the conductivity of the fluid in the cell was done by connecting electrodes to a Mettler-Toledo conductivity meter (model M300 Thornton) calibrated using a two-point procedure. Standard solutions of 1.11 and 5.15 Measurement in a series of sodium chloride solutions with specific conductivities up to about 10 Testing the cells ability to determine volumetric fractions of disperse phases was demonstrated through measurements of solid holdup of sand slurries (density 2.58 Measurements completed in pulps with up to 30% solids by weight, showed for both cells, a strong correlation with solids holdups calculated from solids addition ( Measurements completed to test the ability of the cylindrical flotation cell for determining volumetric fractions of dispersed phases, when the volume of liquid inside the cell varies, were accomplished by measuring the conductivity of sodium chloride solutions after consecutive additions of liquid. The results showed as expected, and for every solution, an initial linear conductivity increase with solution volume, but once the level of the solution reached the top of the metallic portion (about 6 L) and start filling the plastic portion of the cell, a constant conductivity was measured independently of the level in the cell ( A new concept for designing electrode arrangements to measure electrical conductivity in lab flotation cells was successfully demonstrated for flotation cells driven by a Denver mechanism. Electrode configurations using a cell-walls/impeller-shaft approach were devised to measure the conductivity of the total volume of solution or dispersion in the cell. Measurements demonstrated that the conductivity of sodium chloride solutions and slurries of 75â€“105 The authors acknowledge funding from
