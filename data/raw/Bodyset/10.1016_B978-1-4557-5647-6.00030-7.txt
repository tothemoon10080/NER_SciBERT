             The elbow joint provides an essential link to the forearm, wrist, and hand, allowing the hand to be moved into position for activities of daily living (ADLs) and to transmit heavy loads. Posttraumatic stiffness and pain can result after both operative and nonoperative treatment of fractures and dislocations of the elbow. To restore functional ROM, good communication is required between the physician and the therapist. To be able to treat elbow fractures and dislocations safely and effectively, the therapist must know which structures were injured, how they were reduced or repaired, and how stable the reduction or fixation is. To prevent the adverse effects of immobilization, early active range of motion (AROM) to noninjured areas and early protective exercise for injured areas are advocated as soon as the inflammatory process and stability of reduction or fixation allow.        The   Fractures and dislocations that interrupt the normal elbow anatomy may interfere with effective joint motion and have the potential to cause pain. The elbow joint is complex and allows not only for flexion and extension but also for forearm pronation and supination through the radial head capitellar articulation. Unless normal anatomic relationships are restored after injury, severe limitations of elbow movement will occur. This will impair the individual’s ability to perform ADLs and to hold productive jobs in the workforce.

Forcible manipulation is never permitted in the rehabilitation of elbow fractures and dislocations. These techniques can result in increased periarticular hemorrhage and fibrosis, causing decreased ROM, and can lead to complications of myositis ossificans and the formation of heterotopic bone. Communication with the physician is necessary to determine when fractures are stable enough to withstand AROM exercise and which ranges constitute the “safe zone” (the ROM that creates no displacement of the fracture or subluxation). This communication allows the therapist to develop the most beneficial therapeutic protocol for each particular patient. The timelines for strengthening, weight-bearing activities, return to work, and sports/leisure skills need to be determined by the physician based on radiographic union. Fracture union is paramount because elbow stiffness is easier to manage than loss of skeletal stability and joint alignment. In general, patients will go through three stages of therapy, with the first stage being the inflammatory or protective phase. In this phase, which may begin as early as a few days after injury, stability of the elbow will be maintained and protective motion exercises will begin. Static orthoses may be fabricated to assist with stability and patient comfort. Edema and pain reduction are important. The fibroblastic or early remodeling phase (generally weeks 3 to 6) will commence when there is joint stability and enough healing to progress ROM and initiate some gentle wrist and grip strengthening. The maturation phase (generally weeks 6 to 12) will begin when there are no longer precautions regarding the ROM, and therapy will consist of AROM and PROM exercises, capsular stretching, soft tissue and joint mobilization, and graded strengthening. Use of an orthosis to gain motion will occur in this phase of healing, as will a return to normal activities. Therapy after distal humeral fractures treated with closed manipulation Extraarticular supracondylar and transcondylar fractures are immobilized in a posterior orthosis with the elbow flexed to approximately 90 degrees and the forearm in the neutral position for a period of 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the stability of the fracture. Gentle AROM exercise into flexion can be started at 2 to 3 weeks, with a gradual increase into extension. Strengthening can begin after approval by the physician has been received. Medial epicondylar fractures are immobilized in a posterior orthosis with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees, the forearm in pronation, and the wrist in slight flexion to relax the flexor–pronator muscle group. These fractures are immobilized for 1 to 2 weeks, after which gentle AROM exercise is initiated, with progression to strengthening activities as directed by the physician. Lateral epicondylar fractures are rare in adults, and treatment consists of immobilization of the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion, with the forearm in supination and the wrist extended to relax the muscles that originate from the fracture surface. Immobilization is for 1 to 2 weeks and is followed by gentle AROM exercise, with progression to strengthening activities as directed by the physician. Intraarticular T and Y condylar fractures are treated by 3 weeks of immobilization with the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion, followed by use of an orthosis with intermittent gentle active mobilization for another 2 to 3 weeks, and progression to strengthening activities as directed by the physician. Displaced fractures of these types require surgical intervention, and their postoperative therapy is described later. Practice has changed recently in that elderly patients may receive surgical treatment, but the so-called Medial and lateral condylar fractures that are undisplaced are immobilized in an orthosis or a cast for 4 to 5 weeks with the elbow in flexion. These fractures may become displaced, resulting in limitations in motion and arthritis; therefore, communication with the physician is needed to proceed safely with rehabilitation. Capitellar fractures are usually treated with ORIF, as described later. Therapy after fractures of the proximal ulna and olecranon Undisplaced fractures are immobilized in a posterior orthosis with midflexion of the elbow and neutral forearm rotation. Gentle ROM exercise should begin after 7 to 10 days. Flexion greater than 90 degrees is avoided for 3 to 6 weeks, until bony union is complete. After union is evident, the patient may progress to gentle resistive activities. Displaced fractures are usually treated with surgical management as described later; however, elderly patients who are not surgical candidates may be treated with closed methods. The elbow is immobilized in 90 degrees of flexion for 4 weeks, followed by gentle AROM exercise and progression to PROM and resistive exercises after healing is evident radiographically. Therapy after fractures of the proximal radius. Undisplaced and minimally displaced radial head fractures are managed with immediate AROM exercise or are immobilized in flexion for a period of 5 days to 3 weeks, followed by AROM exercise and progression to strengthening activities as directed by the physician. A loss of full elbow extension may be expected, and displacement can sometimes occur with early motion. Loose bodies can also be problematic with these injuries. Displaced proximal radius fractures are treated surgically and are described later. Therapy after dislocations of the radius and/or ulna. These dislocations are immobilized in a posterior plaster orthosis in 90 degrees of elbow flexion and neutral forearm rotation. If there is suspicion of a lateral collateral ligament injury, then the forearm should be positioned in pronation, and if there is suspicion of a medial collateral ligament injury, then the forearm should be positioned in supination. Circulatory status and neurologic status are closely monitored during the first 24 hours for signs of ischemia and compartment syndrome. Motion in the uninvolved joints is begun on the day after reduction, and gentle active flexion from the orthosis may start during the first week. It is important to know if there was evidence of a radiographic drop sign as this will modify the rehabilitation process. A radiographic drop sign ( Therapy after fractures associated with dislocation: see Therapy for the stiff elbow. Since elbow stiffness is such a common sequela of elbow fractures and dislocations, its nonoperative treatment is discussed here. Sometimes when patients are referred for therapy late or when patients have been seen in another center, they arrive with a significant loss of elbow extension or flexion, or both. Other patients may develop contractures despite the best therapeutic efforts. Elbow contractures are intrinsic, extrinsic, or mixed in nature. Extrinsic contractures are caused by thickening of the soft tissue (capsule, ligaments, muscle) or by heterotopic ossification. Intrinsic contractures are the result of destruction or disruption of the articular cartilage, including loose bodies and osteophytes. Patients with joint contractures can be most challenging to treat, but with the compliant patient and skilled therapist, ROM gains can often be made with use of a corrective orthosis. The orthosis is designed to apply a low-load, prolonged stretch, which in turn should cause plastic elongation of the tissue.  Loss of motion and need for prolonged use of an orthosis and/or subsequent surgical procedures to restore motion Nerve injury Malunion Instability of the fracture and/or recurrent dislocation Vascular injuries and compartment syndrome Myositis ossificans Heterotopic ossification Nonunion Residual pain Posttraumatic arthritis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy  Indications: elbow fractures and/or dislocations that have achieved stability through surgical techniques Precautions Associated muscle and/or ligamentous injury Associated nerve or blood vessel injury Unresolved hematoma and/or edema Unresolved pain levels Unstable reduction or history of recurrent dislocations See the discussion of therapy in the Nonoperative Therapy section. Keep in mind that the newer generation of implants and specialized hardware may allow earlier AROM, and the timelines for healing may then differ from those for the nonoperative patient, underscoring again the need for close communication between the therapist and the surgeon. Postoperative therapy after distal humeral fractures. Extraarticular, supracondylar, and transcondylar fractures that require limited open reduction or percutaneous pinning are immobilized in less elbow flexion than is used with closed methods. The ulnar nerve may be transposed in these fractures. Gentle AROM exercise into flexion may begin at 2 to 3 weeks, with a gradual increase into elbow extension. Some surgeons prefer earlier AROM or the use of CPM if the fixation is stable. Strengthening may begin after approval by the surgeon has been received. Medial epicondylar fracture: see Lateral epicondylar fracture: see Intraarticular T and Y condylar fractures that require fixation with screws and Kirschner wires or full exposure with plating of the fracture are placed in an orthosis in 45 to 90 degrees of elbow flexion postoperatively and are kept elevated. Those fractures requiring full exposure may involve osteotomy of the proximal ulna or release or reflection of the triceps and transposition of the ulnar nerve. Depending on bone quality and the stability of the hardware, as indicated by the surgeon, gentle AROM exercise may begin in 3 to 5 days. If bone quality is poor, or if there is a question about the stability of the fixation, immobilization will last longer. Once mobilization is allowed, the patient is encouraged to use the extremity in light ADLs, with use of a protective orthosis continuing between exercise sessions. Patients who have undergone an osteotomy of the proximal ulna and release of the triceps need to avoid active or forceful extension and flexion for 6 weeks because of the stress these actions would place on the extensor mechanism repair. Strengthening is begun at 6 weeks or at the time the fracture demonstrates healing radiographically. Patients whose bone stock is poor, or who have severe destruction of the joint and supporting structures, may be candidates for an elbow arthroplasty. This surgery and rehabilitation are discussed in Patients with medial and lateral condylar fractures stabilized with screws and/or Kirschner wires may begin AROM exercise 5 to 10 days postoperatively, with the extremity in an orthosis in flexion between exercise sessions for 3 to 5 weeks. If a medial condylar fracture requires plating, the ulnar nerve is usually transposed anteriorly; this possibility should be considered in the rehabilitation. Capitellar fractures treated with surgical reduction and secure fixation (or, rarely, surgical excision) are immobilized in a posterior orthosis, with AROM exercise into flexion, limited extension, and pronation initiated during the first operative week. Supination exercises are avoided during the first 4 weeks because of the stress they place on the repaired lateral collateral ligament. The patient should also avoid full extension for the first 3 weeks because this motion generates a shear force across the fracture site. Strengthening is delayed until at least 6 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative therapy after fracture of the proximal ulna and olecranon. Fracture of the proximal ulna is a common injury, particularly in the elderly patient population. For those fractures that are treated with tension band fixation, intramedullary fixation, plating, or proximal fragment excision with triceps advancement, gentle AROM exercise may be initiated 3 to 7 days postoperatively. Extremes of motion, specifically flexion, are avoided during the first 4 weeks. The elbow may be supported in a protective orthosis between exercise sessions. Strengthening exercises may be started after the union is firm or at least 8 to 12 weeks postoperatively if excision and triceps reattachment has been performed. Postoperative therapy after fracture of the proximal radius. Displaced radial head fractures may be treated with ORIF. If the fragment cannot be fixed and in the presence of ligamentous injury or instability, prosthetic replacement is now the treatment of choice. Postoperative therapy after dislocation of the radius and/or ulna. As described earlier, most of these injuries are treated by nonsurgical means unless ligamentous repair is needed for the elbow to be stable enough to permit early motion. If ligaments are avulsed, they are repaired to bone with sutures; if they are torn, they are reconstructed with a tendon graft. Elbow motion usually begins within a protective brace during the first week, with care taken to use a forearm position that protects the repaired structures (after lateral collateral ligament injury, the forearm should be placed in pronation; after medial collateral ligament injury, the forearm should be placed in supination; and if both ligaments have been repaired, the forearm should be placed in the neutral position). A Munster-type orthosis or sugar tong orthosis that controls forearm rotation but allows elbow flexion and some extension is usually fabricated for these patients. Pipicelli et al. Postoperative therapy after fractures associated with dislocations. Monteggia fractures can be reduced surgically in a variety of ways: (1) internal fixation of the ulna with closed reduction of the radial head, (2) open reduction of the radial head and internal fixation of the ulna, and, occasionally, (3) internal fixation of the ulna with excision of the radial head. Radial neuropathy, particularly of the posterior interosseous branch, is frequently seen in these fractures. Postoperatively, patients with type I fractures are immobilized in 90 to 120 degrees of elbow flexion with moderate forearm supination for 4 weeks. AROM exercise is begun at 4 weeks, and gentle pronation and supination are permitted. The patient may need to be supported in a sling or protective orthosis between exercise sessions. Extension of the elbow beyond 90 degrees is not permitted until 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Essex-Lopresti fractures can be managed with ORIF of the radial head and repair of the central band of the interosseous membrane in conjunction with reduction of the DRUJ, repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, and pinning of the DRUJ. If there has been severe comminution of the radial head, a prosthetic replacement must be used with repair and pinning of the DRUJ. Immobilization is in a Munster type or sugar tong orthosis, which allows gentle elbow flexion and extension while preventing forearm rotation. At 4 to 6 weeks, the pin is removed from the DRUJ and gentle forearm rotation may begin, progressing to strengthening at 8 weeks. These patients often develop chronic problems necessitating future reconstructions. Rehabilitation for the terrible triad injury will be dependent on which structures were damaged and how they were repaired. In general, patients should be seen early in the first 2 to 5 days for fabrication of a posterior elbow orthosis in about 80 to 90 degrees of flexion. The forearm position will be dependent on the ligaments that were injured (see earlier section IV). Patients need to be instructed to avoid shoulder abduction and prolonged internal and external rotation for the first 4 to 6 weeks, as this can put unwanted varus and valgus stress on repaired ligaments. Education on proper sleeping and resting positions to prevent the varus and valgus forces is important during this time frame, with the optimal position being with the arm adducted to the patient’s side in the protective orthosis with the elbow bent and in neutral shoulder rotation. Complex elbow fractures with dislocations and other high-energy injuries to the elbow are frequently stabilized with an external fixator. Initial treatment may include management of skin grafts, free flaps, and open wounds. Therapeutic treatment depends on the individual injury and the surgical stabilization and repairs performed. Close communication with the surgeon is imperative for safe and appropriate progression of these patients to prevent the vast number of potential complications from these injuries. Nonunion, infection, and residual pain and stiffness are frequent sequelae. Postoperative therapy after capsular release of the elbow Because a capsular release is a common secondary procedure after elbow fracture and dislocation, it is described here. Those patients who after 6 months have not obtained a functional ROM via active and passive exercises and an orthosis regimen are considered candidates for this procedure. Operative treatment sequentially releases tissues and structures that are limiting motion. Releases consist of, but are not limited to, the anterior capsule, the ulnar nerve, adhesions between the triceps and posterior capsule and humeral shaft, the posterior capsule, and heterotopic bone that is limiting motion. Postoperatively, ROM exercise may begin immediately along with CPM use. An external fixator may be used if instability of the elbow was present on capsular release. Therapy consists of AROM/PROM exercises and intermittent use of a dynamic or static progressive orthosis, with a static orthosis used to maintain gains at nighttime. See the  See The need for hardware removal Hardware failure Infection  Edema measurements are taken on initial evaluation and then weekly thereafter until there is resolution or they are within normal limits (WNL). Pain levels are measured on initial evaluation and then at each visit during the first 2 weeks, and weekly thereafter, until pain has resolved. Sensory status is measured on initial evaluation and then every 4 to 6 weeks, or earlier if the patient indicates a change of status. Circulatory status is determined on initial evaluation and then at each visit during the first week. AROM exercise of the uninvolved joints is started on initial evaluation and AROM is checked weekly until it is WNL. AROM exercise of the involved joints is started as described specifically for each injury, and AROM is checked weekly thereafter. PROM exercise of the involved joints is started when stability and/or union is firm and PROM is checked weekly thereafter. Strengthening exercises are started as described specifically for each injury and strength is checked every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter. CPM use may be initiated after approval by the physician; usually, it is indicated early, with ROM in the safe zone. Use of a static progressive orthosis and/or a dynamic orthosis may be initiated after approval by the physician, usually after radiographic union is firm. Outcomes after elbow fractures and dislocations vary widely and depend on many factors, among them the severity of the injury itself, the skill of the physician or surgeon, timely initiation of rehabilitation, patient age, patient compliance, and the skill of the therapist. Outcome tools have been developed in an attempt to predict and quantify results for these injuries.
