Binary Metal/oxide composites and their interfaces have important technological roles, e.g., oxide coatings on metals, combinations of ceramics with metals for electronic purposes, etc. The present research is a continuation of the use of dissolved H to help to characterize Pd/oxide composites produced by internal oxidation An important characterization of metal/H systems are isotherms, i.e., relations between equilibrium p After complete internal oxidation and reduction, the H  The internally oxidized TEM and electron diffraction were carried out with a high resolution electron microscope at Nagasaki University (Japan). The samples were prepared by jet electropolishing using a solution of 1 volume of perchloric acid and 4 volumes of acetic acid at 270 Â± 5 K. The Pd-Rh alloy system has a miscibility gap below about 1173 K  A typical electron diffraction pattern of an internal oxidationed Pd There is clearly an orientational relation (OR) between the matrix and oxide phases giving rise to these diffraction spots Further support for the mixed oxide, PdRhO It is shown that a mixed PdRhO TBF acknowledges Westinghouse Savannah River Corporation for partial financial support of this research.
