The data presented here focuses on the physicochemical characterization of perovskite CaTiO3 nanoparticles (orthorhombic) as photocatalyts and the kinetic study of their photodegradation performance toward organic pollutant, i.e. brilliant green (BG) which is azo derivatives dye. The CaTiO3 nanoparticles was synthesized using chicken eggshell-derived CaCO3 and anatase TiO2 with molar ratio of (1:1), (1:3), (2:5), and (2:7). The physical and microstructural properties of CaTiO3 were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and UV/vis spectrometer. The effect of initial dye concentration, catalyst composition, and catalyst dosage on the adsorption mechanism of dye on CaTiO3 was investigated in jacketed photoreactor under UV irradiation. The analysis reveals that BG molecules are efficiently chemisorbed, as indicated by pseudo first order kinetic, and degraded within 120 min. Considering the low-cost preparation process and high photocatalytic performance, the resultant CaTiO3 can further be used as an efficient photocatalyst for organic pollutant removal from aqueous and industrial wastewater.  The CaTiO The current data, particularly the kinetic of degradation of aqueous BG solution, is useful for relevant studies of photocatalytic azo dye degradation using other catalysts, which is not limited to pristine CaTiO The physicochemical data highlights the current synthesis route could not yield 100% CaTiO The preparation of CaTiO Physicochemical characteristics of various CaTiO Having characterized the physicochemical properties, the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous BG dyes using the resulting CaTiO Synthesis of CaTiO Initial investigation of 10 ppm brilliant green (BG) photodegradation was carried out employing different CaTiO The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
