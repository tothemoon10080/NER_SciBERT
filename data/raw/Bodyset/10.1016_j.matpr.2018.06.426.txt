Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have proved their viability as good alternatives to conventional alloys in high strength and stiffness application in industries like automobile, aerospace and mineral processing. Al metal matrix composites (MMCs) are being considered as a group of advanced materials for their lightweight, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and good wear resistance properties. In this work Al6061- nanoAl2O3composite with 1 , 2 and 3 wt. percentage of Al2O3 were fabricated by ultrasonic assisted strir casting process. Further heat treatment of composites was done. Tribological properties have been investigated on pin on disc wear testing machine. It is found thatwear resistance of the composite is considerably higher than that of the matrix alloy and increased with increasing Al2O3 particle content.
