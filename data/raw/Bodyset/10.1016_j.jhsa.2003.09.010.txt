Purpose
                  This study evaluates the use of limited internal fixation and dynamic traction for the treatment of severely displaced digital and thumb pilon fractures.
               
                  Methods
                  Six patients were evaluated both clinically and radiographically at an average of 29 months after surgery (range, 18–36 months) for pain, range of motion, and radiographic signs of joint space narrowing and congruence. Surgery involved the placement of a pin for dynamic traction and an assessment of the adequacy of the articular alignment. A limited incision and supplemental K-wires were often used to improve the position of severely displaced fragments or for the repair of the central tendon.
               
                  Results
                  Three patients were pain free, 2 patients experienced pain with prolonged activity, and 1 patient had pain associated with activities of daily living. Average digital arc of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint was 94°(range, 90°–100°) and thumb interphalangeal motion was 62.5° (range, 60°–65°). The average duration of digital traction was 3.5 weeks. Four patients had greater than 1 mm incongruity of the articular surface immediately after surgery. At final evaluation, all patients had good joint congruency and 2 patients had joint space narrowing but were asymptomatic. There was 1 minor pin tract infection.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Dynamic traction combined with limited internal fixation can be an effective treatment for displaced intra-articular pilon fractures. This technique may allow for earlier removal of traction and simultaneous repair of soft tissue injuries.
