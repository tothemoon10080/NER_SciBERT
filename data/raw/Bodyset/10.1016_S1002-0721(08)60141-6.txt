Ni-W-P-CeO2-SiO2 nano-composite coatings were prepared on common carbon steel surface by pulse electrodeposition of nickel, tungsten, phosphorus, rare earth (nano-CeO2) and silicon carbide (nano-SiO2) particles. The effects of nano-CeO2 concentrations in electrolyte on microstructures and properties of nano-composite coatings were studied. The samples were characterized with chemical compositions, elements distributions, microhardness and microstructures. The results indicated that when nano-CeO2 concentration was controlled at 10 g/L, the nano-composite coatings possessed higher microhardness and compact microstructures with clear outline of spherical matrix metal crystallites, fine crystallite sizes and uniform distribution of elements W, P, Ce and Si within the Ni-W-P matrix metal. Increasing the nano-CeO2 particles concentrations from 4 to 10 g/L led to refinement in grain structure and improvement of microstructures, while when increased to 14 g/L, the crystallite sizes began to increase again and there were a lot of small boss with nodulation shape appearing on the nano-composite coatings surface.
