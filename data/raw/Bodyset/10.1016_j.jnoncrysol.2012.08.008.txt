The kinetics of non-isothermal crystallization of two glass-ceramics obtained from a basalt rock, namely one without nucleating agents (BsM) and the other with the addition of 10% TiO2 and 2% ZrO2 (BsM1) was investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA). The pyroxene structure of the two glass-ceramics was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The activation energy as a function of the crystallized fraction was evaluated by Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS), Starink, Tang and Vyazovkin methods. The crystallization process of the sample BsM is accompanied by a single exothermic effect while the crystallization of sample BsM1 is accompanied by two exothermic effects on the DTA curve. The activation energies for sample BsM are very close to those associated to the Peak-1 of sample BsM1, varying between 325 and 345kJmol−1 on the entire range of crystallized fraction, α. The activation energies associated to the Peak-2 of the sample BsM1 are about 100kJmol−1 higher on the entire range of α compared with the activation energies of the sample BsM and those associated to the Peak-1 of sample BsM1.Pyroxene glass-ceramics possess a number of valuable properties that make them attractive materials for many applications. Excellent mechanical strengths, hardness and abrasion resistance, chemical inertness, thermal shock and wear resistance are unique properties that recommend these materials for a wide variety of applications in different fields such as industrial floor coverings, wall facings, glazes for tiles, abrasion-resistant linings or high-temperature insulators Glass-ceramics are also very attractive because of the relatively low price of the materials used in their preparation. Different types of wastes like blast furnace slag Natural basaltic rocks represent another cheep raw material that ensure high resistance to abrasion and corrosion and very good chemical stability to the glass-ceramics and are widely used for their preparation The main crystalline phase in the glass-ceramics based on basalt is represented by the pyroxene solid solution The crystalline phase in the basaltic glass-ceramics is represented by the pyroxene solid solutions derived from metasilicates, MSiO The propensity of pyroxenes for isomorphism, allows many cations to be easily embedded in the crystal lattice and as a consequence, a wide variety of glass-ceramic materials can be obtained. It was demonstrated The aim of this study was to investigate the crystallization kinetics of two glass-ceramics with pyroxene structure, namely one glass-ceramic without nucleating agents and another containing 10% TiO TiO We started from Romanian basalt (labeled Bs) with the oxide composition presented in Based on previous results The change was performed by adding the appropriate amount of MgCO By adding 10% TiO Crystallization kinetics of the glass-ceramics was investigated using a NETZSCH-STA 449C TG/DTA instrument in nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 20 The phase composition of the samples was determined by XRD using a Panalytical XPERT-PRO diffractometer (Ni filtered, Cu For non-isothermal conditions, at constant heating rate Considering the Arrhenius type dependency of the rate constant with temperature: Separation of variables and integration of Eq.

The pyroxene structure of the studied glass-ceramics was confirmed by the XRD results. The XRD patterns prove the existence of the same pyroxenic phase for both samples BsM and BsM1. Therefore, the addition of 10 %TiO The obtained results regarding the crystallization of the glass-ceramic BsM, without nucleating agent, respectively BsM1, with the addition of 10% TiO Both glass-ceramics crystallize forming the same phase, the pyroxene solid solution, Ca(Mg, Fe, Al)(Si, Al) The activation energies for the sample BsM1 (calculated by all the presented methods) associated to the first exothermic effect are a little lower (on the range 0.4 The presence of a single crystalline phase in both samples suggests that both exothermic effects in sample BsM1 are due to the same crystalline phase (the pyroxene solid solution) but that separates in two successive stages. A first stage, simultaneously with that in sample BsM, can be attributed to the crystallization process initiation on account of some active centers on the surface of glass-ceramic powder grains. For sample BsM1, the separation of a little amount of crystalline phase is followed by a period in which the vitreous matrix, more complex because of the 10% TiO In this context, the real effect of 10% TiO The activation energy of the mass crystallization process, associated with the second exothermic process is higher than in the case of glass-ceramic without TiO This way of crystallization processes development in sample BsM1, strongly influences the texture of the obtained glass-ceramics. Regarding the acting mechanism of TiO The inclusion of TiO Regarding the effect of ZrO  Both studied glass-ceramics, BsM without nucleating agent, respectively BsM1 with the addition of 10% TiO The crystallization process of the sample BsM without nucleating agents is accompanied by a single exothermic effect while the crystallization of sample BsM1 with the addition of 10% TiO The values of the activation energies calculated with the mentioned methods are very close, confirming the high accuracy of KAS, Starink, Tang and Vyazovkin methods. The activation energies for sample BsM are very close to those associated to the Peak-1 of sample BsM1, varying between 325 and 345 The activation energies associated to the Peak-2 of the sample BsM1 are about 100
