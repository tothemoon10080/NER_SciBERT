For realizing to the triboelectrostatic separation of mineral matters from cleaned coal with density of <1.35 g/cm3, the quartz, kaolin and pyrite are pulverized to less than 75 Î¼m and mixed according to various proportions, then fed to a triboelectrostatic separator. The material adhere to electrodes are divided to three subsection samples. The samples are analyzed with XRF, sulphur and ash analyzer. A quantity of quartz of 69.31%-71.27%, kaolin of 75.66%-81.93%, pyrite of 86.74%-90.52% could be removed under the same conditions. The results indicate that in the process of triboelectrostatic separation, coal would charged positively and quartz, kaolin, pyrite, calcite would charged negatively. Coal and these mineral matters could be separated effectively.
