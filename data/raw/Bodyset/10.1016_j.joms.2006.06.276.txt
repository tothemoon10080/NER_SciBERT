Purpose
                  The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of isolated zygomatic arch fractures and to evaluate the functional and radiological outcomes of the treatment.
               
                  Patients and Methods
                  Forty patients with isolated zygomatic arch fractures were analyzed clinically.
               
                  Results
                  The patients were 25 males and 15 females with an average age of 42 years. The cause of injury was traffic accident in 26, followed by fall in 8, sports in 3, and assault in 3. The left side was involved in 25 cases. Fractures were classified into 5 types according to the degree of displacement and loss of bone contact. Reduction was performed in 31 patients, 26 treated by the Gillies temporal approach. Conservative treatment was chosen in 9 patients. The reduction status was excellent in 12 cases, good in 17 cases, and fair in 2 cases. There was no difference in the reduction status in terms of the fracture types or the interval between reduction and injury. Interincisal distance (IID) at maximal mouth opening recovered from 33.4 to 43.8 mm by excellent reduction, from 26.2 to 42.2 mm by good reduction, from 27.5 to 40 mm by fair reduction, and from 41 to 46.6 mm by conservative treatment.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Good functional and radiological outcomes were obtained in isolated zygomatic arch fractures. Reduction status was not influenced by either the fracture type or the interval between reduction and injury, and recovery of IID was similarly achieved by excellent, good, and fair reduction.
