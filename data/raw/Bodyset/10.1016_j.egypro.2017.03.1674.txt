This work reports the first results of an on-going activity aimed at the scale up of the wet-route carbonation of steel slag for storing CO2 and generating a product with valorization potential. Two batches of Basic Oxygen Furnace slag (BOF1 and BOF2) collected at different times from a steelmaking plant downstream iron recovery were used to perform the tests in a pilot-scale rotary kiln unit part of ENEA's research infrastructure. The tests were carried out at ambient (25°C- 37°C) and enhanced temperature (45°C-53°C), under a 40-47% CO2 flow, at atmospheric pressure for a reaction time of 30min. In each experiment around 1000-1500g of BOF slag was employed. The residues were humidified in order to achieve a liquid to solid ratio of 0.17 l/kg. This value was selected on the basis of the results of preliminary lab-scale static and dynamic experiments that are also presented in this paper. The product collected at the end of each test was cured at controlled conditions (T=25°C e RH=100%) for 28 days and then characterized in terms of particle size, CO2 uptake and environmental behavior. The mean diameter (D50) of the obtained product was around 1mm for the tests performed at room temperature and slightly lower for the test performed at 50°C, i.e. around twice the size of the starting material. The CO2 uptake measured for samples collected immediately after the tests was quite similar (4-6% wt.), whereas after curing a 50% increase was observed for all BOF1 slag samples, while only a slight increase was observed for BOF2 slag. These results are significantly higher than the ones of the lab-scale tests. The leaching behavior of the product appeared also to be significantly affected by the treatment performed in the pilot plant.
