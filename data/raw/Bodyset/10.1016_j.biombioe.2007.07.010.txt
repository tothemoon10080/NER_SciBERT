                      and SO2 emissions are reduced at the same time. The devolatilization rates of two biomass-based materials were studied using TGA and were related to the yield of pyrolysis gases and char during flash pyrolysis. Numerical simulations using CHEMKIN to model NO reduction through homogeneous gas phase reactions were reported. The numerical predictions were then compared to NO

A difference in NO reduction was observed by use of different bio-oils under similar operating conditions. This is believed to be due to the difference in yield of flash pyrolysis products of bio-oils. Also, different pyrolysis gases have different NO

Knowledge of the relative contribution of pyrolysis gases in NO reduction will help choose a feedstock of biomass that will aid in increasing the yield of the desired species. A parametric analysis was done using the model to study the effect of varying concentrations of hydrocarbons, CO2, CO, and H2, and the results were then verified using a flow reactor. The analysis showed that hydrocarbons were mainly responsible for causing reduction in emissions of NO, whereas CO2, CO, and H2 have very little effect on NO reduction.The majority of pollution from pulverized coal-fired combustors is from emission of sulfur and nitrogen dioxides. The Clear Skies Act of 2003 would dramatically reduce and cap emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO Previous studies The reburning process is reasonably well understood for the use of coal and natural gas as reburn fuels Bio-oil is produced from pyrolysis of biomass when reacted with air and lime/water slurry in a stirred reactor. Calcium in the line is ion-exchanged with acidic functional groups in the bio-oil, producing a product called BioLime™. BioLime™ when injected into a combustor at appropriate location and temperature pyrolyzes and produces hydrocarbon radicals. These hydrocarbon radicals react with NO The main objectives of this study are to: determine the composition of pyrolysis gases that are obtained from pyrolysis of Biolime products, model the NO validate the model predictions using the experimental results from a down-fired combustor (DFC), and study the relative contribution of each of the pyrolysis gas species in NO reduction through homogeneous reactions. Two bio-oil-based materials, called BioLime™ I and III, were obtained from DynaMotive Technologies Corporation. Bio-oil produced from pyrolysis of biomass was reacted with air and lime/water slurry in a stirred reactor to obtain BioLime™. BioLime™ I had approximately 7 A Perkin-Elmer 7 series Thermal Analysis System was used for TGA studies on the two BioLime™ samples. Approximately 10 The experimental setup used for flash pyrolysis is shown in The DFC described elsewhere in detail All numerical calculations are done using a PSR computer code The procedure and assumptions in the above study are as follows: Only homogeneous gas-phase reactions are responsible for NO reduction. The effect of heterogeneous reactions is neglected. Gases from pyrolysis of BioLime™ react with NO Gas concentrations are calculated from the yields reported in an earlier study and are shown in Reburn fuel is mixed rapidly and perfectly with the products of combustion from the primary zone. This is achieved by use of a high-pressure injection nozzle for feeding the reburn fuel. Reburn fuel is pyrolyzed instantly on entering the combustor and therefore pyrolysis kinetics do not control the NO The kinetics of reburning is controlled by the rate constants for the hydrocarbon–NO reaction system. The effect of mass transfer is neglected. This follows from the previous two assumptions. An average of the wall and bulk temperature at the point of reburn fuel injection is used as the inlet temperature for the calculations. Gas densities are calculated at the reburn zone inlet temperatures. The flue gas in reburn zone consists of 14% CO A residence time of 1.13 Proximate analysis showed that both BioLime™ samples have different ash content, and hence actual weight loss curves obtained directly from TGA are not directly comparable for quantitative analysis of volatiles yield. The weight loss curves on a dry ash free basis for both the BioLime™ were divided into four zones Evaluation of the weight loss of the samples between 166 and 900 The composition of pyrolysis products from the flow reactor, calculated in milligrams/gram of BioLime™, is shown in Predictions of NO Different pyrolysis gases can have different NO The second stage is the reaction of HCN with the oxidizing species (O, OH) to form NH The HNCO reacts further to give NH The NH Burch et al.  The TGA weight loss curves of BioLime™ samples in inert atmosphere showed two distinct peaks between 160–400 The total gas yield from flash pyrolysis for both BioLime™ samples I and III closely matched with the primary pyrolysis weight loss in TGA showing that primary pyrolysis reactions were mainly responsible for the volatiles being evolved in flash pyrolysis. Lower amounts of lignin evolved more volatiles and produce less char during flash pyrolysis of bio-oils in the combustor. Higher yields of pyrolysis gases increase the NO reduction potential of the BioLime™ through homogeneous gas phase reactions. An increase in pyrolysis temperature increased the gas yield along with the decrease in the yield of char. This is mostly attributed to the increased primary decomposition of the char residue. Percentage of NO The higher NO The parametric study from flow reactor showed that the CO, CO The financial support for this work was provided in part by Dynamotive Technologies Corporation, Vancouver, Canada, and the United States Department of Energy under the cooperative agreement DE-FC22-92PC92162.
