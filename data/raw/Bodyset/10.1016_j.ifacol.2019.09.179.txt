This paper describes how a rule-based controller can be designed to control the averaging level of bulk solid materials in a set of bins. The controller automatically manipulates the tripper car speed and the number of bins in use. The tripper car position and each binâ€™s level are the only required measurements. The proposed controller is simple, but effective to achieve a better material distribution among the bins. Also, it prevents undesired states of overflow and low-level interlocking. Examples in an iron ore plant in Brazil illustrate the performance of the proposed method.
