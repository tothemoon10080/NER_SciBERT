New filtering and spectral interpretations of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) are provided. It is shown that the variables reconstructed from diagonal averaging of reduced-rank approximations to the trajectory matrix can be obtained from a noncausal convolution filter with zero-phase characteristics. The reconstructed variables are readily constructed using a two-pass filtering algorithm that is well known in the signal processing literature. When the number of rows in the trajectory matrix is much larger than number of columns, many results reported in the signal processing literature can be used to derive the properties of the resulting filters and their spectra. New features of the reconstructed series are revealed using these results. Two examples are used to illustrate the results derived in this paper.  Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has proven to be a flexible method for the analysis of time-series data. Applications are reported in diverse areas such as climate change and geophysical phenomena The basic elements of SSA were first reported in The purpose of this paper is to give a number of interpretations of SSA from a signal processing perspective by addressing issues related to filtering interpretations, spectrum evaluation and recovery of harmonic signals. In particular, in the case where the trajectory matrix has many more rows than columns, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are nearly identical to those of an associated symmetric Toeplitz matrix. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this latter matrix are highly structured The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we state the basic SSA algorithm and some variations. This is followed by filtering and spectral interpretations of the SSA algorithm. These interpretations make extensive use of symmetry properties of the eigenfilters that are used in the filtering. These in turn are derived from symmetry properties of the eigenvectors of the trajectory matrix. Two examples are then analyzed to illustrate the theoretical results. The basic SSA algorithm consists of the following steps Choose an embedded dimension Form the Determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Define The utility of the method is derived from the following properties and interpretations of the eigenvalue analysis: The eigenvectors The latent variables Consequently, Scree plots are also useful for identifying harmonics in the data. As discussed in The eigenvalues of  A singular value decomposition of the matrix is undertaken Each of the This diagonal averaging is computationally equivalent to calculating Recall that The latent variables The use of reduced-rank approximations to assist in the extraction of harmonic signals from additive noise has been considered extensively in the signal processing literature Before discussing filtering interpretations, we state a number of definitions and properties. A column vector A vector  An         Let  For a polynomial  An eigenfilter is a polynomial formed filter whose polynomial coefficients are obtained from an eigenvector. Denoting an eigenvector by         The latent variable Let the eigenvectors be obtained from the Toeplitz approximation to The filters in Eqs. The relationship between the even and odd filters can be expanded by using the alternate calculation method for the symmetric and skew-symmetric eigenvectors that follows from The skew-symmetric eigenvectors are obtained by replacing the sum of the variables by their differences in Eq. For an even From Eqs. For the designated values of Eq. The results in this section apply only to signals reconstructed from rank-1 approximations, say, The spectrum of the filtered series in Eq. The interesting spectral features of the filtered signals arise from the structured nature of the eigenfilters. Using the Toeplitz approximation, the eigenfilters are either palindromic or antipalindromic. Any eigenfilter The limiting cases for the spectrum of the filtered signal Using the results in When As shown in Section In this section, we consider the following process In this example, we choose We use the Toeplitz approximation From The roots for these eigenfilters are shown in The third column in The top four panels in As an example, we consider a synthetic suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) series shown in Eq. In this example, we choose window length The scree plot for the eigenvalues, By using the Toeplitz approximation, 61 symmetric and 60 skew-symmetric eigenvectors are obtained. The first column of The magnitude of the associated spectral windows of these eigenfilters is shown in the second column in The roots of the eigenfilters follow the same properties in The convolution filter coefficients are shown in the third column of The first three RCs are plotted in the last three panels of The first RC is a very smooth signal, reflecting that it is obtained by a low-pass filtering of the data. By comparing the patterns of the other two RCs, it is clear that the identification of the harmonic component has been done correctly, as the convolution filter acts like a notch filter. Singular Spectrum Analysis is a flexible and useful method for time-series analysis. The primary contributions of this paper have been to provide additional insights into the filtering and spectral characteristics of SSA technology and the enhancements that arise by using diagonal averaging. These new results are derived from the properties of symmetric Toeplitz matrices and the properties of the resulting eigenfilters and convolution filters. Filtering and spectral interpretations for the reconstructed series from diagonal averaging were derived. The symmetric and skew-symmetric behavior of the eigenfilters was exploited to derive a number of these properties. It was shown that the reconstructed series could be interpreted as zero-phase filtered responses, obtained by a particular implementation of forward and reverse filtering of the original data. It was also shown that whereas the latent variables are orthogonal, the reconstructed series are not orthogonal. The results in this paper should enable a more thorough comparison of SSA with other filtering methods. Multichannel extensions of SSA (MSSA) have been proposed
