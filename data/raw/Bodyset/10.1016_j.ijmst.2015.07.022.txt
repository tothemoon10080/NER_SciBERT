This study was performed in two phases of work. In the first stage, four conventional first-order flotation kinetics models were fitted to the measured recoveries data and the best model were selected. In the second stage, influence of pH, solid concentration, water chemistry and the amount of collector dosage were investigated on kinetics parameters including flotation rate constant and ultimate recovery. The results indicated that that perfectly mixed reactor model and Kelsall model gave the best and the weakest fit to the experimental data, respectively. It was observed that flotation rate constant and ultimate recovery were strongly affected by chemical factors investigated especially water quality. The flotation rate constant decreased with increasing the solids content, while ultimate recovery increased to certain value and thereafter reduced. It was also found that the most values of flotation rate constant and ultimate recovery obtained in dosage of collector are 30 and 40g/t, respectively.
