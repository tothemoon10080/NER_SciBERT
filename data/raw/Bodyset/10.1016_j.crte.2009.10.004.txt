This study focuses on two Mediterranean oligotrophic high mountain lakes located in the Sierra Nevada National Park (southern Spain): Río Seco (RS) and La Caldera (LC). A combination of field measurements and laboratory experiments is used: (i) to quantify in situ settling fluxes; (ii) to study the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) release or uptake by settling and resuspended particles; and (iii) to discriminate between the biotic and abiotic contribution for such patterns. In general, all suspensions (lake water untreated and lake water enriched with settling and with resuspended matter) in both study lakes release significantly more SRP to the solution when biological activity was suppressed. Biological uptake from settling and resuspended matter is likely to be limited by the bacterial consumption of P. Despite of these similarities, this study has revealed notable differences in the effect of sediment resuspension on SRP dynamics in both study lakes, when simulating natural conditions (biotic and abiotic processes). While in LC, the enrichment of lake water with settling and with resuspended matter did not cause an increase in SRP concentrations in lake water, SRP concentrations in RS at the end of the experiment were significantly higher (probability P
                     <0.05) in lake water enriched with resuspended matter (3.2μg/l) than in natural lake water (lower than the detection limit). Accordingly, it is reasonable to expect that sediment resuspension, which occurs more frequently in RS compared with LC, affects drastically the SRP availability in the water column in RS.Oligotrophic high mountain lakes, which are scarce in the Mediterranean area, represent ideal ecosystems in which to study sediment-water interaction as a consequence of the low-nutrient content in the water column. Several mechanisms have been suggested to control the exchange of nutrients, mainly phosphorus (P), across the sediment-water interface ( In fact, resuspension may play a key role in the nutrient dynamics of shallow lakes, where sediment often undergoes continuous wave action. Several consequences could arise from sediment resuspension: increased turbidity may reduce light penetration which can diminish primary production and ultimately promote biological changes; nutrient recycling increases owing to particulates bound to bottom sediments are redistributed in the water column ( The latter could be a particularly relevant mechanism in the case of oligotrophic shallow lakes where, because of low SRP levels, available P sorbed to sediment particles could be released and alter the lake trophic status as detected by In addition, and apart from the upward resuspension flux, settling material could also be a significant source of dissolved nutrients through mineralization processes, thus being a relevant component of recycled production ( The effect of sediment resuspension and sedimentation on SRP dynamics is of particular concern for high mountain lakes, which represent remote, oligotrophic systems where the external load of nutrients is extremely low ( to examine the SRP release or uptake by settling and resuspended matter; to discriminate between the biotic and abiotic contribution for such processes in two Mediterranean oligotrophic high mountain lakes located in the Sierra Nevada National Park (southern Spain). The well-documented P-limitation of both study lakes ( For this study, two Mediterranean oligotrophic high mountain lakes located in the Sierra Nevada National Park (southern Spain): Río Seco (RS) and La Caldera (LC) were selected ( In order to study the sedimentation processes in LC and RS, sediment traps for collecting settling material were deployed at two different depths (1 and 1.7 m). The traps consisted of twin-Plexiglas cylinders, with an aspect ratio (H:D where In July 2005, resuspended matter (flocculent layer) was sampled using a horizontal Van Dorn sampler, which was bounced off the bottom a few times to resuspend the sediment ( A laboratory experiment was conducted, in July 2005 (period I), with the settling material collected by the upper traps (1 m) and with the resuspended matter of both study lakes. Suspensions (100 Correlation analyses were performed using Statistica 6.0 Software ( During the ice-free period of 2005 and 2006, both study lakes showed similar ( As Incubation experiments with LC samples showed no SRP in solution (no release) in the control with untreated lake water or lake water enriched by settling and resuspended matter ( In RS experiments, and similarly to LC experiments, the control showed no SRP concentrations in lake water ( Similar to LC, the treatment with sodium azide increased SRP concentrations significantly ( Daily settling rates measured in this study are in the range of those reported in the literature for oligotrophic systems ( The study of the interaction between the solid particles (suspended, settling and resuspended matter) and the solution is complex but crucial for the case of oligotrophic lakes where external nutrient load is especially low and, therefore, internal nutrient recycling may represent a key source of nutrients that ultimately control primary production. This complexity is even greater if we consider that notable seasonal changes in the chemical characteristics of settling matter can occur as a consequence of phytoplankton succession, the mixing conditions and sorption-desorption processes during sedimentation ( Our experiments showed that the effect on P-release of resuspended matter was about an order of magnitude smaller than that of settling matter and untreated lake water (demonstrated by the different scales of y-axis in This study has revealed notable differences in the effect of sediment resuspension on SRP dynamics in two oligotrophic high mountain lakes and thus highlights the need for in situ studies. First, when not adding the biological inhibitor (sodium azide), that is, simulating the natural conditions when lake water is enriched with settling matter and with resuspended matter, no increase in SRP concentrations in lake water was noticed in LC. By contrast, in RS the input of resuspended matter causes a short-term release of SRP from the particulate to the dissolved pool but an uptake over the 7 days of the experiment. One likely interpretation is that bacterial growth along the experiment contributed to an increasing P removal from lake water. However, it is relevant to note that SRP concentrations in RS at the end of the experiment are significantly higher ( The relevance for these results is even more important if we consider that the hollow coefficient (maximum depth divided by the root square of the lake area) is more than three times lower in RS than in LC ( Next, we try to clarify the role of biotic and abiotic processes in the release or uptake of SRP by settling and by resuspended matter. In LC, the higher SRP levels in preparations with treatments (addition of sodium azide) compared with controls, for both resuspended and settling matter, suggest that biotic activity is playing an important role in SRP uptake from the solution to the particulate matter. Biological uptake from settling and resuspended matter is likely to be the result of bacterial P limitation, in which bacteria tend to uptake P more than release it to the solution during organic matter mineralization in order to satisfy their own metabolic requirements. This pattern has also been described previously ( Finally, we conclude that further research on the specific role of attached living bacteria on the uptake/release of P from the settled and resuspended material at different times is needed.
