We have achieved, for the first time to our knowledge, lasing in a new type of telluride-tungstate glass host doped with neodymium: Nd3+:(0.8)TeO2–(0.2)WO3. Lasing was obtained at 1065nm with two samples containing 0.5mol% and 1.0mol% Nd2O3. During gain-switched operation, slope efficiencies of 12% and 10% were obtained with the 0.5mol% and 1.0mol% doped samples, respectively, at a pulse repetition rate of 1kHz. Judd–Ofelt analysis was further employed to determine the emission cross section σ

Emission spectra were further measured with a ½-m Czerny–Turner-type monochoromator. To determine the fluorescence lifetime of the   The threshold data were used to estimate the emission cross section In the Judd–Ofelt analysis, the absorption characteristics of the samples were first investigated.  We have demonstrated lasing in bulk Nd The authors would like to thank Adnan Kurt for providing valuable technical support for some of the equipment used in the experiments. A.
