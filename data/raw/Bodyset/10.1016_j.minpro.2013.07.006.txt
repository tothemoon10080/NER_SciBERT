Effects of sodium salts on reduction roasting and Fe–P separation of high-phosphorus oolitic hematite ore were studied in the process of coal-based direct reduction followed by wet magnetic separation. Various parameters, including reducing temperature and time, type and dosage of sodium salts, grinding fineness of magnetic separation feed and magnetic field intensity were investigated. The results of reduction and Fe–P magnetic separation are significantly improved by the addition of sodium sulfate and borax, in comparison with those in the absence of additives. A magnetic concentrate with total iron grade of 92.7% and phosphorus content of 0.09% was obtained from an oolitic hematite ore containing 48.96% iron and 1.61% phosphorus when reduced in the presence of 7.5% sodium sulfate and 1.5% borax and wet magnetic separated under the proper conditions. The results of optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of reduced pellet reveal that metallic iron grains exist in sizes of 10–20μm and are associated with gangue minerals closely when reduced in the absence of sodium salts. By contrast, the oolitic structure is destroyed and metallic iron grains grow markedly to the mean size of 50μm when reduced in the presence of sodium sulfate and borax. Sodium salts are capable of destroying the oolitic structure via reacting with gangues, enhancing the reduction of iron oxide and promoting the growth of metallic iron grains during reduction, which is beneficial for Fe–P separation of the oolitic hematite ore.It is of great scientific significance and economic value to efficiently utilize oolitic hematite resources as this type of resources has great reserves and is currently regarded as one of the most refractory iron ore resources in the world. Oolitic hematite ores are mainly distributed in USA, France, Germany, Russia and China ( Oolitic hematite ore is typically characterized by low total iron grade (Fe In recent years, numerous laboratorial researches on exploiting oolitic hematite ore and high-phosphorus iron ores have been carried out. Available methods include: physical separation, froth flotation, chemical leaching, bio-leaching, magnetic roasting–magnetic separation, direct reduction roasting–magnetic separation, as well as the combinations of such processes. Dephosphorization of iron ores by gravity separation (e.g. hydrocyclone, shaking table), magnetic separation and froth flotation were reported ( Alkali-leaching and acid-leaching were also proposed for the dephosphorization of iron ore ( Bio-leaching was applied by Jiang et al. for the dephosphorization of iron ore ( The process of reduction roasting (magnetic roasting and direct reduction roasting) followed by magnetic separation has also been applied to recover iron from oolitic hematite ore ( Generally speaking, most of these methods have not been found to be technically effective and economically feasible, and the reasons are as follows: high phosphorus content in the concentrate, low iron recovery, high practice cost, environmental pollution, etc. Previous studies indicate that reduction of iron oxide is accelerated even by a small quantity of alkali–metal compound, and the growth of metallic iron grains is facilitated during the carbothermic reduction of iron ore ( The oolitic hematite ore sample was taken from Hunan province, China. The chemical composition of the ore sample is presented in Chemical phase analysis (refer to The microstructure of the sample is observed by an optical microscope ( It can be concluded from the above results that, the extremely complex mineralogical relationship among iron-containing, phosphorus-containing minerals and other gangue minerals makes it impracticable to achieve mineral liberation, subsequently, it is difficult to recover iron and remove phosphorus from oolitic hematite ore by physical processing methods. The proximate analysis of reducing coal and chemical composition of its ash are presented in The additives of sodium salts (sodium sulfate and borax) are of analytical reagent (AR) grade. The experimental process includes pelletizing, reduction roasting and wet magnetic separation. The iron ore was crushed and ground to 65 Reduction roasting experiments were performed in a vertical resistance furnace with an inner diameter of 70 The microstructures of the raw ore and reduced pellet were observed by the optical microscope (LEICA, DMI 5000 The chemical phase of iron and phosphorus was analyzed according to the following methods (   A 0.2000  The nonmagnetic portion obtained from (a) was filtrated and washed, then an absorption spectrophotometer was used to assay the Fe  The nonmagnetic portion obtained from (a) was filtrated and washed, then an absorption spectrophotometer was used to assay the Fe  Another 0.1000  Another 0.1000   A 0.1000–0.5000  20 The metallic iron content and total iron grade of reduced pellet, along with the total iron grade and phosphorus content of magnetic material were analyzed. Subsequently, the iron metallization of reduced pellet, the iron recovery of magnetic separation and the dephosphorization of total experimental process can be calculated as follows: Under the conditions that the reducing time was 120 It can be seen in The effect of roasting time on reduction and Fe–P separation is shown in As can be seen in When the oolitic hematite pellet was reduced at 1050 According to the previous studies, two kinds of sodium salts (sodium sulfate and borax) were used to intensify the reduction and Fe–P magnetic separation of oolitic hematite pellet. According to the foregoing results, the reducing conditions were 1050 It can be seen in The effect of sodium sulfate dosage on reduction and Fe–P separation is shown in It can be seen in The effect of borax dosage on reduction and Fe–P separation is shown in The results in Under the conditions that the sodium sulfate and borax dosage were 7.5% and 1.5% respectively, the reducing temperature was 1050 As seen in The effect of magnetic field intensity on Fe–P separation is shown in It can be seen in Based on the above results, a satisfactory product was obtained under the conditions that the sodium sulfate dosage was 7.5% and the borax dosage was 1.5%, the reducing temperature was 1050 Sodium salts can improve the reduction and Fe–P separation of the high-phosphorus oolitic hematite ore greatly. To find out the function of sodium salts on phase transformation during reduction, XRD analysis was carried out to reveal the difference between pellet reduced in the absence or presence of sodium salts, as well as the magnetic material and nonmagnetic material. The results are shown in It can be seen from The main reactions during the reduction roasting in the absence of sodium salts can be described as follows: Regarding reduction roasting in the presence of sodium salts,  The microstructures of the reduced pellet were studied by using an optical microscope in order to characterize the growing character of metallic iron grains during reduction roasting. The results are shown in    Hematite grains in the oolitic hematite ore are finely disseminated and associated with chamosite, collophanite, quartz and other gangue minerals, forming the unique concentric and layered texture. Fe–P magnetic separation results are imperfect when oolitic hematite pellet is reduced at 1050 Optical microscopy analysis of reduced pellet shows that metallic iron grains exist in sizes of 10–20 The authors wish to express their thanks to the
