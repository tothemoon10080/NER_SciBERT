The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate mineral content of root canal dentin after treatment with several endodontic irrigation solutions. Sixty mandibular anterior teeth extracted for periodontal reasons used. The crowns of the teeth were removed at the cemento-enamel junction. Pulp tissues were removed and the teeth were randomly divided into six groups including 10 teeth each. Root canals were enlarged with gates-glidden burs (# 1, 2, and 3). The groups were treated as follows: group 1, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate for 15 min; group 2, 3% H2O2 for 15 min; group 3, 17% EDTA for 15 min; group 4, 5.25% NaOCl for 15 min; group 5, 2.5% NaOCl for 15 min; and group 6, distilled water (control). Dentin chips were obtained using gates-glidden burs (# 4, 5, and 6). The levels of five elements calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and sulfur in each specimens were analyzed using ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry) technique. Changes in the levels of the chemical elements were recorded. The results were then statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. There was a significant decrease in the calcium and phosphorus levels after treatment with all irrigation solutions except for 5.25% NaOCl when compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The K, Mg, and S level changes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). It has been concluded that endodontic irrigation solutions have an effect on mineral contents of root dentin.
