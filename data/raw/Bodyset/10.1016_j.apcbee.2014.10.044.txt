The experiment was carried out to study the dissolved air flotation (DAF) process in a tank involving mainly velocity distribution and turbidity removal. Chitosan and Bentonite were known as coagulant agents thus were used in the study. Measurements were carried out on four cases with different inlet velocities of 0.3m/s, 0.6m/s, 0.9m/s and 1.2m/s. Laboratory tests were conducted to test the water quality based on turbidity values and basic drinking water parameters. From the test results, it was found that the inlet velocity gave impacts on the distribution of flow in the tank and thus affected the efficiency of the flotation process. Chitosan and Bentonite can be applied to the flotation tank resulting in an average of 97% turbidity removal. This study successfully proved the effectiveness of the combination of Chitosan and Bentonite as a coagulating agent in the DAF tank for raw water treatment process.
