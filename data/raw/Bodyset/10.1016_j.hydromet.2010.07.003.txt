A comparative study on extraction of Fe(III) from the HCl leach liquor of low grade iron ore tailings has been carried out using Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP), Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 in distilled kerosene. The percentage extraction of iron increased with increasing HCl and extractant concentrations. The extracted species in each case was found to be HFeCl4·S. The extraction isotherms for the above extractants indicated quantitative extraction of Fe(III) in 3-stages at O:A ratio of 3:2 with TBP, and in 2-stages at O:A ratio of 1:1 with Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923. The stripping studies of the loaded organic phases were carried out with 0.4M HCl. The stripping isotherms indicated 2-stages at O:A ratio of 5:2 for TBP, and 3-stages at O:A ratio of 2:3 for Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923. From the extraction studies, the extraction efficiency of the extractants for Fe(III) was in the order TBP<Cyanex 921<Cyanex 923. Although Cyanex 923 was found to be the best extractant, the percentage stripping of Fe from the loaded Cyanex 923 was the least. The stripping of Cyanex 923 was 94.9%, but with TBP and Cyanex 921, it was 99.8% and >99.9%, respectively.Due to the gradual depletion of high grade iron ore reserves in India, attempts are being made to use the vast resource of low grade iron ore (52% Fe) after beneficiation to 58% Fe. Currently, it is being considered to beneficiate iron ores as low as 45% also for future use. The tailings obtained after beneficiation of low grade iron ore is a waste material which can also be utilized to recover pure Fe from the hydrochloric acid leach liquor after solvent extraction using suitable extractants. The extraction of iron from different leach liquors, spent acids and metallurgical wastes has been carried out with different extractants such as D2EHPA, LIX 860, TBP, MIBK, Cyanex 923, etc., as reported in the literature. Iron and copper were recovered from the HCl leach liquor of dirty car radiators ( Extraction of Fe(III) from a solution bearing 56.4 The effect of different parameters such as equilibration time, temperature, pH of aqueous phase, metal ion concentration, and LIX 860 concentration on extraction of Fe(III) with LIX 860 ( In this study, the tailings obtained after processing of the low grade iron ore of Minerals Matrics Limited, India was leached with HCl and solvent extraction studies were carried out to recover iron values from the leach liquor. The tailings contained 13.38% Fe and the leach liquor contained 18.49 The commercial extractants Cyanex 921 (Tri-octyl phosphine oxide), Cyanex 923 (a mixture of tertiary octyl and hexyl phosphine oxides) and Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) were used in the study as received without any purification. Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 were supplied by Cytec Industries (USA) but TBP was supplied by Sisco Research Laboratories (India). Distilled kerosene (b.p. 160–240 The low grade iron ore tailings from the low grade iron ore of Minerals Matrics Limited, India prepared at the Mineral Processing Department of IMMT, Bhubaneswar contained 13.38% Fe. These tailings were leached with HCl to produce a leach liquor containing 18.49 Initial experiments on the effect of equilibration time on distribution of metal ions in two phases showed that 5 In one set of experiment, to study the effect of HCl concentration on extraction of iron, the concentration of HCl in the feed solution was varied in the range 0.78 to 9.29 In another set of experiment, the effect of H To study the effect of [Cl The plots of log D vs. log [Cl To study the effect of extractant concentration on extraction of iron from the leach liquor bearing 18.49 The experimental data showed an increase in extraction from 38.7 to 99.9% with Cyanex 923, 34.2 to 99.8% with Cyanex 921 and 36.5 to 99.9% with TBP with increase in extractant concentration ( The plot of log D vs. log [Extractant] for TBP, Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 was straight lines with slope values of 0.92, 1.19 and 1.18 ( The extraction of iron from HCl medium using TBP, Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 can be expressed as follows: Where, ‘a’ — the number of H ‘y’ — the number of solvent molecules, and ‘S’ is the solvent molecule (TBP, Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923). The equilibrium constant K Taking logarithm of Eq. From the slope analysis data ( So the extraction mechanism of iron with the extractants can be written as: To extract iron values from the leach liquor with three extractants, it was required to determine the number of stages and the O:A ratio, for which the McCabe–Thiele plots were constructed with 0.94 To confirm the above predictions, a 3-stage counter-current simulation study (CCS study) at O:A ratio of 3:2 was carried out with TBP, and 2-stage CCS study at O:A ratio of 1:1 was carried out with Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923. The analysis of raffinates showed 5.5 (9.85 The TBP loaded organic contained 24.01 The FTIR absorption spectra of pure and metal loaded extractants were studied to know the interaction between the extractant and the metal ion. The spectra of extractants and their complexes with iron are shown in The –C–H symmetric and asymmetric deformation vibrations and stretching vibrations for pure and Fe-bonded TBP, Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 as shown in the The FTIR spectra of Cyanex 921 show the characteristic peak at 1160.9 In case of TBP, the P being bonded to three oxygen atoms of the three alkoxy (C Extraction of Fe from the HCl leach liquor of the low grade iron ore tailings was carried out with TBP, Cyanex 921 and Cyanex 923 in kerosene. It was observed that extraction of iron increased from 49.8 to 99.8% with Cyanex 921, 54.1 to 99.9% with Cyanex 923 and 13.6 to 99.7% with TBP with increasing [HCl] from 0.78 to 9.29 The authors are thankful to Prof. B.K.
