Clavicle fractures are common and potentially devastating injuries in athletes that may result in complete loss of the competitive season. Approximately 20% to 45% of all clavicle fractures are attributed to sport-related activity with cycling and contact sports being the most common. A systematic approach is required when examining injured athletes. Isolated clavicle injuries can be diagnosed with standard radiographic views of the clavicle. Treatment recommendations rely heavily on patient-specific factors, including athlete age, type of sport, position, competitive level, future aspirations, and perceptions of surgical fixation. Nonoperative management is generally advocated for non- or minimally displaced fractures and most fractures in adolescent athletes. Excellent functional outcomes with early return to sport and minimal complications have been demonstrated with modern fixation techniques in displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.
