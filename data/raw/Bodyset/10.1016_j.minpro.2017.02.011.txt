The authors regret to inform that the unit of froth depth ( Revised text: Based on the result of optimization it was found that the desired ultimate combustible recovery with an appropriate flotation time was obtained from the flotation process with a given range of experimental variables ( The variables considered in the study are: the feed pulp concentration Moreover, the levels of frother dosage and froth depth were constant with 220 The adjusted determination coefficient (Adj. R2) of the predicted model was 0.9971 with feed pulp concentration of 85 The unit of froth depth ( Author would like to apologize for the inconvenience caused.
