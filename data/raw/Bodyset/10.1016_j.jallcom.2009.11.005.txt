By adding small amount of V (1–3at.%) into the Ti70.5Fe29.5 binary eutectic alloy, both the strength and the plasticity of the alloys are spontaneously improved up to 2000–2200MPa and ∼3.5%, respectively. However, large amount of V (5–7at.%) leading to the high volume fraction of the ω-phase results in degradation in both strength and plasticity. These results suggest that the mechanical properties of the Ti–Fe–V ultrafine eutectic alloys are strongly governed by volume fraction of the eutectic matrix and ω-phases.Ultrafine grained materials or bulk metallic glasses have been highlighted due to an extraordinary high strength compared to conventional coarse grained materials Recently, there is an interesting finding that Ti- and Fe-based ultrafine eutectic alloys consisting of fully eutectic structure without micron-scale primary phase possess considerable plastic strain of 7–12% combined with high strength of 2.2–3 In the present study, we report on influence of addition of V contents (1–7 A series of (Ti  SEM secondary electron micrographs obtained from as-cast (Ti  The ultimate strength and the engineering strain of the (Ti The binary Ti This work was supported by the
