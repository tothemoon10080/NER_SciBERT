Separation of water-soluble minerals by flotation is the most important present-day method of potash ore processing. It has currently come into use in the production of carnallite, that is, the raw material for the production of metallic magnesium and various fertilizers. The paper describes studies on the influence of both hydration of surfaces of alkaline halogenide crystals and that of changes in morphology of sylvite surface in saline solutions having different compositions on cationic collector sorption at saline minerals. The paper also considers the effect of cationic collector composition on the efficiency of clay-carbonate slimes protection by reagents-depressors and on floatability of sylvite and halite at different temperatures and compositions of electrolyte solutions. As a result of work, it has been suggested the optimal compositions of reagents-collectors for the separation of water-soluble minerals by flotation.
