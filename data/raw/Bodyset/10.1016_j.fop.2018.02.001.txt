Past venues for the TiO  The first speaker in the afternoon session on the first day of the TiO Dr Prochazka pointed out that first-generation anti-dirt coatings were usually simply hydrophobic coatings that merely slowed down the rate of dirt pick-up and microbial attack. By contrast, nano-TiO Dr Jirko Bezdicek (of Levenger, headquartered in Lekunberri, Navarra, Spain) presented a paper on the use of  Dr Wu Zhonghui (of KComber/CCM) described and demonstrated his company's application of “big data” technology, analysing imports, exports and reported prices, as well as E-commerce transactions. Using E-commerce platforms for buying and selling industrial products of all kinds has become a very important feature of Chinese business. The <1688.com> platform of the Alibaba group, founded by Mr Jack Ma in April 1999, is probably the world's largest and best-known trading platform. In 2017, total domestic (intra-China) transaction revenues on this platform will exceed Rmb 120 bn (approaching $20 bn), which will be more than 30 times the 2020 figure. Another widely used platform in China is based on the <HC360.com> website and this is said to be China's leading business-to-business E-commerce platform. Substantial volumes of TiO Ms Alison Saxby (of Roskill) presented an excellent overview of the titanium metal industry, drawing on some of the data presented in Roskill's recent multi-client reports (Ref 3). The industry value-chain is quite complex: feedstock is chlorinated to produce TiCl The direct consumers of TiO  There were two papers on the mineral sands sector – one from Iluka, which has been one of the world's leading suppliers since its creation in December 1998 and one from BlueJay Mining (formerly FinnAust), which plans to begin supplying ilmenite from northwestern Greenland by mid-2019. In his presentation, Mr Robert Gibney (of Iluka) emphasised the point that Iluka is committed to maximising earnings for its shareholders over the full business cycle. Over the past five years, it has achieved an average operating profit margin of around 35%, thanks to constantly flexing its operating settings in line with market conditions. The key objectives are to avoid building up excessive inventories and maintaining a sufficient margin of capacity so as to be able to respond quickly to sudden upsurges in demand. Capital investment plans have been closely scrutinised following the appointment of Mr Tom O’Leary as CEO in September 2016, resulting in abandoning the Brazilian anatase extraction venture and taking an impairment charge on Iluka's investment in Metalysis. The $287 Rutile prices had been hovering within the $500–530 per tonne range for some time prior to December 2010. They more than doubled in 2011 and then doubled again in 2012, reaching a peak of nearly $2500 per tonne. After that spike, there was a sharp downturn, with the average realised rutile price dropping below $700 per tonne in 2015. Since then, there has been a modest recovery to $765 per tonne in June 2017, with the expectation of a continued rising trend through into 2018, reflecting strong demand from the global pigment industry. Back in 2010, world production of high-grade chlorinatable feedstock more or less equalled consumption at 2.89 Iluka's average realised price for zircon (premium and standard grades) had been $2080 per tonne at the peak in 2012, but it dropped to $810 per tonne in 2016. For the first half of 2017, Iluka's average realised price for zircon increased by 7% and it was expected to pass the $1100 per tonne mark in the final quarter of the year. In order to curtail its zircon output so as to draw-down inventories, Iluka idled its zircon-rich Jacinth-Ambrosia mine (South Australia) in April 2016. Global zircon demand has been booming during 2017, as reflected in the upsurge in prices. Moderate demand growth is anticipated in 2018, prompting Iluka to reopen the South Australian mine. Mr Rod McIllree (of BlueJay Mining) outlined his company's plans to become a major supplier of ilmenite, thanks to the planned development of five placer deposits in the Pituffik area of northwestern Greenland. BlueJay's exploration leases are believed to contain up to 700 Zircon is an important co-product for a number of companies producing TiO  Reducing the carbon footprint – the total amount of “greenhouse gas” emissions attributable to a particular activity, company or factory, expressed in terms of CO Mr Philippe Guillemaille (of TNG Ltd, Australia) described his company's project to employ its patented TNG will be fully vertically integrated, mining the deposit and producing TiO Mr Mazen Alnaimi (of Argex, Canada) described his company's project to employ its patented The third paper on novel technologies for TiO  The final day of the Alicante conference was bookended by two papers on proposed EU legislation associated with possible health risks of using pigments. Prof Damjana Drobne (of Ljubljana University, Slovenia) focussed on the EU's By contrast with TiO Dr Fois noted that organic pigments are usually extremely insoluble in all common solvents. Therefore, they will not migrate from the final consumer product even following prolonged contact with water, oil, sweat, saliva, etc. If organic pigments enter the human body by ingestion or inhalation, they are not sufficiently reactive in biological systems to go through any dangerous metabolic pathways. The EU has specific legislation on the safety of organic pigments in toys (the Thus ended another illuminating TiO  1) For those who were unable to attend the event, the full set of published papers from the Alicante Pigment & Colour Science Forum & TiO Ms Sharon Garrington, SmithersRapra, Shawbury, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, SY4 4NR, England.
