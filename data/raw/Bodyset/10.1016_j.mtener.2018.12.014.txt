Zinc Antimonide (ZnSb) is a promising p-type thermoelectric (TE) material for mid-temperature (room temperature to 673 K) power generation application due to its high TE conversion efficiency and low cost. Here we show that further improvements of the TE efficiency of ZnSb is possible by reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity

                     . This is achieved by forming a solid solution between ZnSb and CdSb which enhance the phonon scattering due to the mass disorder/strain effect. Compositions of Zn1-xCdxSb (x = 0, 0.25, 0.375 and 0.5) have been synthesized by melting, rapid compaction followed by annealing. The formation of the solid solution is confirmed from X-ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements and the calculated lattice parameters indicate an expected increase with Cd content. Thermoelectric properties have been measured between room temperature and 673 K. It is observed that the lattice thermal conductivity

                      in the solid solutions is found to be due to the anharmonic nature of the bonding. The effect of alloying on the electrical properties have been further investigated and results indicate low alloy scattering (U) potential ∼0.3 eV in the solid solutions. The possible origin of such low U values is further an indicator of the muti-center, anharmonic nature of bonding in this system. Thus, the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity coupled with low alloy scattering potential make Zn1-xCdxSb ideal candidates for further enhancement in thermoelectric efficiency.Thermoelectric (TE) materials are capable of directly converting temperature difference to electrical potential and vice versa, which makes them prospective candidates as alternative green energy source for harvesting waste heat The Zn Some recent reports show that acceptor impurities from group I (Ag, Cu) and group IV (Pb, Sn, Ge) can be used to attain optimal doping concentrations ( The objective of this work is to study the effect of Cadmium substitution in ZnSb on the lattice thermal conductivity and charge carrier scattering.
