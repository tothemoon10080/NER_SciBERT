In this work, the co-doping in both the anion and cation sites of SnTe has been implemented by addition of BiCl3 and the effect of co-doping on thermoelectric performance of SnTe-based materials has been studied detailedly. Benefitting from the sharp reduction of carrier concentration and the increase of density of states due to the electron donor contribution of Bi and Cl, the electrical transport properties have been improved greatly; moreover, the hierarchical architectures such as the point defects, dislocations, nano-particles and phase/grain boundaries act as multiscale phonon scattering centers and effectively suppress the transport of phonons in wide frequency range, thus reduced the thermal conductivity dramatically. Due to the synergistic regulation of cation-anion co-doping, a maximum ZT of ~1.27 at 873 K has been obtained in the sample of SnTe doping with 4% BiCl3, which enhances by 182% in comparison with the pristine sample.Thermoelectric (TE) materials, which can directly convert the waste heat into electricity, have been considered as a promising sustainable energy solution As a promising mid-temperature TE material, SnTe draws a great attention recently due to its low environmental load and suitable band structure Driven by this motivation and based on the previous work, BiCl A series of Sn The powder diffraction patterns were recorded with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation in a PANalytical X′pert PRO diffractometer, and the measure results of samples were analyzed with the JADE 6.0 software; moreover, the Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns were carried out by the GASA software. The morphology, microstructure and chemical composition of the samples were investigated by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (NanoSEM 450), and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). A home-made Namicro-Ⅳ thermoelectric measurement system were employed to investigate the electrical properties of samples including the Seebeck coefficients ( Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the pristine, stoichiometric SnTe and BiCl As demonstrated in  Although the Bi precipitates can not be resolved by SEM in a low magnification mode, they can be well distinguished by TEM observation. As shown in The electrical resistivity ( On the other hand, when the chlorine atoms dissolved into the SnTe, the larger electronegativity of Cl can reduce Sn vacancy concentration and further depress the hole concentration, which is similar with the Se-doped SnTe, as reported by Tan  Benefiting from the improved electrical transport properties and reduced In summary, the co-doping in both the anion and cation sites of SnTe has been implemented by addition of BiCl This work is co-financed by Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
