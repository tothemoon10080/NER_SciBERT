Titanium dioxide with a particle size of approximately 0.3μm is widely used as a pigment because of its notably high refractive index and significant scattering properties. To achieve optimum scattering in the visible range (400–700nm), it is important to obtain a narrow particle size distribution, between 0.2μm and 0.4μm. TiO2 particles are usually finely ground to the desired particle size range using a wet-stirred media mill. In the present case this fine grinding was performed in the multiple passage mode using a laboratory-scale stirred media mill. Optimum values for the operational parameters were determined, and the stress energies were varied to obtain different stress mechanisms, and thus different particle size distributions. The narrowest particle size distribution around the target of 0.3μm was achieved with operational parameters resulting in the lowest stress energy and the lowest specific energy consumption. The operational parameters at this point included a 255μm Zirconium oxide grinding media, a stirrer tip speed of 9.2m/s, and a solid concentration of 52wt.% and a filling ratio of 70vol.%. Comminution was expected to largely follow a compressive stress mechanism when this optimal combination was employed.Titanium dioxide pigment particles approximately 0.2 Titanium dioxide pigment particles are produced in a sulphate process in which gel-like meta-titanic acid, H The effect of the operational parameters of a stirred media mill on the particle size of pigment TiO The experimental material used was surface-unmodified rutile titanium dioxide (“calciner discharge”), which had been pre-ground in a hammer mill. A typical amount of a commercially available wetting agent was used as a grinding aid.

As seen in The effects of different grinding media densities on the widths of the PSDs are presented as a function of cumulative SEC in The stress energy of grinding media describes the maximum kinetic energy of two colliding grinding beads. The stress energy is optimum and energy utilization at a maximum when the stress energy is just sufficient to break the particle. The optimal value for stress energy can be found by illustrating some property of the product Similar trends can be seen in The width of the particle size distribution is related to comminution mechanisms In the present experiments the stress energy was also changed merely by adjusting the density of the grinding media, so that the number of stress events remained approximately the same. A smaller particle size and narrower PSD was obtained at a lower SEC using the lower-density grinding media (as seen in The narrowest particle size distribution at the target median particle size for pigment TiO  Solid concentration by weight [wt.%] Diameter of grinding media [μm] Density of grinding media [kg/m Filling ratio of grinding media [vol.%] Stirrer tip speed [m/s] Mass flow rate [kg/s] Specific energy consumption [kWh/t] Stress energy of grinding media [Nm] Particle size for 10% finer [μm] Median particle size [μm] Particle size for 90% finer [μm] Mean active power [kW] No-load power [kW] Particle size distribution Theoretical residence time [s] Zirconium oxide Yttria (Y Width of the particle size distribution [μm] The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by
