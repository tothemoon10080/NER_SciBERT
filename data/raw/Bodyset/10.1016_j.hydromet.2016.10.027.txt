Multi-stage bioprocess treatments (designated MBT) by employing a mixotrophic bacterium Pseudoclavibacter sp. strain SKC/XLW-1 capable of producing biosurfactants and oxidizing iron and sulfur were carried out to investigate the biodesulfurization of organic sulfur in Tondongkura coal from Indonesia. MBT consisted of biooxidation, followed by biomodification and ended with column flotation (called bioflotation). The bacterial strain was successfully employed to remove organic sulfur and other sulfur forms (i.e., pyritic sulfur, sulfate and total sulfur) from Tondongkura coal by MBT. This observation was also supported by FTIR analyses, which detected the existence of CS bond and SH bond (attributed to aliphatic thiols). In addition, transmission and scanning electron microscopic observations showed that over the course of the experiment the bacterial cells produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which interact with coal particles. These results indicate that the bacterium Pseudoclavibacter sp. strain SKC/XLW-1 and its metabolic products such as EPS are suggested to play a strategic role in removing sulfur contents from Tondongkura coals by MBT; the ability to oxidize sulfur and a continuous supply of EPS (for environmentally friendly flotation bioreagents). These results also reveal that the utilization of the bacterium Pseudoclavibacter sp. strain SKC/XLW-1 and its metabolic products is highly potential to be a more eco-friendly alternative flotation reagent in biodesulfurization processes of coals. Thereby, the findings of this study may provide an encouraging insight into the improvement of biodesulfurization processes in recalcitrant organic sulfur-containing coals by employing bacteria and their metabolites using multi-stage bioprocess treatments in order to create an economical and more eco-friendly desulfurization process.Biodesulfurization of coal, in particular organic sulfur, has received a great deal of attention in recent years, since the combustion of coal containing high sulfur causes severe environmental pollution such as acid rain because of sulfur dioxide emission. Sulfur is present in coal mainly in three forms—pyritic, organic and sulfate sulfur, and organic sulfur is the most recalcitrant form of sulfur due to its nature finely dispersed in coal matrix, which is thus more resistant to conventional chemical desulfurization and high investment and operation costs are imposed to desulfurize the most recalcitrant molecules ( Several studies have been conducted to remove sulfur from coals ( Therefore, the current work addressed the biodesulfurization of organic sulfur in Tondongkura from Indonesia using a mixotrophic bacterium The bacterial strain used in this study was a mixotrophic bacterium The lignite coal used in this study was obtained from Tondongkura, Pangkep Regency, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Sieve analysis of the sample showed grain size distribution of the coal of − Treatments studied were two main treatments (the so-called multi-stage bioprocess treatments which were designated MBT) and two control treatments (i.e., a combination of biomodification for 30 Biooxidation experiments were conducted in duplicate in a Biomodification experiment was carried out in duplicate in a To investigate chemical bondings in coals before and after treatments, 1 The pH of the solutions was monitored with pH meter (Horiba) at set time intervals. To determine the removal of sulfur, the sulfur contents (organic sulfur, pyritic sulfur, sulfate, and total sulfur) in coals before and after treatment were measured by following standard methods ( For bacterial TEM observation, samples were fixed with 2.5% The bacterium  Furthermore, FTIR analysis of coals in all treatments also identified the functional groups contained in coals, including alkyl group-general; alkyl group-hydroxy or possibly amino substituent; alkyl group carbonyl with nitrile type substituent; hydroxy compound-non bonded hydroxyl groups; hydrogen bonded compound; hydrogen bonded compound-possibly acid or amine salt; carbonyl compound; carbonyl compound-possibly ester or ketone; carbonyl compound possibly ketone, amide or aromatic aldehyde; aromatic compound possibly 1,4 substituted; aromatic amine aryl substituted guanidine or hydrozine; aromatic compound-possibly or amino substituted; aromatic compound-possibly 1,3-substituted; nitrile type substituent; para aryl aryloxy or aryl amine compound ( Transmission electron microscopic observations revealed the bacterial cells and coal particles over the course of the experiment ( Based on the TEM observations, it is presumably suggested that the EPS generated by bacteria may enhance contact between bacteria and water-insoluble compounds such as coals and increase the surface area of hydrophobic water-insoluble coals and their bioavailability, thereby improving uptake of organic sulfur by bacteria and thus enhancing the biodesulfurization of coals in this study. This interpretation is also supported by SEM images of coal particle surfaces ( The present study has shown that multi-stage bioprocess treatments (MBT) could be applied to biodesulfurize organic sulfur and other sulfur forms such as pyritic sulfur, sulfate and total sulfur from Tondongkura coals by employing the bacterium We thank the technicians of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering, Faculty of Mining and Petroleum Engineering, Institut Teknologi Bandung and all the students of the Geomicrobiology-Biomining & Biocorrosion Laboratory and Microbial Culture Collection Laboratory, Biosciences and Biotechnology Research Center, Institut Teknologi Bandung for their cooperation and assistance.
