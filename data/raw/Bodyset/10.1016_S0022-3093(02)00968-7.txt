Amorphous Al2O3 films were deposited on p-Si by rf magnetron sputtering to investigate their potential as a gate dielectric in organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). The deposition was performed at room temperature, 200 and 300 °C using Al2O3 and Al targets. Achieved Al2O3 films have higher capacitance values than thermally grown SiO2 as characterized by capacitance–voltage measurements. It is also found from current–voltage and roughness measurements that the leakage current and the surface roughness can be least when the films are deposited at room temperature. The capacitance of the film obtained from the Al2O3 target appears higher than that of the Al2O3 film from the Al target while the results of electrical breakdown are opposite. These room temperature processes are promising for applications to the gate dielectrics of organic TFTs.Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) have made impressive progress over the past decades, and it is now likely that OTFTs will find their applications in a number of ways. OTFTs basically provide two principal advantages over Si-based TFTs in processes and application: low thermal budget and low cost A chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 3×10 A typical RBS spectrum of an Al In the same manner, stoichiometry and thickness of all the samples are analyzed and listed in  Since the possibility of RT process has been observed above in the   Amorphous Al This work has been supported by Brain Korea 21 project and also by Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Planning.
