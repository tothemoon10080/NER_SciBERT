We evaluated eight biorefinery processes targeting the extraction of ulvan from Ulva ohnoi. Using a factorial design the effect of three sequential treatments (aqueous extraction of salt; ethanol extraction of pigments; and Na2C2O4 or HCl (0.05M) extraction of ulvan) were evaluated based on the yield (% dry weight of biomass) and quality (uronic acid, sulfate, protein and ash content, constituent sugar and molecular weight analysis) of ulvan extracted. The aqueous extraction of salt followed by HCl extraction of ulvan gave higher yields (8.2±1.1% w/w) and purity of ulvan than equivalent Na2C2O4 extracts (4.0±1.0% w/w). The total sugar content of HCl extracts (624–670μg/mg) was higher than Na2C2O4 extracts (365–426μg/mg) as determined by constituent sugar with ulvan specific monosaccharides contributing 94.7–96.2% and 70.1–84.0%, respectively. Ulvan extracted from U. ohnoi was 53.1mol% rhamnose, 27.8mol% glucuronic acid, 10.1mol% iduronic acid, and 5.3mol% xylose with molecular weights ranging from 10.5–312kDa depending on the biorefinery process employed. Therefore, the extraction of high quality ulvan from U. ohnoi is facilitated by an aqueous pre-treatment and subsequent HCl-extraction of ulvan as part of a cascading biorefinery model delivering salt, ulvan, and a protein enriched residual biomass.The intensive and targeted cultivation of macroalgae, both marine and freshwater, has been implemented as a mechanism to mitigate impacts from anthropogenic wastewaters. This process has the benefit of remediating contaminants from wastewaters, in particular nitrogen and phosphorous, through incorporation within the macroalgal biomass, which is then harvested and can be used as a bio-resource. Marine macroalgae have been the focus of this process because of their robustness, high productivities, novel biochemical profiles and metabolites, and ability to be cultivated at scale One product of specific interest in Notably, the fractionation of ulvans from other cell wall components, for example glucuronans, xyloglucans, cellulose and proteins, represents a significant challenge. Conventionally ulvans are extracted at 80–90 Our objective is to develop and assess a cascading biorefinery process for the species  This study tests the assumption that the sequential removal of salts and pigments in a cascading biorefinery process will improve the yield and quality of ulvan extracted in a subsequent step. We use a factorial experimental design to quantify the effect of three extraction treatments; treatment 1 targets the extraction of salts; treatment 2 targets the extraction of pigments; and treatment 3 targets the extraction of ulvan (     Chemical compositions of the untreated biomass ( The constituent sugar composition, molecular weight and structure of the ulvan were determined after further purification to remove salts and low molecular weight components. Samples of the freeze-dried extracts (150–180 Constituent sugar composition was determined by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) after hydrolysis of the polysaccharides present to their component monosaccharides Molecular weight profiles were determined using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS). Samples (5 Ulvan was exchanged with deuterium by freeze-drying with D The effect of extraction treatment on the yield (% of dw biomass extracted) and overall quality of the extracts (as % of uronic acid and sulfate, sulfate: uronic acid ratio, and % of protein (Bradford assay) and ash in the extract) was analysed using four-factor permutational analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) The untreated biomass contained protein (18.5 Yields (% dw biomass) of crude ulvan extracts ranged between 3.7 The content of uronic acid and sulfate, the ratio of sulfate: uronic acid, the content of protein and ash, all parameters in combination (overall quality) and individually, and the elemental composition (CHNS) of the crude extracts were used to determine quality. Extraction process had a significant effect on the overall quality of the extracts ( The effect of extraction process differed between the individual parameters investigated. Specifically, the uronic acid content was significantly affected by treatment 3 (pseudo-F The content of protein in ulvan extracts was significantly affected by treatment 3 (pseudo-F The yields of freeze-dried material following dialysis of the extracts were 52–65% for the Na The process used to extract ulvan from Extracts from all the processes were composed predominantly of rhamnose, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid and xylose, sugars that are typical constituents of ulvans. Smaller amounts of other sugars including galactose, glucose, mannose, fucose, arabinose and ribose were also present, though in larger amounts in the Na The molecular weight profiles for HCl extracts were distinct from those for Na The NMR spectra for extracts from all of the processes were consistent with published spectra for ulvans The carbon ( The yield and quality of ulvan extracted from cultivated The total fibre content of the untreated Yields of crude ulvan extracts from Aqueous extraction of salts (treatment 1) prior to ulvan extraction with HCl resulted in moderate (15–20%) increases in yields. It is proposed that the aqueous extraction increases ulvan yields in two ways, related to their interactions and distribution within the cell wall The quality of extracted ulvan is critical in terms of its application and any further processing requirements. For applications requiring high purity ulvans, further processing to remove contaminants, such as other carbohydrates, proteins and small molecules, can be significant. In this regard, extraction of ulvan with HCl yielded the highest purity extracts containing less protein, ash and contaminating carbohydrates (see The use of colorimetric uronic acid assay data was an effective proxy for ulvan content in extracts, with ulvan extracts from HCl extractions having higher UA contents relative to Na Rhamnose, xylose, glucuronic acid and iduronic acid are the major constituent sugars present in ulvans, with variation in their relative abundance determined on the basis of taxonomic, ecophysiological and methodological differences For the development of a biorefinery process targeting the extraction of ulvan from In terms of product applications, constituent sugar compositions are linked to both physicochemical properties and biological activities of polysaccharides SEC-MALLS revealed considerable differences in the molecular weights of HCl- and Na The depolymerisation of ulvan is an important consideration as molecular weight is correlated with rheological properties The acidic extraction of ulvan, following an initial aqueous treatment to remove salts (EP6), provided the highest yield of product having the best quality profiles in terms of monosaccharide composition and carbohydrate, protein, sulfate, and ash content. Although extraction of ulvan with sodium oxalate afforded significantly lower yield and quality profiles, the higher molecular weights obtained may be targeted for specific applications.
