The objective of this study is to make a comparison among different methods used for evaluation of steady state groundwater inflow to a shallow circular cross section tunnel. These methods include: analytical solutions, empirical methods and numerical modelling. Analytical formulas provide an estimation of inflow rate based on some simplifying assumptions which are somehow unrealistic. Therefore, their results are over/underestimated. Empirical methods are presented based on the experiences of different tunnel projects and they mostly provide an appropriate qualitative estimation; while, their quantitative predictions are not desirable. Despite analytical and empirical approaches, numerical modelling is a suitable tool for solving complex geomechanical and hydrogeological conditions. Hence, their results are more reliable and precise for designation of efficient drainage systems. In this study, groundwater inflow into Tabriz Metro-Line 2 (TML2) is evaluated by means of these methods and their results were compared. The results indicated that all of the methods provide consistent results, however, it is inferred that in the absence of sufficient data, Raymer equation can provide more reliable estimation of inflow rate for shallow tunnels in comparison to other analytical and empirical solutions due to its higher correlation with numerical results.One of the most challenging issues in underground operations like tunneling is groundwater inflow which has severe consequences such as instabilities, life loss of workers, ground settlements and environmental disasters ( Various methods have been developed in the last decades for investigation of groundwater inflow to the tunnels like analytical, empirical and numerical methods. Analytical solutions are based on Darcy’s law and conservation of mass. These methods were presented based on some simplifying assumptions like homogeneous and isotropic rock mass permeability, steady state flow, circular tunnel cross section held at a constant hydraulic potential. Empirical methods like IMS, SGR (Site Groundwater Rating) and TIC (Tunnel Inflow Classification) are also presented to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate groundwater inflow to the tunnel. These methods using geological and geomechanical parameters provide qualitative and quantitative estimation of groundwater inflow to the tunnel. Moreover, numerical methods like finite element method and discrete element method have been widely used by the advancing of faster computers. The aim of this study is to compare different methods used for estimation of steady-state groundwater inflow to a circular tunnel. To this end, a review of the methods are provided in each section and then steady-state groundwater inflow into Tabriz metro-line2 ( The approximately 22 km long Tabriz metro-line 2 tunnel (  Zone 1, in west of the city from Sanat square in Gharamalek to Jahad square up to the studied depth (almost 30 m), is comprised of alluvial deposit consist of fine grain and sand alternation. Also, variation of groundwater table is between 5 and 18 m. Zone 2 is from Jahad square to Selab-Aghzi in Abbasi Street. Coarse grain alluvial sediments (gravel and sand) with rock fragments (boulder and cobble) floated in them are constituted the surface layers of this zone. In addition, among coarse grain sediments interlayer fine grain alluvial exist, however, Zone 3 is from Selab-Aghzi to Shahid Fahmideh square in where week rock layers of claystone, mudstone, sandstone and marlstone underlain with surface alluvial sediments of 5–15 m thickness. Also, fine and coarse grain alluvial deposits form the surface alluvial sediments. Zone 4, distance between Shahid Fahmideh square and east of Baghmisheh, is mainly formed of coarse grain (sand-gravel) and fine grain (clay-silt) alluvial. Zone 5 is from Baghmisheh to Tabriz International Exhibition center in where the main lithology is weak rock layers of marl, claystone, mudstone and sandstone ( For identification of subsurface layers’ properties more than 100 boreholes have been drilled. Various mechanical and hydrogeological tests were conducted to obtain geomechanical properties of the Since 1962, scientists have tried to develop sophisticated analytical solutions for prediction of groundwater inflow to tunnel for different steady-state and transient regimes (see, for example: Considering a tunnel in a semi-infinite rock mass (homogenous and isotropic condition) with a horizontal water table (     Similar to Goodman method, this equation is limited to estimate steady state inflow as well as taking no account of local variations in the geological conditions, and is, therefore, unable to predict the water table draw-down.  The tunnel lies in a homogenous media with constant permeability in all directions. The tunnel is deeply embedded (h/r ≥ 3–4). The proposed equation which is developed based on industrial experiences is as follow: For prediction of steady state groundwater inflow into a circular cross section tunnel,  When h = r, Eq. In order to predict groundwater inflow to As can be seen in First, it should be noted that one of the main factors in analytical methods is hydraulic head which is defined as the distance between the tunnel centerline and groundwater table ( Second, it is noteworthy to mention that due to some mathematical limitations in the analytical equations, groundwater inflow cannot be predicted. The detailed information on the limitations is as following: Goodman and Lombardi equations: h ≤ (r/2) Lei and Karlsrud equations: h ≤ r  Finally, the difference among analytical methods is due to the different assumptions considered in development of the analytical solutions. The average of groundwater inflow into Like SGR method ( Detailed explanations of parameters S        An important point is that when tunneling is done in unsaturated zones, After scoring of parameters  The results of SGR calculation along Application of numerical methods has been significantly increased by the advent of professional computers. Various numerical methods have been developed in the past decades; Finite Difference Method ( Numerical solutions can be applied in prediction of groundwater inflow to tunnels in complex geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions. Several commercial software programs have been developed in the past decades based on Finite Element Method ( SEEP/W 2D model can be used for simulation of different flow conditions like saturated or unsaturated in confined or unconfined aquifers considering the hydraulic conductivity and volumetric water content as a function of pore water pressure ( The governing partial differential equation for two dimensional saturated/unsaturated flow of groundwater can be obtained by coupling the continuity equation and Darcy's law: Galerkin approach has been used in SEEP/W According the point that the media in this study is considered as homogenous, isotropic and saturated (as it will be described comprehensively in the following section), Seep/W model will use Boussinesq equation (Eq. Several conceptual models have been proposed for simulation of groundwater flow through fractured zones; (1) Equivalent Porous Media (EPM) models, (2) Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN) models and (3) Hybrid models. Comparison of the models have demonstrated that EPM models are of more efficiency and faster to calculate compared to the other models in simulation of the fluid flow in fractured zone ( For implementation of the numerical simulation, the first attempt was to define optimum model dimension. In the literature of numerical modeling of fluid flow into tunnels, it is inferred that total inflow rate decreases by increasing model dimensions irrespective of the boundary conditions and in situ stress ratios ( In the numerical analysis process the model domain, which is a rectangular shape, was discretized into finite element meshes. Considering the different model sizes of the geologic sections, the information regarding model nodes is not included in detail. As mentioned in “Site investigation” section, water pressure tests were carried out within the exploratory boreholes along In the numerical analysis of steady state groundwater inflow to Constant head boundary at the right and left boundaries. A flux boundary at the tunnel perimeter. A no-flow boundary at bottom of the model. Numerical analysis of steady state groundwater inflow to As can be seen in The averages of Q values obtained from various analytical methods were compared to the Q values acquired through finite element analyses ( However these methods are very different in their formulation, some interesting considerations can be made through their comparison. First and foremost, Q values distributions have the same trend for both of the methods. This is of more importance since it shows that irrespective of their relative difference, there is a global coherence. Thus, the methods can be compared even though they are methodologically very different. Second, due to the same trend of both analytical and numerical methods, it can be inferred that the framework used for numerical simulation of the steady state groundwater inflow to Finally, as it is expected the Q values obtained from analytical methods are higher than the results of numerical methods. Also, there is a difference in the maximum value of groundwater inflow; i.e. the maximum groundwater inflow is predicted as 26.3 lit/min/m in distance between 15 + 550 and 15 + 650 km using analytical methods, while it is predicted as 12.25 lit/min/m in distance between 15 + 650 and 15 + 750 km by means of numerical modeling. The main reason for these differences lies in determination of equivalent hydraulic conductivity and also the simplified assumptions used for development of analytical methods. Hence, it can be inferred that Q values computed with finite element method can be considered reliable and not out scaled. Moreover, the relative differences of analytical methods with FEM were computed and their average values are summarized in Also, the correlation of analytical methods’ results with FEM results is calculated ( In addition, the results of analytical, empirical and numerical methods are plotted in As you can see in Generally, there are three kinds of methods for evaluation of groundwater inflow to tunnel: analytical, empirical and numerical methods. Analytical methods provide reliable results; however, they mostly over/underestimate groundwater inflow to the tunnel due to many simplification used for their development. Numerical methods are known as the most precise and reliable approaches for assessment of groundwater inflow to tunnel since they allow solving complex hydrogeological and geotechnical conditions as well as complex tunnel geometries. The analytical methods are sufficient for simple geometries (circular tunnel cross section) with a few parameters. Whenever geomechanical parameters of the site is available, numerical solutions can provide the most precise and reliable results. The empirical methods are developed based on the experiences obtained in various projects around the world. They are relatively easy to use and take a short time to complete. The feasibility and simplicity of empirical and analytical methods instead of numerical methods in initial stages of designing tunnel excavation is of more importance.
