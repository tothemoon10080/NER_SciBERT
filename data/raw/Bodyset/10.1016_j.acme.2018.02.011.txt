The goal of the research is an attempt of optimization of the hydrometallurgy-based zinc production line, consisting of three stages: mixing of raw materials, oxidative roasting and leaching. The output product of one stage is an input to the next stage. Goal of mixing is preparation of zinc concentrates mix on the basis of zinc concentrates originated from different mines. The output semi-product of the next stage, the oxidative roasting process, is calcine, which is the input of the leaching. The result of the leaching is zinc sulfate solution and the goal of leaching is to carry out the maximum amount of zinc to solution. The preliminary step of any optimization is modeling of the analyzed processes. Modeling of considered three stages of zinc production line, based on the real industrial data of one of zinc production plants, was performed using different techniques. The elaborated models were the basis of the optimization for given objective functions of each of the production stages. The optimization methodology of multi-stage processes developed by the authors was applied. Obtained results of modeling and optimization are presented.
