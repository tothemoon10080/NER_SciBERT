To simplify the quantification of time irreversibility, we employ order patterns instead of the raw multi-dimension vectors in time series, and considering the existence of forbidden permutation, we propose a subtraction-based parameter,

                     , to measure the probabilistic differences between symmetric permutations for time irreversibility. Two chaotic models, the logistic and Henon systems, and reversible Gaussian process and their surrogate data are used to validate the time-irreversible measure, and time irreversibility of epileptic EEGs from Nanjing General Hospital is detected by the parameter. Test results prove that it is promising to quantify time irreversibility by measuring the subtraction-based probabilistic differences between symmetric order patterns, and our findings highlight the manifestation of nonlinearity of whether healthy or diseased EEGs and suggest that the epilepsy leads to a decline in the nonlinearity of brain electrical activities during seize-free intervals.Nonlinearity is a necessary condition for chaotic behaviors, so whether a time series is compatible with a linear process is important in the paradigm of deterministic chaos. Time irreversibility is one of fundamental properties that determine whether a time series is linear or not. Complex systems characterized with nonlinearity and nonequilibrium yield statistical asymmetry under time reversal, therefore, measurements for time irreversibility or directional asymmetry are feasible assessments for characterizing nonlinear complex activities. A stochastic process is said to be time reversible if its probabilistic properties are invariant with respect to time reversal, otherwise it is directional or irreversible For symbolic measures, it is not realizable to always have all of the designed symbolic sequences, and the nonoccurring sequences, called forbidden sequences or forbidden words, are closely related to the nonlinear complexity of the dynamical processes In our contributions, we propose a novel subtraction-based parameter to quantify temporal asymmetry by measuring the probabilistic differences between symmetric order patterns, and we verify the parameter by chaotic and reversible processes and apply it to characterize the nonlinearity of epileptic EEGs. Let us recall some basic theoretical concepts of time irreversibility. In the statistical definition of G. Weiss Another definition of F. Kelly And for a reversible time series, the probability distributions of These definitions allow us to quantify the time irreversibility by measuring the probabilistic divergences of symmetric vectors or measuring the differences of joint probability distributions between the forward and backward time series. Interestingly, the calculation of joint probability in time irreversibility, involving vector length The permutation method, arising naturally from the time series without any further model assumptions, contains inherent causal dynamical information and underlying dynamics of temporal structure Then we count the amount of each permutation and calculate the probability Given the existence of forbidden permutation The subtraction-based parameter follows some properties for measuring probabilistic difference. Basically, when two probabilities are equal, To quantify the rate of single order patterns without symmetric form, we define Eq. Surrogate data is commonly used to identify nonlinearity in time series. The surrogate method is to generate linear surrogate data sets following a null hypothesis that specifies series as some linear process, and detect the nonlinearity by determining whether some statistic aspects of the original and surrogate data are significantly different Surrogate data could be generated by model-based certain particular autoregressive (AR) process or by model-free methods that randomly adjust amplitude or phase of the original data In this section, nonlinear processes generated by chaotic models, reversible process and their linear surrogate data sets are employed to validate Logistic equation, written as To ensure that all possible permutations will appear, the length of data should not be too short. We select data length from Let us firstly look at the rates of single order patterns, Time irreversibility of the three series and their surrogate data are shown in We test the three processes with different data length from 7000 to 10000, and find that the data length have no significant influence to the results. The two chaotic series and reversible Gaussian process prove that it is effective to quantify the time irreversibility by using 22 healthy volunteers (aged 15 to 49, mean Considering the influence of data length on Let us first check the distributions of single order patterns, illustrated in Temporal asymmetry of the healthy and epileptic EEGs and their surrogate data are shown in We learn that the parameter quantifying the difference between of symmetric distributions proposed by Costa et al. Time irreversibility of different brain areas, taking For one point, both the healthy and epileptic brain activities manifest the nonlinearity of time irreversibility. Our highly complicated brain, a collection of huge number of neurons interacting and synchronizing with each others, has arguably been a typical complex network For another point, the brain disease of epilepsy cause declination to brain behaviors' nonlinearity. During epileptic seizures, synchronous neuronal firing and severe dysfunction in brain activities could be recorded by EEG From the time irreversibility detections of chaotic and reversible processes and real-world physiological signals, we learn that There are some reports When using the ordinal approach for symbolizing time series, equal values, In summary, we simplify the quantification of time irreversibility by transforming m-dimensional vectors into order patterns and measuring the probabilistic difference between symmetric order patterns.
