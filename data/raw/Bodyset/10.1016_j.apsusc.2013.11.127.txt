The microstructural stability of ultrafine grained (UFG) cold spray 6061 aluminum deposits produced by high pressure cold spray were investigated by in situ heating to a fully annealed state via a hot-stage transmission electron microscope (TEM). It was possible to observe the precise locations and temperatures of different microstructural changes, like dislocation movement and other restoration processes. Even after heating up to the annealing temperature for this alloy, the deposited layer in the perpendicular direction was found to preserve the UFG structures, which were the result of different recrystallization mechanisms caused by the high strains present during cold spraying. Extensive solute segregation at the grain boundaries acted as an obstruction for grain boundary migration in this direction, thereby preventing grain growth. However, in the direction parallel to the deposited surface, the UFGs were not resistant to grain coursing like the other direction, since the grain boundaries had much less solute segregation.Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricate bulk ultrafine grained (UFG) materials without porosity and a better combination of ductility and strength by imposing severe plastic strain There is also some indirect evidence of grain boundary (GB) segregation in UFG materials processed by cold work Non-isothermal heat treatments, especially the use of low heating rates, are frequently encountered during thermo-mechanical processing cycles, and hence are of importance for industrial purposes. During non-isothermal heat treatment, recovery and precipitation are likely to occur, generating complex interactions with recrystallization. Precipitation can also strongly influence the recrystallization behavior. The precipitation of dispersoids in the course of an annealing treatment can hinder or even suppress recrystallization The present study was undertaken in an effort to understand the recovery and recrystallization processes and associated changes in the microstructure during heating and annealing of a highly deformed 6061 alloy layer deposited by high pressure CS. Finding the exact temperatures for the processes involved during heating are important for microstructural control. In this case, an in situ hot-stage TEM investigation was found to be a suitable and powerful tool to study and probe the complex interactions and thermal stability of the various inhomogeneous as-deposited microstructures, during non-isothermal heating and annealing. In the present study, a 6061 coating was produced with a commercial gas-atomized 6061 Al powder as the feed stock with a size range of 5–50 The powder morphology and the coating microstructure were examined using SEM samples, sectioned for both the The annealing behavior of the cold spray deposited material was characterized by continuous in situ heating of the sample to 450 Thermal analysis was also performed in a SDT Q600 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) in order to investigate the phase evolution of 6061 deposited sample during the continuous heating.

Kinetic solute segregation, as a consequence of a radiation-induced vacancy flow, has been suggested by Anthony Early estimations of the vacancy production during cold work were made based on the data for residual resistivity measurements The TEM micrographs of the The microstructure of the planar view (  Results of the grain size variation with annealing temperature along both directions, parallel and perpendicular to the cold spraying direction, are presented in The full heat treatment cycle from room temperature to 450 On increasing the annealing temperature to 150 In According to our observations recrystallization starts at 300 Increasing the annealing temperature to 400 As a result, even at high annealing temperatures, e.g. 440–450 The cold sprayed 6061 aluminum deposits produced by high pressure cold spray were investigated by different electron microscopies. Compared with the as-received powder particles, an increase in solute segregation was observed after CS, which has been attributed to the flow of solute elements through CS-introduced point defects (dislocations and vacancies).
