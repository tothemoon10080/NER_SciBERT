Electrolyte is an important component of dye sensitised solar cells (DSSC). Its composition, in particular, additives controls the energetic at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, influencing the performance of dye solar cell. We report here for the first time the use of 8-Hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) as an electrolyte additive to replace costly, volatile 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP). Due to its unique structural feature containing hydroxyl and amine group, 8HQ results in remarkable difference in the energy band alignment at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface with respect to that of TBP, as revealed by photocurrent density and Mott-Schottky analysis. Apart from this band shift, 8HQ is very effective in suppressing back electron transfer resulting in enhancement in open circuit voltage. Compared to TBP, additive 8HQ resulted in ∼22% increase in Jsc

                      (∼5.8%) and 15% increase in photoconversion efficiency with N3 dye. Overall, we found that 8HQ is a highly effective additive in tailoring the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface which results in superior performance of dye sensitized solar solar cells as compared to cells with TBP as the additive.The efficiency of DSSCs is determined by its short circuit photocurrent density ( The kinetics of electron injection depends on the conduction band edge ( To improve the performance of DSSCs beyond that achieved by TBP addition, various kinds of nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as imidazole derivatives, pyrazole derivatives, pyridine derivatives, triazole derivatives and benzimidazole derivatives have been employed, but all of them had revealed similar trade-off between In 1983, Grätzel et al. had utilized 8-Hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) for surface complexation with TiO To prepare TiO The current-voltage characteristics of cells were measured with a Keithley Model 2420 source meter and a solar simulator with a 150W Xenon arc-lamp (Newport) under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 Cells prepared with TBP were compared to those prepared with addition of 8HQ as well as those prepared with Li additive only. The molecular structure of 8HQ and TBP is shown in From the dark The photocurrent in DSSCs is determined by the electron injection efficiency (Φ Compared to electrolyte LE01(TiO The comparison of the electrolytes LE01, LE02 and LE03 in terms of the reaction kinetics at the TiO To exemplify further the underlying mechanism of these additives in electrolyte on the photovoltaic parameters, impedance spectra were also measured by varying the applied potential at equal intervals in the vicinity of The exponential nature of chemical capacitance in the three electrolytes is clearly evident from In DSSCs V The potential of additive 8HQ has also been tested with N719 dye and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics ( We believe that 8HQ plays the same role like TBP in the suppression of recombination since 8HQ bears nitrogen atom For the first time 8HQ has been used as an electrolyte additive to replace costly volatile TBP. Use of 8HQ has resulted in remarkable energetic variation at the TiO The authors would like to acknowledge the support from NCPRE and SERIIUS in various forms for the above work.
