Laboratory and industrial scale experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of tertiary dodecyl mercaptan (TDM) as a collector on the flotation of auriferous pyrite and arsenopyrite. The optimum recovery of gold associated with auriferous sulphides was obtained by adding a mixture of TDM and sodium butyl xanthate, together with only a little CuSO4 as an activator in a weak alkaline pulp adjusted by NaOH. A two-month industrial trial at the Liumei plant in Guangxi, China showed that an average gold recovery of 90.8% into a concentrate assaying 81.1g/t Au from a feed assaying 2.9g/t Au could be achieved at pH 8–8.5 using TDM as a collector.Gold generally occurs in association with sulphide minerals including pyrite, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite. Many techniques are used to process gold ores, such as gravity separation, cyanidation and froth flotation ( The Geology and Mineral Resources Exploration and Development Co., Ltd., in Guangxi province, China, has a large resource of gold ore with grades as low as 2.5 This paper tests tertiary dodecyl mercaptan (TDM) as a collector to float auriferous sulphides without adding any H The auriferous sulphide ore used in this study was collected from the feed to the flotation circuit at the Liumei Plant. The ore is composed mainly of arsenopyrite, pyrite, quartz, sericite, ankerite, calcite, and small quantities of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite and apatite. Gold is the only mineral of economic value in the ore. Pyrite and arsenopyrite are the main Au-bearing minerals, and the orthostereoscopic image shows that they are idiomorphic–hypidiomorphic crystals with a particle size of 0.10 Prepared samples, of 1000  Different types of pH regulators were tested at a TDM addition of 100 Industrial scale flotation trials have been carried out at the Liumei plant located in Guangxi, China. The production capacity of this plant is 300 The effect of NaOH addition on the flotation of auriferous sulphides was investigated at 80 Due to the poor solubility of TDM, different addition points in the circuit were tested under the condition of TDM (80 The industrial tests were carried out from September 2008 to October 2008. The circuit pulp pH was adjusted with NaOH in the presence of TDM, and by H Laboratory and industrial scale tests are conducted to determine the effect of TDM as primary collector on the flotation of auriferous sulphides ore. The laboratory tests suggest that the auriferous sulphides can be recovered by flotation without adding any H
