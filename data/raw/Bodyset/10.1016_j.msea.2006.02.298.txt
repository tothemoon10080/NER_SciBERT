The thermal and mechanical properties of 1mm diameter rod specimens were investigated over a wide composition range of the Cu–Zr binary alloy system. Our results indicated that alloys with composition near Cu–36at.% Zr have a higher activation energy and a lower plastic deformation during compression test than those of compositions near Cu–50at.% Zr. A relationship between the activation energy and the plastic deformation could be worked out suggesting that the lower is the activation energy to crystallization, the larger is the plastic deformation.In comparison to many other binary alloys of transition metals, the amorphous Cu–Zr alloys can be obtained in a wide range of composition upon high cooling rates. Ray et al. A study on the formation of the amorphous phase was thus undertaken in the composition range Cu The alloy ingots of nominal compositions Cu The DSC traces obtained from a few 1 In order to check whether the 1 Typical compressive room temperature stress–strain curves for the 1 The fracture for all specimens was found to be inclined to about 45° to the loading axis, a typical characteristic of glassy alloys, suggesting that the failure occurred near the maximum shear stress. Also, a large number of shear bands with different orientations could be observed on the fractured sample with the Cu It is acknowledged that amorphous materials have a brittle behavior at temperature far below Recent independent observations on amorphous specimens deformed either by bending, nano-indentation, cold-working or uniaxial compression methods have revealed the formation of nanocrystallization In order to check the applicability of the approach, the activation energy for crystallization of the samples has been measured using the Kissinger method The 1 This research was supported by a grant (code # 05K1501-00510) from ‘Center for Nanostructured Materials Technology’ under the ‘21st Century Frontier R&D Programs’ of the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology.
