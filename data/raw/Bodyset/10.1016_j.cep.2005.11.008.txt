The objective of the study is to show that the theory of information can be used to describe the random process of mixing of granular materials in a multi-ribbon blender. A new form of the entropy criterion estimating the current state of a mixture is proposed, a mathematical model to describe the variations of the informational entropy during the process is developed, and the experimental validation of the model is done for the blending process duration. Based on the experimental measurements the impulse response of blending process of granular material is obtained.The objective of the study is to develop a mathematical description of evolution of the state of a mixture of particulate solids in a mixer, which is widely used in industrial processes. This is, for example, the multi-ribbon blender Primary information on the state of a mixture is the distribution of concentration of a key component (tracer) over the mixing zone. The models describing evolution of the distribution are usually based on the dispersion equation, or on cell models using the theory of Markov chains. This approach is described and discussed in recently published reviews by Berthiaux and Mizonov The integral characterisation of the state can be done within the entropy approach, in which the informational entropy A mathematical model based on the informational entropy was proposed by StrÄ™k Finally, it can be said that the entropy criterion is a good and informative characteristic of a state of a stochastic system, and under some additional assumptions allows describing evolution of the system. Below, a new entropy model is used to describe and explain experimental data obtained at the multi-ribbon blender. The experimental system used in this work consisted of two collections of particles of different colour: 5 The effect of blending process on the state of granular mixture was studied by taking the representative samples from the operating volume of the blender. The samples were taken at different moments of time, the total number of samples was always equal to 10. The experimental samples were further divided into two groups: the group of samples, in which homogenisation currently occurs ( Entering into the homogenisation group (index Entering into the segregation group (index The above conditions In a single sample only two outcomes are possible for the key component: blue and not blue. The relationship Taking into account the above consideration and definitions the average informational entropy can be calculated separately for the both groups of samples: If the asymptotic state of the mixture is homogeneous, the informational entropy of this state The interaction (superposition) of segregation and homogenisation takes place during the blending process, and the total informational flow changing the entropy finally is:  The experimental investigation of mixing to apply the developed approach to treatment of experimental data was carried out at the experimental set with the multi-ribbon blender, which is shown schematically in The vessel of blender was consists of two horizontal cylinders, partly penetrating into each other, and two intersecting helical ribbons. The description of agitator geometry is given in the patent The experimental investigations were done according to the following scheme: Before the starting ( Then, ( At the moment The agitator was brought in motion. In the sampling moments of time ( On the basis of the experimental data collected in Accordingly to the fact that the construction of the blender does not allow observing the transient behaviour of the granular material at different intervals of mixing time, we can only assume that there exist three principal transport areas inside the operating volume: The area near free surface of the mixture, which is not directly covered by the ribbons during their rotation; here, the motion of granular material is the result of transmission of the energy from the ribbons edges to the material; this process can be characterised by small inertia of particles and described by the transfer function The periodical transport of granular material outside the area of the multi-ribbon agitator can be described by means of two parameters, which are inertial and damping coefficients; the process in this area can be described by the transfer function The area of direct contact of granular material with the inertial sides of the vessel; this process is characterised by high inertia as a result of interaction between the sides of the vessel and the moving granular material, and can be described by the transfer function Using the above assumptions we propose the block diagram of the total process consisting of the parallel system of the first and the second order linear elements, transfer functions of which are shown in At the moment where Applying the residuum theory to the model, the block diagram of which is given in The diagram in Several important conclusions can be derived from the material described above: Eqs.
