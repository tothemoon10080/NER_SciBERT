The author would like to apologize to the authors of â€œ The following paragraphs in the Introduction of this paper should be put into quotation marks and revised as follows: There are a few studies in relation to the fully 3D numerical simulation of tunneling by using the shielded TBMs. However investigations regarding to the spatial numerical analysis of TBM tunneling that have been carried out for the specific projects can be found in the literature Another group of studies involves numerical analyses, which do not consider the shield in the numerical modelling [20]. In this regard, a back analysis of the creep deformations and pressures has been performed by Shalabi [14] for the Stillwater Tunnel (USA, D Taking the ground properties, TBM components and performance parameters into accounts, a fully axisymmetric numerical models was performed by Ramoni and Anagnostou [10] in order to evaluate the impacts of thrust force, over boring, shield length and skin friction coefficient between the shield and the ground regarding to the problem of shield jamming. Moreover, Ramoni and Anagnostou [9,11] applied the stress-point algorithm in their analysis by using the so-steady state method As well as a reference to be added:
