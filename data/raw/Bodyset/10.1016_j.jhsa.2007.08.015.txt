In this article, we describe a technique for internal fixation of coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus. It follows basic AO principles utilizing lag screw fixation combined with an antiglide plate to neutralize shearing forces. We have used this technique successfully for the treatment of isolated shear fractures of the capitellum, including those with extension into the trochlea.
