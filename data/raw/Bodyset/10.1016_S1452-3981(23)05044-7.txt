A novel synthesis and enrichment processes for high pure TiCl3 in molten CaCl2 were experimentally investigated in this study. Two steps were carried out: the first is the preparation of titanium subchloride, and the second is the enrichment process of TiCl3 with HCl gas. The titanium subchloride was prepared by the reaction of titanium tetrachloride with metallic titanium in molten CaCl2. The HCl gas was used to purify the melt before a series of experiments were done. Also, it was introduced into the melt when TiCl2 reached to the saturated solubility (7.89 wt.%) at 1123 K. The power of high pure TiCl3 was collected on the top container of special designed equipment. The collection efficiency of TiCl3 keeps above on 95%, and the utilized efficiency of HCl decreased with the intruding rate increasing. X-ray diffraction and EDS results demonstrated that the products were pure TiCl3. SEM result disclosed that the pure TiCl3 was dense and homogeneous with an agglomerative structure.
