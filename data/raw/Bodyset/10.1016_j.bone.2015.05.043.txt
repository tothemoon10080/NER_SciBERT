We read with interest the letter by Sharp and Magnusson. We are thankful for the contribution to understanding the discrepancy between the apparent hypermineralization and decreased bone strength in diabetes patients as suggested in our recent paper The study by Manavalan et al. The altered mineralization in diabetes patients may be due to increased glucose levels. In vitro high levels of glucose increased mineral deposition, but also decreased the quality of the mineral based on the calcium/phosphate ratio Bone material strength measured by micro indentation is reported to be decreased in type 2 diabetes patients, although bone mineral density was not different BAP may be a marker of an altered bone mineralization process in diabetes, which may explain this paradox. We agree with Sharp and Magnusson, that circulating bone turnover markers should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to determine, whether BAP may be a marker of hypermineralization in diabetes patients.
