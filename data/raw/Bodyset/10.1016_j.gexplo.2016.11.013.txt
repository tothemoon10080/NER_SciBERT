In this study, fractal/multifractal modeling methods have been applied for preliminary hydrothermal Ni prospection using a set of stream sediment geochemical data of Ahangaran district, which is an arid terrain in eastern Iran. The study area has a complex geological and morphological setting, which is dominated by the presence of aeolian sands. Cretaceous ophiolitic rocks hosting nickel endowment are influenced by extensive listwanitic alteration. Hydrothermal nickel mineralization occurs as veinlets and disseminated forms within the listwanite units. Among the analyzed elements, Ni, Cr and, Co have been recognized as being associated with listwanitic alteration and Ni mineralization, through robust factor analysis of compositional data. The regional background patterns of these mineralization-related elements were delineated via the concentration – area (C-A) fractal modeling method. Different multifractal characteristics of the selected elements were recognized using the multifractal spectrum f(α) curves and different multifractal indices. The enrichment and depletion patterns of the related elements in different parts of the study area were also identified using the local singularity mapping technique. The application of local singularity mapping manifested different geochemical patterns that were not recognized via the C-A fractal modeling method. The superiority of the local singularity mapping technique in delineating geochemical populations over the C-A fractal modeling method, was revealed by quantification of the correlation between geochemical anomalies and geological evidence of the mineralization.Recognition of anomalous geochemical patterns is a crucial issue in regional to local scale mineral exploration, since mineralization is often accompanied by specific patterns of metal dispersion ( From the statistical point of view, it is known that ore-forming elements do not always follow normal and log-normal distributions; instead they often show positively skewed distributions ( By using any of the traditional statistical methods of anomaly and background separation, such as setting specific threshold values ( Besides, exploring the plausible links between elements and mineral deposits could be useful for recognition of mineralization-related elemental associations, for which multivariate analyses have been applied (e.g., The main objective of this research is to use a set of stream sediment geochemical data for prospecting Ni mineralization in the Ahangaran district, eastern Iran, a poorly-explored area. In the study area, due to arid climate condition, widespread presence of aeolian sands and strong winds causing the weathered materials to be transported far away from their original sources ( Factor analysis (FA) is a multivariate statistical procedure, which unravels the underlying patterns and manifests the possible links among a set of measured variables, using a correlation or covariance matrix of measured variables ( Thus, robust factor analysis (RFA) of compositional data should be applied for proper recognition of mineralization-related elements. Prior to RFA, a log-ratio transformation should be applied to open the closed (i.e., compositional) geochemical data (e.g., Fractal/multifractal methods have been applied in various fields of geosciences (Agterberg and  Multifractals describe the statistical distribution of objects with fractal geometry. Multifractals are spatially intertwined fractals with continuous and variable fractal dimensions ( Based on the concept of fractal geometry ( Thus, the slopes of straight lines, which could be fitted to the log-log plots of concentration versus the area, denote the fractal dimensions of different geochemical populations. The intersections of straight lines determine the threshold, which may delineate geochemical populations ( Several complicated geological processes, such as dispersion pattern of ore-forming elements across an area, are formed as the outcome of non-linear dynamic processes ( Instead, the scaling exponent or the fractal dimension of such systems varies as a function of spatial variation ( For modeling continuous spectrum of fractal dimensions of geochemical variables, multifractal spectrum analysis by the momentum method ( This analysis starts with interpolation of a geochemical variable with different scales, i.e., different cell sizes ( In a log-log plot, the Eq. The multifractal spectrum If the curve of For assessing the multifractal distribution pattern of geochemical contents, the parameters of Singular physical processes are defined as non-linear processes, which are accompanied by a huge amount of energy release or material accumulation within a narrow spatial-temporal range. From the multifractal point of view, singularity could be described via power-law relationships. If we describe the amount of material within a surface The singularity index (  In log-log plots, the average concentration values The points should be fitted by the least square method, and the slope of the linear relationship can be considered as ( Delineated geochemical anomalies should be ground-truth checked with mineralization-related geological information. In this regard, delineated geochemical anomalies as binary predictor maps should be compared to a binary map of mineralization-related geological data or evidence of mineralization (  Two types of errors exist regarding recognition of geochemical anomalies. The type I error ( The overall accuracy ( This quantity has been used for assessing the quality of anomaly and background separation methods (e.g., The outcrops of ophiolitic rocks in Iran are distributed over the Khoy, Rasht, Kermanshah, Nayriz, Nayin, Sabzevar, Iranshahr and Birjand areas ( The oldest rocks exposed in the Ahangaran district are Cretaceous ophiolitic rocks, Cretaceous volcanic rocks including basaltic andesites and porphyritic andesites, and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks consisting of sandstones and marls ( The hydrothermal Ni mineralization in the study area occurs as veins and veinlets within listwanitic-altered rocks ( For Ni prospecting in the study area, stream sediment geochemical exploration has been carried out by the geological survey of Iran and a total of 188 stream sediment samples have been collected. The samples were sieved by 180 The climate in the study area is arid steppe. The typical characteristic of the study area is the presence of aeolian sands and strong winds that cause the weathered materials to be transported far away from their original sources ( For the recognition of mineralization-related geochemical signatures in the study area, robust factor analysis (RFA) of compositional data was applied on the seven analyzed elements (i.e., As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn), all of which are somehow associated with the hydrothermal Ni mineralization ( Several criteria should be set prior to factor analysis, of which the number of factors could be determined by a significant amount of total variability to be explained by factors ( The results of RFA are shown in As nickel mineralization in the Ahangaran district is associated with relative enrichment of Ni, Cr and Co ( The statistical characteristics of the elements, such as the skewness and kurtosis, suggest that the raw data (the data obtained from analysis of samples without any transformations) of Ni, Cr and Co do not follow normal distributions ( To assess the spatial distribution of the investigated elements (Ni, Cr and Co), interpolation of raw geochemical variables was carried out. Geochemical mapping should be performed by the selection of a proper unit cell size ( The C-A log-log plots, consisting of the values of gridded geochemical maps of Ni, Cr and Co ( The four geochemical populations of Ni are representative of high anomaly, anomaly, background and low background geochemical contents ( The three delineated geochemical populations for Cr represent high anomaly, anomaly and background geochemical populations ( The four delineated geochemical classes of Co are considered to represent highly anomalous, anomalous, background and low background geochemical contents ( Multifractal spectrum parameters of the selected elements (Ni, Cr and Co) were measured based on six iterations with different cell sizes ranging from 200 The multifractal spectrum curves The multifractal spectrum curves of the selected elements are all of right deviations ( The widths of the multifractal spectrum ( Singularity mapping (SM) can be implemented on either raw or gridded data. For areas with irregularly-spaced sampling, gridding the data not only allows for better visualization of the spatial characteristics of the data set, but also improves the accuracy of SM ( The selection of edge sizes and intervals in SM is based on the expanse of the study area, the scale of the unit cell size and the scale of local structures of interest ( A computer program was coded and implemented for the calculation of the singularity indices ( Inspection of the delineated geochemical anomalies of the Ni mineralization-related elements, generated by the C-A fractal model ( It should be noted that neither all parts of the Cretaceous ophiolitic rocks are mineralized nor all parts of these rock units are classified as mineralization-related geochemical anomalies. But as Cretaceous ophiolites are host rocks of the hydrothermal Ni mineralization in the study area ( The geochemical populations delineated by the C-A fractal model ( By comparison of the binary anomaly classes of C-A fractal modeling and the binary ground-truth map of the geological controller of Ni mineralization, the cells with true positive ( The lowest The However, the anomaly maps of Co and Cr, obtained from the C-A fractal and the singularity multifractal modeling methods, have the lowest In this study, a district-scale stream sediment geochemical survey has been conducted as a preliminary exploration stage for recognizing the significant geochemical signatures of hydrothermal Ni mineralization in the Ahangaran district, an arid terrain covered mainly by the aeolian sands ( Ni, Cr and, Co were identified as the elements, which were related to hydrothermal Ni mineralization by the application of robust factor analysis of compositional data ( The concentration – area (C-A) fractal method was applied for recognition of regional background ( Comparison of different methods has shown that with the C-A fractal method, different patterns of element enrichments and depletions were revealed as compared with the local singularity mapping (SM) multifractal method ( Comparison of the results of the C-A and SM methods with the geological evidence of mineralization ( The authors express their gratitude to the geological survey of eastern Iran (GSI), particularly Mr. Hassan Azmi for providing the data to this research. The authors are also appreciative of Professor Huseyin Yilmaz and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions, which significantly improved the manuscript.
