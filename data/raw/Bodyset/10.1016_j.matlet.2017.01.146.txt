Spherical hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals with hierarchical structure and controllable size has been successfully synthesized by hydrothermal method. The polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a template united with Ca2+ chelating agent is used to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth. The synthesized powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrograph (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicate that the obtained particles are uniform spherical crystals with hierarchical structure. Furthermore, the process of PVP template united with Ca2+ chelating agent is discussed.Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is similarity to the mineral phase of human bones that has been widely used as bone substitute for filling bone defects and scaffold matrix for tissue engineering. Because of their ease of handling and adsorption ability, it also is used in other biomedical applications such as drug delivery To maintain good control of the morphology of HAP, citric acid is frequently used to draw the shape and size of the particle Therefore, spherical crystal assembly of hydroxyapatite with hierarchical structure had been successfully prepared via hydrothermal process. We chose PVP template and sodium citrate as a Ca  In FTIR spectra, the characteristic groups of HAP can be observed. The bands at 563 The bands at 3426   Based on the previous analysis, a possible process of the HAP formation with PVP template united with Ca In this work, uniform spherical multi-structure crystal cluster of HAP have been successfully synthesized with PVP template united with calcium citrate chelating. The obtained crystal cluster is about 1um in size and single sheets HAP is 200â€“300 This research was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
