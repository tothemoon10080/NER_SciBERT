PID controllers are indisputably the most common controller type encountered in process control applications. Therefore, they have been quite well accepted for process control of crushing processes as well. However, successful tuning of a PID controller typically requires a model of the controllable process. This paper presents a novel approach for continuous-time low order transfer function identification on a closed single-input-single-output PID control loop. The proposed method is based on calculation of time integrals on controller input and output signals. The method is relatively simple, numerically straighforward and intuitively appealing as it simultaneously provides model parameters and criteria for control loop performance assessment.
