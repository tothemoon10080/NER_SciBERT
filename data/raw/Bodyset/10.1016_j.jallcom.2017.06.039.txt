SiC fiber-reinforced Ti-21Al-29Nb matrix composites with either C and C/Mo duplex coatings were prepared by the foil-fiber-foil (FFF) method, in order to comparatively study the effects of C/Mo duplex coatings on the interface and mechanical properties of the composites. The longitudinal tensile strength of the as-prepared composites was measured at room temperature. In order to study the interfacial thermal stability and microstructure evolution characteristics of the composites, vacuum thermal exposures of the composites were carried out at 800, 900 or 940 °C for different durations. The interfacial microstructures of the as-prepared and thermally-exposed composites were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicate that the C/Mo duplex coating does not only have better thermal stability, but also can further slow down the interfacial reaction of the composites in comparison with the C single coating. The diffusion of a small amount of Mo atoms made the matrix close to the interface have better plasticity, so the tensile strength of the composites can be further improved. The interface of the composite with the C/Mo duplex coating was nearly intact after the 940 °C/50 h thermal exposure while that of the composite with the C single coating was not intact, as the C/Mo duplex coating can better relax the thermal residual stresses than the C single coating.The needs of the aerospace industry for materials with low density and high strength at elevated temperatures have oriented research toward fiber-reinforced Ti-Al intermetallic matrix composites Fiber protective coating has been introduced to help solve these problems, and many investigations have shown that some fiber coatings are effective in improving the interface and mechanical properties of the composites In this work, the effect of a C/Mo duplex coating on the interface and the room temperature tensile properties of SiC SiC In order to study the interfacial thermal stability of the composites, some parts of the SiC Longitudinal tensile tests of the as-prepared composites were performed using an Instron-1195 tensile test machine at room temperature with a displacement rate of 1 mm/min to investigate the effect of C/Mo duplex coating on the mechanical properties of the composites. The composites were cut into dog-bone-type plate tensile specimens by electric discharge machining.   In addition, from Additionally, there is also some other difference in the microstructure of the matrix near the fiber, see In order to study the effect of element distribution characteristics on the microstructure of the composites, EDS map analysis of each element was carried out in the interfacial zone of the as-prepared composites. The analyzed position and corresponding results of the SiC According to For the sake of studying the interfacial phases of the SiC By contrast, EDS mapping in the interfacial zone of the as-prepared SiC In summary, some Mo atoms have diffused into the matrix of the composite, which caused the formation of O phase in the SiC In order to study the effect of C/Mo duplex coating on the mechanical property of SiC   By contrast, In order to study the thermal stability of the C/Mo duplex coating in the interface, vacuum thermal exposures to the SiC According to In addition, we can also see that the thickness of the reaction layer in the SiC  In addition, it can be seen that the morphology of the three constituent phases─α   The interfacial reaction layer of the as-prepared SiC The addition of the Mo coating resulted in a B2-riched transition zone between the reaction layer and the matrix in the SiC The tensile strength of Ti-21Al-29Nb matrix was improved with the addition of SiC fibers, and the SiC When the composites were thermally exposed at 800 and 900 °C in vacuum, the C/Mo duplex coating provided more protection than the C single coating.
