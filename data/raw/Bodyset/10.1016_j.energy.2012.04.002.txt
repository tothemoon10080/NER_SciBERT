Improvement of energy efficiency has been accepted as one of the most cost-effective approaches towards sustainable economic development and reduction of the continuously increasing energy consumption internationally. South Africa, being among the developing countries, is not an exception even though historically low energy prices and the lack of appropriate policies have created an energy intensive economy.
                  This paper examines the factors affecting the trends in energy efficiency in South Africa from 1993 to 2006 and particularly the impact of structural changes and utilisation efficiency of the country's energy intensity. Identifying and understanding the driving forces are necessary ingredients in the development of appropriate policy-making. This paper also provides disaggregation of the energy efficiency trends in the main sectors of the economy.
                  We determine that structural changes of the economy have played an important and negative role in the increasing economy-wide energy efficiency. On the other hand, the energy usage's intensity was a contributing factor to the decreasing trend of energy efficiency. We suggest that differentiated price policies may be required if South Africa is to create an effective energy efficiency policy.Internationally, countries are starting to face the challenge of sustainable energy. This means that their behaviour towards energy usage has to align with their social, environmental and economic targets. The improvement of energy efficiency has been accepted as one of the most cost-effective approaches towards sustainable economic development and the reduction of the continuously increasing energy consumption. Also, the environmental benefits are important: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, CO Both developed and emerging countries face similar energy and environmental challenges. South Africa, being among the developing countries, is no exception. Amongst its main industries in GDP are those related to minerals extraction and processing which are by nature energy intensive The main purpose of this paper is to unfold the reasons of the trends in energy efficiency in South Africa from 1993 to 2006; particularly the identification of the impact of structural changes and utilisation efficiency on the country's energy intensity. By identifying and understanding the driving forces, policy-makers can choose the most appropriate policies for the future of energy efficiency. This paper will also disaggregate the energy efficiency trends in the main sectors of the economy. Various sectors have different energy profiles and hence, different reasons for their changes in energy efficiency To do so, the rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section Defining energy efficiency can prove a difficult task especially if one thinks on the various contexts within which the concept can be used. In order to come up with a definition that includes as much information as possible, the World Energy Council Similarly, in the European Union's Action Plan for Energy Efficiency According to Oikonomou et al. In general, it is agreed that energy efficiency is an economical way to reduce energy usage taking into consideration the economies' real output Improving energy efficiency is an effective way for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, striving for more energy efficient equipment might lead to increased competition with positive results (for consumers) in the prices of products and services After the political instability of the 1990s and the country's first democratic elections in 1994, the priorities of the policy-makers changed. The current government has identified energy issues as critical for the economic development of the country. The Free Basic Electricity (FBE) indicates the importance of energy issues and ensures that a certain amount of electricity is provided free of charge to the population in its entirety. More specifically with regards to energy efficiency, the first Progress on energy issues has been considered unsatisfying for many years. For example, electricity demand was increasing for many years on the basis of declining real prices and in the same time the government was refusing to allow increases in generation capacity. These resulted in major electricity blackouts in the country. The Department of Energy (DoE) decided to demonstrate the importance of energy efficiency issues by releasing the first  Energy efficiency, as noted earlier, is defined as the ratio between energy consumption and economic output. In other words, the value of energy intensity shows how many units of energy (in this case TJ) are consumed for the production of 1 unit of economic output (in this case ZAR Taking the analysis a step further, we determine the most energy intensive sectors in South Africa through the years. Firstly, we compare the disaggregated (per economic sector) energy consumption of the country through the years to examine if there are any structural changes among the sectors. From The highest industrial consumers were: ‘mining and quarrying’ (20.4% to the industry and 7.12% to total), ‘iron and steel’ (19.8% to the industry and 6.91% to total), ‘chemical and petrochemical’ (9.8% to the industry and 3.4% to the total) and ‘non-ferrous metals’ (7% to the industry and 2.44% to total). However, it is likely that even though a sector consumes a high share of the overall energy in the country, it can also be among the most efficient sectors. Therefore, there is a need to put the energy usage of each sector in perspective by comparing the intensities of the various sectors.  ’Iron and steel’ and ‘non-metallic minerals’ sectors have shown a significant decrease in their intensity levels. This fact can be attributed to two possible reasons: either the use of more efficient technologies or the production of a mix of products that uses less energy per value. On the other hand, the ‘non-ferrous metals’ and ‘mining and quarrying’ sectors showed increases of 23% and 21% respectively. The question that arises is which factors have driven these trends in the total economy and in the individual sectors. To answer this question, we conducted a decomposition exercise. Decomposition techniques have become a useful tool for energy modelling and analysis over the last two decades with special focus on energy consumption and efficiency According to Ma and Stern Within the IDA approach, there are various methods to employ but there is no consensus as to which one is the best. We decided to follow the method proposed by Ang and Liu Perfect decomposition: the method does not allow for the existence of unexplained residuals. Path independency: the method presents symmetry between decomposition of changes in terms of ratios or differences The ability of the method to handle zero values Consistency in aggregation: decomposition exercises are usually conducted in a disaggregated level and consistency allows the results to be summed at an aggregated level. In the literature, a number of studies Let The above equation indicates that a change in Aggregate energy intensity changes, say from the base period 0 to the comparison period Differentiating both sides of Integrating both sides of The mean value theorem for integral allows us to rewrite Similarly, Equation Specifically for this paper, the following variables and terms are used:        Total industrial and agriculture energy efficiency: Change in total industrial and agriculture energy efficiency between year 0 and year Local sources are used to obtain the required data for this analysis. Sectoral and total energy consumption is derived from the The main source of information is Eskom, followed by the municipal power stations and other big industries. DoE does not conduct any independent surveys or regular data audits but relies on the credibility of the data providers and the National Energy Regulator (NERSA). A quality control process is in place involving a manual data check querying when inconsistencies are observed and a subsequent review process with major local and international organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) Balances are available up to year 2009 however the last couple of years may still be subject to correction and hence our sample includes the period from 1993 to 2006. The real economic output information per sector is obtained from the Quantec databases  As was expected for the South African economy that boomed from 1993 to 1994 onwards, the structural changes of the economy have played an important role in increasing the economy-wide energy efficiency. However, the energy usage's intensity was a contributing factor to the decreasing trend of energy efficiency. If it was not for the intensity improvements the energy efficiency would have been higher by 0.38 units for the period 1993 to 2006 (last row in The figures for the overall period (1993–2006) indicate that there was a decrease in the ratio of consumption over output by 0.37 (last row of The results are graphically illustrated in Through the years, the intensity effect was a decreasing force to the changes of energy efficiency while the structural changes “pushed” the changes higher. For example, during the periods 2002/03 and 2003/04 (as depicted in  The sector with the highest change in efficiency was ‘food and tobacco’. For this sector the structural effect on energy efficiency was positive (increasing the ratio of energy consumption/output). However, it was surpassed by the high negative intensity effect of −3.418. A sector that experienced an increasing intensity effect but a decreasing structural effect was ‘chemical and petrochemical’. During the studied period, if the structure of the economy had not changed the intensity of the sector would have been 0.136 higher. Another interesting example is the ‘non-metallic minerals’ sector: both factors were increasing driving forces to the sector's ratio of energy consumption over economic output. Exactly the opposite case was experienced by the ‘construction’ sector: both factors drove the ratio lower within the study period (1993–2006). Comparing these results with international decomposition analysis, it was found that for all the member countries of International Energy Agency, both structural and efficiency changes were contributing factors to the decreasing side of the energy intensity Looking at the only negative effect of the energy usage's intensity, it can be concluded that if the structure of the economy has not changed through the years, the energy intensity would probably be lower.  The objective of this paper is to identify the factors affecting the energy intensity of the South African economy. Identification of the underlying forces affecting energy intensity is a prerequisite for the development of appropriate policy. Such information is particularly useful in developing countries where the policy and regulatory authorities make decisions in a vacuum of relevant knowledge. For example, if the reason for high energy intensity of an economy is its structure and not its energy efficiency, it will be futile to focus efforts on the latter and ignore the issue of economic structure. In this context, it should be mentioned that China has introduced a differential power pricing policy designed to discourage energy intensive industries. Since 2004, the Chinese government classified the energy intensive industries, including electrolyte aluminum, ferroalloy, calcium carbide, caustic soda, cement, steel and others, into four categories – those to eliminate, those to discourage, those to allow and those to encourage The decomposition of the energy efficiency in South Africa is instructive. While the country's energy efficiency improves (energy is used more efficiently), structural changes move in the opposite direction. It should be noted here that the structure of the economy is an endogenous process which is not solely determined by the need to save energy but other factors as well responding to overall economic efficiency within a market paradigm. The relevant institutions in the country lack a consistent framework for planning the expansion, stability or discouragement of targeted industries. This lack of direction coupled with a lack of a differential energy pricing policy lead to structural changes which affect the country's energy efficiency adversely. To put it differently, publishing energy policies and setting energy efficiency targets have a limited effect as far as the underlying forces are not appropriately managed. Similarly, blanket price increases (the same across all sectors) not only do not optimise the price impact on the country's energy efficiency but may also lead to adverse consequences for the country's industrial structure, foreign direct investments and similar aspects. Additionally, the findings of the exercise particularly for the energy intensive sectors may also be related to the nature or features of the technology. Hence, besides a differentiated energy pricing regime, a higher contribution of renewable forms for the generation of energy might assist partially to tackle the problem. The sectoral decomposition of energy efficiency in the country confirms the above arguments. ‘Non-ferrous metals’ and ‘non-metallic minerals’ – two of the most energy intensive sectors – exhibit an adverse structural effect indicating an expansion in their activities during the period. The agricultural sector also presents the same trend with regards to the structural effect, although the intensity effect “pulls” the change of energy efficiency to the other direction. The identification of energy intensity per sector is also useful for policy development. Efforts to improve energy efficiency may be more productive in sectors with high energy intensity than in sectors with low energy intensity. As seen in
