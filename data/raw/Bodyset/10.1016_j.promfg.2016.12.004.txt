The addition of Ru to the weld metal of 316L austenitic stainless steel (ASS) by Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) button welds has shown superior mechanical properties. In the present investigation, the effect of Ru additions on the physical properties of 316L weld was evaluated by investigating the microstructural and mechanical properties of weld metal. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloyed button welds were analyzed using optical microscope, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX and Vickers hardness test respectively at 0.1%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% Ru addition. Primary ferrite (FA mode) solidification resulted in primary δ-ferrite and eutectic γ-austenite in the button welds, while hardness values increased to 198 HV with increasing Ru addition up to 2% Ru.
