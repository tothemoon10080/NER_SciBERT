The electrochemical measurement and surface analysis methods were employed to investigate the corrosion behavior of steel A3 influenced by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans (T.f). Polarization curve results indicated that the presence of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans resulted in higher corrosion potential of the electrode and obviously accelerated the corrosion current density. Atomic force microscope (AFM) results showed that asymmetric biofilms adhered to the surface of steel A3 after 7 days of exposure. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that pitting appeared on the surface of steel A3 after 7 days of exposure in T.f solution, which was induced by the metabolism of bacteria and the morphology of the deposit. Pitting holes of steel A3 in T.f solution were deeper after 20 days of exposure. The presence of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans aggravated the localized corrosion of A3 steel.
