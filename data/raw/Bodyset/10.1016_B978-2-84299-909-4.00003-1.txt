               Treatment of proximal ulnar fracture should be considered as a whole in elbow trauma. Understanding of anatomy and biomechanics are almost necessary to propose a well-staged procedure. The proximal ulna is a multidirectionnal stabilisator of the elbow. It participates in anteroposterior stability with the olecranocoronoid hook, but also in varus stability with the anteromedial facet of the coronoid. It acts in synergy with the radial head and the medial and lateral ligaments. The lesions concerning the proximal ulna should be correctly analyzed, focusing on the olecranon, the coronoid and a metaphyseal extension of the fracture. Identification of radial head fracture and dislocations of the radiocapitulum and proximal radioulnar joints should be identified. In isolated simple proximal ulna fracture, tension band wiring is the recommended technique, contoured plate is advocated for comminuted fractures. In cases of ulnar metaphyseal extension or associated lesions in the elbow, a plate is mandatory. In cases of coronoid brachial complex fracture, with an instable elbow and depending on the size and the localization of the fragment, sutures, wires or plates are recommended. Radial head fracture should not be resected. Osteosynthesis of the radial head or a prosthetic replacement restore the lateral stability of the elbow. Suture of the collateral lateral ligament and the extensor muscle on to the lateral epicondyle restore the posterolateral stability. At this stage, if the elbow is still unstable, a hinge external fixator and suture of the medial collateral ligament should be discussed. With respect to this protocol, early postoperative mobilization on a stable joint will give good functional results and lessen risk of complications.
