Quantum chemical calculation was used to estimate the reduction potentials of 25 organic cations and the oxidation potentials of 11 anions. This information was used to select promising cations and anions for the preparation of ionic liquids as green electrolytes for electrodeposition of active metals. The reasonable linear correlations between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies and the reduction potentials of cations, and the linear relationships between the oxidation potentials and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies of anions were obtained. The orders of electrochemical stability for cations and anions being obtained agree well with the experimental measurements. The suitable ionic liquids with sufficiently wide electrochemical windows for electrodeposition of active metals are suggested to be [Emim]NTf2, [Bmim]NTf2, [Bmim]BF4, [Bmim]PF6, [Bmim]CTf3, [Emim]BF4, [Emim]PF6, [Emim]CTf3..
