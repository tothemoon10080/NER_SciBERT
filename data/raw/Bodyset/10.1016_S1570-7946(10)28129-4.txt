Reactive extrusion involves complex interactions between operating parameters, flow conditions, material rheological behavior and reaction kinetics. Although reactive extrusion modelling has interested many authors, it still remains a challenge. We propose here a steady-state reactive extrusion model combining chemical engineering methods and simplified fluid mechanics laws. This steady-state model was derived from the dynamic model proposed by Choulak (2004). A rheo-kinetic model for a biopolymer oxidation process induced by coupled thermo mechanical and chemical effects was developed and integrated into the twin-screw extrusion model. This modelling approach enables to provide a predictive model involving very rapid calculation. The reactive extrusion model was then integrated into a static process simulator. The simulations reproduce available experimental data with a satisfying accuracy.
