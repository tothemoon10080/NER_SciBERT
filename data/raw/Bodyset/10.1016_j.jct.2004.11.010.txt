Activity coefficients of HCl in (hydrogen chloride+holmium chloride) (aq) have been calculated from the observed e.m.f.s using the Nernst equation. The temperatures ranged from (278.15 to 328.15) K at 5 K intervals and at constant total ionic strengths of (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) mol·kg−1. Electromotive-force measurements were made on the cell without liquid junction of the type:

                  The results of the activity coefficients of HCl for this mixed electrolyte mixture have been interpreted in terms of the simpler Harned’s equations and the ion-interaction model of Pitzer. Results show that the quadratic term is sufficient for the full range of Y
                     B (the ionic strength fraction of the salt) to 0.9 at all the ionic strengths studied. The Pitzer’s mixing parameters

                     ⩾0.05 mol·kg−1 over the entire temperature range.In recent years there has been a considerable amount of interest in the investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the mixed aqueous electrolyte solutions, particularly at high concentrations. The significance of this research project involving the chlorides of the lanthanide salts will be in the fields of (a) mineral solubility, (b) hydrometallurgy, (c) determination of the solubility, solubility product, and the hydrolysis constant of the lanthanide compounds; (d) test and advancement of the theory of mixed electrolyte solutions, and (e) detailed characterization of how the thermodynamic activities of asymmetric charge mixtures vary with the ionic radius of the metallic cation in the lanthanide series. Thus, it is very important to provide accurate thermodynamic data such as the mean molal activity coefficient of the components present in the mixture of strong electrolyte solutions. For the purpose of the predictions and calculations of the solubilities of inorganic species in aqueous mixtures of multicomponent and multivalent ionic solutions of high ionic strength, the availability of the accurate activity coefficient data in the literature is essential. Kim and Frederick It has been demonstrated in earlier studies that many mixed-electrolyte solutions in admixture with acids such as (HCl The properties of an electrolyte solution at finite concentration are dependent on the short-range forces between solute ions and of long-range electrostatic forces. Ion-interaction model of electrolyte solutions, developed by Pitzer and co-workers, Compounds of holmium and its alloys have found uses in lasers, computer monitors, and compact discs, etc. Activity coefficients of some pure aqueous rare-earth chloride solutions have been reported based on isopiestic measurements As a continuation of the previous investigations for mixed electrolyte systems with a common ion such as (HCl In the experimental determinations of the activity coefficients of aqueous mixed electrolyte solutions, precise electromotive force methods have been used since these methods give the activity coefficients of at least one of the solutes directly. The electromotive-force method was chosen to determine the activity coefficients of HCl in (hydrogen chloride Reagent grade hydrochloric acid was distilled twice. Two different hydrochloric acid stock solutions ( The standard potentials The e.m.f. measurements were made first at Hydrogen fugacity corrections were made due to the contributions of the water vapor to the total pressure in the cells. For each experimental cell solution, the hydrogen fugacity was calculated from the activity of water and the atmospheric pressure. Solutions with a total ionic strength of mixed electrolytes of (0.01 to 1.5) mol Harned’s equations describe that at constant total ionic strength, the variation of the logarithm of the activity coefficient The comprehensive ion-interaction theory of Pitzer In equations Although various approaches to treat the experimental data for unsymmetrical mixed electrolytes are available in the literature The unsymmetrical mixing coefficients have the forms: In order to estimate the values of the higher order mixing terms The mixed-electrolyte interaction parameters along with standard deviation of the fit for (hydrogen chloride These results for rare-earth ions can be used to determine reasonable predictions (estimates) of the activity coefficients for similar systems not studied yet. Thus the Pitzer model can successfully be used for the calculations of the solubility of salts in brines to a higher ionic strength of (10 to 15) mol The authors acknowledge the support of the Petroleum Research Fund administered by the American Chemical Society ACS-PRF No. 39713-B3.
