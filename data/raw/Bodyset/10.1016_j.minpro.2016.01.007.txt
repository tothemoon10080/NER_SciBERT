This paper introduces an application of chlorination roasting process followed by hot-acidulous water leaching that could cause a high extraction selectivity of Ni, Co and Mn over Fe and Mg which can concentrate Ni and Co in laterite ores. Thermodynamic analysis of possible chlorination reactions in roasting process was calculated and the Predominance Area Diagram of Ni–Co–Cl–H–O was shown to indicate the effect of partial pressure of HCl and H2O on the stability of NiCl2 and CoCl2. The mixture of NaCl and MgCl2·6H2O was selected as chloride agent and the chlorination mechanism was discussed comprehensively. The results show that the leaching rates of Ni, Co, Mn, Fe and Mg are 87%, 58%, 53%, 3.2% and 5.4% respectively at the optimal conditions, which showed that Ni, Co and Mn could be extracted effectively and the extraction of Fe and Mg was suppressed simultaneously. The Ni/Fe ratio and Ni/Mg ratio can reach 0.97% and 0.25% in leaching solution which can increase 15 times and 8 times respectively in comparison with the Ni/Fe and Ni/Mg ratio in raw ore.As a result of escalating mining costs, depleting sulfide reserves, and continuously increasing world demand for nickel, nickeliferrous laterite ores have become the major source of production of nickel as it hosts most of the world's terrestrial nickel resources, comprising about 60% of the total 130 Chlorination metallurgy is characterized by the high reactivity of chlorine, the high volatility and low melting point of metal chloride, and the big differences in the formation of different metal chlorides ( Therefore, chlorination roasting of laterite has continued to remain a subject of interest since it produces soluble chloride of valuable metals with simultaneous rejection of iron and magnesium, and the products of nickel chloride and cobalt chloride can be used as the principal commercial chemicals ( To explore a simple, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly chlorination roasting process for low-grade laterite, more solid chloride agents must be used to extract valuable metals and the chlorination mechanism should be researched comprehensively. In this present research, sodium chloride and magnesium chloride mixed together were used as solid chloride agent due to their popular application, low price and low melting point. This investigation mainly focused on the extraction of valuable metals from laterite ore and the rejection of impurity metals during the selective chlorination process. Various parameters were studied including different solid chloride agents, chloride agent quantity, chlorination temperature, chlorination time and particle size of the sample. A limonite laterite ore from Yunnan province in China were ground to 100% passing 100 The main valuable metals of nickel and cobalt distributing in different minerals, such as goethite, limonite, sulfite, lizardite and etc., are shown in The ore weighed 8 The volumetric method (K The quantitative parameters applied in evaluating the extraction rate of valuable metals and selectivity between valuable metals and impurity metals are the leaching rate, and Ni/Fe and Ni/Mg ratios. The leaching rate is the amount of metals in leaching solution divided by the amount of metals in raw ore. The Ni/Fe and Ni/Mg ratios are the amount of Ni divided by the amounts of Fe and Mg in leaching solution respectively. Contrasted with the original ratios of Ni/Fe and Ni/Mg in raw ore, it is easy to prove the selectivity in this chlorination roasting process. The chemistry of solid salt chlorination roasting is very complex because several processes such as oxidation, decomposition, in situ chlorination and evaporation of volatile species occur either simultaneously or sequentially. The thermodynamic analysis of various possible reactions that could occur during the chlorination roasting of laterite using NaCl and MgCl On the basis of thermodynamic calculation (  Except for 2MnO The effect of different chloride agents about NaCl, MgCl  It can be seen in It is very interesting that the mixture of NaCl and MgCl The quantity of NaCl and MgCl It can be seen in The effect of temperature in the range of 873 to 1273  To investigate the effect of the roasting time on leaching rate, a series of experiments were performed, and the results are shown in  The effect of particle size on the leaching rate and Ni/Fe ratio and Ni/Mg ratio is shown in The decrease of particle size can increase the reaction area which is helpful for gas–solid phase reaction and increase the leaching rate for all metals. It can be seen in Based on thermodynamic analysis, the chlorination roasting experiments with NaCl and MgCl The project was sponsored by
