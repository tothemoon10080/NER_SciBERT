Using melt infiltration casting at different temperatures (965, 990 and 1015 °C) for different time (10 and 15 min), the composites of (Cu50Zr43Al7)99.5Si0.5 bulk metallic glass reinforced with tungsten wires were produced. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quasi-static compression tests were carried out to evaluate the microstructure and mechanical properties. The results show that the maximum ultimate compressive strength and strain-to-failure of about 1880 MPa and 16.7% were achieved, respectively, at the infiltration temperature of 965 °C for 15 min.
