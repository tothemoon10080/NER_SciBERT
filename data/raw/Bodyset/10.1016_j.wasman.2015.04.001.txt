The current work reports on a new approach for copper bioleaching from Printed Circuit Board (PCB) by moderate thermophiles in a rotating-drum reactor. Initially leaching of PCB was carried out in shake flasks to assess the effects of particle size (−208μm+147μm), ferrous iron concentration (1.25–10.0g/L) and pH (1.5–2.5) on copper leaching using mesophile and moderate thermophile microorganisms. Only at a relatively low solid content (10.0g/L) complete copper extraction was achieved from the particle size investigated. Conversely, high copper extractions were possible from coarse-ground PCB (20mm-long) working with increased solids concentration (up to 25.0g/L). Because there was as the faster leaching kinetics at 50°C Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was selected for experiments in a rotating-drum reactor with the coarser-sized PCB sheets. Under optimal conditions, copper extraction reached 85%, in 8days and microscopic observations by SEM–EDS of the on non-leached and leached material suggested that metal dissolution from the internal layers was restricted by the fact that metal surface was not entirely available and accessible for the solution in the case of the 20mm-size sheets.Technological innovations have stimulated widespread utilization of electronic equipment, which has also resulted in a considerable increase in the generation of electronic waste (e-waste). Incineration and landfilling are often the ways to deal with electronic waste ( Pyrometallurgy is particularly appropriate to recover copper and precious metals from some type of electronic waste such as mobile phones, but the technique requires high grade feed and thus is not suitable for low grade e-wastes, including PCB. Moreover, pyrometallurgy is related to some environmental impacts such as greenhouse gases, formation of furans and dioxins and dust ( Bio-hydrometallurgy is a specialized branch of hydrometallurgy that utilizes microorganisms to solubilize metals and therefore is often viewed as eco-friendly process for the treatment of low-grade ores and wastes ( In addition to these two bacterial genera thermophilic microorganisms may also be employed in bioleaching operations ( The reactors used in the bioleaching of sulfides are generally designed as stirred tank or air-lift type but concerning e-waste bioleaching there is a limited data about the type of reactor on process performance. A rotating-drum reactor could be suggested as alternative to the stirred-tank reactors with the potential advantage to treat material at increased pulp densities and reduce global energy consumption. It could be assumed that such a reactor will ensure reduced impact on the microbial cells due to the lower degree of collisions between the particles ( The feasibility of copper bioleaching from fine milled PCB at low solids concentrations (up to 10.0 With the above mentioned concerns in the background, the current work proposes a different approach to PCB bioleaching, in which relatively coarse PCB sheets are leached without reducing their size down to the micrometer scale. The objective is to avoid useless overgrinding and hence reduce the overall cost associated with the fragmentation step. Another aim is to discuss the bacterial adaptation to increased PCB content and to find out the optimal pH and ferrous iron concentration for bioleaching using moderate thermophiles in a rotating-drum reactor. The experiments were carried out with PCB collected from obsolete desktop computers, from which all electronic components such as capacitors and resistors were manually removed in advance. At the beginning, the dismantled boards were shredded using a metal guillotine to obtain nearly rectangular PCB fragments with 20 The mesophile microorganisms utilized in the current study were isolated from a Brazilian sulfide mine, for which microbial diversity studies revealed the predominance of Prior to the bioleaching experiments, the two bacterial strains were inoculated to both crushed (−208 Bioleaching of ground PCB was carried out in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks placed in a thermostated shaker (New Brunswick Innova 44) at the Bio and hydrometallurgy laboratory of the Federal University of Ouro Preto (Brazil). Both mesophile and moderate thermophile cultures were tested under the procedure described in Section Another series of bioleaching experiments were performed batchwise with the 20 The experiments were performed at rotation speed of 80 Metal concentration in the solid PCB was determined by inductively coupled plasma -atomic emission spectrometry (ICP–AES) – Varian Series II, following sample (1.0 Ferrous iron was assayed by titration with standard potassium dichromate solution in the presence of a 1 The heterogeneous composition of PCB sheets, which contain metals, polymers and ceramics ( After adaptation to ground PCB, an Eh increase was observed in the presence of 10.0 It is acknowledged that dissolution of metallic copper requires an oxidizing agent as suggested by Eq. Ferrous iron bio-oxidation plays a key role in copper dissolution as suggested by the low copper extraction in the control experiments (control tests) performed in the presence and absence of ferrous ions ( Although bioleaching could be performed in the presence of 10.0 With PCB sheets  To explain the phenomena observed during PCB bioleaching, microscopic observations of PCB samples before and during bioleaching were carried out. The dissolution of copper before and after PCB “pre-weakening” by means of a jaw crusher can be seen in the SEM images 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. Cracks introduced in the PCB resulted in an improvement in copper extraction by facilitating solution diffusion toward the inner PCB layers ( For the PCB sample submitted to both jaw crushing and lacquer removal, further tests assessed the effect of the initial ferrous iron concentration on copper leaching as shown in It is known that bacterial growth and substrate utilization are influenced by pH solution ( The effect of ferrous iron concentration on copper bioleaching inside the rotating-drum reactor was investigated in the presence of  As mentioned above, the highest degree of copper extraction corresponding to 85% was reached after seven days for the test performed with 5.0 Experiments with 5.0 As expected, the redox potential was lower in the control experiment – The evolution of both pH and acid consumption was also monitored. The results depicted in The experimental conditions in the rotating-drum reactor enabled an accurate determination of acid consumption during bioleaching. Addition of sulfuric acid was required to keep pH within the targeted value of 1.75 The technology proposed herein would be best suited for either small scale operations or residues with low copper content. As bioleaching has been industrially applied to the processing of refractory gold ores (gold locked inside pyrite grains) and copper sulfides the scale-up of such a biotechnology is feasible and a cost effective industrial application is forecasted. Nevertheless, future work is required to address such issues. Another interesting aspect would be to investigate the potential of using bioelectrochemistry to recovery copper from the solution purification.
