Abstract
                  Red mud is the waste of alumina industry and has high TiO2 and Fe2O3 content which are active components for the adsorption of anion pollutants. In this study, the uptake of phosphate by red mud activated by heat treatment and acid-heat treatment was investigated. The factors influencing the adsorption were also investigated. The result showed that the red mud sample treated using acid-heat method at 80°C with 0.25 mol/L HCl for 2 h achieved the highest phosphate removal. For the heat-activated red mud, the sample heated at 700°C for 2 h preformed better than the other heat treatment. Phosphate removal by the activated red mud was significantly pH dependent, and pH 7 was the optimal pH for phosphate removal. The adsorption fits Langmuir isotherm model well and the maximum adsorption capacities of the acid-heat activated red mud and the heat activated samples were 202.9 mgP/g and 155.2 mgP/g, respectively.
