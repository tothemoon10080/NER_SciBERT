Bi-Pb alloys are promising heat transfer fluid candidates for fast-neutron nuclear reactors and concentrating solar power systems. The thermodynamic properties of Bi-Pb alloys can be calculated effectively by using thermodynamic models. The molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) has been widely applied in research on the thermodynamics of metallic melt in recent years. In this paper, the thermodynamic properties of liquid Bi-Pb alloys were examined by using the electromotive force method. The partial and integral thermodynamic parameters of the system were calculated from the electromotive force. The activities and infinite dilution activity coefficient of Bi-Pb alloys at various temperatures were also calculated by the MIVM. A comparison between the experimental results and the theoretical results showed that the theoretical results are close to the experimental results and that the MIVM can be used for the thermodynamic calculation of lead-bismuth-based alloys.
