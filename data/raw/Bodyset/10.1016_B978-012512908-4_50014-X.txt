Metal deposits are largely employed in microelectronics, for optical devices, in cosmic and atomic technology, in galvanotechnique, and in other fields. Their numerous practical applications are based on the possibility of depositing metal films with a favorable combination of their functional properties. In addition, there is also the possibility to prepare metal deposits with particular physical and mechanical properties, which substantially differ from those of the same metals in their usual massive state. These possibilities offer the opportunity for improving the physical and technical parameters of materials and devices and for promoting new technical branches. To reproduce the overall mechanism of formation of the structure of the deposits, it is necessary to examine all the consecutive steps of their growth. In the case of the heterogeneous crystallization on a foreign substrate, two main growth steps of the deposits may be considered in connection with the formation of the different structural defects. They are the initial nucleation step and the subsequent deposit growth step “in thickness.” The initial crystallization step includes the formation of the nuclei on the substrate—their lateral growth until a thin compact deposit layer is produced.
