In this paper, any two of the three anticorrosion agents, that is emulsifier (OP-10), soluble glass (Na2O Â· nSiO2) and glycerin (C3H8O3), were treated simultaneously on the surface of amorphous (a -) MgNi + 5% Ml2Mg17(Ml denotes the lanthanum-rich mish metal) electrode and the electrolyte. Effect of the synergistic anticorrosion treatment on charging/discharging cycle stability of the electrode was investigated. Contrasted with single treatment method, the cycling stability of the electrodes was further improved. The desirable synergistic anticorrosion method was that the electrode was treated by the soluble glass, and that OP-10 was added into the electrolyte. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) results of the electrode show clearly that the anticorrosion agent can change the electrochemical activity and mechanism of the electrode. The concentration of the anticorrosion agent in the electrolyte treated by the synergistic anticorrosion method was also investigated. The appropriate concentration of the anticorrosion agents in the electrolyte is 0.143 %.
