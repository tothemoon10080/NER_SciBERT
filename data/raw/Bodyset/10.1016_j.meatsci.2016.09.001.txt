Low-fat Bologna-type sausages were produced with 50% of NaCl replaced by KCl and with addition of lysine and/or liquid smoke as flavor enhancers. The influence of sodium reduction on technological, physicochemical, and microbiological properties was determined. In addition, the sensory properties were evaluated using a Check all that apply questionnaire (CATA) and a consumer study. The partial replacement of NaCl by KCl did not have negative impacts on physicochemical, technological, and microbiological properties. However, the addition of KCl affected the sensory acceptance, as consumers identified by CATA questionnaire a reduction in salty taste and an increase in bitter, astringent, and metallic taste. The isolated or combined addition of lysine and liquid smoke reduced the sensory quality defects caused by the addition of KCl. Therefore, high quality low-fat Bologna-type sausages with sodium reduction close to 50% can be produced by replacing 50% NaCl by KCl and with addition of 1% lysine and/or 0.1% liquid smoke.Excessive consumption of fat and sodium is a risk factor for the onset of cardiovascular diseases ( Bologna-type sausages are emulsified meat products that traditionally contain from 20 to 35% fat and 2.2 to 2.5% salt ( However, sodium reduction is particularly difficult because it necessarily involves removing or partially replacing NaCl levels, which is the main source of sodium in meat products ( Several strategies have been used to reduce sodium in meat products. Many studies have reported that the partial replacement of NaCl by KCl is one of the best alternatives to reduce the sodium content in meat products ( Given the above, to provide healthy characteristics, Bologna-type sausages were prepared with approximately 50% of fat and sodium found in commercial products. To reduce the fat content, a formulation optimized in previous studies was used ( Four low-fat Bologna-type sausages were prepared with partial sodium chloride reduction (50%) followed by substitution with combinations of potassium chloride: KCl (1.25% NaCl, and 1.25% KCl), Lys (1.25% NaCl, 1.25% KCl, and 1% lysine), LS (1.25% NaCl, 1.25% KCl, and 0.1% smoke liquid) and Lys Three independent replicates of each batch were prepared in three different days. A total of 10 Cooking loss was determined in five replicates for each treatment according to the methodology proposed by Emulsion stability was determined in five replicates for each treatment using the methodology proposed by Texture profile analysis (TPA) was carried out using a TA-TX2 Texture Analyzer (Stable Micro Systems Ltd., Surrey, England) with a load cell of 25 Fat, moisture, protein and ash contents were analyzed in triplicate using three sausages per treatment according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists ( The pH was measured using a pH MA-130 Color measurements were performed in a Minolta CR-400 colorimeter (Konica Minolta Sensing Inc., Japan), according to CIE L* a* b* system, using spectral reflectance included as calibration mode, illuminant D65, and observation angle of 10°. The color variables were measured at four points on the central part of the cut surface of three slices of the samples. L*, a*, and b* values were determined as indicators of lightness, redness, and yellowness, respectively. Whiteness was calculated from the L*, a*, and b* values as described by Whiteness The calculation of ΔE was made with the following equation: ΔE Sample portions (25 This study was approved by the Ethics in Research Committee of the University of Uberlândia (MG, Brazil) under protocol number 42469614.0.0000.5152. A three-digit code has been assigned to the samples, which were evaluated by each consumer in a monadic order, following a balanced design as described by A total of 100 consumers (60% male, 40% female, aged 18–54) that regularly consumed Bologna-type sausages were recruited among students and staff of the Federal Institute of Education (Uberlândia, Brasil). The color, aroma, flavor, texture, and overall acceptability were evaluated using a non-structured nine-point hedonic scale, with 1 being extremely disliked and 9 extremely liked ( A randomized complete block design was adopted and the entire experiment was replicated three times on three different days. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the generalized linear models was performed to analyze the technological, physicochemical, and microbiological data, considering the treatments as a fixed effect, and the experiment replications as a random term ( Analysis of correspondence was used to analyze data from CATA questionnaire, considering the chi-square distance ( The physicochemical and technological characteristics of the low-sodium and low-fat Bologna-type sausages are shown in The emulsion stability of the low-sodium and low-fat Bologna-type sausages was analyzed by % water and fat released ( In emulsified meat products such as Bologna-type sausages, the texture is one of the most important sensory attributes and is directly linked to the fat and water-holding capacities of the meat matrix, which in turn, are influenced by the ionic strength and functional properties of the proteins ( Springiness refers to the degree of recovery of cylinder sample height ( The use of KCl as salt substitute as well as the addition of lysine and liquid smoke did not significantly ( The sodium and potassium levels in the Bologna-type sausages were consistent with the addition levels of NaCl and KCl in each formulation ( The pH and aw values were considered acceptable for this type of meat product ( The replacement of 50% NaCl by KCl did not significantly ( The microbiological quality of low-salt meat products has been widely studied once the safety of these products can be affected by the increased Aw, which favors microbial growth. In this study, total coliforms, coagulase positive staphylococci, The analysis of correspondence to evaluate the descriptors generated by CATA questionnaire explained 94.14% of the total variation of the data, being 73.04% and 21.10% in the first and second dimensions, respectively ( The second group formed by the control and the Lys treatments was mainly characterized by the descriptors: characteristic aroma, soft, salty taste, brightness, fatty aroma, spice aroma, and characteristic taste. The Bologna-type sausages containing liquid smoke (LS and Lys The results of consumer test of low-fat and low-sodium Bologna-type sausages are presented in For aroma and flavor, considered crucial for reduced-sodium in low-fat Bologna sausages formulations, the treatment with the lowest scores was the KCl formulation (1.5% NaCl and 1.5% KCl). Treatments Lys (1.25% NaCl, 1.25% KCl, and 1% lysine), LS (1.25% NaCl, 1.25% KCl, and 0.1% smoke liquid) and Lys The overall acceptance followed the same tendencies reported for the other sensorial attributes since the KCl formulation (1.5% NaCl and 1.5% KCl) had the lowest score. The lower sensory acceptability observed in the treatment with KCl may be due to the descriptors that discriminate this sample in CATA questionnaire ( The present study showed that the replacement of 50% NaCl by KCl did not have negative impacts on technological, physicochemical, and microbiological properties of low-fat Bologna-type sausages. However, the replacement of NaCl by KCl affected the sensory quality by reducing the salty taste and conferring a bitter, astringent, and metallic taste. The addition of lysine and/or liquid smoke was able to suppress the undesirable sensory defects caused by KCl, enabling the elaboration of sensorial acceptable low-fat Bologna-type sausages, with a sodium reduction close to 50%.
