To reduce cost and secondary pollution of spent lithium ion battery (LIB) recycling caused by complicated separation and purification, a novel simplified recycling process is investigated in this paper. Removal of magnesium is a common issue in hydrometallurgy process. Considering magnesium as an important additive in LIB modification, tolerant level of magnesium in leachate is explored as well. Based on the novel recycling technology, Li[(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)1−x

                     ≤0.05) cathode materials are achieved from spent LIB. Tests of XRD, SEM, TG-DTA and so on are carried out to evaluate material properties. Electrochemical test shows an initial charge and discharge capacity of the regenerated LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 to be 175.4mAhg−1 and 152.7mAhg−1 (2.7–4.3V, 0.2C), respectively. The capacity remains 94% of the original value after 50 cycles (2.7–4.3V, 1C). Results indicate that presence of magnesium up to x
                     =0.01 has no significant impact on overall performance of Li[(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)1−x

                     ]O2. As a result, magnesium level as high as 360mgL−1 in leachate remains tolerable. Compared with conventional limitation of magnesium content, the elimination level of magnesium exceeded general impurity-removal requirement.Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively used as electrochemical power sources for portable electronic devices due to their outstanding electrochemical performances. With the development of these portable electronic products, the worldwide consumption of LIBs has increased tremendously. Total worldwide rechargeable batteries production is estimated to be 7.0 billion in 2015 Lithium cobalt oxide is the first commercial cathode material available in the market. Lots of research has been carried out to recover metal values such as cobalt and lithium from LiCoO Nevertheless, traditional LiCoO It is worthy noted that cathode materials used for commercial LIBs are not always pure compound. Significant electric drive vehicle technology growth is to be expected in the next 10 years while batteries will be the key factor to achieve essential progress in electric vehicle. As a result, application of Li-ion batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles is expected to increase significantly for the next decades. Extensive application and scale effect of LIBs in HEV and PHEV demands for high power and safety stability batteries as well as lower cost, which has led to the utilization of mixed cathode materials Furthermore, as we all know, impurities in feed influence recovered product quality significantly thus purification process is an essential step of an overall recycling route. From the viewpoint of expanded reproduction and industrialization, price of impurity removal procedure constitutes a major cost of whole recovery process and must be given particular consideration for a large-scale application. Magnesium has been used as a modification ingredient in design of improved cathode materials, which also compromises a common impurity source of battery waste. On one hand, Mg In this paper, a novel recycling technology to regenerate LiNi An overall recycling route proposed to treat spent LIBs is shown in Recycling process consists of thermal treatment, crushing, ball milling, sieving, secondary alkaline leaching, secondary acid leaching and purification. It is applied to preparation of a regenerated solution with enriched transition metal ions from spent lithium-ion batteries. There are three approaches proposed to deal with the purified leaching liquor. Compound of NiSO The gravimetric titration method with dimethylglyoxime was used to determine concentration of nickel; the aluminum content was determined by standard zinc solution titration with EDTA; cobalt concentration was determined by the 722S-type spectrophotometer; iodometric method was used to determine concentration of copper; the manganese content was determined by potentiometer titration with potassium hypermanganate based on oxidization–reduction principle X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected on a Rigaku Ru-200 power diffractometer (Japan), with Cu Kα radiation in the 2  D2EHPA is used as extractant to further remove impurities after chemical deposition and neutralization. According to the pH influence on metal ions extraction from a sulfuric solution using D2EHPA as extractant The whole recycling route comprises the main steps schematically shown in Elemental analysis shows that the regenerated cathode material synthesized directly from the purified leaching liquor is pure compound of Li[Ni The allowable level of magnesium in regenerated Li[Ni To ensure that impurities in recovered product are limited to required specification without sacrificing the recovery efficiency of major elements, a series of synthesis were conducted via controlled-crystallization and solid state sintering by adding a varying amount of Mg The thermal behavior of the obtained (Ni Three endothermic peaks are observed in DSC curve, corresponding to three apparent weight loss stages in TG curve. The initial endothermic peak (1) shows up over the temperature range between 100 and 200 Based on results above, (Ni Crystal structure of all samples is investigated by X-ray diffraction. The XRD pattern of the recovered product is shown in As shown in SEM (scanning electron microscope) of the product at different magnifications is shown in As seen in The SEM micrographs of Li[(Ni The electrochemical behaviors are investigated by capacity measurement and charging–discharging performance. The voltage vs. capacity profiles within a potential window of 2.7–4.3  Variable valence of impurity ions in leaching solution is often not available, which means that those impurity ions are always electrochemically inactive. Presence of Mg As can be implied from the measurements of XRD, SEM and electrochemical properties, low content of Mg in Li[(Ni From the work presented above, following conclusions can be drawn: The cathode active material of Li(Ni The electrochemical property of the regenerated Li(Ni XRD showed that Mg successfully replaced Co within the layered structure. All of the Li[(Ni The regeneration technology developed in this study could be of some practical benefits since it is feasible for large-scale treatment by rather efficient and easily achievable operations. Furthermore, based on the projected quantities of lithium ion batteries available for recycling in the next few years, there is a considerable market opportunity for this technology to be applied further into the disposal of hybrid batteries and other cobalt/nickel scraps without sophisticated impurities removing steps.
