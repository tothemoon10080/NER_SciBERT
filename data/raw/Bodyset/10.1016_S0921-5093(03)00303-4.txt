The influence of austenitisation temperature on the structure and properties of three experimental weather resistant steels has been studied. All these steels contain 1% Mn, 0.3% Ni, 0.47% Cr and 0.47% Cu. In addition, steel #1 has 0.1% C, 0.1% P, steel #2 has 0.1% C, 0.05% P and 0.024% Nb while steel 3 has 0.2% C, 0.054% Nb and 0.046% V. It has been found that the hardness, yield strength and tensile strength do not change significantly with austenitisation temperature over the range 900–1200°C for steel #1 but they increase considerably when austenitised above 1000°C for steels 2 and 3. Similarly, the ductility decreases with increasing temperature of austenitisation. All the steels austenitised up to 1000°C exhibit sharp yield points. None of these steels shows sharp yield point after 1200°C. At 1100°C, however, sharp yield points were observed in steels 1 and 2. There has been a noticeable change in optical microstructure. In steels 2 and 3 the pearlite is gradually replaced by granular bainite when austenitised above 1000°C. The transmission electron microscopy study reveals that the granular bainite consists of acicular ferrite and martensite/austenite constituent.Weather resistant steels are high strength low alloy steels (HSLA), generally alloyed with Cu, P, Cr and Ni. When there is no P addition, V (∼0.04%) is added for precipitation strengthening to compensate for the strong solid solution strengthening provided by phosphorus. These alloying elements serve the dual purpose of promoting a protective layer which prevents the steel from further rusting and also of providing increased hardness and strength to the steel The microstructure of these weather resistant steels consists of ferrite and pearlite and for strengthening one has to rely mainly on ferrite grain refinement, solid solution and/or precipitation hardening. Consequently, these ferrite–pearlite steels are unable to attain higher levels of strength. On the other hand, the potential effect of microalloying by Nb with more Mn (1% instead of 0.45% in conventional weathering steels) on the decomposition of austenite and the associated strengthening mechanisms (grain refining and precipitation hardening) could improve their properties to extend their application to some other vital areas. It is well established that Mn, Mo and Cr additions along with microalloying by Nb and B increase bainitic hardenability The present investigation evaluates the effects of chemical composition as well as that of the austenitizing temperature on the structure and properties of three experimental weather resistant steels. All these steels contain 1% Mn, 0.3% Ni, 0.47% Cr, and 0.47% Cu. In addition, steel 1 has 0.1% C and 0.1% P, steel 2 has 0.1% C, 0.05% P and 0.024% Nb while steel 3 has 0.2% C, 0.054% Nb and 0.046% V. These are austenitised at various temperatures in the range 900–1200 A batch of three steels (designated as steels 1, 2 and 3 in Samples of 150×25×12 mm were cut from the rolled plates for heat treatment. These samples were austenitized at 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200 The specimens were mechanically polished and etched with 2% nital. Optical microstructures of the steels were observed with a NEOPHOT metallograph. Specimens for transmission electron micrograph (TEM) study were cut by slicing 0.1-mm thick discs in a Buehler's Isomet slow speed saw. The slices were mechanically thinned to 0.05 mm thickness and electrolytically polished at 30 V using a solution of 95% acetic acid and 5% perchloric acid maintained in a twin jet polisher at −10 The tensile properties were evaluated using an Instron machine (model 1273) at constant cross head speed of 2 mm min Hardness measurements of the steel specimens were carried out using Vickers Hardness Testing Machine using 30 kg load. An average value of the measurements at 4 different points in each specimen was taken. The variation of tensile properties (yield strength, YS; ultimate tensile strength, UTS and % El) with austenitizing temperature is shown in The stress–strain curves of all the three steels exhibited sharp yield points after austenitisation at 900 and 1000 The Vickers hardness number (VHN) of the three steels has been plotted against austenitizing temperature in The optical microstructures of the three steels at the different austenitizing temperatures of 900, 1000, 1100 and 1200 After austenitisation at 1100 The TEMs of steel 1 after austenitisation at 1000, 1100 and 1200 In the case of steel 2 austenitised at 1000 The TEMs of steel 3 austenitised at 1000 The present investigation shows that the YS of steel 2 is significantly higher than that of steel 1 when austenitized at any temperature in the range 900–1200 Normally, it is expected that the YS would decrease with increasing austenitizing temperature due to grain coarsening. But on the contrary, Nb microalloying in the weather resistant steel has resulted in an increase in strength on austenitization at higher temperatures. This unusual result can be explained with the help of optical and TEM studies. The microstructure at 900 The synergistic effect of Nb and B in granular bainite formation has been well established But with the increase in austenitizing temperature, Nb(C,N) gets dissolved. The following The Nb in solution causes a large effect on depression of transformation temperature as well as hardenability. It was reported that for every 10 Steel 3 has 0.2% C, 0.054% Nb and 0.046% V in contrast to 0.11% C and 0.024% Nb in steel 2 (the Mn, Ni, Cu and Cr contents are the same in steels 2 and 3). The higher C, Nb and V in this steel is expected to result in higher strength compared to steels 1 and 2. The volume fraction of pearlite is higher due to higher C in this steel when austenitised at 900 The tensile ductility as measured by the elongation has been found to decrease with austenitisation temperature in all the three steels. This is attributed to the replacement of ferrite–pearlite structure with acicular ferrite–bainite or M/A constituent and also an increase in austenitic grain size with increase in austenitizing temperature. Steel 3 has the lowest % El as it has the highest carbon with higher Nb and V which together result in higher amounts of harder bainite, M/A constituent and finer precipitates. The insignificant effect of austenitizing temperature on hardness of steel #1 ( The following conclusions may be drawn based on the present investigation on three experimental weather resistant steels: (1) There has been a noticeable change in the optical microstructure with austenitisation temperature. All the steels exhibit ferrite and pearlite at 900 (2) The hardness, YS and tensile strength do not change significantly with austenitisation temperature over the range 900–1200 (3) All the steels exhibit sharp yield point when the microstructure is predominantly ferrite–pearlite up to 1000 (4) The transmission electron microscopy study reveals that the granular bainite consists of acicular ferrite M/A constituent.
