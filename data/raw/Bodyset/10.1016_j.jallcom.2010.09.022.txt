Metallic cobalt microspheres have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method in the presence of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), and the diameters of these spheres are in the range of 1–2μm. Bimetallic Co/Pt microspheres and hollow noble metal Pt microspheres have also been selectively synthesized by adjusting the amount of reactants of replacement reaction in which corresponding noble metal compound and metallic cobalt microspheres are used as starting materials. The study on catalytic activities of the as-prepared metallic microspheres on hydrolysis of ammonia-borane for hydrogen generation reveals that Co/Pt (molar ratio 5:1) bimetallic microspheres are far more active than the hollow noble metal Pt microspheres.Ammonia-borane (H Recently, various catalysts for promoting the hydrolysis of NH Various methods have been successfully applied to the synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles and hollow noble metallic materials Herein, we demonstrate a facile synthesis strategy for fabricating metallic cobalt microspheres via a direct reduction of cobalt(II) chloride by hydrazine hydrate in the presence of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP) stabilizer in ethylene glycol solution. PVP-stabilized cobalt(0) nanoclusters are found to be stable in solution, highly active and long-lived in hydrolyses of ammonia-borane. The direct reduction route provides a new method for large-scale synthesis of metallic cobalt spheres and other metallic spheres. On the basis of replacement reaction, bimetallic (Co/Pt) and noble metal (Pt) spheres have also been obtained as corresponding noble metal compounds interacting with as-prepared metallic cobalt spheres. The investigation on catalytic activities of hollow noble metal and bimetallic spheres reveals the superior catalytic activities of Co/Pt bimetallic spheres for hydrogen generation, respectively. Ammonia-borane (NH 1 As-prepared metallic Co spheres (1 The hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH The obtained samples were characterized on a Rigaku Dmax-2000 X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD) with Cu Kα radiation ( X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to determine the chemical composition and crystallinity of the as-prepared products. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis ( The Co/Pt bimetallic spheres and hollow Pt spheres are obtained by replacement reaction between metallic Co spheres and the chloroplatinic acid. The driving force of those reactions comes from the large standard reduction potential gap between the Co  The SEM images of the as-prepared Pt samples are shown in The catalytic activities of the as-prepared spheres for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane (NH In summary, metallic cobalt microspheres have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method in the presence of poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP), and the diameters of these spheres are in the range of 1–2 This work was supported by the
