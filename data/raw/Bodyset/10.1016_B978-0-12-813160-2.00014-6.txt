Through its different operations, the hydrocarbon industry (and particularly refineries), produces effluents containing highly toxic compounds (phenols and sulfurs, among others). Thus, in the transformation of crude oil, >2500 final products are produced such as liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, gasoil, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel, lubricating oils, and petrochemical raw materials. All of these are obtained through separation processes (initial desalination, atmospheric distillation, and vacuum distillation), conversion (catalytic and thermal cracking, catalytic and steam reforming, isomerization, alkylation, and lubricating oils production), and treatment (naphthas and diesel desulfurization, sour water, and catalyst regeneration). The production of fuel oil and gasoline, among others, leads to different configurations of plants and process units, which also allows for the classification of refineries as simple, complex, or very complex. In this context, obtaining the different products leads to the production of effluents containing biorefractory compound that cannot be treated through biological methods. Because of this, the use of electrochemical processes has proven to be an excellent option. That is why, in this chapter, we will address the use of electrooxidation (EO) using metal oxide electrodes with Ti as a substrate (Ti/MO
                     x
                  ) as well as boron doped diamond (BDD) electrodes to eliminate phenol and phenolic compounds. Even though the different refinery process units can produce different types of effluents, in this chapter we will only discuss the main research reported in the literature as well as that obtained in our group regarding water produced, spent caustic, and desalter effluent.              Through its different operations, the hydrocarbon industry (and particularly refineries), produces effluents containing highly toxic compounds (phenols and sulfurs, among others). Thus, in the transformation of crude oil, > The average water consumption in oil refining is 294 In general, the wastewater produced in refineries can contain levels of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD As previously stated, phenols and phenolic compounds are among the main pollutants produced by the hydrocarbon industry, especially from refineries. Phenols are aromatic compounds containing one or more hydroxyl groups attached to the ring. A phenol concentration around 5–25 Given this situation, a very important alternative is the use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) It has been demonstrated that the use of AOPs with O It is necessary to highlight that the efficiency of each process with the potential to be developed into an applied technology depends on the nature and contamination load to be treated. If the objective is total mineralization, an electrochemical AOP, such as EO (incineration), is the most favorable option. Special mention must be made to electrocoagulation (EC) as one of the electrochemical technologies with a high capacity to remove elevated organic charges, greases, oils, and suspended solids, among other pollutants. The nature of EC is nondestructive, meaning that it does not possess the ability to mineralize a pollutant in an efficient manner, at least not without the intervention of coupled chemical reactions. Among the main reaction mechanisms found in this technology, there are: (i) coagulation-flocculation-flotation, (ii) direct oxidation, (iii) mediated oxidation, and (iv) direct electronic transference (see the chapter “Electrocoagulation” in Part I, for additional information). Within these mechanisms, coagulation-flocculation-flotation is predominant. Depending on the material used as an anode, the initial removal process begins with the release of Al In the case of an aluminum (Al) anode, the main reactions are represented by Eqs. Considering the elevated capacity of the EC process to remove organic pollutants, its use represents an excellent pretreatment for electrochemical AOPs, in this way achieving an improvement in current efficiency. Among the destructive processes, the use of electrochemistry has been shown to be an excellent option in the treatment of highly complex matrixes containing toxic organic compounds. Among the main advantages of electrochemical processes, there are: (a) versatility (redox processes in diluted or concentrated solutions), (b) automatization [easy handling of electrical variables (current and potential) and control for data acquisition], (c) environmental compatibility (use of the electron as a reagent), and (d) absence of muds. At present, the main application and with scaling potential is represented by EO, which is classified as electrochemical conversion and incineration Depending on the nature of the anode and its corresponding overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (η-O The above graph was created based on the anodic overpotentials obtained in 0.5 The BDD has won great acceptance due to the production of chemically active The reaction mechanisms in an EO process that lead to electrochemical conversion and incineration have been widely reported, considering the electrocatalytic performance of the material used as an anode. Thus, currently, there are two main classes of materials known: active [Pt, MOx (IrO The reaction mechanism that leads to the electrochemical incineration process with a BDD electrode is complex and entails the direct participation of the In turn, the contribution of mediated oxidation from other oxidizing agents—such as peroxodisulfuric acid (H In our work group, we have demonstrated that the elimination of C-sp  Another interesting aspect of the use of electrochemical processes is the reaction that occurs in the cathode. In an EO process in an undivided cell, the reduction reactions of organic molecules compete with water reduction. Therefore, different products can be obtained during electrolysis due to the varying overpotential values in the hydrogen evolution reaction (η-H On the other hand, Azzam et al. Among other works, Borrás et al. Other studies have also indicated that both O  It has been documented in other studies that the Ti/SnO In turn, Li et al. In this study, Na In studies by Zhao et al. The wastewater produced in the various process units of oil refining can have different names such as water produced, sour water, tank bottom draws, spent caustic, and desalter effluent. The composition and concentration of the pollutants vary widely; therefore the electrochemical parameters that control the EO process with BDD must be thoroughly studied, evaluating them for each type of effluent. This section will focus solely on the electrochemical treatment of water produced, spent caustic, and desalter effluent, presenting some of the main work reported in the literature as well as those conducted in our work group. The effluents produced during the extraction of petroleum and gas are known as water produced. Among the most relevant researches regarding EO, there are those reported by Zanbotto Ramalho et al. The analysis focused on the influence of operation parameters, such as In another study, the phenol degradation with Ti/TiO The aqueous wastes produced by the hydrocarbon industry, which involves the use of NaOH to carry out the elimination of sulfur compounds present in the different fractions of crude oil, are known as spent caustics and are classified as sulfidics (removal of H Currently, spent caustics are treated through wet air oxidation (WAO), acid neutralization (AN), and biological oxidation (BO). Step 2 can be followed by steam stripping in which residual H In our group, we have evaluated the selective degradation of phenol and phenolic compounds found in a spent caustic diluted through an adequate chemical pretreatment, consisting of the optimization of the conversion process of phenols to phenolates using NaOH In alkaline conditions, the results were not encouraging because the formation of CO The low degradation efficiency of phenol and phenolic compounds in an alkaline medium was also explained by the decrease of the η-O In this process, a cell with a single compartment and a capacity of 120 It can be observed that the mixture includes a phenolic content of 11,041 The main results obtained showed a greater efficiency in the chemical type of pretreatment process when using H The voltammograms obtained for both HCl and H In our study, and considering the presence of chlorides, the use of UV light ( Under the best operating conditions, a spent caustic mixture (100 The effluents from the desalination process, known as desalter effluent, are characterized by having inorganic salts, sodium chlorides, magnesium, and calcium in their compositions It is important to emphasize that due to the quality of the crude processed and the nature of the desalination process, the physicochemical composition of the effluents completely differs from those identified in water produced and spent caustics. In our group, we conducted the EO of waters from the desalination process of crude oil, using Si/BDD as the anode and applying It is clearly observed that there is no significant difference with regards to the pH in the long term ( In this chapter, results have been presented regarding the electrochemical treatment of spent caustics (diluted and concentrated) in simple samples and highly toxic mixtures as well as results of electrolysis in desalter effluent, which are two of the main effluents highly contaminated by hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds, and the presence of salts. It is important to mention that spent caustics possess an elevated hazard related to their physicochemical composition, which can exceed 11,000
