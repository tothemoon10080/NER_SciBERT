The practice of in-situ leaching of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore using (NH4)2SO4 solution has revealed serious environmental problems such as ammonia-nitrogen pollution in water body and plant growth difficulties. The present study investigated the use of magnesium sulfate instead of (NH4)2SO4 as the leaching agent in the recovery of rare earth elements to solve the problem of ammonia-nitrogen pollution. It was determined that the optimum leaching condition in 298K, a flow rate of 0.60mL·min−1, and 0.20mol·L−1 magnesium sulfate solution, lead to 93% of total rare earth leaching efficiency and around 50% aluminum leaching efficiency. The results suggested that the magnesium sulfate was capable of producing identical recovery efficiency as (NH4)2SO4 and reducing aluminum leaching efficiency at the same time. In addition, the leaching mechanism was analyzed with different kinetic models, it was determined that the leaching kinetics of the weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore could be appropriately described by Pseudo-first-order model, which indicated that the film diffusion was rate-limiting for the leaching process. The apparent activation energy was calculated to be 8.90kJ·mol−1. However, the content of ion-exchangeable magnesium in rare earth washing tailings was 560mg per kilogram soil. This would lead to an imbalance of ion-exchangeable calcium and ion-exchangeable magnesium, which would have a bad effect on the plant growth. Based on these findings, the synergic leaching with magnesium salt and calcium salt was identified as an excellent alternative leaching agent for further studies.The ongoing development of advanced technologies resulted in an increasing demand for rare earth elements as they are extensively used in high strength permanent magnets, lasers, automotive catalytic converters, fiber optics/superconductors, and electronic devices, especially for the mid- and heavy rare earth ( For a long time, much effort has been engaged in the research and development of a series of hydrometallurgical processer for the specially weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores ( According to several reports, the soil of southern China is in need of magnesium fertilizer due to the lack of ion-exchangeable magnesium ( The experimental samples of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores were collected from Liutang Rare Earth Mine area located in the Chongzuo City, Guangxi Province, China. The chemical composition of ore sample was listed in Columns of 40 In the leaching process, 300 Clay mineral could absorb rare earth ions because of its negative charge, forming weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore. The absorbed REEs could easily and selectively be desorbed and substituted on the substrate by the cations and transferred into the solution as soluble REE sulfates ( Pseudo-first-order model The Pseudo-first-order model can be expressed as ( Elovich model The Elovich equation as modified by Intraparticle diffusion modelAn intraparticle mass transfer diffusion model proposed by To investigate the leaching process and leaching mechanism of rare earth with magnesium sulfate solution, the effect of temperature on the leaching efficiency was examined in the range of 5–50 Different kinetic models were used to describe rare earth release based on the analysis of the experimental data in A plot of the leaching rate against the reciprocal temperature was performed for the kinetic data of The apparent activation energy is then calculated to be 8.90 According to Fick's law, the leaching rate of film diffusion control could be expressed as Eq. In order to study the effect of the particle size of rare earth ore on rare earth leaching, the rare earth ore sample was sieved into five levels with different particle sizes and then leached with magnesium sulfate. The influence of particle size on the leaching efficiency was investigated, which was presented in According to the liquid film diffusion control model of rare earth leaching kinetics, increasing the leaching agent concentration is conducive to decrease the resistance of diffusion and improve the leaching reaction rate. In the leaching process of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore, the rare earth efficiency is expected to be higher and the leaching efficiency of impurities to be lower, especially the aluminum ions. The aluminum ions in the leaching solution would lead to a number of problems, such as low product purity, low rare earth yield and high consumption of precipitant. Thus, the comparisons of rare earth and aluminum leaching efficiency between two kinds of leaching agents were investigated. The result shown in In the real industrial production, the rare earth leaching efficiency could be changed by adjusting the flow rate of the leaching agent, so the effect of the flow rate of the magnesium sulfate solution on rare earth leaching was studied, and the result was presented in  The effect of the acidity of the leaching agent on rare earth leaching was demonstrated in Experiments were carried out to study the effect of magnesium sulfate agent on soil, so as to provide data to the in-situ leaching of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore. First of all, the column with 300 Magnesium balance of the process was calculated and listed in In order to reduce or even eliminate ammonia-nitrogen emissions, magnesium sulfate was proposed to be the leaching agent to deal with the weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore instead of ammonium sulfate. The present study investigated the influence of experimental conditions such as temperature, particle size, the concentration and acidity of the leaching agent, and flow rate on the extraction process of rare earth ions adsorbed on weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore via leaching with magnesium sulfate solutions in columns. It is determined that the rare earth leaching efficiency increases with increasing leaching temperature, the concentration and acidity of leaching agent, and with decreasing particle size, flow rate. The rare earth leaching efficiency is about 93% in 298 The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial supports of the
