The La-doped LiFe1-xLa1-xPO4/C material was synthesized using the low-temperature reduction-heat treatment method. The material’s cathode structure and electrochemical properties were investigated using an X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charge/discharge cycling. The results show that different amounts of lanthanum doping influences the structure and electrochemical properties of the material. With an increase in the doping amount in LiFe1-xLaxPO4/C material at x from 0 to 0.0075, the initial charge/discharge performance is visibly improved. Especially when the doping amount of La is fixed at x=0.005, LiFe0.995La0.005PO4/C has a better performance. The initial discharge capacity presents 169.6 mAh·g-1 at 0.1C, and the capacity is retained at 167.7 mAh·g-1 after 20 cycles. Electronic conductivity, electrode reaction reversibility, structure stability, and the charge transfer process are enhanced.
