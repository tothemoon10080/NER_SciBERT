Amorphous alumina-yttria powders with 20, 25, 30 and 37.5 mol% yttria were synthesised by a co-precipitation method using the respective nitrates as precursors for identifying a composition with the best amorphous phase stability. Thermal analysis showed that calcination to yield amorphous oxides completed at around 800 °C. Crystallisation behaviour investigated by x-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that Al2O3–25 mol% Y2O3 (25Y) had the highest crystallisation temperature of 900 °C. Crystallisation involved the appearance and disappearance of metastable hexagonal yttrium aluminate (H-YAlO3) below 1000 °C. The phase evolution sequences for all the compositions were studied in detail. All the phases were nanocrystalline, establishing the efficacy of amorphous phase crystallisation as a viable route for the synthesis of nanocrystalline ceramics. Solution combustion synthesis (SCS) was selected to synthesis 25Y with enhanced amorphous phase stability using different proportions of citric acid and ethylene glycol. Thermal analysis revealed that the powder was free of organic residue after heat treating at 650 °C. The powder produced with 10 vol% of fuel (citric acid + ethylene glycol) yielded the highest crystallisation temperature of 925 °C and the appearance and disappearance of H-YAlO3 between 950 and 1100 °C. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that the co-precipitation synthesis might have residual NH4

The crystallisation kinetics can be such that the crystalline phase(s) are of nanometric dimensions. If the amorphous phase is prepared in the bulk form, then its crystallisation can lead to the formation of bulk nanocrystalline ceramics. This is an attractive alternative to sintering of ceramic nanoparticles, because grain growth during sintering makes it difficult to retain nanometric grain sizes while achieving complete densification. This approach of producing nearly fully dense alumina-zirconia amorphous oxide and then crystallising it into bulk nanocrystalline oxide ceramic has been demonstrated by Gandhi et al. In spite of the interesting and potentially useful characteristics such as high hardness and refractive index, alumina-yttria amorphous/glassy materials did not garner a lot attention owing to the difficulties in processing these materials into bulk dense forms. The amorphous material is, of necessity, produced in particulate form and must be sintered without crystallisation. The particulate forms can be produced either by rapid solidification or chemical precursor synthesis. Temperature more than ~ 2000 °C is normally required to melt alumina with zirconia, yttria or lanthanoid oxide additions Amorphous/glassy alumina based oxides can also be produced by chemical synthesis methods, such as reverse co-precipitation (alumina-yttria) The following abbreviations are used throughout the paper: Al Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate and yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (as detailed above) were used as starting materials. Citric acid monohydrate (C Method 1 (M1): Equal volumes of aqueous metal nitrate solution and aqueous fuel solution (5 vol% of fuel – citric acid + ethylene glycol). Method 2 (M2): Equal volumes of aqueous metal nitrate solution and aqueous citric acid solution (5 vol% of fuel). Method 3 (M3): Aqueous fuel solution (10 vol% of fuel – citric acid + ethylene glycol) was taken 5 times the volume of aqueous metal nitrate solution. Equivalence ratio (φ The as-synthesised powders from co-precipitation and combustion routes were calcined at various temperatures between 700 and 1500 °C for 5 min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min followed by air cooling to investigate the thermal stability of the amorphous phase as well as the crystalline phase evolution. Calcination and crystallisation behaviour of the as-dried reverse co-precipitation and the combustion synthesis powders were examined by simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC, TA instruments, SDT Q600) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min from room temperature to 1200 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The phase evolution and the crystalline structure of all the calcined powders were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, X′Pert Pro, PANalytical) with Cu-Kα radiation in the diffraction angle range of 10–90° and a step size of 0.02°. The TG-DSC plots for the as-dried co-precipitated alumina-yttria powders are shown in In the co-precipitation process, the stoichiometric amounts of aluminium nitrate and yttrium nitrate were mixed with deionised water to obtain an aqueous solution in which the nitrates would dissociate into metal ions and The co-precipitation process requires proper control over pH, since the precipitation of Al(OH) In the case of 20Y, crystallisation occurred with the evolution of γ-Al In the compositions of 25Y, 30Y and 37.5Y the amorphous phase was stable up to 900 °C. The metastable H and G formed at 925 °C. At higher temperatures, H transformed into G. A small amount of γ formed in 25Y. G+H transformed into G + γ and G in 30Y and 37.5Y, respectively. The two-phase G + γ microstructure observed at and above 1100 °C in 30Y was due to slower cation diffusion The preference for the formation of H or G from the parent amorphous phase depended on the free energy and the complexity of the structure. From the free energy-composition curve constructed for Al Frequencies of functional groups present in the co-precipitated alumina-yttria powders were studied using FT-IR analysis. Alumina-yttria powders with the composition range from 20Y to 37.5Y and heat treated at different temperatures for 5 min were chosen for FT-IR studies. FT-IR spectroscopy reveals crystalline transition and decomposition pathways involved in the powder. As an example, the FT-IR spectra for 25Y at each heat treatment step are shown in The FT-IR data on crystalline powders are presented in this section. In the case of 20Y, γ started to evolve at 900 °C as the first crystalline phase. However, majority of the phase was still amorphous. This is seen from the presence of a broad amorphous peak in the XRD pattern ( The summary of crystallite size evolution in the alumina-yttria systems synthesised by reverse co-precipitation is shown in γ phase first nucleated with crystallite sizes of 3.2 nm at 900 °C for 20Y, 6.3 nm at 1000 °C for 25Y and 16.2 nm at 1100 °C for 30Y. There was no existence of γ phase in 37.5Y. The crystallite sizes increased slowly with increase in temperature from 3.2 nm to 10.9 nm up to 1200 °C for 20Y, 6.3–19.9 nm and 16.2–20 nm up to 1300 °C for 25Y and 30Y respectively. At high temperature, the transition from γ to α was attributed to a drastic increase in the crystallite size which occurred at 1300 °C for 20Y, 1400 °C for 25Y and 30Y. For 20Y, G phase evolved at 1000 °C with a crystallite size of 22.5 nm and slowly increased up to 1300 °C. No H phase was observed for 20Y. With the increase in yttria content, the crystallite size of the H phase decreased. H phase was first crystallised at 925 °C, with a size of 19.1, 17.9, 15.2 nm for 25Y, 30Y and 37.5Y, respectively. The crystallite sizes increased slowly up to 975 °C for 25Y and 1000 °C for 30Y and 37.5Y. Similarly, G first crystallised at 925 °C with a size of 24.1, 24.9 and 21.9 nm for 25Y, 30Y and 37.5Y, respectively. The crystallite size for G increased slowly up to 1300 °C. The crystallite size observed in γ to α transition was higher than H to G transition. H to G transition occurred at 1000 °C for 25Y and at 1100 °C for 30Y and 37.5Y. For all the compositions, the crystallite sizes increased drastically above 1300 °C for both α and G phases. The TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (see The efficacy of amorphous phase crystallisation in obtaining nanocrystalline oxides was evident in the crystallite size data in Based on the results obtained from the reverse co-precipitation, the composition 25Y was identified as the enhanced stability of the amorphous phase. In order to explore the possibility of improving its stability further, the 25Y composition was synthesised by the solution combustion synthesis (SCS) technique. The TG-DSC curve for the as-synthesised 25Y through solution combustion using Method 3 (M3) is shown in In the combustion process, the oxidizer to fuel ratio plays an important role for determining the exothermicity of the combusted product. Based on the concept of propellant chemistry For citric acid and ethylene glycol as fuel: For citric acid as fuel: The thermodynamic data for various reactants and products are given in Enthalpy of combustion: Adiabatic temperature: Here, n is the number of moles, ∆H The summary of phase evolution of the 25Y powder prepared by method 1, 2 and 3 of combustion synthesis is given in Direct nucleation of G from the amorphous precursor leaving some residual amorphous phase. γ yields from the residual amorphous phase leading to phase separation upon crystallisation. Transformation of γ to α at high temperature. In case of M3, the amorphous phase was stable up to 925 °C as shown in FT-IR analysis for 25Y powder from three methods (M1, M2 and M3) is given in The summary of crystallite size evolution in 25Y by SCS using different methods is shown in G first crystallised with a size of 17 nm at 700 °C and 26.4 nm at 900 °C for M1 and M2 respectively. γ phase nucleated at 1100 °C with the crystallite size of 13.3 nm and 5 nm for M1 and M2, respectively. In both G and γ, crystallite sizes increased slowly up to 1200 °C. At 1300 °C, γ to α transition occurred with a drastic increase in the crystallite size. The crystallite sizes increased drastically above 1300 °C for both G and α phases. The pathway for the crystallite size evolution for M3 (citric acid and ethylene glycol – 10 vol%) involved four steps: H and G nucleated at 950 °C with the crystallite size of 17.9 and 20.4 nm, respectively. The crystallite size increased slowly up to 1000 °C for H and 1300 °C for G. γ phase with a crystallite size of 6.1 nm evolved at 1100 °C. The crystallite size increased drastically at 1400 °C which was attributed by the transformation of γ to α. It is known from literature that the γ to α transition yields large α grain. This is due to factors such as large decrease in molar volume, and templated growth of α The crystallite size increased drastically above 1400 °C for both G and α phases. Naturally, the crystallinity improved with the temperature.  Reverse co-precipitation was used for synthesising amorphous alumina-yttria powders with systematically varying yttria content. The alumina-25 mol% yttria (25Y) composition was identified as the one with the most stable amorphous phase (up to 900 °C). A solution combustion synthesis technique was also used for synthesising 25Y powders which enhanced the amorphous phase stability to 925 °C. This enhancement was attributed to the absence of radicals such as Crystallisation of amorphous phases into nanocrystalline oxide ceramics has been studied in detail. The phase evolution sequences in both, reverse co-precipitated and solution combustion synthesised materials were studied and analysed. Both, metastable and stable phases retained nanometric grains even after thermal exposure at 1500 °C.
