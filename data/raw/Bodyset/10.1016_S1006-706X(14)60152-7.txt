The porous titanium fiber materials with open porosity were successfully prepared by the vacuum sintering technology. The morphology characteristics of sintering neck of porous titanium fiber materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that the formation and growth of sintering neck of porous titanium fiber material approximately follow the rule that the primary mechanism is grain boundary diffusion and subsidiary mechanisms are other diffusion mechanisms during the sintering process. The formation and growth of the sintering neck depend mainly on the sintering temperature and slightly on the soaking time. The sintering system of porous titanium fiber material was determined and the equation of the sintering neck's length was established.
