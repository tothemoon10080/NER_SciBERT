Thiosulfate system is considered an interesting alternative leaching process for precious metals. Nevertheless, most of the literature published on these conventional thiosulfate leaching solutions has been focused on the use of ammonia and copper to generate the cupric tetraamine complex, which acts as a catalytic oxidant for silver. However, ammonia toxicity is also a detrimental issue in terms of the process sustainability. For that reason, thiosulfate–nitrite–copper solutions were studied as an alternative less toxic system for silver leaching.
                  In this work, the effect of the thiosulfate concentration (0.07M, 0.1M and 0.15M) and temperature (room temperature, 30, 35, 40 and 45°C) on the metallic silver leaching kinetics is presented for the S2O3–NO2–Cu system. The results show that the thiosulfate concentration plays an important role in the S2O3–NO2–Cu–Ag system since it controls the silver leaching kinetics. On the other hand, an increase in temperature favors the silver recovery.
                  Finally, the SEM–EDS analysis, the X-ray mapping and the X-ray diffractograms show that the solid silver particles are coated by a Cu, S and O layer for the 0.07M and 0.1M thiosulfate experiments, which is consistent with the formation of antlerite (Cu3(SO4)(OH)4); while the 0.15M thiosulfate scenario produced a layer composed only of Cu and S, revealing the formation of stromeyerite (CuAgS). The UV–Visible technique confirmed the in-situ generation of copper–ammonia complexes for the 0.07M leaching condition; however, these complexes are not formed at the 0.15M condition.At present time, the mining industry has experienced new technological (e.g. leaching of carbonaceous refractory ores) and environmental (e.g. cyanide toxicity) challenges for the extraction of silver and gold ( The thiosulfate system has been studied extensively in the last years as an efficient and economic system for gold and silver leaching due to its ability to produce strong complexes with these metals and to leach them easily from their ores when the system is catalyzed with cupric ions ( The catalytic effect of the cupric ions on the leaching solution of the thiosulfate–copper–ammonia system increases the silver and gold leaching kinetics up to 20 times; this increase is mainly attributed to the formation of a copper–ammonia complex, the so-called cupric tetraamine Cu(NH In addition to the formation of the cupric tetraamine, ammonia has another important effect on the leaching kinetics: the ammonia prevents the gold passivation due to its preferential adsorption on the gold surface generating a gold–ammonia complex ( The temperature effect on the silver and gold leaching kinetics has been reported extensively in the literature. In contrast, Zipperian et al. found that the initial rate of silver and gold extraction is enhanced by an increase in the leach temperature; but the rate falls dramatically after a processing time of one hour ( In the last decades, the nitrogen species catalyzed (NSC) pressure leaching system has been proposed for the recovery of silver, copper, zinc and iron from refractory sulfide ores, as an alternative method to the cyanidation process ( The combination of sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite has been used in the United States since the 1930’s as the primary antidote for cyanide intoxication ( As a result of the nitrite reduction, ammonia will be predominantly formed at pH values above 9, while ammonium will be predominantly formed at pH values below 9. The addition of copper ions in the leaching system is important in order to form cupric ammonia complexes (Eq. According to the results reported by The main objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of the thiosulfate concentration and the temperature on the silver leaching kinetics employing the thiosulfate–nitrite–copper alternative leaching system in order to find the best conditions to accelerate the silver leaching.
