Corrosion protective sol–gel silica coatings were developed on AA2024-T3 alloy by in situ cross-linking with hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine). Coatings with or without corrosion inhibitors (2-mercaptobenzothiazole or 2-mercaptobenzimidazole) and of two different thicknesses (1–1.5 and 3–3.5μm, respectively) were obtained. Potentiodynamic scans and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (after immersion in Harrison's solution for up to 4weeks) were employed to evaluate the anticorrosion performance of coatings, whereas their thickness, morphology and integrity were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Further the depth sensing nanoindentation technique was employed to measure the hardness and reduced modulus of coatings and the obtained data were analyzed to indicate their wear resistance, plastic deformation and mechanical integrity. In all cases, coatings of high quality with good barrier properties (impedance modulus reaching up to 106
                     Ωcm2 at the very low frequency regime) and self-healing abilities (in case of the inclusion of an inhibitor) were obtained. The coating thickness was found to affect the anticorrosion performance, however, even thinner coatings demonstrate satisfactory protection and self-healing effect. Nanoindentation analysis revealed the flexible nature and viscous behavior of the coatings (with the theoretical transition of the elastic to plastic behavior appearing at 1000μN applied load) demonstrating also an optimal integration of the organic inhibitors into the film. It also revealed an effect of thickness with thinner coatings exhibiting slightly superior behavior in terms of elasticity and wear resistance.In contrast to pure aluminum, alloys containing copper, magnesium and silicon as the principal substitution elements are susceptible to atmospheric corrosion. Some aluminum alloys such as AA2024-T3 present severe pitting and develop a voluminous white corrosion product under some exposure conditions in corrosive atmosphere. Chromate conversion coatings offer very good corrosion protection for aluminum alloys. However, due to the carcinogenic toxicity of hexavalent chromium (Cr The beneficial adhesion properties of sol–gel based coatings to metals are due to the fact that strong covalent Si Recent research focuses on encapsulating and complexating the inhibitor in suitable nanoreservoirs in order to avoid the direct interaction with the sol–gel matrix and to also achieve its slow release. In order to accomplish this goal, the inclusion of an inhibitor in nanoparticles Another issue concerning the sol–gel anticorrosion coatings is their rather poor mechanical behavior, which depends on structure and composition, inherent mechanical properties of the substrate, adhesion strength, residual stresses and coating thickness In our previous work, corrosion protective sol–gel coatings were developed on AA2024-T3 alloy through an aqueous sol–gel process which includes in situ formation of a dense silica network from hydrolyzed 3-glycidoxy-propyltri-methoxysilane and tetraethoxysilane followed by in situ cross-linking by hyperbranched PEI In the present study, the same methodology was employed to deposit hybrid organo-silicate coatings onto AA2024-T3 alloy aiming at assessing their anticorrosion protection ability and evaluating their nanomechanical properties, wear resistance and adhesion to the substrate, correlating, in this way, their overall performance with the process parameters. In this respect, coatings integrating or not an organic inhibitor (MBT or MBI) and differing in their thickness, (affected by the dipping time of the alloy into the synthesized cross-linked sol) were developed and the observed differences are discussed. AA2024-T3 alloy coupons with dimensions of 60 The sol–gel process involved the preparation of an aqueous solution by the drop-wise addition, under continuous stirring, of 3-glycidoxy-propyltri-methoxysilane (GPTMS) (97% pure, Merck) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (99% pure, Alfa Aesar) in 3:1 molar ratio to a 0.05 Finally, the cleaned AA2024-T3 coupons were dipped into the cross-linked silane solutions (immediately after its preparation) either for 100 The corrosion performance of the coated aluminum samples was studied by potentiodynamic scan (PDS) measurements conducted in Harrison's solution (0.35 The coating quality together with the corrosion behavior was also explored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Samples dip-coated for 100 In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies performed in a JEOL JSM 6380-LV instrument were employed to evaluate the thickness, surface morphology and quality of the films developed before and after the corrosion tests. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was used to characterize and confirm the surface coating in cross section images at an accelerating voltage of 20 The three-dimensional topography and roughness of the films were evaluated with the aid of an atomic force microscopy (AFM, DME Dualscope DS95). The indentation analysis was performed using a Hysitron TriboLab® Nanomechanical Test Instrument (Hysitron Inc., Minneapolis, USA) that is capable of performing indentations. The equipment allows the application of loads from 1 to 10,000 SEM and AFM analyses were employed aiming at evaluating the morphology and the topography as well as the quality of the film surfaces. The SEM analysis revealed that, in all cases, dense coatings, exhibiting a defect-free surface without any pores or microcracks, were developed. Representative SEM images of the coatings' surfaces are depicted in The essential adhesion of the synthesized coatings can be attributed to the fact that the film is ‘cross-linked’ and stably attached on Al surface both through covalent and non-covalent, but rather strong, interactions of amino groups with silica and alumina active sites As can be seen in  Potentiostatic polarization curves of coated coupons in Harrison's solution, prepared for a dipping period of 100 As can be seen, the corrosion potential The above results are in full agreement with the results presented recently The very good barrier properties of the coatings and the superior behavior of inhibitor containing ones were also confirmed in SEM studies of their surface after the PDS test ( The Bode plots presented in As can be seen from the modulus plot The coating containing MBT is further explored by measuring the impedance spectra as a function of time. In A similar behavior is observed also for the coating containing MBI (data not shown), in accordance with the results obtained previously Indentation tests were initially performed on the AA2024-T3 substrate and revealed Slope changes that are observed at loading curves are studied through a power law relation, by which loading data are fitted through the general relationship between the applied load ( Further analysis of the obtained load    Ιn Hybrid organo-silicate anticorrosive coatings were deposited onto aluminum alloy substrates through an aqueous sol–gel method that employs hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine) to cross-link the silica network onto the metal surface as well as to solubilize corrosion inhibitors to get integrated into the deposited film. Coatings of two different thicknesses (1–1.5 and 3–3.5 In all cases, smooth coatings of high quality with good corrosion barrier properties were obtained, whereas the integration of an organic inhibitor into the film induces self-healing behavior. The coating thickness is a parameter that affects anticorrosion performance, since the thinner coatings of 1–1.5 The analysis of the nanomechanical properties revealed that the coatings are quite flexible with a viscous behavior attributed to their organic content. In fact, the measurements showed that the indentation index increases with the applied load, reaching, in all cases, its maximum value at 1000
