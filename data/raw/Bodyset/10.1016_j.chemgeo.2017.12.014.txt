Among the most significant challenges in maximizing the precision and accuracy of U-Pb zircon geochronology by LA-ICP-MS is minimizing the impact of downhole fractionation, the time-dependent evolution of Pb/U ratios caused mainly by complex differences in the volatility and chemical properties of elements as they are excavated from the ablation site. To produce meaningful dates for unknown materials, downhole fractionation is typically quantified in a reference zircon and a time-based correction factor subsequently employed to yield constant Pb/U in both standard and unknown zircons. This assumes that both the reference and unknown zircon exhibit similar downhole behaviour. As a test of this assumption, downhole fractionation trends were characterized and quantified in three common zircon reference materials (Plešovice, 337Ma; Temora-2, 417Ma; 91500; 1065Ma) and in three low-U (<300ppm) zircon samples with coherent U-Pb systematics from mafic intrusions (Laramie, 1436Ma; Bushveld, 2057Ma; Stillwater, 2710Ma). Using an exponential downhole correction model based on each of the untreated zircon reference materials, the corrections were applied to each of the “unknowns” and the resulting time-dependent Pb/U ratios and final ages were compared. The effectiveness of pre-treatment protocols was also evaluated by comparing downhole fractionation trends for untreated grains, annealed grains, and grains that were annealed and leached (i.e., chemical abrasion). Each of the three zircon reference materials exhibited distinct downhole fractionation and their calculated correction factors had variable influence in correcting each of the unknowns. Application of the fit parameters either over-corrected or under-corrected the Pb/U ratios of the unknowns due to differences in slope for the different downhole rates at a given time. In most cases, annealing zircon prior to LA-ICP-MS analysis lessened the magnitude of U-Pb mass fractionation during laser ablation, whereas chemical abrasion did not significantly change ablation behaviour beyond simply annealing the grains. Based on the relative effectiveness of the downhole correction that was applied, the resulting U-Pb dates of zircon from the Precambrian mafic intrusions can vary significantly when compared to the CA-ID-TIMS ages established for these samples. The results of this study indicate that a robust downhole correction method for LA-ICP-MS U-Pb geochronology of zircon, particularly for application to magmatic zircon and igneous crystallization ages, involves characterization of downhole fractionation in different reference materials and then applying a correction to the unknown zircon based on a reference zircon that behaves similarly during ablation.Laser ablation-inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) offers fast, accurate, and relatively precise geochemical analyses for numerous applications with micrometer-scale spatial resolution (e.g., Among the most significant challenges involved in maximizing the precision and accuracy of LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon geochronology is downhole fractionation, the time-dependent evolution of Pb/U ratios due to complex differences in chemical properties, including volatility and mass of the isotopes as they are excavated and transported from the ablation site ( Application of annealing and chemical abrasion pre-treatment protocols for zircon that were developed for ID-TIMS U-Pb geochronology ( In LA-ICP-MS, as in most other analytical techniques in geochemistry (e.g., Whereas zircon is robust under most geologic conditions, it is susceptible to open-system Pb loss over time due to metamictization, the process of self-irradiation of the crystal structure following radioactive decay of the parent isotopes The three zircon reference materials (Plešovice, 337 Plešovice zircon, which was extracted from a potassic granulite from Plešovice (Czech Republic), was proposed as a reference material by The Temora-2 zircon is sourced from the Paleozoic Middledale gabbro-diorite in eastern Australia ( The 91500 zircon is derived from a large single crystal (Royal Ontario Museum) that was broken into grain sizes of ~ Sample SR336 was collected from a monzodiorite dike along the eastern contact of the monzosyenitic Sybille intrusion adjacent to the Poe Mountain anorthosite of the Laramie anorthosite complex in Wyoming, USA ( Sample SR336 was collected from a monzodiorite dike along the eastern contact of the monzosyenitic Sybille intrusion adjacent to the Poe Mountain anorthosite of the Laramie anorthosite complex in Wyoming, USA ( Sample SA04-13 is a pegmatitic feldspathic orthopyroxenite from the Merensky Reef in the Bushveld Complex of South Africa ( Sample ST05-03 is from a leucogabbro in the Anorthosite zone II (AN2) of the Stillwater Complex (Montana, USA) and has been proposed as a new zircon reference material for the TIMS and LA-ICP-MS community for the dating of Archean zircon ( Zircon from the in-house samples SA04-13 and ST05-03 was separated from whole rock samples following standard mineral processing procedures at the Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research (PCIGR) as described by Following treatment, untreated grains (UT), annealed grains (AN), and grains that underwent chemical abrasion (CA), including both annealing and leaching, were mounted in epoxy resin in 2.5 Assessment of downhole fractionation of U-Pb isotopes for analyzed zircon was carried out on a Resonetics RESOlution M-50-LR Class I laser ablation system coupled to an Agilent 7700 Assessment of downhole fractionation of U-Pb isotopes for analyzed zircon was carried out on a Resonetics RESOlution M-50-LR Class I laser ablation system coupled to an Agilent 7700  The Iolite 2.5 extension for Igor Pro ( To calculate a fit for downhole fractionation, Iolite stacks each integration of a given sample and calculates an average ratio of Pb/U over each ablation time-slice. The function: To calculate a fit for downhole fractionation, Iolite stacks each integration of a given sample and calculates an average ratio of Pb/U over each ablation time-slice. The function: This method produces constant ratios of The internal structure and zoning of the three zircon reference materials and in-house unknowns were examined by cathodoluminescence imaging ( The CL responses of the three in-house samples are variable ( Annealing produced significantly stronger CL responses for all reference and in-house zircon ( Representative trace element concentrations from the reference zircon and in-house zircon samples are compared in Representative trace element concentrations from the reference zircon and in-house zircon samples are compared in  Exponential fits and associated coefficients of the averaged downhole fractionation observed in the three zircon reference samples (Plešovice, Temora-2, 91500) show distinct behaviour both between samples and when comparing untreated, annealed, and chemically abraded grains of a single sample ( In Plešovice zircon, the annealed and chemically abraded grains behave differently from the untreated zircon grains during ablation, especially as the ablation time increases ( Exponential fits for Temora-2 zircon show similar behaviour between the three types of grains that were analyzed ( Downhole behaviour in 91500 zircon is distinct from that observed in Plešovice and Temora-2 ( For the in-house zircon samples from Precambrian mafic intrusions analyzed as unknowns, the downhole fractionation trends also show variations between the different pre-treatments similar to those observed in the reference samples, but with some important differences ( Applying an ideal downhole fit correction to raw Pb/U ratios results in corrected-Pb/U ratios that are flat throughout the entirety of the ablation ( In Plešovice zircon, applying the fit parameters of untreated grains to annealed and chemically abraded zircon results in evolving Fit parameters for downhole fractionation in the three untreated zircon reference materials (Plešovice, Temora-2, 91500) were subsequently applied to the untreated grains of the three unknown zircon samples (SR336, SA04-13, ST05-03) to assess the effectiveness of the correction ( For optimal U-Pb zircon geochronology by LA-ICP-MS, the impact of downhole fractionation must be characterized, quantified, modelled, and a systematic correction applied. A critical component of U-Pb zircon analysis by laser ablation involves attempting to closely match the matrices of the unknowns and reference materials for external calibration. Among the characteristics that have the potential to control the ablation behaviour of zircon (e.g., colour, orientation, metamictization), crystallinity has been shown to have the strongest effect on downhole fractionation ( This study provides a systematic quantitative analysis of the effects of downhole fractionation corrections using a range of reference materials with different pre-treatments applied to samples with variable Pb/U extending in age from Mesoproterozoic to Neoarchean. Both annealing and chemical abrasion techniques impact the rate at which zircon ablates when compared with untreated varieties of each sample ( Based on the relative effectiveness of the downhole correction that was applied (i.e., similarity of the downhole fit between the reference and the unknown), the resulting U-Pb dates of the samples can vary significantly when compared to the established CA-TIMS ages ( Stillwater AN2 zircon has been proposed as a U-Pb reference material for LA-ICP-MS dating of Archean zircon by During data reduction following LA-ICP-MS analysis of an unknown zircon, it is common to trim time sections from the record of a full ablation due to integration of inclusions, zoning, or ablating through small or thin zircon grains into the epoxy. When only a partial ablation can be utilized, it is important that application of the downhole fractionation function properly corrects the data at each time point (i.e., depth) during the analysis. We observed that various correction factors tended to over-correct or under-correct the analytical data throughout the course of a 40 The experiments conducted in this study were designed to assess the accuracy of the exponential downhole corrections on both untreated reference materials and treated zircon from three mafic intrusions of variable and known ages. As most published U-Pb zircon analyses by LA-ICP-MS are obtained using untreated reference materials to calibrate the unknowns, we focused on the issue of the data reduction of treated unknowns using untreated reference materials. The analysis of annealed reference zircon does show improvement in the consistency of the ablation rate and minimizes downhole fractionation differences between samples, a conclusion consistent with that of The approach taken in this study involves characterizing downhole fractionation in different reference materials by LA-ICP-MS and then applying a correction during data reduction of the analyses of unknown zircon using a reference zircon that behaves similarly during ablation. Practically, this strategy is best suited to producing reliable dates with high analytical precision and accuracy for magmatic zircon and constraining igneous crystallization ages and emplacement histories to better understand crustal magmatic processes (e.g., Downhole fractionation during LA-ICP-MS analysis of zircon for U-Pb geochronology has been characterized and quantified by a comparative analysis of the fit parameters to an exponential correction model for three common zircon reference materials (Plešovice, Temora-2, 91500) and for relatively low-U zircon (< The following are the supplementary data related to this article.
