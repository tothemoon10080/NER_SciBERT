The nature of the electrode surface plays an important role in the electrode reaction. In this study, Pb- Ag alloy anodes modified with polyaniline films were prepared by galvanostatic polymerisation. Linear scanning voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry and potentiodynamic polarisation were measured and compared with those of unprepared Pb-Ag (0.3 wt%) alloy anodes. The oxygen evolution reaction potential of the modified anodes was lower than that of the unprepared Pb-Ag (0.3 wt%) anode at same anodic current density. The corrosion resistance of the modified anode was better than that of the unprepared Pb-Ag (0.3 wt%) anode. SEM images were obtained to characterise the morphology of the polyaniline film, and FTIR spectra confirmed that the film coating the Pb-Ag alloy was polyaniline.
