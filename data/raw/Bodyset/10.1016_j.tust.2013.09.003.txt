Thermal gradient is one of the main features in artificial freezing ground and permafrost regions. The deformation and strength behavior of frozen soils with thermal gradient is of utmost importance for stabilities analysis of frozen engineering. A series of uniaxial compression tests were carried out on frozen saturated clay at various average temperatures and thermal gradients. The experimental results indicated that the uniaxial stress–strain curve for frozen clay with thermal gradient presents elastic-linear strain hardening characteristics, both the hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength increase as the thermal gradient and average temperature decreased, but the elastic modulus varies little as the thermal gradient increased. The polygonal stress–strain constitutive equations were implemented into the FEM (Finite Element Method) and the local axial strain distribution of frozen clay with thermal gradient was studied. Two stages are observed from the curves describing the relationship between local axial strain and specimen height, i.e., increase stage and decrease stage for the slope of d. Characteristic parameters such as the demarcation height of Hd
                     , the maximum slope of d
                     max are defined and analyzed. It is found that the characteristic parameters are all dependent on the thermal gradient and average temperature. The thermal gradient presents weakening effects to the local axial strain rate at middle specimen height of

                      in frozen clay with identical average temperature, and that further lead to the decrease of hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength.The artificial freezing is usually adopted as a method of ground improvement for underground engineering and for strengthening soil around excavations (such as metro engineering, nuclear waste storage project, and mining engineering in deep alluvium). Meanwhile, considerable amounts of engineering constructions will be performed (such as highway or railway tunnel, underground pipe-lines, and mineral resources exploration) in cold regions, especially in the permafrost regions of China ( There are two types of methodologies on how to study the nonlinear heterogeneities induced by thermal gradient and the corresponding mechanical responses. Large scale of physical modeling is one of the most essential research methods, and that can supply reliable and reasonable verification for the theoretical analysis and numerical modeling results. In recent decades, much attention had been paid on non-uniform deformation characteristics, bearing capacity and overall instability process of frozen engineering obtained by using physical modeling, and the comprehensive computation models considering the temperature distribution, initial earth pressure, excavation height, exposure period and the deformation or strength behavior for the structures were then put forward ( However, strength behaviors and deformation mechanism drawn from the frozen soil with uniform temperature could not be simply applied to the frozen structures in artificial freezing ground or permafrost regions due to the lack of considering heterogeneities induced by thermal gradient ( The laboratory experiment on specimen with single thermal gradient is the latest developed test methodology ( In present paper, the experimental investigation of quasi-static uniaxial tests, conducted on the samples of frozen clay under a temperature varying from −20 to −10 The soil fraction of tested materials was taken from a mine shaft at a depth about 510–530 The specimens were prepared as cylinders with 100 The uniaixial compression tests were carried out on a multifunctional material testing apparatus for frozen soils consisting of a loading system, a cooling system and an auto controlling system ( For the uniaxial compression experiment, we measured the axial force with load transducer of 500 In order to examine the influences of thermal gradient (= (top end temperature The uniaxial compression tests on frozen saturated clay were carried out by the following three steps:    The global axial strain of  In short, the axial stress–axial strain curves present elastic-linear strain hardening characteristic for the frozen clay with a thermal gradient ranging from 0.0 to 0.75 The variation of elastic modulus versus of the thermal gradient is plotted in It is found that the correlation between elastic modulus and average temperature (or negative temperature) can be written as follows: The linear equation concerning the relationship between The results for hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength are quite different from that for elastic modulus as shown in Here, we propose the following equation to describe the hardening modulus of Strength of frozen saturated clay is significant dependent on the pore polycrystalline ice strength, clay particle strength and the strengthening between the soil skeleton and pore ice. The strength of polycrystalline ice and the strength of frozen clay under an axial strain of 0.01 and 0.20 are presented in The fact that the responses of elastic modulus is smaller than that of the hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength indicates that the heterogeneities induced by thermal gradient start to take into action only during the elasto-plastic deformation stage. The heterogeneities induced by thermal gradient have two major components: (1) heterogeneities caused by moisture migration during freezing stage, and the corresponding density (such as polycrystalline ice size) variation and redistribution; (2) the non-uniform local deformation along the specimen height during the elasto-plastic deformation stage with an axial strain greater than 0.01 caused by the interaction between the frozen soil with different temperature. Moreover, the heterogeneities during freezing stage couples with the heterogeneities formed during compression (shearing) stage, and that both affect the final local strain distribution. It is not realistic to install numerous of LVDTs around the specimen. Hence, the measurement of local strain distribution is achieved through numerical simulation method. The modeling results will help us to better understand the measured hardening modulus and compression strength decrease mechanism for frozen clay with thermal gradient. Based on the ABAQUS finite element software package and the experimental results for frozen clay with uniform temperature shown in The polygonal stress–strain model means that there are only the elastic strains when the axial strain is less than 0.01, and there are elastic stain and plastic strain when the axial strain is larger than 0.01. The computing parameters of The elastic Poisson′s ratio of The element type used in FEM model was CAX8R ( The temperature at different specimen height is different as shown in In order to describe the non-uniform distribution along the specimen height for the local axial strain, we introduce the following two statistical indicators:    The demarcation height of Furthermore, both the index of As was pointed out in previous studies, there are at least two features make the local strain distribution induced by thermal gradient for a frozen soil distinguished from that for frozen soil with uniform temperature. The first is that the non-homogenous characteristics exist before the shearing because of the thermal gradient. The second is that the largest strain is located at the bottom end during the whole compression process. In general, the non-homogenous characteristic for frozen clay with uniform temperature develops gradually as the shearing deformation increased, and the strain localization phenomenon is observed when the shear deformation reaches a certain value. Consequently, there are significant differences between the present work and the traditional strain location phenomenon. The collective results represent a unique characterization of the complete stress–strain–strength behavior of frozen clay as a function of average temperature and thermal gradient. For the strength of frozen soil in artificial freezing engineering, another important factor is the strain rate. The stress–strain–strength behavior of frozen soils related to strain rate had been studied extensively since the pioneering work of The characteristic temperature in the middle height of the specimen as shown in It can be found from Furthermore, according to the analysis of test results, the relationship between the hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength and the corresponding local strain rate in frozen clay with thermal gradient can be written as:  Substituting Eqs. A series of uniaxial compression tests of frozen clay at various thermal gradients and average temperatures have been carried out, the deformation and strength behaviors for frozen clay with thermal gradient are analyzed and the following results can be drawn based on this study: Uniaxial stress–strain curves for frozen saturated clay with thermal gradient present elastic deformation characteristic under an axial stain less than 0.01, but that present elasto-plastic deformation characteristic under an axial strain more than 0.01. Both the hardening modulus and uniaxial compression strength increase as the temperature and thermal gradient decreased. However, the elastic modulus under the identical average temperature varies little as the thermal gradient increased. The local axial strain–specimen height curves can be divided into two stages at the demarcation height. The slope of curves describing the relationship between the local axial strain and specimen height present an increase trend with the increase of specimen height, but with a further increase of specimen height, which decreases rapidly. The demarcation height of The thermal gradient presents weakening effects to the local axial strain rate at middle specimen height of This research was supported by
