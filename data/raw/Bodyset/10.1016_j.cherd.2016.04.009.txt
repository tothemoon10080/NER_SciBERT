It was observed that the absence of baffles could lead to decreased energy efficiency for axial- and mixed-flow impellers at particular operating conditions. The investigations also included the effect of baffle removal on solids dispersion, and results of this investigation indicate that it is possible to obtain complete solids dispersion with reduced power input, whilst the solids were suspended from the tank bottom.specific impeller power input at specific impeller power input at power efficiency factor: mass of suspended solids per unit of power at solid phase density (kg/m liquid phase density (kg/m effective liquid density (kg/m density of water (kg/m kinematic viscosity (m torque impeller clearance (m) solid volume fraction (v/v) optimum solids concentration (v/v) impeller diameter (m) lever arm length (m) particle diameter (m) particle size (m) force (N) gravitational acceleration (m/s sedimentation bed height (m) suspension/slurry height (m) impeller constant load measured by the load cell (kg) mass of solids (kg) impeller speed (rps/rpm) the impeller speed for complete off-bottom suspension in three-phase system (rpm) the impeller speed for complete off-bottom suspension in two phase system (rpm) power number power (W) baffling efficiency factor dimensional coefficient gas flow rate (vvm) tank diameter (m) tank volume (m solid loading ratio (kg/kg) optimum solids concentration (v/v) Blue Glass Beads There is a dire call for carbon emission reduction around the globe, and therefore reduction of energy use by industries is important. Mixing process is a common industrial process associated with significant energy use. Three-phase stirred vessels, involving simultaneous dispersion of gas and suspension of solids in liquid, are involved in various industrial applications, including complex mixing processes such as catalytic gas-phase reactions, oxidation, hydrogenations, fermentation, wastewater treatment and mineral processing ( The impeller speed at which solid particles are completely suspended off the tank bottom is denoted as  The primary role of baffles in stirred vessels is to prevent swirling and vortexing of liquid. It is widely accepted that baffles improve mixing and enhance mass and heat transfer. Information on the mixing efficiency of impellers with different geometries under unbaffled conditions in three-phase systems is scarce in the literature. Studies on radial ( The literature on the impact of gas introduction and gassing rate on the mixing efficiency of various impellers under unbaffled conditions is scarce. In addition, there are limited studies on the suspension of ultra-high concentration solids in unbaffled tanks under gassed condition. Particle size is one of the most important parameters that influence solids suspension. Moreover, there is no information on an effective approach to minimise the power consumption of three-phase stirred vessels operating with high solids concentrations as the existing information is only limited to two-phase systems ( The transparent cylindrical vessel used throughout this work was 0.4 It is well known that RT impeller discharges fluid radially towards the vessel wall and two recirculation loops are formed above and below the impeller. The radial and tangential velocities are almost equal in magnitude at the impeller tip. In a fully baffled vessel, the tangential velocity decreases more rapidly than the radial velocity as the radial distance from the centre increases. As for mixed flow impellers, point velocity studies have showed that the radial and tangential velocities in the flow produced are about equal but vertical velocities are about two times greater. In the downward pumping mode, a weak zone occurs at the centre because there is no discharge from the hub and maximum flow is at the tips of the blades. As a result, a secondary loop moving upwards at the centre is induced. The A310 impeller has three specially designed blades mounted at a shallow angle to provide a high degree of axial flow with minimal power requirements. Each blade is contoured such that the angle of inclination with respect to the vertical plane is higher on the upper part of the impeller. The A310 blade is shaped as an aerofoil and the width of the blade decreases as the distance from the hub is increased. The small blade angle of the A310 impeller reduces drag at the leading edges of the blades and efficiently converts mechanical energy to fluid motion, thus creating more flow with less energy. The impeller clearance ( Compressed air, tap water, and spherical glass ballotini beads ( The power drawn by the impeller for agitation at a particular speed was determined by measuring the torque experienced by the shaft using a load cell as shown in The power drawn, While majority of the studies on two- and three-phase agitated systems has reported power consumption with respect to the total liquid volume in the vessel. Based on the information, the specific impeller power draw was expressed as a function of the total mass of the suspended solids (  In these figures, critical impeller speed ( As explained earlier, it is possible to express the impeller power consumption based on It can be seen that It is obvious that the results for all five impellers exhibit similar behaviour, and consequently there is ( To provide a clearer picture of the improved impeller energy efficiency due to increased solids concentration, the inverse of At any given solids loading, A310 could suspend more solids per unit of power compared to the other two impellers. For According to the data listed in Recently,  Experiments in three-phase baffled tank were conducted using larger diameter impellers. Experiments were carried out in the presence of gas with flow rates of 0.5, 0.75, and 1 Trends in power efficiency By comparing the results in Compared to 0.5 RT, the mixed-flow impeller exhibits higher values of Therefore, similar to solid–liquid systems, it is possible to define an optimum solids concentration for three-phase systems at which the energy supplied by the agitator is consumed most efficiently.    According to the data shown in The experiments were repeated under unbaffled condition to study the effect of baffles on power efficiency factor. The To study the effect of baffle removal on impeller power efficiency better, a term defined as baffling efficiency factor, This factor indicates the percentage improvement in impeller energy efficiency factor upon baffle removal. High value of  The  According to the data shown in The It is observed from The It is found that the influence of baffling configuration on energy efficiency of A310 is strictly dictated by the operating conditions. The negative Based on the curves plotted in This behaviour is similar to that of 0.5 PB impeller but for a different range of Overall, the three impellers studied in this work exhibit different behaviours upon the removal of baffles. 0.5 RT impeller is found to be the most suitable impeller for the suspension of solids in unbaffled tanks. The removal of baffles results in significant enhancement of power efficiency factor values for this impeller, which is an improvement applicable at all solids concentrations. 0.5 PB impeller benefits from baffle removal in most cases except at high gas flow rates and low solids concentrations. In contrast, the axial-flow impeller A310 exhibits undesirable behaviour at low to medium solids concentrations under unbaffled mode. It is concluded that in systems with dilute solids concentration, removal of baffles decreases It should be noted that the removal of baffles in a solid–liquid agitated vessel leads to the formation of a vortex at the centre of the tank, which can draw air from the liquid surface. The aerated gas from surface can reach the impeller zone and affect the suspension of solids by forming ventilated gas cavities behind impeller blades. As a result, impeller speed needs to be increased further to keep solids in suspension. It is possible to suppress the gas entrainment by using only partial baffles in the upper half of the vessel because the solids suspension is limited to the lower portion of the tank. However, as explained earlier, impeller power consumption in a tank equipped with baffles is remarkably higher compared to that under unbaffled condition. According to our results, the extra power input required to return particles to suspension as a result of gas entrainment in an unbaffled tank is insignificant compared to the excessive power input required to completely suspend solids off the tank bottom under baffled (partially or fully) condition. Larger particles tend to settle with higher velocity and require a higher degree of liquid turbulence to stay in suspension, which inevitably forces the impeller to consume more power to operate at It is observed that with an increase in particle size, power efficiency values of A310 impeller decreases for all conditions studied in this work. This decline is regardless of baffling configuration and solids concentration, but is found with and without the presence of gas. As can be seen in In a solid–liquid system, the increase in particle size had no effect on (  It can be seen that the upon the removal of baffles, the In the present work, the energy efficiency of a three-phase mixing system was studied over a range of solids concentration, particle size, gas flow rate, baffling configuration and impeller type. Our initial observations showed that the specific impeller power consumption based on mass of suspended solids ( Another term, known as baffling efficiency factor ‘ The authors are grateful to the
