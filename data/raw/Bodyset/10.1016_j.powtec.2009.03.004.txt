The 4th International Conference on Discrete Element Methods was held in Brisbane in August 2007. A wide range of papers were presented covering both numerical methodologies and applications. The applications ranged from minerals engineering and particle technology to soil mechanics and rock mechanics. Consequently, papers were selected for possible publication in a number of different journals. This special issue collects together a number of papers that were considered to be of interest to readers of Powder Technology.
