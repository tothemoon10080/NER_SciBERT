This study investigated the combined effects of commercial electroplating additives on the properties of nickel electrodeposits. Pieces of carbon steel were electroplated in a Hull cell, using the Watt's bath with different concentrations of additives and different times of deposition according a 25-1 fractional factorial design. Three response variables, namely brightness, roughness and charge transfer resistance were studied. Several synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the studied factors were found and briefly discussed on a physical basis. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that clustering in PC-space can be associated with morphological characteristics of the coatings.
