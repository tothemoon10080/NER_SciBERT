A detailed mineralogical characterization of a tin-polymetallic ore from Mengzi, Yunnan Province, China, was undertaken by automated electron microprobe-based mineral mapping and quantitative analysis methods. The results show that the most valuable metal is Sn (0.98%, mass fraction). The main tin minerals are cassiterite and stannite, which account for 94.90% of total tin. Other metals, such as Cu (0.261%), Zn (0.612%) and Pb (0.296%) can also be seen as valuable metal to be recovered. Minerals such as pyrrhotite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite are disseminated in the ore. Quartz, sericite and dolomite are the main gangue. The optimal grinding fineness should be chosen as 0.037 mm to make sure that most of the tin minerals can be liberated from other minerals.
