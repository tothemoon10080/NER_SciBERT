A hydrometallurgical treatment involving solvent extraction of zinc using di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) has been investigated to recover zinc from an industrial leach residue. The residue was leached with sulfuric acid producing leach liquor which was subjected to solvent extraction for enrichment of zinc and removal of impurities. Operating variables, such as pH, D2EHPA concentration, temperature, aqueous/organic (A/O) phase ratio, tri-butyl phosphate (TBP) concentration and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) concentration in aqueous phase were studied. Practically, all zinc was extracted from the aqueous solution at pH 2.5 with 20% w/w D2EHPA in kerosene. Increasing either TBP concentration up to 5%, or Na2SO4 concentration up to 0.2M, increased the zinc extraction. Zinc could be extracted at one theoretical stage at A/O of 1/1, as calculated by McCabe–Thiele method.In the treatment of zinc concentrates by conventional roast–leach–electrowinning (RLE) processes the leach residues produced may contain significant quantities of zinc. Leaching of solid waste coming from filtration plants is mainly carried out using sulfuric acid solutions ( Solvent extraction may be used for the selective extraction of impurities or valuable metals from process streams into an organic phase. The organic solvent, D2EHPA, allows an efficient recovery of Zn from sulfuric acid solutions of low pH (2.5–3.5) ( The aim of the present work was mainly studying the zinc solvent extraction of the leach liquor produced from the industrial residue. The sample used was prepared by leaching an industrial filter cake from Iranian Zinc Mines Development Company; a zinc hydrometallurgy plant. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), Perkin–Elmer model AA300 and an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzer, Philips model PW 1730 were used to determine chemical composition and mineral phases of the filter cake, respectively. The chemical composition of the sample is 9.87% Zn, 13.69% Pb, 4.93% Fe, 0.21% Mn, 0.3% Ni, 0.25% Co and 1.34% Ca. Based on the XRD analysis, the major phases in the filter cake were PbSO For a good leaching, temperature was set at 80 Chemical composition of the filtrate determined by AAS is 28.80 The organic solution was D2EHPA (Industrial grade, 97% purity, Bayer, Germany) diluted with kerosene (mostly aliphatic in nature, Tehran Oil Refinery). Experiments were carried out by contacting specific volumes of aqueous and organic solutions for 5 The equilibrium concentration of metal ions, Zn The percentage of metal extraction, from aqueous sulfate medium was studied using D2EHPA in kerosene within the pH range of 0.5–5.0 and the pH-extraction isotherms of zinc, iron, and lead were determined. For that the A/O phase ratio was maintained at 1/1. The pH Extraction study was carried out using [D2EHPA] Experiments carried out for six different D2EHPA concentrations, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% and 40% as a function of pH at A/O of 1/1 at 40 The A/O studied were 1/2, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1 and 4/1 at the operating conditions of [D2EHPA] Tri-butyl phosphate (98% purity, Merck) was used as a phase modifier to enhance phase disengagement. Extraction study was carried out using [D2EHPA] Effect of Na The McCabe–Thiele diagram was constructed to determine the theoretical extraction stages required for the separation of zinc from aqueous phase. It has been obtained by contacting the aqueous phase and the solvent containing 20% (w/w) of D2EHPA at pH 2.5, 40  Zinc was preferentially extracted by D2EHPA at low pHs (below 2.5). At the D2EHPA concentration range of 5–40% (w/w) the zinc extraction increased from 10% to ca. 99%. Below pH At pH below 2, varying the TBP concentration from 0% to 5% increased the percentage of extracted zinc. However, at pH above 2.5, TBP concentration did not change the zinc extraction. Increasing the Na Zinc concentration in the aqueous phase could be reduced from 4.69 EV and FR would like to thank Iran Zinc Mine Development Company for partial support of this project.
