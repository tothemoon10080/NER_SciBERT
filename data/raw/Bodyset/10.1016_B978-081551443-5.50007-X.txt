Slips are a suspension of ceramic particles in a liquid that is usually water. Slips also contain other materials such as deflocculants, pH modifiers, and binders. There are two principal uses for slips: slip casting and making press mixes. Slip casting is the process where the slip is poured into a plaster mold and water is drawn into the plaster, thereby creating a wall of consolidated material. Coarse particles are often called “grog.” Coarse grogs can be obtained in two ways: sintered or fused that are then crushed and sized. This chapter addresses two aspects of the fine slips: particle size measurements and the physical constitution and chemistry effect on viscosity. Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a slip to flow or a liquid to shear. When pouting a slip out of a beaker, if the viscosity is high, it will pour slowly like molasses. Plotting shear rate against viscosity determines the rheology of the slip. For slip casting, a little flocculation is often desirable to keep the cast permeable and to provide a little drying shrinkage so that the piece releases from the mold. Therefore, it is desirable to move off the minimum of the flow curve but just a little to one side.
