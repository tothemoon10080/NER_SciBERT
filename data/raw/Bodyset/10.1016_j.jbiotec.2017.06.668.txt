In this work, nanoemulsion-based delivery system was developed by encapsulation of oregano essential oil (OEO) at different concentrations (0.5%, 0.75% and 1%, v/v) in poly-vinyl alcohol solution. The nanoemulsion systems (NES) were characterized in terms of nanodroplet size distribution, zeta potential, thermal, molecular, micro-structural and antifungal properties. The average droplet diameters were in the range of 70â€“75
