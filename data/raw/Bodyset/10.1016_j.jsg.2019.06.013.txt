The relationship between hydrothermal fluids and fault development is studied through a petrographic analysis of faulted veins in an open-pit copper mine, Radomiro Tomic (RT), northern Chile. Brittle deformation in RT was initiated with the formation of veins, disrupting low-strain crystal-plastic deformation. Following cooling, shear fractures propagated along these veins with associated fluid influx, leading to phyllic alteration. Hydrolysis converted all plagioclase to kaolinite within the damage zones and all orthoclase to illite within fault cores and the less deformed rocks surrounded by faults. In turn, precipitation of quartz and pyrite locally cemented gouge in the fault cores. Concentration of clays around faults and veins weakened the rocks and promoted shear strain along them. These processes are expected to occur in any porphyry-related hydrothermal system and can combine during the development of the system. Although cementation tends to strengthen fault cores, the overall strength of the faults is expected to be reduced by hydrolysis of plagioclase, reducing the friction of the faults and their capacity to accumulate stress. These findings may have strong implications for understanding the evolution of ore deposit, the rheology of the crust, earthquake generation, and natural hazard assessment.Understanding fluid-rock interaction in and around faults in the Earth's crust is important for understanding a wide range of geological processes, such as earthquake generation ( Faults play a fundamental role in the migration of fluids and can behave as barriers or conduits depending on the fluid flow direction ( Both field and petrographic observations are necessary to understand the mechanical changes induced by fluid-fault interactions in active hydrothermal settings. However, most published petrographic studies that aim to understand fluid-fault interaction have been conducted on faults where significant ore deposits are lacking and only weak evidence of hydrothermal activity is observed (e.g., The faults studied are located within the Radomiro Tomic copper deposit (hereafter referred to as RT) in northern Chile ( The RT deposit is located in a trench-parallel fault system which has been termed the Domeyko Fault System or DFS ( RT deposit is mainly hosted by the Chuquicamata Porphyry Complex ( Three hypogene hydrothermal events have been identified in RT ( RT is located in an Eocene-Oligocene plutonic block flanked by two regional scale faults: the West Fissure fault to the west and the Mesabi fault to the east ( In this study, the main sources of data are outcrop maps of the internal structure of the faults at selected sites. The internal structure of these faults has been characterized by mapping the mine walls at different scales (cm to m). The maps group rock volumes into rock units according to their macroscopic petrographic properties and spatial relationship to the faults. At least one sample from each unit was collected for analysis. The mapping was complemented with optical petrographic descriptions of fault materials (including cathodoluminescence), micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF, using a Bruker M4 Tornado The rocks observed in the mine walls have been grouped into the following five units: black cataclasite-gouge, quartz vein, white proto-cataclasite, clay-altered granite, and pyrite breccia ( The most conspicuous characteristic of the faults in RT is their black cores, which contrast with the surrounding white clay-rich haloes. Faults which lack black cores are less abundant, younger, and trend NW-SE. The black material in the fault cores has diverse levels of cohesion varying from highly cohesive to uncohesive. Rocks with the above characteristics are grouped into one unit denoted black cataclasite-gouge. These rocks are distributed in irregular layers with a highly variable thickness (1 mm–1 m) and are adjacent to quartz veins ( The distribution of each defined unit, along with their mineralogical content and microscopic properties, are provided in the following section. A list of petrographic and mineralogical characteristics for each, with a systematic record for all the major minerals, is given in the All the granitic rocks in the RT deposit outside the green-white fault haloes are included as part of the granitic protolith unit. These rocks show a porphyritic texture with variable contents of quartz (25–40% vol.), orthoclase (25–40% vol.), plagioclase (20–30% vol.), and minor biotite (<2% vol.) replacing amphibole. Phenocrysts represent more than 50% of the rock volume, vary in size from 1 mm to 3 cm, and are set in a crystalline groundmass (0.01–0.4 mm grain size) that varies from grey aphanitic to white phaneritic. Quartz is mainly present in the groundmass, but also occurs uncommonly as small phenocrysts (<5 mm in size). In both cases the crystals are anhedral, exhibiting internal sub-grains ( This unit includes altered granitic rocks containing more clay than the protolith. that is irregularly distributed around the black faults in green-white haloes. The haloes are 1–10 m wide and gradually fade into the surrounding protolith. Brittle deformation in these rocks is only evidenced by heterogeneously distributed extension cracks and minor shear bands. The rocks are composed of quartz (30–40% vol.), orthoclase (25–35% vol.), clay (25–40% vol.; illite + kaolinite + smectite), and pyrite (<1% vol.). A notable characteristic is the total absence of plagioclase, which is replaced fully by pseudomorphic aggregates of clay. In contrast, orthoclase is only partially altered to clay. These rocks preserve the porphyritic texture of the protolith. Microscopically, the quartz exhibits irregular sub-grains and bulging grain boundaries in both the phenocrysts and the groundmass. The orthoclase exhibits sub-grains only in the groundmass ( This unit includes rocks exhibiting very high levels of mineralogical alteration, indicated by the higher relative content of quartz and clay. These rocks exhibit far fewer fractures and rock fragments than the black cataclasite-gouge unit, reflecting a lower brittle deformation intensity. Under direct sunlight, they are white in colour and have a pearly lustre, crossed by some thin (1–2 mm), black-to-grey veinlets. The unit is distributed in white lenses within larger cataclasite layers (mm-to cm-size) or in metre-sized regions between fault branches. Mineralogically, white protocataclasite is almost entirely composed of quartz (50–55% vol.), clay (45–50% vol.; illite + kaolinite), and traces of pyrite (∼1%). A porphyritic texture is locally preserved, with quartz phenocrysts and feldspar pseudomorphs set within a groundmass composed of massive clay and irregular patches of quartz. A fragmental texture can be observed with angular quartz clasts set in a clay-rich matrix ( This unit includes all the bodies of banded quartz veins, regardless of their shape or deformation state. Most quartz veins have sinuous tabular shapes, are adjacent to fault cores ( This unit includes fault rocks with more than 50% vol. of fragmental matrix, regardless of their cohesion (and thus includes cataclasites and gouges). These rocks have a characteristic black to dark grey colour, with some white spots, bands, and lenses. Under direct sunlight, they show a gentle golden brightness. They are typically distributed in layers of mm-to m-scale thickness, varying from thin ultracataclasite layers to thicker cataclasite or gouge zones. The cohesion of these rocks is highly variable, ranging from strong and well-cemented rocks that break into sharp fragments upon impact with a hammer (i.e., cataclasites), to poorly cemented rocks with a dusty appearance in dry conditions and muddy appearance in wet conditions (dispersible when submerged in water, i.e., gouge). Macroscopically, the texture of black cataclasites consists of fragmented, angular white blocks or porphyroclasts (0.5–10 mm) set in a fine black matrix (∼0.1 mm grain size) of highly variable proportions (50–90% matrix). The black matrix is primarily composed of clay, quartz, and fine pyrite grains. Porphyroclasts are fragments of quartz veins, quartz crystals from the granitic protolith, and irregular lenses of massive clay (white proto-cataclasites). Some cataclasites show sub-horizontal right-lateral kinematics, evidenced by subvertical shear foliations oriented between 0 and 30° counterclockwise with respect to synkinematic shear bands. Black cataclasite is commonly interlayered with fringes of white rock <1 cm thick and composed of quartz and clay (without pyrite), resulting in a banded microstructure. Mineralogically, the black cataclasite gouges are very similar to the white protocataclasites, being mainly composed of quartz (40–55% vol.) and clay (20–45% vol.). The clay fraction includes kaolinite, illite, and traces of smectite. However, black cataclasite gouges also contain significant amounts of metallic sulphides (5–10% vol.), of which pyrite is the most abundant, followed by chalcopyrite, digenite, molybdenite, and minor covellite. Quartz porphyroclasts are 0.1 mm–5 cm in size and under the optical microscope two types are identified. Type I porphyroclasts consist of polycrystalline fragments, exhibiting an internal fabric that varies from diffuse patchy extinction to sub-grains with clear boundaries ( This unit includes fault rocks containing larger fragments of pyrite and less matrix (30–50% vol.) than the black cataclasite-gouge. The pyrite breccias are easy to disaggregate by hand and present a combination of grey and dark-golden colours. Pyrite breccia is only observed in some of the faults and is distributed in discontinuous bodies adjacent to black cataclasite-gouge. Mineralogically it is composed of quartz (30–40% vol.), clay (30–40% vol.; illite + kaolinite) and pyrite (10–20% vol.). Sulphates (<10% vol.; gypsum, chalcanthite + natroalunite) fill the pore spaces between the rock fragments. Uncommon observations of relict feldspar were also observed under optical microscope. The breccia exhibits an inequigranular fabric with four types of porphyroclasts: 1) fractured euhedral pyrite crystals; 2) angular monocrystalline and polycrystalline quartz fragments; 3) sub-tabular blocks of clay, pseudomorphed after plagioclase; and 4) elongated fragments of foliated gouge, composed of much finer fragments of quartz and clay. In contrast to the black cataclasite-gouge unit, the breccia exhibits textural characteristics such as a larger grain size, very poorly developed foliations, and an absence of sigmoidal bodies that correspond to low shear strain. The petrogenetic processes by which the deformation and pore fluids modified the properties of the described rock units ( The granitic protolith represents the initial stage of the magmatic system. Its porphyritic texture suggests at least two main stages of magmatic cooling and crystallization. Additionally, orthoclase megacrysts enclosing quartz in their outer rims were probably formed during a late magmatic stage ( The distribution of alteration minerals in haloes around faults indicates that fluid flowed through the damage zones during the propagation and development of the faults (e.g., Furthermore, the preservation of shape displayed by the clay pseudomorphs indicates that the hydrolysis occurred under static conditions, and that the faults have not been deformed significantly since then. The formation of clay is related to the “quartz/sericite alteration” hydrothermal event dated to 31.8 ± 0.3 Ma and the relatively younger “argillic alteration” ( The complete replacement of feldspars by clay (plagioclase and orthoclase) suggests that the white protocataclasite is mainly formed by intense hydrolysis of the protolith. In turn, its distribution, enclosed by black cataclasite (or gouge) layers, suggests that such chemical reactions are probably spatially limited by a hydrologic compartmentalization between low-permeability fault rocks. The absence of plagioclase and orthoclase indicates that fluid-rock interaction is so strong that all the feldspars are altered, resulting in illite, kaolinite, and quartz ( The absence of fragments of wall-rock within the quartz veins indicates that comminution and wear by brittle shear only occurred after their formation. Therefore, it is inferred that the veins were initially extensional fractures (mode I) before being sealed by quartz, becoming the first tabular bodies or structural anisotropies developed across the protolith. The sinuous and irregular shapes of the veins are interpreted here as a consequence of ductile deformation; this is supported by the intracrystalline features of quartz, which indicates dynamic recrystallization at very low strain rates ( The banded structure of the veins indicates episodic periods of precipitation. In turn, euhedral crystals of quartz and open intercrystalline spaces indicate precipitation under enough fluid pressure to prevent the collapse of the fracture walls under the existing lithostatic pressure. These characteristics are consistent with the formation of veins by hydrofracturing during episodic transient periods of brittle deformation or fluid influx, disrupting a longer-term plastic deformation at lower strain rates. Such a process is explained by the dependence of crystal plasticity on strain rate and fluid pressure ( The distribution and shape of the sulphide minerals that occur between euhedral quartz crystals indicates the following sequence of precipitation: quartz, molybdenite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and finally chalcocite. The sub-horizontal striations on molybdenite imply that the veins were sheared along the strike after their formation. The fragmental texture of these rocks is evidence of the brittle comminution of the pre-existing minerals. However, the intercrystalline structure of the quartz porphyroclasts also indicates that crystal-plastic deformation occurred before cataclasis. The bulging internal boundaries of the quartz are consistent with recrystallization by grain boundary migration at a low strain rate, and the presence of smaller sub-grains indicates dynamic recrystallization by sub-grain rotation (SGR) ( The characteristics of the black cataclasite-gouge indicate that these rocks were formed by alternating episodes of pyrite and quartz precipitation plus intense brittle shearing, causing frictional wear and comminution. The pyrite breccia has very similar mineralogy to the black cataclasite-gouge, but with differences in fragment size and shape. The breccia has much larger fragments and is comprised of less deformed pyrite crystals than those found in the black cataclasite-gouge. These textural features indicate that comminution and frictional wear (induced by shear strain) is less intense in these rocks than in the black cataclasite-gouge. Instead, most of the pyrite blocks have a non-sheared, “jigsaw puzzle’ texture ( The rock units defined in the previous section can be broadly separated into those that are part of a fault core and those that are part of a damage zone, as per their distribution and deformation intensity ( Recrystallization of quartz is observed around faults (in the protolith) and within fault cores and damage zones, suggesting that quartz plasticity is not restricted to the faults. Assuming progressive cooling, quartz recrystallization should be expected at the earliest stages of the hydrothermal system. However, also it is less likely that the recrystallization of quartz took place after the onset of brittle deformation as a consequence of hot fluid pulses passing through the faults. Recrystallization of orthoclase appears to be restricted to the groundmass of the altered rocks in the damage zones. This indicates that the temperature needed to activate mechanisms of plastic deformation in orthoclase was only reached in the vicinity of the faults, and suggests that the mylonitic rocks formed as part of a precursory shear zone, or by advective heat transfer induced by flow of hydrothermal fluids along the faulted veins. In this regard, the bands of subgrains in polycrystalline fragments of quartz within black cataclasites and gouge ( Destruction of feldspar by hydrolysis is spatially related to damage zones and fault cores by different degrees. In damage zones, only plagioclase is fully replaced by clays, and orthoclase is still preserved. However, in fault cores, both feldspar crystals are destroyed by hydrolysis. These observations indicate that alteration is more efficient in damage zones than in the surrounding protolith, and most efficient within the fault cores. Furthermore, the full hydrolysis of orthoclase in white protocataclasite blocks surrounded by black cataclasite-gouge suggests that this process is enhanced with hydrological compartmentalization. Frictional wear and comminution took place only in fault cores. Cementation by quartz precipitation (“silicification”) is also restricted to fault cores (quartz veins). The high cohesion of the black cataclasites is explained by quartz cementation after cataclasis. In the quartz veins, crystal growth on the walls of fractures reduced the available open spaces. According to the distribution of, and relationships between, the rock units, the petrogenetic processes can be arranged into a logical time sequence, representing the evolution of the faults in the RT. The first two processes were the late growth of orthoclase phenocrysts and the replacement of amphibole by biotite, which have been related to “K silicate alteration” at ∼32.7 Ma ( Intercrystalline space, aligned parallel to the quartz bands within the veins, provided the direction of highest permeability. Part of this space was filled with euhedral crystals of molybdenite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite, before the onset of shearing and subsequent fracturing ( Considering the spatial relationship between clay (illite and kaolinite) and pyrite, and their state of deformation, these minerals are considered to be syngenetic (i.e., they formed together, after quartz vein precipitation, during brittle deformation). The relationship between pyrite precipitation and quartz-sericitic alteration has been previously reported in several deposits, with both processes being grouped together as a single stage named “phyllic alteration” ( As shear strain accumulated, gouge was formed in the faults, and grain size was progressively reduced. Most dextral displacement was accommodated by the faults during this period of gouge formation, as represented in Following the formation of the black gouge and pyrite breccia, no further deformation affected the faults. However, two important mineralogical modifications occurred subsequently: silicification of the fault gouge (becoming cataclasite) and formation of clay minerals from feldspars. Aggregated clusters of quartz fragments recognized under optical cathodoluminescence, indicate cementation of the gouge by crystalline quartz, forming cataclasites under hydrothermal conditions ( In general, this type of argillic alteration can occur during the entire lifetime of a hydrothermal system, by the chemical action of ascending low-temperature, low-salinity, and low-pH vapours. Such alteration is nearly always found in the uppermost zone of the hydrothermal system (close to the surface) and is frequently imposed over other alteration zones (e.g., over potassic and sericitic alteration) when the surface is degraded ( The hydrothermal system studied here evolved from conditions favouring the stability of orthoclase, to those favouring the stability of illite and kaolinite. This sequence indicates evolution of the hydrothermal system from a high-temperature and intermediately acidic (dominated by K Fluid-fault interaction is an important process during the development of fault systems under the influence of hydrothermal fluids. The precipitation of new minerals (e.g Hydrolysis, or hydrogen metasomatism, leading to the replacement of feldspar by clays ( In light of the current interpretations, we infer that the effects of hydrothermal fluids on the mechanics of faults can be summarized as a combination of: (1) weakening by alteration; and (2) hardening by precipitation. These processes can occur both in fault cores and damage zones. However, (2) is more localized in the fault cores at RT than (1), locally forming faults that have a strong core surrounded by a weaker damage zone. The failure of a fault is controlled by the strength of its weakest component. Consequently, the strength of the faults described is dictated by a combination of the processes described above, regardless of the strength that the core can reach locally. Therefore, it should be expected that hydrothermal fluids related to porphyry copper deposits will weaken developing faults, decreasing their capacity to accumulate stress. All the black faults (Kalatche System) in the Radomiro Tomic porphyry copper deposit exhibit banded quartz veins adjacent to their cores or contain fragments of the veins within them. In contrast, not all veins are faulted. Mineralogically, the faults are characterized by pyrite-rich cores with variable levels of silicification, surrounded by irregular haloes of clay-bearing altered granite. Plagioclase from the protolith is fully replaced by clay, both in the cores and haloes. Orthoclase is preserved in fault haloes (damage zone) but fully replaced by clay in the cores. These faults were initiated by brittle shear along banded quartz veins, after the hydrofracturing that produced the veining ceased. Subsequently, the hydrothermal system was channelled into the faults, during the onset of phyllic alteration. The main effect of the hydrothermal fluids was the hydrolytic destruction of the feldspar all across the faults, which weakened the rocks and enhanced slip along faults. Such weakening also promoted slip along faults and formation of fractures, increasing the permeability of the system in a positive feedback loop between alteration, fluids and brittle deformation. Hydrothermal fluids also precipitated a significant quantity of minerals to the fault cores, partially sealing them. This process probably strengthened the core rock with respect to their previous states, and possibly even with respect to the surrounding rocks. Although fault cores tend to be strengthened by precipitation, the total strength of the faults is expected to be reduced, due to the destruction of feldspars in the fault cores and damage zones. Replacement of the feldspars by clay weakens the faults and reduces the capacity of faults to accumulate stress.
