Fe3O4 octahedra are synthesized by dealloying Al–15Fe (at.%) alloy ribbons in 5molL−1 NaOH solution at 95±5°C for 2h. The electrochemical properties of the Fe3O4 octahedra as anode material for lithium-ion batteries are investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are employed to study the structural evolution. The results show that the Al can be leached out from Al–15Fe ribbons consisting of α-Al (Fe) and Al13Fe4 phases to obtain regular Fe3O4 octahedra. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling of the Fe3O4 octahedra in half cell configuration with lithium at 50mAg−1 current density exhibits first discharge capacity of 1077mAhg−1, 16.3% higher than the theoretical capacity of Fe3O4. The cell shows stability at charge–discharge rate of 50mAg−1 and good capacity retention rate up to 38 cycles. The coulombic efficiency of the Fe3O4 octahedra remains as nearly 100% except for the first cycle. Moreover, dealloying strategy is suggested to be facile in large-scale production of superior anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, indicating its promising prospect for practical application.Dealloying, which is referred to a selective corrosion process, has been widely used to fabricate nanoporous metals, during which the more active component is dissolved away from the precursor yet the less active component is remained in nanoporous microstructure Recently, some researchers have found that dealloying of Al–Fe alloy (−1.662 Over the past few decades, Fe Attributed to the advantage of dealloying and melt-spinning technique (preparing the precursor alloy ribbons), in this paper, we synthesized regular Fe The alloy ingot with nominal compositions of Al–15Fe (at.%) was prepared from Al (purity, 99.999 Dealloying of these rapidly solidified Al–15Fe alloy ribbons was carried out in 5 The phases of the rapidly solidified Al–15Fe alloys and the as-dealloyed samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2200) in the 2 Electrochemical experiments were performed with coin cell (CR2025) using lithium foil as counter and reference electrode. The working electrode was fabricated by mixing the as-dealloyed Fe  The lithium storage capacity of the as-prepared Fe The initial discharge process shows a total capacity of 1077 Though it needs an in-depth investigation to probe the mechanism for excellent property of the dealloyed Fe Fe This work is supported by the
