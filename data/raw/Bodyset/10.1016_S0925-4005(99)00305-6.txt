CO2 gas-sensor was fabricated by coating and heat-treating the drop of LaCl3⋅7H2O solution on the surface of SnO2 thick film. The effects of several factors, such as heat-treatment temperature, La concentration of coating-drop and humidity on CO2 sensitivity of thick film sensor were investigated in this work. The starting material, LaCl3⋅7H2O, for coating was phase-transformed by heat-treating, from LaCl3 to LaOCl at temperature range of 367–738°C, and from LaOCl to La2O3 over 773°C. The maximum sensitivity appeared at heat-treatment temperature of 1000°C and La concentration of 1×10−2 M La. The sensitivity showed a tendency to decrease remarkably with increasing humidity as well as with decreasing oxygen partial pressure.Semiconductor-type gas-sensor for sensing CO Also, we used lanthanum chloride as a starting material in this work, whereas they used lanthanum nitride or lanthanum acetate in previous works. The systematic studies on the formation of lanthanum compound by heat-treatment and the CO SnO LaCl The phase-transformation and crystallinity of La compound after various heat-treatments were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). X-ray diffraction experiments were performed with a D/MAX-II A (Rigaku, Japan), operating at 30 kV and 25 mA with Cu Kα radiation. Thermal analyses of La compound were conducted by TG/DTA (Seiko, SSC/5200) using reference powder of Al Sensor response to CO La compound of LaCl The experimental results of    Our best sensor for CO  The starting material, LaCl The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Korea Research Foundation made in the program year of 1997.
