In this study, poly(l-lactic acid)/gelatin composite fibrous matrixes were prepared by electrospinning and were immersed in five times simulated body fluid (SBF) to induce flaky-like minerals depositing on fiber surface. After being subjected to calcination, the flaky-like apatite minerals transformed into hexagonal hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals under proper sintering temperature and time along with the complete removal of organic fibers. The obtained hexagonal HA crystals demonstrated similar morphology and crystallinity to those obtained by calcining antlers and human tibia. The results suggested that the combination of biomineralization and calcination was a possible way to produce biomimetic calcium-phosphate apatite in vitro, which had wide use in bone tissue engineering.Mineralized organizations like bone are biocomposites, and mainly composed of collagen fibril and carbonated hydroxyapatite (HA) PLLA/gelatin composite fibrous sheets were prepared by dissolving same amount of PLLA (Sigma, Mw=10 Pure gelatin fibers were easily swollen and agglomerated in contacting with water, and pure PLLA fibers were poor in inducing the nucleation of apatite. However, the PLLA/gelatin composite fibers had been proven good templates to induce apatite deposition for two reasons The flaky-like morphology of the apatites obtained by biomineralization was far from the shape of apatite in natural tissues. As shown in However, the calcination process had significant effect on the morphology, and crystal structure of HA derived from flaky-like biomineralized apatite. Calcining temperature and time were two key parameters to guarantee the formation of apatite resembling biological HA. At first, the calcining time was set as 1 With the calcining temperature being determined 1000 By choosing proper SBF, the flaky-like apatite deposited biomimetically on polymeric substrates could be a good source to produce hexagonal-shaped HA by calcination, whose morphology and structure well resembled the natural minerals from antlers and human tibia. In this producing process, calcining temperature and time were two key parameters to enhance the growth of (3 The authors acknowledged the financial support from
