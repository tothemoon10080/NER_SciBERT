This study reviews the innovations and optimizations in biogas production from the biological perspective reported by recently published patents and research works. The proposed biological strategies can be categorized into three different groups, i.e., upstream, mainstream, and downstream approaches. In the first part of this review, upstream strategies, including pretreatments by fungal, microbial consortium, and enzymatic as well as some other biological methods including microaeration, composting, ensiling, and genetic and metabolic engineering are discussed in detail. The impacts of upstream strategies on biogas production as well as their potentials in further improving the biogas industry are comprehensively scrutinized. Despite their promising impacts on biogas production, such biological innovations are time-consuming and require extra equipment and facilities that should be addressed in future studies. Overall, most information on biogas production has been generated through lab-scale investigations and not by commercial plants, undermining the commercial value of these data for the right decision-making. Pilot data would be necessary for techno-economic analyses with acceptable accuracies. Therefore, the future efforts should be directed toward providing the missing data for re-engineering designs, calculations, and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the newly designed biogas plants.

These include facilitated access to economic raw materials and pretreatment of such feedstocks as well as those of low digestibility using different processes such as milling, comminution, disintegration, hydrolysis, and thermal and chemical treatments to increase their biogas production yields [ The present work is aimed at comprehensively examining and discussing the biological innovations targeted in enhancing the biogas production process. Generally, the biological strategies proposed to boost biogas production can be classified into three different categories, i.e., upstream, mainstream, and downstream approaches. In the first part of this review, the upstream approaches including various pretreatment procedures (i.e., fungal, microbial consortium, MC, enzymatic), microaeration, composting, and ensiling as well as efforts put into the genetic and metabolic engineering of target microorganisms are reviewed and discussed in detail. In the second part of this review, mainstream and downstream biological approaches are comprehensively presented and critically discussed. Furthermore, current challenges faced in optimizing biogas production processes, future prospects, and practical implications of the present work are discussed in detail. Biogas could be potentially generated from different substrates ( Biologically, AD is a four-step process, including hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis, through which organic materials are converted into methane by distinct bacterial and archaeal consortia [ The overall conversion rates of the simpler compounds generated into methane are different, i.e., acetate > ethanol > butyrate > propionate [ Pretreatment is in general intended to increase the availability (i.e., digestability) of the substrates for AD and consequently to enhance biogas production [ To address the above-mentioned drawbacks and to enhance the rate and efficiency of biological pretreatments, application of specific fungi, MC, and enzymes, as well as techniques such as microaeration, ensiling, partial composting, and genetic and metabolic engineering of microorganisms (strain improvement) have been widely investigated. A summary of the recent studies (2013–2018) conducted on the application of various pretreatment techniques to increase biogas/methane production from different feedstocks is presented in  Under the general AD conditions, lignin remains intact shielding the degradable carbohydrate polymers against decomposition [ The application of fungal pretreatment technology is presumed to be cheap; however, it is presently not. Currently, the production cost for each gram of sugar could be at minimum about ¢1.6 which is up to 4–15 times higher compared with conventional pretreatment technologies [ These AF are capable of biomass saccharification by producing a wide range of efficient cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic, and glycolytic enzymes and therefore, could assist with decreasing the retention time typically required to complete the process [ Overall, an ideal economically feasible fungal pretreatment technology must be a stand-alone short process that does not require any sterilization process and subsequent enzymatic treatments. In this context, lignocellulosic feedstocks that are recalcitrant towards AD process could be economically converted into sugars while substantially saving capital as well as operating costs. For instance, the above-mentioned production cost of sugar could be decreased by up to 62.5% (from 1.6 to $0.6/kg) if unsterilized lignocellulosic feedstock is digested by fungi with 90% glucose yield in 7 d [ A mixture of several isolated microorganisms or specialized MC (consisting of at least of 2–4 strains) has been proven to be more effective in degrading lignocelluloses than individual strains [ In 2016, Poszytek et al. [ Overall, MC pretreatment does not require any sterilization step and has the potential to be integrated with AD (i.e., simultaneous pretreatment and AD). However, detailed physiological characterizations of various microorganisms involved in lignocellulose conversion into biogas (particularly methanogens) in order to construct a compatible and efficient simultaneous MC pretreatment and AD process are required. Enzymes such as cellulases, cellobiases, endoglucanase, xylanases, pectinases, and ligninolytic enzymes (e.g., laccases, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase) as well as amylases and proteases have been used to convert various feedstocks into AD digestible sugars for increasing biogas production rate under mild conditions to avoid formation of inhibitory compounds [ In a study, a cocktail of proteolytic enzymes were derived from For enzymatic pretreatment of wastes and wastewaters containing oils and fats, biosurfactants are applied as an important class of additives for stimulating enzymatic (lipolytic) activity by increasing the solubility and bioavailability of these components of feedstocks [ In a different study, a novel method was introduced in which a plant-derived biosurfactant such as saponin was used to enhance the enzymatic pretreatment of waste activated sludge [ Overall, a sterilization step is required for any successful high sugar yield enzymatic process to eliminate the action of endogenous microorganisms consuming the released sugars before the AD [ Aerobic biological pretreatments such as microaeration, ensiling, and composting prior to AD can be effective in treating complex substrates [ Ensiling is also a commonly used and promising technique to pretreat wet biomass before AD [ Composting may also be used as a pretreatment prior to the biogas production. The main purpose of implementation of composting before the biogas production process is generally to increase the feedstock temperature through auto-heating, thus reducing heat requirements for biogas production start-up [ A large gap still exists between the attributes of the existing strains used at different stages of biogas production and upgrading. Although in addition to the pretreatment stage, such enhanced strains could also be used during mainstream and downstream processes, but their development needs to be accomplished beforehand, and therefore, related activities are classified as an upstream approach. Metabolic engineering has attracted much attention to develop robust and efficient strains [ For improving strain performance during AD, different metabolic engineering approaches, including high-throughput screening, high-throughput metagenomic sequencing, gene synthesis, and enzyme/pathway engineering, have been put into practice [ The enhancement of native hydrolytic microorganisms through genetic modification is one of the metabolic engineering approaches. Another approach is using non-hydrolytic microorganisms of high growth yield as host and transforming them by incorporation of the genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases and/or hemicellulases [ It should be quoted that although through genetic modifications, advantageous features including enhanced hydrolysis performance could be introduced into cells, the industrial-scale utilization of such engineered strains may be limited by the regulations governing the application of genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) [ Different upstream approaches, including fungal, MC, enzymatic, pretreatment as well as microaeration, composting, and ensiling have been employed prior to AD to improve biogas yield and productivity. However, most of these techniques are associated with a number of bottlenecks hindering their commercial applications. General examples of such barriers include being time-consuming and requiring extra equipment and facilities, both of which increasing the operating and capital costs. In addition, an appropriate upstream biological method could vary depending on the applied digestion system and the type of feedstock used, further complicating its integration with the AD process. Concerning fungal and MC pretreatments, efforts have been focused on isolating and engineering microorganisms capable of biogas production from recalcitrant feedstock such as lignocellulose. However, the application of GMOs offering favorable characteristics, leading to enhanced rate and yield of biological pretreatment is controversial owing to biosafety issue. It is also vital to consider the economic aspects, energy consumption, and environmental aspects of upstream biological methods when selecting the most efficient method for a given feedstock. Therefore, after all, laboratory experiments, technical, and economical evaluations should also be conducted to select and implement the most proper methods before AD. Unfortunately, such specific data and information are hardly available in the published literature. Global economic models are expected to change in the future in response to the growing concerns over human health and environmental quality. Among the envisioned consequences would be higher penalties/taxes imposed on the environmental features of production systems in use. The application of biological methods of environmental-friendly nature is bound to increase at industrial biogas plants for upstream purposes, despite their present bottlenecks. Therefore, in addition to techno-economical evaluations, it is instrumental to scrutinize these methods using various sustainability assessment tools such as LCA analysis and exergy-based approaches. The findings of such investigations would pave the way for more effective implementation of these eco-friendly methods as a replacement for their physicochemical counterparts. Moreover, they could also assist policy/decision makers in defining competence-based models of initiatives for the various stakeholders of the biogas industry. To this end, this review has strived to comprehensively summarize and discuss upstream innovations reported over the recent years on biogas production from the biological viewpoint with an ambition to resolve the obstacles limiting efficient performance and economic rationalization of the biogas production systems. This review paper will contribute to recognizing the recent upstream biological innovations and strategies to improve biogas production and motivate researchers to further contribute to this field. It is important to highlight that breakthroughs or innovative concepts are sometimes very close to the commercial stage, and therefore, summarizing and investigating such progresses, as performed herein, could play a significant role in facilitating their industrial penetration and possibly commercialization in the future. It should also be noted that the second part of this review comprehensively presents and critically discuss mainstream and downstream biological approaches developed to boost biogas production. Given the pros and cons of various upstream approaches, an effective upstream method should: (1) improve the microbial digestibility of feedstock during biogas production; (2) limit the degradation carbohydrates or their loss; (3) hinder the generation of inhibitors; (4) operate on minimum and low-cost chemicals or water; (5) operate on inexpensive equipment/reactors; (6) require low size reactors; (7) need low energy input in the form of heat and power; (8) limit the need for waste disposal, (9) be cost-effective and environmentally-friendly, (10) suit a large variety of feedstock with minimum modifications, (11) preferably be conducted with the AD process simultaneously, and (12) ideally, require no sterilization step. It is concluded that the technology used for biogas production is generally quite old and most plants are running based on old technologies. Therefore, retrofitting and modification are necessary for many new biogas plants. Unfortunately, the primary data required for re-engineering designs and calculations are not available for most indicated approaches like the kinetics data, and the data required for LCA. For instance, for the evaluation of an upgrading system at a commercial-scale, the process should be optimized by using exergy-based approaches. Such optimizations need accurate mass and energy balances throughout the process; however, most lab-scale studies fail to provide such data. On the other hand, for conducting techno-economic analyses with acceptable accuracies, pilot data would be necessary, however, in most cases, pilot data are either unavailable or unpublished. Therefore, future research and development efforts should be directed toward providing these data. In addition, most information regarding biogas yield have been generated through lab-scale investigations and not by commercial plants. This would undermine the commercial value of these data and information and subsequently, rendering the decision-making process difficult for biogas plant owners and engineers targeting different levels and types of upgrading.
