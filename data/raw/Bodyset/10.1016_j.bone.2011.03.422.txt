 One limitation of the comparison between theoretical prediction and BMDD measurements is due to the fact that the experimental data are affected by the stochastic nature of the backscattering of electrons and the finite acquisition time. We have now devised an approach using regularization tools to deconvolve and correct measured BMDDs. As a result, the reference BMDD for healthy human adults could be defined with improved precision. Moreover, the mathematical model was applied to situations where the mineralization process is disturbed. The inadequate mineralization in osteomalacia and the increased bone turnover at menopause both lead to a shift of the BMDD histogram towards lower mineral contents, in comparison to reference. With the use of mathematical modeling, it became possible to differentiate the time evolution of the BMDD, for both disease scenarios. The influence of Sr-treatment was also considered in the mathematical model, taking into account the difference in electron backscattering between Sr and Ca. When about 5% of the Ca atoms are replaced by Sr in the newly formed bone only [3], the model predicts a strong transient narrowing of the BMDD.
