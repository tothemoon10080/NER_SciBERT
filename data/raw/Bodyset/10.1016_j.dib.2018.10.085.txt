The data presented in this paper are related to the research article entitled “Synthesis, characterisation and electrochemistry of eight Fe coordination compounds containing substituted 2-(1-(4-R-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)pyridine ligands, R=CH3, OCH3, COOH, F, Cl, CN, H and CF3.” (Conradie et al., 2019) [1]. This paper presents electrochemical and density functional theory data of 4-phenyl-substituted dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})iron(II) compounds, containing differently substituted 2-(1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)pyridine ligands (L2 – L9) (Tawfiq et al., 2014) [2]. Density functional theory calculated data of five different structural isomers for each compound, consistently show that the title compounds are octahedral and that the isomer with the chloride atoms, the pyridine nitrogens and the triazol nitrogens trans to each other, has the lowest energy. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) data and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) data of dichloro(bis{2-[1-(phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN3]pyridine-κN})iron(II) show origin for the preference of the trans isomer.  This data provide DFT optimized structures, properties and energies for the different structural isomers of eight differently R-substituted dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN Natural bonding orbital data of dichloro(bis{2-[1-(phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN Quantum theory of atoms in molecules data of dichloro(bis{2-[1-(phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN The 4-phenyl-R-substituent in dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN This data provide cyclic voltammograms at different scan rates of the Fe The dichloro(bis{2-[1-(4-R-phenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN The computational chemistry calculated relative energies, obtained for the different structural isomers of each compound, are given in The Fe(II) complexes of this study are high spin S = 2 Natural bonding orbital (NBO) data for Fe and the atoms bonded to Fe in dichloro{bis[2-(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN Data of a quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) study of dichloro{bis[2-(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl-κN Cyclic voltammograms of the Fe Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in the gas phase on the neutral compounds, using the B3LYP functional and the triple-ζ basis set 6–311 G(d,p) on all atoms.
