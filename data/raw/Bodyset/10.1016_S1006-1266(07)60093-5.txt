The shear characteristics of soil-structure interfaces with different roughness are studied systematically by using the DRS-1 high normal stress and residual shear apparatus. The experimental results indicate that, under a relatively high normal stress, normal stress and the coefficient of structural roughness are the most important factors affecting the mechanical interface characteristics. The relationship between shear stress and shear displacement of the soil-structure interface is a hyperbolic curve with high regression accuracy. Based on our experimental results, a nonlinear elastic constitutive model of the soil-structure interface under relatively high normal stress is established with a definite physical meaning for its parameters. The model can predict the strain hardening behavior of the soil during the shearing process. The results show an encouraging agreement with experimental data from direct shear tests.
