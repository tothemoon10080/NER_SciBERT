This investigation is concerned to evaluate the effect of double quenching and tempering (DQT) with conventional quenching and tempering (CQT) heat treatment processes on microstructure and mechanical behavior of a commercially developed hot rolled AISI 4140 type steel. Comparison of microstructure and mechanical properties of DQT and CQT heat treated specimens have been established in details. Optical and scanning electron microscopies have been used to follow impurity concentration and microstructural changes, and their relation to the associated mechanical properties. The results indicate that the improvement of mechanical properties particularly impact toughness of DQT heat treated specimens is much higher than that of the CQT condition, and this observation is rationalized in terms of finer austenite grain size developed in the DQT condition providing much finer martensitic packets within the grains and a lower level of impurity concentration of sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) near the prior austenite grain boundaries as well.The influence of microstructure on mechanical properties of low alloy steels has been a subject of considerable research interest in physical metallurgy The AISI 4140 steel used in the present study was developed by Iranian Alloy Steel Co, Yazd, Iran. The melt steel was refined by various methods to reduce the level of impurities such as sulfur and phosphorous. The diameter of bar was 25 The oversized Charpy and tensile specimens were cut from the as received 25 To remove oxide and decarburized layers, the machining of finalized specimen size was carried out after all of the heat treatment processes. The mechanical properties including tensile strengths, elongation, reduction in cross-section area, Charpy impact energy and hardness were measured using the average of three experimental results for each heat treatment process. Hardness measurements were done by Rockwell method and reported as RC hardness numbers in accordance with ASTM E18 standards The fracture surfaces of impact tested specimens were examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM) model TESCAN-VEGA-II at an accelerating voltage of 15 The engineering curves of stress–strain (s–e) of CQT and DQT heat treated specimens are drawn in According to the results of impact tests on the heat treated specimens, the DQT heat treatment shows a considerable improvement in toughness compared to the CQT heat treatment. This is rationalized to be due to the almost 50% of improvement in austenite grain refinement developed in the DQT specimens. Variation in hardness on tempered samples is given in Optical metallography was carried out in the as-quenched condition to study the variation in the microstructure and prior austenite grain size for the CQT and DQT heat treatment processes. It is interesting to point out that the martensitic crystal size followed by quenching has been reported to be proportional to the grain size of austenite prior to quenching  Typical EDS line scan analysis of impurity elements such as sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) for the CQT and DQT heat treated specimens are displayed in It has been well established by several investigators The SEM fractographs of impact tested specimens of CQT and DQT heat treated specimens are shown in It has been well established that the fracture process, in a low alloy steel is in a manner in which the voids are first formed at MnS inclusions which are usually the largest, then at smaller oxide inclusions and finally at small carbides It is interesting to point out that the prior austenite grains are not longer presented in the hardened CQT and DQT specimens, and therefore the experimental results shown are logically reflected the effect of prior austenite grain size on the martensitic packet size ( A study of the DQT heat treatment process in association with CQT standard condition in AISI 4140 steel produced the following conclusions. For almost an identical hardness and strength following CQT and DQT heat treatment processes, the DQT condition results in a significant improvement of 23% in impact toughness as compared to the CQT condition. The corresponding prior austenite grain size of DQT heat treated specimens has been about 50% finer (5.8 Although, the improvement of impact toughness in the DQT heat treated condition is considered to be in part due to the formation of finer austenite grains and so finer martensitic packets compared to CQT treatment, the improvement has been also associated with very uniform distribution and a lower level of impurity concentration observed at the prior austenite grain boundary as well. The DQT treatment is less sensitive to temper martensite embrittlement followed by tempering heat treatment because of a lower distribution of impurity elements of S and P segregated at the prior austenite grain boundaries. Consistent with the improvement in ductility and impact energy, the dimples in the fracture surfaces of DQT specimen are larger compared to CQT one.
