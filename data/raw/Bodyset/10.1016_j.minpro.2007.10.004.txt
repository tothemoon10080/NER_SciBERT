57Fe–Mössbauer spectroscopy is demonstrated to be a sensitive phase analysis tool for control of the ilmenite reduction process in a commercial rotary kiln. Knowledge of recoil-free fractions for each of the key Fe-bearing phases would further reduce the error of quantitative determination. In this case, the feed material is predominantly pseudorutile and rutile and the key phases are confirmed to evolve in two stages, namely the formation of ilmenite from pseudorutile (Fe3+
                     →Fe2+) followed by the reduction of ilmenite into metallic iron and rutile (Fe2+
                     →Fe) via ferrous pseudobrookite.The objective of this work was to assess the potential of Both Mössbauer spectroscopy and XRD have a long history of application in the mining industry because of their phase-identification capability (refer to the recent review by Because of its commercial importance, a range of ilmenite reduction paths have been investigated and their chemistry is well documented in the literature. Research into the carbothermic reduction of ilmenite has been conducted mainly under controlled laboratory conditions ( To the best of our knowledge, the only previous phase analysis of ilmenite reduction in a commercial rotary kiln was conducted by Ilmenite reduction in the commercial kiln being investigated employs the Becher Process ( The The XRD patterns were recorded using Cu K The In a qualitative sense, both techniques map out the evolution of the key phases and This is in agreement with the laboratory reduction of natural ilmenite sands in CO The overall reactions in the second step (FeTiO In the quantitative sense, The true situation almost certainly involves a combination of these two causes. However, without careful determination of the recoil-free fractions for well-characterised single phase specimens, they cannot be separated. Nevertheless, if the effects are constant throughout the reduction process, it should be possible to achieve close agreement between the XRD and Finally, in addition to the four key Fe-bearing phases, the The third of the unidentified sub-spectra is a doublet (never more than 9.3% of the total spectrum intensity) with an isomer shift of  Banchachit Saensunon gratefully acknowledges the Royal Thai Army for its financial support.
