Age hardening in a Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co alloy has been studied at different aging temperatures and times. It has been observed that this alloy exhibits considerable age hardening with hardness increasing from 225H
                     V to a peak value of 320H
                     V on aging. Yield strength increases from 360 to 710 MPa and tensile strength from 610 to 890 MPa on aging the solution treated alloy for peak strength. The electrical conductivity of the alloy is found to be 4 and 8% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS) in solution treated and peak aged conditions, respectively. Addition of cobalt to Cu–4.5Ti alloy reduces the aging temperature and time for attaining peak hardness. Ordered, metastable and coherent Cu4Ti (βl) precipitate is found to be responsible for maximum strengthening of the alloy. Interestingly, absence of equilibrium precipitate Cu3Ti and presence of Cu4Ti phase have been noticed in the overaged condition. The absence of Cu3Ti is attributed to the addition of cobalt. In addition, intermetallic phases of Ti and Co like Ti2Co and TiCo have been observed in solution treated, peak aged and overaged conditions. Cold work prior to aging enhances the hardness, strength and electrical conductivity of the alloy. For example, 90% cold work followed by aging at 400°C for 1 h increases the hardness from 320 to 430H
                     V; yield and tensile strengths, from 710 to 1185 and 890 to 1350 MPa, respectively, and electrical conductivity, marginally by 1% IACS. While mechanical properties are comparable, electrical conductivity of Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co is less than that of the binary Cu–4.5Ti alloy in the solution treated as well as peak aged conditions.Copper and copper alloys are widely used because of their excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, outstanding resistance to corrosion, ease of fabrication as well as good strength and fatigue resistance Studies on ternary alloying additions such as vanadium, aluminum, alumina, boron and nickel to binary Cu–Ti alloys have been carried out by earlier investigators A 30 kg melt of the Cu–Ti–Co alloy was made in STOKES Vacuum Induction Melting (VIM) furnace with oxygen free electronic (OFE) copper, Cu–26wt.%Ti master alloy and pure cobalt metal as charge materials. The ingot was homogenized at 850°C for 24 h and analysed for titanium and cobalt contents. The analysed composition of the ingot was found to be 4.5 wt.% Ti and 0.5 wt.% Co. The homogenized ingot was hot forged and rolled into rods and flats of suitable sizes. Specimens from the hot rolled rod were solution treated (860°C/2 h/WQ) and aged at 400, 450 and 500°C for different times. Vickers hardness ( Thin discs of ∼0.10 mm thickness were sliced from the heat-treated samples using an ISOMET saw and they were further reduced to ∼20 μm by mechanical polishing. Discs of 3 mm diameter were punched out from these thinned sections and electropolished in a Fischionne twin jet electropolisher using a solution of 30 vol% HNO The influence of aging time on hardness of the solution treated Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co alloy compared with the binary Cu–4.5Ti The effect of cold work on aging at 400, 450 and 500°C is shown in The influence of prior cold work on the tensile properties of the present alloy after peak aging for maximum hardness at 400°C is shown in The tensile properties and electrical conductivity of the Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co alloy are compared with those of Cu–4.5Ti and Cu–5.4Ti alloys In the peak-aged condition, the strengths of the Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co alloy and of the binary Cu–4.5Ti alloy The electrical conductivity (EC) of the Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co alloy is lower than that of the binary Cu–4.5Ti and Cu–5.4Ti alloys in both solution treated and peak aged conditions. In the solution treated condition, the EC of the ternary alloy is found to be 4.0% IACS which is lower than that of the binary Cu–4.5Ti alloy by nearly 50%. However, it increased to 8.0% IACS on peak aging, the extent of increase being 50% of the solution treated alloy. The lower levels of EC in Cu–4.5Ti–0.5Co, as compared to the binary Cu–4.5Ti alloy are mainly attributed to the Co being in solid solution in copper. Gregory et al.
