The objective of this study is to model potential emission and economic savings from reburning coal with CB and compare those savings against competing technologies. A spreadsheet computer program was developed to model capital, operation, and maintenance costs for CB reburning, SCR, and selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR). A base case run of the economics model, showed that a CB reburn system retrofitted on an existing 500MWe coal plant would have a net present worth of −$80.8 million. Comparatively, an SCR system under the same base case input parameters would have a net present worth of +$3.87 million. The greatest increase in overall cost for CB reburning was found to come from biomass drying and processing operations.

Biomass transport distances and the unavailability of suitable, low-ash CB may require future research to concentrate on smaller capacity coal-fired units between 50 and 300MWe.Cattle biomass (cattle manure) has been proposed for use as a reburn fuel for nitrogen oxide (NO If these results can translate into similar NO The purpose of this study was to predict and gage the economic viability of reburning coal with CB at existing coal plants against several major parameters such as dollar values of avoided emissions, biomass processing costs, and transportation costs. This study was conducted by generating a mathematical model from engineering and economic analyses of the drying, transportation, and combustion systems involved in the overall process of utilizing CB as a reburn fuel in existing coal plants. The methodology and justification of the model will be covered later in this article, but first some discussion of CB and reburning processes is necessary. American agriculture, particularly animal farming, has become a highly industrialized business over the past 50 years. The larger and more productive of these animal farms are commonly referred to as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) or “super farms”. Housing dairy cows, beef cattle, and other traditional farm animals and also disposing of the large amounts of manure produced from them are significant undertakings The three largest beef cattle states in the US are Texas, Kansas and Nebraska, respectively The usefulness of CB as a fuel for combustion and emission control systems can be determined from ultimate and heat value analyses of each biomass fuel. These analyses are summarized in Low-ash biomass from cement-paved lots and feed yards has a comparable amount of ash to TXL, which suggests that boilers setup to burn lignite could probably handle burning LA DB or LA FB. However, high ash fuels with contents up to 68% (on a dry basis) are certainly not suitable for most combustion systems. Please refer to contributions from Oh et al. The primary NO A basic illustration of the reburning process is shown in The most common reburn fuel is natural gas. Conventional gas reburn systems can reduce NO There are some more commercially available secondary NO Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) is a similar post combustion technology to SCR, except that the NH A spreadsheet model for a single coal-fired unit utilizing CB as a reburn fuel was developed to gage the economic viability of retrofitting CB co-combustion systems in existing coal-fired facilities. The methods, assumptions, and research involved in generating this model are discussed in this section. Once the model was completed, a reference or base case run was completed. From this base case result, several major parameters were varied over a certain range to demonstrate the sensitivity of the overall cost (or benefit) of reburning coal with CB. To demonstrate the spreadsheet program's capabilities, and for the sake of brevity, only one case of fueling setup for the power plant was considered for the present article. For this case, the primary fuel (PF) burned in the boiler's primary burn zone (PZ) was pure Wyoming sub-bituminous coal. Whereas the reburn fuel (RF) injected into the reburn zone (RZ) was cattle biomass. Blends of these fuels in either the PZ or RZ are not discussed here; however, they too can be represented with the present model. Plant operating parameters such as the plant capacity, the overall fueling rate, the capacity factor, the plant's annual operating hours, the higher heating values of the primary and reburn fuels, and the percentage of the plant's heat rate supplied by the reburn fuel are usually known or design variables. Other parameters such as the plant's overall heat rate, the mass fueling rates of the primary and reburn fuels, and the plant's overall efficiency, can generally be computed from these inputs. Thermo-physical properties of CB, such as bulk density and specific heat, and modeling equations of these properties were discussed by Bohnhoff et al. The cost of processing and importing coal was a simple dollar per tonne (1.0 Mg) input value prescribed to the spreadsheet program. However, this was not the case for CB. The cost of preparing the biomass for the reburning process needed to be determined from known values of fueling rate, biomass moisture percentage, labor, distance between the plant and feeding operation and other drying and transportation cost parameters. Cattle biomass reburn fuel must be supplied to a coal-fired operation from neighboring animal feeding operations. Therefore, a distribution system may be envisioned where there are a number of small dryers (rated between dry matter of 0.5–2.0 The cost of transporting the dried CB to the power plant was also included in modeling studies. One of the most important parameters was the average distance between the animal feeding operation(s) and the power plant. This distance determined the number of hauling vehicles (trucks) required to move the biomass, as well as the number of round trips that those trucks took per year to consistently supply the reburn system at the power plant. Alternatively, Ghafoori et al. Therefore hauling transportation analysis was adopted largely from a USEPA Cattle biomass reburning systems may, at least, affect three types of emissions from coal-fired units: nitrogen oxides (NO Some of the more important parameters in determining the emissions from biomass combustion were the percentages of moisture, ash and each combustible element in the fuel. Hence, the ultimate and heat value analyses listed in An uncontrolled NO NO Finally, the amount of inert ash produced by the plant was expected to increase due to the generally higher ash content of CB, even LA CB, compared to most coals. Moreover, since ash must either be sold for exterior usage, or disposed in landfills, the results from this analysis was used to compute overall dollar savings or costs from ash production. Sulfur oxide (SO The cost of installing an environmental retrofit on a coal-fired power plant can be broken up into three different components: capital cost, fixed operation and maintenance costs (FO&M), and variable operation and maintenance costs (VO&M). The capital cost is the initial investment of purchasing and installing all necessary equipment so that the system is fully functional. Fixed operation and maintenance costs are generally incurred whether the system is running or not. These costs typically include labor and overhead items such as fuel feeders, grinders, and air and fuel injectors, whereas, VO&M costs include handling and delivery of raw materials and waste disposal In the economic spreadsheet model, both primary and secondary NO The NO Reburn technologies were not included in the latest version of the IPM. Thus, the main challenge of this study was to estimate the cost performance of a CB reburning system even when only experimental results and pilot scale tests have been conducted for these systems, and few applications of gas and coal reburning systems existed for comparison. Work by Zamansky et al. Some estimates of coal and biomass reburn capital costs are presented in Annual monetary values pertaining to NO With all annual costs computed, each cost component of the NO coal fired in a unit with primary NO coal fired in a unit with primary controls retrofitted with a CB reburn system, coal fired in a unit with primary controls retrofitted with an SCR system, and coal fired in a unit with primary controls retrofitted with an SNCR system. An option to turn off primary NO One of the more common ways to indicate the economic bottom line of a project is to compute a net present worth (NPW) that is the equivalent combined value of all cash flows throughout the life of the project in present dollars. The first step in computing the NPW is to compute an operating income (or cost, if negative) for each year, Before computing the NPW, depreciation of capital and taxes on income must also be addressed. The depreciation method adopted for the present analysis was the modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS). The income after tax will be discounted by a factor: The NPW can be expressed as an annualized cost (or revenue) leveled throughout the life of the project. For this case, More information about computing depreciations, taxes, and NPWs can be found in the textbook by Newnan et al. Base case input parameters for a theoretical 500-MW From the base case inputs, a resulting reference run was completed. The heat energy released by the CB in the reburn zone of the boiler burner was found to be 2.38 Yet economically, the CB reburn system was found to have a NPC (negative NPW) of $80.8 million. The base case Year 1 cost components of the four possible operating conditions are juxtaposed in Comparatively, SCR was found to have an NPV (positive NPW) of $3.87 million. However, SCR was also found to have the highest capital cost. SNCR was found to have the cheapest capital investment cost, but the emission levels achieved by SNCR were assumed to be poorer than levels achieved by either CB reburning or SCR. The final step in this economic analysis was to vary some of the base case input parameters and study the sensitivity of the NPW and the annualized cost. This analysis will be discussed presently. The higher O&M costs for CB reburning were partly attributed to the relative expense of importing low-calorific value biomass to meet a set percentage of the plant's heat rate (for the base case, 10%). Since the ammonia, urea, or other reagents imported for competing technologies, such as SCR and SNCR, typically does not add to the fueling of the plant, O&M costs can stay relatively low for the same targeted NO Cattle biomass displaces some of the coal that must be purchased by the plant. For this reason, the profitability of a CB reburn system is extremely sensitive to the price of the displaced coal ( The overall annualized cost of a CB reburn system was also found to be sensitive to the dollar amount placed on emissions. For example, in The major advantage of reburning with CB over SCR is the possibility of saving on avoided CO However, the amount of ash in CB may limit the fueling rate of CB and thus the possible CO An important logistical parameter was found to be the average distance between the plant and the animal feeding operation(s) that supply the CB reburn fuel. The power plant should be near a geographical area of high agricultural biomass density. Goodrich et al.  For the base case 500 To handle these issues, several methods such as storage and reserve stockpiles of ready-to-fire CB can be kept near the power plant. Reducing the reburn fuel's heat rate contribution would also have to be considered. Or, perhaps the initial base case with a 500 MW  Assuming base case parameters, a cattle biomass (CB) reburn system retrofitted on an existing 500 The profitability of a CB reburning system retrofit on an existing coal-fired power plant can improve with higher coal prices, higher dollar values on NO A CO As of the publication of this paper, 27 coal-fired power plants are under construction in the US. Forty-four others are in the early stages of development  Mercury emissions may also affect the economics of CB reburn facilities. For future development of co-combustion systems, these emissions should be account for as well. Future work should also include extending the economic models developed here to co-firing, thermal gasification, and smaller on-the-farm combustion systems. Moreover, the discussion in this paper has concentrated on the economic benefits to the power plant facility, yet there are numerous benefits to farmers and others in the agricultural sector. Removing large quantities of manure from concentrated animal feeding operations decreases the possibility of phosphorus overloading and subsequent soil and water pollution by reducing the required capacity of manure storage structures such as anaerobic lagoons. Future work should also include investigations into the regional benefits such as job creation and rural economic development related to cattle biomass combustion.
