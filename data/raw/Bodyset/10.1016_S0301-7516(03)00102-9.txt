Bubble–particle interaction during flotation comprises of collision, attachment and detachment. This paper presents a review of our investigations into these microprocesses. Analysis of collision phenomenon focuses on the physicochemical hydrodynamics of water flow passing the rising bubbles. The influence of the fore-and-aft asymmetry of water streamlines and of the mobility of the bubble surface on collision efficiency is quantified. In the case of attachment, the analysis considers contact and attachment times and reveals that the available models for contact times are far from satisfactory. It may be necessary to include short-range hydrodynamic interactions for the modeling of contact times. At present, the actual attachment time is difficult to predict from first principles. Finally, the examination of detachment focuses on models for predicting the tenacity of attached particles. The influence of the bubble size on tenacity is also analyzed. Simplified equations describing the maximum particle size for stable attachment to air bubbles are derived.Particle–bubble interaction is the fundamental process in flotation. However, the principles governing the interactions are not fully understood. Due to the nature of governing effects, the particle–bubble interaction is divided into collision, attachment and detachment The collision efficiency (probability) is commonly defined as ratio of the real to ideal collision rate. Since a particle collides with a bubble if their axes of motion are sufficiently close, the collision efficiency, The limitations of In the numerator of In this equation, the particle velocities are scaled by dividing by the bubble slip velocity, It is important to note that the dot in The determination of The motion of particles approaching a bubble surface is influenced by a number of factors, including Mass of the particle: inertial effect Weight of the particle: gravitational effect Liquid flow passing the bubble: interceptional effect. The effect of each of these parameters has been modeled independently employing The integrated approach to determining the bubble–particle collision efficiency The BBO equation includes steady and unsteady drag, gravitational and inertial forces. The extended BBO equation is given by This equation is applied to very small particles that ideally satisfy Stokes Law. Empirically, it can be used with particles with diameter up to 60 μm. Possible extensions are discussed in As can be observed, the gravity, inertia and liquid flow (interception) effects are included in the description of the particle velocity by Modeling of the liquid flow field, Modeling of the particle velocity, Quantifying of The liquid flow around a gas bubble is governed by both the continuity and Navier–Stokes equations. Exact solutions to these equations can be analytically derived when the Reynolds number, The stream function for Stokes and potential flow, respectively, is given by Both of these flow fields yield symmetric profile with respect to the bubble equatorial plane as can be seen from The significance of the fore-and-aft asymmetry of the liquid flow passing the bubble at intermediate Reynolds number is illustrated in The asymmetry of liquid flow near the bubble surface influences both the particle–bubble collision and attachment interactions. Since the liquid streamlines are more compressed towards the front of the bubble, the radial liquid velocity changes its direction away from the bubble surface before the liquid passes the bubble equator (This change takes place at the equator in the Stokes flow and potential flow fields). As a consequence, the particle colliding area is not the entire front hemisphere of the bubble surface, and subsequently, the collision angle, The tangential and radial components of the liquid velocity, relative to the bubble surface and normalized by dividing by the bubble slip velocity, can be approximately derived using an expansion into the Taylor series and the numerical solution to the Navier–Stokes equations, which give. At immobile bubble surface At mobile bubble surface The BBO Solving for the particle velocity gives In this case, the particle velocity is simply equal to the settling plus liquid velocity. We have The collision efficiency is a function of the mobility of the bubble surface described by In the case of low Stokes number, the asymptotic solution to It is noted that this particle velocity and the corresponding particle tangential velocity For mobile surface, the tangential liquid velocity, The inertial effect was also analytically modeled by It is noted that there exist a number of equations for The attachment efficiency of particles is a function of the contact and attachment times. After colliding with bubble, the particle deforms the bubble surface and then slides along the surface until it reaches the maximum collision angle, Successful attachment involves three principal time steps, including: Thinning of the intervening liquid film to the critical thickness ( Rupture of the liquid film and formation for three-phase contact ( Expansion of the three-phase contact to form a stable aggregate ( The summation of the times of the above-described steps gives the attachment time, Of the three terms on the right-hand side of The particle sliding time can be determined by solving the BBO motion equation described in The tangential velocity, The particle sliding contact time as a function of the particle polar position is obtained by integrating This equation was compared to the experimental data obtained with different bubble Reynolds numbers Comparison of In The collision time has been modeled based on the oscillation of an effective mass, The available models are compared to the experimental data in The development of microfabricated cantilevers and atomic force microscopy has meant that the interaction forces between a bubble and a particle now can be measured Typical results of from a set of AFM measurements are shown in The results in The key issue in quantifying bubble–particle aggregate stability is to determine whether or not the adhesive force acting on the attached particle is sufficient large to prevent the particle detaching from the bubble surface under the dynamic forces existing in flotation cells. This section focuses on the force analysis and on the determination of the strength of the particle attachment. Adhesive forces acting on the three-phase contact line include: Capillary force, Hydrostatic pressure force, Buoyancy, The most important detaching forces are the particle weight, The simple case of attachment of a particle attached to a stationary free surface (a large air bubble) is illustrated in In terms The condition for equilibrium of forces on the particle attached to the gas–liquid interface described by Recent numerical solutions to the Young–Laplace equation describing the gas–liquid deformation The influence of the bubble size on the adhesive force can be included by modifying the pressure force term in The remaining terms in As expected, for the case of the particle radius being significantly smaller than the capillary strength (∼2.7 mm), The theoretical developments for the strength of the particle attachment described in Inserting For the maximum size,  The flotation process has been considered in relation to three steps of bubble–particle interactions, namely, collision, attachment and detachment. Collision efficiency can be determined from the particle approach velocity in the near proximity of the bubble surface. The liquid flow passing the bubble is characteristically fore-and-aft asymmetric. Particle velocity can be approximated from the BBO equation for particles in a moving liquid. Bubble surface mobility and inertia have been included in quantification of the collision efficiency, with the analysis giving good agreement with the experimental data. Attachment has also been analyzed in terms of the times involved and the nature of the bubble–particle interaction, i.e., collision or sliding. Available models for the sliding and collision contact times have, in general, shown to be limited in their application. Short-range hydrodynamic forces during bubble–particle attachment influences the bubble–particle contact. Determining both the bubble–particle attachment and contact times has to consider the short-range hydrodynamic interaction. Detachment and stability can better be quantified in terms of the tenacity of the particle attachment, which is the maximum of the forces and is a function of the particle and bubble size, the surface tension and the particle contact angle. Analyzing the tenacity and the simplification of forces acting on particle before detaching can predict the maximum floatable particle size. The turbulent collision efficiency has to be determined for the modeling of the actual flotation process.
