The relationship between energy consumption and the rock fragment size distribution is a basic question in rock fragmentation. Based on fractal rock mechanics and fracture mechanics theory, a new model of energy consumption during rock fragmentation is proposed. Moreover, dynamic uniaxial compressive tests on granite and sandstone under five different impact velocities are conducted with the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) device, the fragment size distribution of broken rock is obtained by sieving and the energy dissipation in the process is analyzed. The results from the tests show that fragments resulting from rock breakage under impact loading exhibit fractal features; the larger the fractal dimension, the higher the degree of rock fragmentation. Notably, the energy consumption density is inversely correlated with the average size of the rock fragments: with an increasing energy consumption density, the average size decreases significantly and the fracture surface area increases accordingly. Additionally, the SHPB tests enable determination of the fracture surface energy of granite and sandstone, and the energy consumption density is calculated based on the theoretical model and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.With shallow oil and gas resources gradually decreasing, the target of oil and gas exploration and development has turned to deep strata in the form of deep and ultra-deep wells, which poses a serious challenge to underground rock engineering and deep drilling engineering. The use of impact energy to drill, a concept that has long been proposed, can enhance the efficiency of rock breaking and meet the demand of deep well drilling ( Research and experiments have indicated that the impact drilling technique is an effective and feasible method to break up rock in deep hard formations, offering great potential in geotechnical engineering and mining of petroleum and natural gas ( The theoretical and experimental studies on energy dissipation of rock fragmentation cited above primarily concentrated on the relationships among energy consumption, stress waveform, strain rate and confining pressure (see, e.g., Fractal geometry was originally developed by Mandelbrot to describe highly irregular and self-similar objects ( It can be concluded from the equation above that the cumulative distribution of fragments with size smaller than Then, the total fracture surface area of fragments can be obtained by integration: Inserting Equation Similarly, the total volume of rock fragments can also be obtained by integration: Rock breaking is the process of new free surface formation. According to fracture mechanics theory ( Then, the energy required for rock breaking per unit volume is defined as the energy consumption density: Equation The test materials used in SHPB impact testing are granite and sandstone with good integrity and homogeneity taken from the Tarim area. To reduce compositional and structural differences that might affect test results, all of the specimens are drilled from the same rock block. The rock samples are processed into cylindrical specimens of φ50 mm × 25 mm using a vertical core machine, as shown in The φ50 mm SHPB testing device is shown in To fully study the characteristics of energy dissipation of rock under impact loading, two types of rock (granite and sandstone) are selected, and five different impact velocity values (6.0 m/s, 7.0 m/s, 8.0 m/s, 9.0 m/s, and 10.0 m/s) are selected. The different impact velocities are obtained by adjusting the impact pressures; five different pressure levels of 0.58, 0.67, 0.75, 0.82, 0.90 MPa are determined to ensure the designed impact velocities. Before the SHPB test, the two end faces of the rock samples are treated with lubricant to assure good contact between the end faces and bars and to eliminate interface friction between the rock and elastic bars. When conducting the SHPB impact tests, the rock specimen is placed between the incident bar and transmission bar. The compressed air is pressurized according to the predefined pressure level to accelerate the projectile, known as the striker bar, that strikes the incident bar. The computerized data acquisition system then continuously records the three wave signals generated in the impact process. Using Equation The logarithmic version of Equation The value of (3− To quantitatively and intuitively describe the degree of fragmentation, the average size of rock fragments is defined as After collecting the rock fragments generated in the SHPB impact tests, sieve tests are performed to obtain the distribution characteristics of the rock fragments. Standard sieves with bore diameters of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, 16.0, 20.0, 25.0, 31.5 mm are adopted, and the fragment sieving results from the rock specimens are given in According to Equation The fractal dimensions and average size of fragments are calculated according to Equations Based on one-dimensional stress wave theory, the stress wave energy can be indirectly calculated according to the incident, reflected and transmitted stress wave signals obtained from the SHPB test ( In Equation Ignoring the energy loss between the rock specimen and bars, the mathematical expression of total absorption energy and energy consumption density of rock is as follows: On the basis of the SHPB test data, the energy dissipation of rock is calculated according to Equations As calculated from the data in As shown in According to the definition, the fracture surface energy and energy consumption density can also be expressed as: Combining Equations When Introducing (14) into (18) and performing the appropriate transformation, the calculated formula of fracture surface energy is as follows: Therefore, the fracture surface energy of granite and sandstone, respectively, are 0.518 J/cm As can be observed from The essence of rock fragmentation is the process of energy dissipation. In this paper, the fractal energy consumption model is established based on fractal rock mechanics and fracture mechanics theory. Furthermore, dynamic uniaxial compressive tests on two types of rock under five different impact velocities are conducted using the SHPB device, and the characteristics of the rock fragment distribution and energy dissipation of rock dynamic breaking are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: The rock fragments obtained from SHPB dynamic tests exhibit a prominent fractal character, with the fractal dimension values varying between 1.7 and 2.6; the larger the fractal dimension, the higher the degree of rock fragmentation. There exists a very significant inverse relationship between the energy consumption density and average size of rock fragments: the average size decreases with the increasing energy consumption density. The energy absorption of rock during the fragmentation process is essentially consumed by forming new fracture surfaces; along with the increase of absorbed energy, the amount of fragments and new fracture surfaces increases. The fracture surface energy of granite and sandstone is determined from SHPB tests to be 0.518 J/cm The fractal energy consumption model proposed in this paper can be used to evaluate the resistance of rock crushing under impact loading and to predict energy consumption based on the distribution of rock fragments conveniently and easily and is expected to provide useful guidance for improving the efficiency of rock dynamic breaking.
