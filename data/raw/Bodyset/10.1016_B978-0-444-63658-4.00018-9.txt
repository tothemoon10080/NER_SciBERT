This chapter discusses the liquid–solid separation equipment and processes most often used in gold processing. Included are preleach thickening, countercurrent decantation, trash screening, carbon screening, concentrate filtration, and tailings thickening and filtration. The chapter is intended as an overview, not a detailed discussion of sizing or operational challenges. However, the references cited are good resources for that information.Patrick Jay from Adroit Process Equipment Pty Ltd, Perth, Western Australia is gratefully acknowledged for initiating the lead contributors for this chapter. The authors would like to thank the editor and publisher for the opportunity to contribute, their employers for providing us the time and resources, and the readers for their interest. Liquid–solid separation encompasses a wide array of equipment, subjects, and processes. For this contribution, processes have been limited to major unit processes deemed unique and central to recovering gold. Potentially interesting applications that have been excluded for brevity are, for example, cartridge filters for pump seal water, formulas for properly sizing a tower filter press, and case studies for countercurrent decantation in Merrill–Crowe processes. The approach in this chapter is to minimize details and outline the current state of technologies, including recent developments that may be of interest. The flowsheets in Therefore, the discussion on liquid–solid separation in gold processing is built on Sedimentation Thickening overview Thickener types Thickener selection Countercurrent decantation Filtration Interstage screens in CIL and CIP Carbon and trash screens Concentrate filtration Pregnant solution clarification in Merrill–Crowe Tailings filtration There have been significant developments in thickener types during the past 10–15 Plant designers and operators should expand expectations for their thickener circuits and select the optimum thickener based on their site-specific objectives and obstacles. A holistic view will bring the needs of upstream and downstream Process objectives Downstream needs Potential process improvements Economic optimization Site layout – footprint Capital cost Operating cost There is no “one size fits all” when it comes to thickeners. This section will discuss thickener background, options, and benefits of each, and how they could be applied to the modern gold-recovery plant. The development of modern flocculants has made available the many slurry thickener options of today. These long-chain, predominantly linear polymers attach to and cause the agglomeration of suspended particles. In this process, polymer molecules wrap around the solid particles, bringing them together into larger, faster-settling masses. The objective is to produce clear overflow and target underflow density by flocculating and settling solids rapidly into the bed. With proper thickener selection, time will produce the underflow densities associated with the thickener type, working through the mechanism of compression. The production of higher-density underflow that exhibits a significant yield stress is possible due to improved floccule strength by use of modern polymers. Dewatering can only occur as long as floccules are intact. Once they start to break due to working of the thickener rake or other mechanism, dewatering for all practical purposes stops. Bench-scale beaker settling tests are used to screen likely flocculants and establish the required dosage. The amount of flocculant used is expressed as grams of polymer per ton of dry solids and referred to as the This feed dilution is generally accomplished with internal dilution at the feedwell. The major international thickener suppliers each have their own method to use clarified water in the thickener to dilute feed. After selection of the optimum flocculant type, dosage, and feed dilutions, the use of automatic control of flocculant feed is the next important step. The use of automatic control of flocculant addition will greatly improve the performance of the thickener compared with manual control. Manual control necessitates setting the volumetric flow rate of the flocculant to meet the needs of the worst case expected for standard operation of the thickener. In that way the operator tries to ensure steady operation without needing to adjust flocculant feed rate for normal variations in thickener feed. These variations include changes in dry feed-rate, particle-size distribution, and mineralogy. The major variable is the dry feed-rate during short periods. The other variables are more gradual and their effect on thickening requires less frequent evaluation by operators. With manual control of flocculant addition during periods when the dry tph is decreased, flocculant is added at a high dosage and this may result in overdosing of the system. This not only wastes flocculant (increasing operating costs) but can also decrease the performance of the thickener: Torque can increase because more flocculant raises overall viscosity of the bed. There is a risk of forming “islands” and “donuts” in the thickener bed, resulting from increased viscosity. Regions in the bed can begin to coalesce, may cling to the mechanism or remain stationary. These islands reduce the active thickening area of the thickener, which lowers the potential underflow density. Overdosed floccules become overlarge and trap water within, which does not release easily and prevents compaction. It may seem counterintuitive, but low underflow density is often a result of overflocculating. Automatic control is based on measuring the dry solids feed rate (tph, calculated from the feed flow rate and feed density), then controlling delivery of the flocculant solution to achieve target dosage (g/t, grams of dry polymer per ton of dry feed solids). The control loop first calculates the dry tph and then, based on the polymer solution concentration, will ramp the metering pump up or down to match the targeted g/t dosage. Providing stable dosage is a significant advantage for effective thickener operation. With control of flocculant addition there is potential to optimize thickener performance. A test series could be conducted to adjust flocculant dosage and monitor critical thickener performance trends, such as underflow density, overflow clarity, or throughput. An example of this type of plant-scale thickener optimization was discussed by Thickener options have grown in the last 10–15 Ability to produce non-Newtonian underflows Development of rakeless thickeners Thickener options can conveniently be divided into four major types: Conventional or high-rate type Rakeless ultra-high-rate type High-density type Deep-cone type To illustrate the differences between these thickener types, A major improvement in the thickener industry is the ability to produce non-Newtonian underflow. A brief review is provided here to give a common background for this discussion. In the industry, the underflow from a high-density or deep cone-type thickener is referred to as One of the defining characteristics of paste/thickened tailings is the increasingly solid-like behavior as the tailings become more concentrated. Unlike slurry, which behaves essentially as a liquid (Newtonian fluid) that assumes the shape of any container in which it is held, a paste will hold its shape to a degree determined primarily by the solids concentration. Pressure is required to make the paste/thickened tailings start movement or flow. This pressure is a rheological term called A physical explanation for the presence of a yield stress involves the particle size distribution (PSD). When suspensions of solids become sufficiently concentrated, the fine particles, typically less than 20  Each sample collected from a process stream will have its own yield stress curve and that curve may shift to the left (lower wt% solids) or the right (higher wt% solids) depending on how the critical variables change. These critical variables include PSD, mineralogy, pH value, water chemistry, solids density, and temperature, to name a few. The yield stress curve is a summation of the effect of all the variables. One of the most prevalent variables in mineral tailings is PSD. Changes in PSD that would be of no concern for most process steps (flotation, leaching, etc.) will significantly change the relationship between yield stress and wt% solids. For example; the result of reducing the D The yield stress curve is important to enable an understanding of the operation of high-density or deep-cone thickeners. It can be said that these thickener types must follow the yield stress curve for the current material. Consider the PSD variation of D Each type of thickener uses different sizing criteria, floor slopes, drive torque, and mechanism design to target production of their characteristic underflow. Some consider the high-density and deep-cone thickener types to be similar, with the deep-cone thickeners generally targeting a higher yield stress. For this discussion, they will be kept separate because the use of low yield stress and high yield stress underflow can produce significantly different outcomes. A description of each type is provided.                     Unit processes in gold-processing flow sheets where slurry thickeners are commonly used include preleach, countercurrent decantation (CCD) and tailings. These result from plants having several water balances and the critical need in many cases to separate solutions from one section to the next. Thickening reduces overall water use, reduces reagent cost by recycling, manages heap-leach water, meets discharge requirements, and prevents reduced performance in a given stage by ingress of reagents or water from other stages. An example of the latter would be some cyanide species in a flotation or bioleaching circuit. CCD presents complex issues and is discussed separately later in the chapter. Thickener selection for any application is site specific and must use a holistic evaluation. Each site has unique problems or goals to manage. Upstream and downstream objectives and obstacles will need to be considered to achieve optimum balance of the process and proper water management. Since site-specific details are critical to slurry thickener selection, an example site is used to illustrate the evaluation process. Some factors may not be included in the selected case. The example site is for CIL located in an arid climate, where water is consequently a major operating cost. The mine site is located in a narrow valley where space is at a premium. Tailings disposal method is on ground in a valley located 10 The preleach thickener is used to separate grinding circuit and leach circuit water streams. Example of the objectives and obstacles applicable to this case are: Water balance in the grinding circuit: Solids concentration in the mills (mill retention time) Recirculating load of solids (overflow clarity) Volume for effective cyclone operation Effect of water volume in preleach thickener underflow on downstream function: Adjustment of pH value Leaching reagents and dosages Optimum leach solids concentration Make-up water temperature Water returned from postleach thickening Thickener selection could consider any of the four types of thickeners discussed earlier, and some key drivers for thickener selection in this case are as follows: A A A The Which thickener type would be recommended for our example of a gold plant in an arid climate located in the mountains? This would come down to the actual space available, cost of water and reagents, and leaching requirements. Each thickener type has potential but the optimum would most likely be rakeless or high density. The rakeless ultra-high-rate thickener may be selected with the lowest capital cost and smallest footprint if the stream is not so large as to require multiple units and water/reagent costs are not too high. The high-density type would be selected if the reagent and water costs warrant the added expense. There have been studies that focus on the recycling of water with reagents and their effect ( The main objectives of tailings thickeners are recovering the leach liquor and preparing the underflow for tailings disposal. Continuing the same example as for the preleach thickener, key objectives and obstacles are as follows: Water balance in the leach circuit: Solids concentration for optimum leaching Recirculating load of solids (overflow clarity) Reagent recycled Tailings deposition site: The deposition site is 10 Location along the mountain foothills requiring three-sided dyke or dam containment Minor natural water rain or ground water The thickener selection process could consider any of the four types of thickeners discussed above. However, selection of deposition method should be considered along with thickener selection. The choice of high-rate or ultra-high-rate thickener typically requires a conventional paddock-style tailings storage facility (TSF) with water-retaining engineered dams to contain the slurry underflow produced by these types. High-density and deep-cone thickener types could use surface-stack methods, which do not need water-retaining engineered dams. There are many factors that must be included in the design of a tailings disposal system, and the water balance for these two deposition strategies is very different: Conventional Paddock TSFs: Water-retaining dams are required to hold water that separates from settled solids (free water). Water-recovery systems need to return water to the process plant. Evaporation losses are high. Loss of water entering the pond to evaporation is in the range of 33–50%. Many gold mines in arid climates tend to be at the 50% level or higher. Deposited slurry will segregate, with the coarse material collecting near the discharge outlet and the fines flowing to the dam before depositing. The coarse fraction dewaters like beach sand while the fines retain a significant amount of water with the solids. On average, about 20–30% of tailings slurry water is retained in a paddock-style TSF along with the solids. Water storage in ponds increases risk of dam failures and release of tailings from the site. Surface-Stacked (Centrally Thickened Discharge [CTD]) TSFs: Non-Newtonian underflow (high-density and deep-cone type thickeners) exhibit rapid drying (capillary forces draw water to the surface). This trait of non-Newtonian suspensions is used to develop the surface-stacked TSF methodology. The paste/thickened tailings are placed in the site either by peripheral spigots or central risers in layers. Layers of 200–500 Little to no water is found at the deposition site. Water release from paste/thickened tailings is often at a rate slower than the evaporation rate and negligible free water pools. Naturally occurring secondary water (e.g., valley drainage) is typically diverted around the site rather than being collected in the impoundment. Water migration to the water table is minimized due to the capillary forces drawing tailings water up. Boundary containment dykes are generally all that is needed, which cost significantly less than the water-retaining dams Rapid drying allows quick access for reclamation or other needed access. Final moisture content in a surface stack is less than in a slurry pond. The final density is greater for surfaces stacks, increasing the capacity of the disposal site ( Thickener selection could consider any of the four types of thickeners discussed earlier and some key drivers for thickener selection in this case are as follows: The high-rate thickener would return the least amount of water to the leach circuit. It would have the most water sent to the pond and be less expensive than the high-density or deep-cone types. The thickener could be located at the plant and the underflow pumped or fed by gravity down to the valley pond. The pond would need to have water returned 10 Rakeless ultra-high-rate thickeners would be very similar to the high-rate thickener as they generally produce similar underflow characteristics. The ultra-high-rate thickener should have a significantly smaller footprint than a high-rate thickener. Limited top size of this type of thickener (12-m diameter) may require multiple thickeners to handle the full stream. This would increase the number of pumps and other equipment, although they may be smaller. The pond would need to have water returned 10 A high-density thickener would recover more water compared with the high rate, increasing underflow density by 8–15 percentage points (25–45% increase in water recovery). Paste/thickened tailings underflow would allow use of surface stacking. Placement of the thickener could be at the disposal site to avoid transporting non-Newtonian underflow 10 The deep-cone thickener would recover the most water. However, because the yield stress curve is approaching vertical, less water can be recovered as yield stress increases. The estimated increased water recovery over that of a high-density thickener would be about 3–5 percentage points. Higher yield stress underflow may increase transport cost. The placement of the thickener should be at the disposal site and the water returned to the plant from the thickener overflow. The angle of repose could be greater than 5°. A steeper deposited-material slope may have erosion issues during precipitation. This added expense may be justified if water and reagent costs are high, but in general the deep-cone type is significantly more expensive than the high-rate or even the high-density types. The marginal increase in water recovery would have to be justified. The footprint of the deep-cone type would be less than that of the high-density and the high-rate thickeners, but larger than the ultra-high-rate type. Tailings thickener selection is more of a decision for the whole tailings system. Costs of the disposal site, transportation of slurry, paste/thickened tailings, and return water must be considered, not just the installed cost of the thickener. The evaluation should be an iterative process where scenarios are assessed for all affected stages. In paste/thickened tailings studies, the needs of the downstream unit operations are usually established first, and the design then works back upstream. The connection between the process stages is rheology (viscosity, yield stress, etc.) of the material, which is dependent on the shear experienced for each process step of the paste/thickened tailings. This type of study can effectively be evaluated by a team of experts (thickener, transportation, and geotechnical, either independent or within the owner and/or operator's organization structure) ( CCD uses several thickeners in series to separate and wash insoluble solid material from liquids. Decanted solutions (the Some operations (often smaller plants) will forego CCD because the pregnant solution lost to underflow contains little metal value. In those cases, a single thickener is used to remove solids. Theoretically, all postleach sedimentation steps could be eliminated, but the resulting cost of clarifying pregnant solution would be significant and likely not justifiable. The fundamentals of CCD were perhaps best described by Considering the CCD schematic in A step-by-step description of a four-stage CCD operation is exemplified as follows: Barren solution (wash) is mixed with the underflow slurry from thickener No. 3 and flows to No. 4. The underflow from No. 4 is pumped to tailings storage facility. Overflow from No. 4 is mixed with the underflow slurry from thickener No. 2 and flows to No. 3. The underflow from No. 3 is pumped to No. 4. Overflow from No. 3 is mixed with the underflow slurry from thickener No. 1 and flows to No. 2. The underflow from No. 2 is pumped to No. 3. Overflow from No. 2 is mixed with the leached slurry and flows to No. 1. The underflow from No. 1 is pumped to No. 2. Overflow from No. 1 is now the pregnant solution and flows downstream for gold recovery. Selection and sizing are determined by bench tests and involve: Number of stages and Amount of washing. Wash water and flow in the leach circuit will determine thickener size. Other important points are: Mixing, and Distribution. Poor mixing of the incoming slurry and wash will mean loss of pregnant solution to the underflow. Mixing tanks are used ahead of each thickener to ensure thorough mixing. These may be combined with inline, low-head pumps to permit all thickeners to be built at the same level, while the pumps act as mixers. In recent years, much more attention has been paid to improving distribution as slurry exits the feedwell and enters the thickener, in part because distribution issues necessitate higher safety factors when sizing thickeners. Poor distribution will cause short-circuiting of solids to the overflow, uneven bed thickness and pregnant solution in the underflow. Those problems lead to increased clarification costs downstream, wear on thickener drives and loss of valuable metals to tailings. A properly designed and operated CCD circuit ensures that virtually all pregnant solution is washed from leached slurry; however, thickeners are not the most efficient washing equipment. A filter can also recover pregnant solution, doing so with much less water by using displacement washing. Highest wash efficiencies are achieved with a type of filter where the cake is formed in a horizontal plane. Examples are horizontal vacuum belt filters and tower filter presses. In such equipment, evenly distributed wash water flows down through the filter cake pushing out (displacing) any pregnant solution remaining. Consider filter feed discharging from a thickener at about 60% solids. Slurry is not fully dewatered on the filter before adding wash, but for simplicity final cake moisture is typically used to determine the amount of wash required. Assuming 14% cake moisture at discharge and a three-displacement wash (i.e., three times the mass of water in the discharged cake), 1 As indicated, three displacements refers to the amount of wash water applied, not the number of wash stages. By reusing the same wash solution in multiple wash stages, countercurrent to the flow of slurry/filter cake, the total wash water could be minimized while maximizing recovery of pregnant solution. Clearly countercurrent wash (CCW) and CCD use the same basic concept. However, because thickeners use dilution instead of displacement washing, a typical CCD circuit requires 1.5–2.5 The requirements for each process are different, but the assumptions in this demonstration are in a typical range. So why is CCD used in Merrill–Crowe? The simple answer is, “return on investment”. Some key drivers influencing the selection of thickeners versus belt filters for CCD duty are as follows: Disadvantages of belt filters: Higher power costs (mainly from the vacuum pump) Filter cloth replacement Greater maintenance costs from more moving parts ( Higher suspended solids in filtrate than in thickener overflow Mechanically complex compared with thickeners Still likely to need a thickener ahead of the filter Disadvantages of thickeners: Flocculent costs that filters do not incur Require more space (a particular issue for indoor installations) High-density or deep-cone thickeners improve the CCD circuit by simply reducing the amount of solution left in the underflow. The efficiency of a CCD stage is increased as the underflow weight percent solids increase, which reduces the value load progressing to the next stage. The comparison presented in As can be interpolated from the table in In general, it seems that most modern Merrill–Crowe installations have selected CCD over CCW configurations, but clearly a thorough evaluation is warranted. That evaluation should include thickener and filtration tests by a qualified laboratory and an economic assessment of operating costs downstream. Investment of a few thousand dollars can save several million in CAPEX and OPEX. Other liquid–solid separation stages in gold recovery circuits are clarifiers used to clean low suspended-solids streams. The mechanics of clarification are similar to those of thickening. The parameters of feed solids concentration, flocculant type and dosage are important to ensure collection of solids in larger masses that will settle to the underflow. The objective is enhanced overflow clarity, with less emphasis on the condition of the underflow. The solid particles concentration in a clarifier feed stream is typically low and the clarifier is a cleaner stage. The effective collection of fine particles by the flocculant is dependent, like slurry thickeners, on solids concentration. However, the problem for a clarifier is not solids concentration that is too high, such as in the case of the slurry thickener, which uses dilution to optimize its operation. The problem for a clarifier is the lower probability of a particle to build proper settling floccules. Clarifying dilute streams is a common task in many industries. Several solutions to this problem have been very effective. The performance for each type claimed by a manufacturer show target overflow clarity <50 The general types and basic description of current clarifier technology includes the following:       Selection between these clarifiers is similar to any other liquid–solid separation stage. The process objectives and obstacles of upstream and downstream needs, along with available space, produce criteria to choose the proper type. While not liquid–solid separation devices in the strictest definition, interstage, carbon retention, or carbon control screens are not comprehensively addressed elsewhere in this book, so it was deemed appropriate to include them in this chapter. They are used to retain carbon in adsorption tanks so that it does not migrate with pregnant slurry. Screen designs have gone through a number of iterations. The accepted design consists of a cylindrical screen (typically of wedge wire) that is sized to allow slurry to pass and prevent carbon from doing so. Normally, these are equipped with rotating outer blades that dislodge any carbon particles that may be trapped in the interstices of the screen ( Variations incorporate low-head, lift pumps (mechanically or air driven) and permit placement of all tanks on the same level. Such capability offers considerable savings in CAPEX. Some interstage screens are also available with mixers that extend below the screen proper to provide the needed leach slurry agitation. Combining so many mechanical functions into a single unit will reduce costs and footprint, but there is a perceived disadvantage to “putting all of one's eggs in a single basket.” Ultimately, economics and plant preferences will govern equipment selection for an application. Trash screens and most carbon screens are nearer to classification devices than liquid–solid separation equipment. However, a few are clearly liquid–solid separation mechanisms and the authors considered a brief discussion on this topic to be warranted. Trash screens are typically used on the cyclone overflow after the last stage of grinding and before leach tanks or preleach thickeners. They remove unwanted material that is larger than the milled ore. That unwanted material can be tramp metal, wood, plastic, or a variety of “trash” that could foul interstage screens, pumps, mixers, etc. The types selected are typically vibrating or linear screens, and in CIL or CIP they use the same mesh as the interstage screens ( Safety screens also tend to be vibrating or linear types and are used on tailings discharging from carbon adsorption circuits to catch any carbon that passed through the interstage screens due to attrition or screen breakage. Therefore, the safety screens are typically one mesh size smaller than the interstage screens ( Loaded-carbon screens are at the opposite end of the carbon adsorption circuit and remove carbon from the process stream before acid washing. As such, they are a liquid–solid separation device in the traditional sense. Another dewatering screen is used in CIL and CIP circuits after elution stripping to remove excess liquid before the regeneration kiln. Mesh size is selected based on criteria similar to those for selection of loaded-carbon screens. Finally, carbon-sizing screens are used after regeneration to remove undersized carbon from the system. Mesh size will be the same as that for the interstage screens. Safety, loaded-carbon and carbon-sizing screens all need to fulfill site-specific process requirements, and considering all possible types will yield a variety of options. A key consideration to narrow the field of choice is a design that minimizes carbon attrition. The rate of zinc cementation in Merrill–Crowe Circuits (see also   A Precoat filters are not designed to remove large quantities of solids but are intended for liquid clarification. As a result, they are best suited to streams with very low suspended solids. They can manage flows with solids loading to 1000 Traditional sedimentation clarifiers can produce overflows of 10–50 Performance varies by application and operation, but even where solutions are relatively clean (e.g., <200 Of the example flowsheets presented in One of the major decisions that must be made for filtration equipment selection is whether to use pressure filters or vacuum filters. Pressure filters for concentrate typically come down to filter presses or tower presses. The great advantage of pressure filters is that their filtration driving force is capped only by the design limits of the filter and the pumps that supply them. As a result, they can typically achieve drier cakes than vacuum filters, which are limited to atmospheric pressure to use as a driving force. Therefore, plant elevation must also be considered when making a selection. The great disadvantage of filter presses and tower presses is that they are batch processes. Flow must be shut off and the filter opened to discharge cake. That means redundancy to accommodate for full slurry flow when one press is in the discharge cycle. Vacuum filters are continuous filters and do not have the same cycle-time challenges. However, when fines (slimes) content is elevated, their filtration rate limitations can make them less economical than filter presses. Fifty years ago, vacuum filters were commonly applied to filter concentrates in a variety of applications. The advantages of lower cake moisture and advances in pressure filters make these the preferred choice in most modern applications. Once the desired final conditions are known, two primary factors affect filter selection for concentrate slurries: Final cake moisture Filtration rate Both of these parameters are determined by standard bench tests, but it may be necessary to carry out tests for both vacuum and pressure filters. Often a quick test will tell if vacuum filtration is practical, without the need to produce a full complement of data. Automatic filter presses can be thought of as the evolved offspring of plate-and-frame filter presses that date back to the middle of the 19th century. Applying programmable logic controllers (PLC) in the 1990s permitted quick and easy washing of seal surfaces and cloth shaking, which improved cake discharge efficiency ( In general, concentrates filter quickly and there are advantages to using automated filter presses, but with small machines the cost of automation becomes a larger portion of the basic machine cost and full automation is more difficult to justify. Small filter presses are most commonly used in Merrill–Crowe plants, so fully automated presses are rarely selected for that specific application. Generally speaking, if adequate cake discharge is achieved, the automated filter press will be less expensive than a tower press but will require more floor space. If the automated filter press is the evolved offspring of plate-and-frame filter presses, the tower press can be considered the unconventional cousin who chose a different path. First patented in 1959 ( Before automation of filter presses became prevalent, tower presses were often selected for concentrate filtration, particularly when larger machines were required. For filter cakes that are difficult to discharge, the tower press may still be the best option. Cloth blinding can be another consideration, since the tower press permits washing the cloth on both sides during each cycle. For the same tonnage in a given application, the tower press will require less floor space but will be taller than an automatic filter press. Sedimentation methods for tailings management are well covered earlier in the chapter. Many operations and plant designers are moving away from high-rate thickeners and the term By now the reader has likely begun to realize that there are no “one-size-fits-all” solutions to liquid–solid separation challenges, which explains why there are so many devices to accomplish what may at first glance seem to be a relatively simple task. This applies equally to the filtration step to achieve dry stacking. Many tailings filters are downstream of a thickener. Underflow must be fluid enough to fill or cover the filter area easily, which will help determine the thickener type. Thickener costs per ton of slurry processed are inexpensive relative to filters. So by removing a few tons of water before filtering, the filters are smaller and costs lower. The basic principles discussed for thickener selection when it is the final treatment for tailings are largely applicable when the underflow will be filtered. By considering the desired deposition characteristics and working backward, the best thickener–filter combination can be found. The economics for choosing to treat plant tails with high-rate, high-density or deep-cone thickeners are driven by the costs of dams, liners and water. Case studies suggest that the economics of choosing filtered tailings (dry-stacked) over paste/thickened tailings is driven almost exclusively by the cost of water ( Automatic filter presses were addressed in the above discussion covering concentrate filtration. In this section, the topic is limited to As with concentrate filtration, difficult to discharge cakes are a driver for selecting a tower press; cloth blinding is a further consideration. For the same tonnage on a given application, the tower press will require less floor space but will be taller than an automatic filter press.  Gradually through the 1960, 1970, and 1980s, other filters began to be chosen for many metallurgical uses. Disc filters remained the option of choice in some niche applications, but pressure filters took over much of what was the disc filter market primarily due to lower cake moisture, as advances in pressure-filter designs reduced the need for operator attention. Other vacuum-filter configurations that offer greater flexibility also took small portions of the disc filter market. More recently, disc filters are finding favor in tailings filtration. For plant tails that can be adequately dewatered by vacuum filtration, disc filters are simply the least expensive filter per ton of solids processed, and they offer continuous filtration. The basic design consists of disc-shaped filter elements arrayed around a hollow, horizontal axis. Operationally the elements are rotated into a tank (vat) of slurry, vacuum is applied, solids captured on the filter media, solution passes through to the hub and out, the filter elements rotate up and out of the vat, filter cake is dried for slightly less than half of a revolution, vacuum is turned off, air pressure applied (typically) and deflector blades ensure that the majority To prevent solids from settling, the traditional agitator consists of a series of paddles on a rotating shaft that runs the length of the tank at the bottom. A newer design incorporates the pumping of slurry into a number of orifices near the bottom and at the back of the tank. Eductors are mounted inside the tank at each nozzle so that the action of the slurry moving through the orifice and the eductor draws in more slurry from the vat, helping to keep all solids in suspension. Neither system can impart the same kind of agitation that is achieved with a mixer in an open tank. For the same tonnage on a given application, a disc filter and vacuum accessories will typically require less floor space than filter presses and roughly the same as tower presses, while offering a lower profile than the latter. However, it typically cannot achieve the same cake moisture as a pressure filter. The primary advantage of a horizontal-belt filter over a disc filter is its ability to thoroughly and efficiently wash filter cake. Considering that a belt filter may cost four or five times what a disc filter does for the same application, it is fair to question why it would ever be considered. The reasons lie in their ability to deal better with poorly suspended solids than can disc filters, filter cloth that can be thoroughly cleaned on each cycle if blinding is an issue and the fact that belt filters may still be less expensive than pressure filters. The caveat is whether vacuum can achieve the desired cake moisture. Oddly, the belt-filter design predates that of the disc filter; at least if patents are any indication. In The key difference between Callow's design and a belt filter that might be considered for tailings filtration today is that the cloth travels through the filtration zone on a rubber carrier or drainage belt. Filtrate passes through the cloth into grooves that run across the belt and out of drainage holes that are typically located in the middle of the rubber belt. Because vacuum is only applied along the row of drainage holes, the load is reduced to a very small surface area, relative to the entire filtration area. When the two belts reach the end of the filter zone, the drainage belt slides off of the static pan through which vacuum is applied, and travels around a driven head pulley for the return trip – somewhat like a conveyor belt. The cloth continues forward for a short distance and travels around a small discharge roll where cake is released. The cloth is cleaned on both sides at a wash station as it returns to the tail end of the filter, where it rejoins the drainage belt. The advantages of belt filter for tailings applications are so specific, that it is not the most common filter in the gold industry. However, if vacuum filtration will meet the needs of the application and there are concerns about keeping solids suspended in a disc filter, or possibly cloth blinding, the horizontal belt filter may be selected. For the same application, it will require more floor space than any of the other options but will have a lower profile than the tower press. Thickening, filtering, and screening are all key to the successful recovery of gold. There are many more thickener options than there were 20 Selection of the tailings dewatering method must consider the deposition system to be used. Newtonian slurry underflow of high rate and ultra-high-rate thickeners requires a conventional slurry pond. Non-Newtonian underflow of high-density and deep-cone thickeners are used for surface stacking. Costs for the full system should be considered when selecting the tailings thickener. Centrally thickened discharge TSFs are an increasingly used option to consider compared with conventional paddock-style TSFs; the best dewatering method may be a thickener–filter combination. Interstage screens for CIL and CIP are a preferred configuration, typically a basic cylindrical basket with external scraper blades to remove wedged carbon particles. Trash, safety, loaded carbon, and carbon sizing screens are usually a vibrating or linear screen. Selection should consider minimizing carbon attrition. Filtering concentrate mainly uses filter presses or tower presses due to low cake moisture, as compared to vacuum filters. Pregnant solution clarification in Merrill–Crowe circuits mainly uses pressure precoat filters. A preclarification step should be considered to evaluate cost savings in smaller filters, longer cycles, and reduced precoat consumption. Options for tailings filtration include automatic filter press, tower press, rotary vacuum disc filter, and horizontal belt filter. If vacuum meets the needs, a disc filter may have the lowest costs and smallest footprint. A belt filter might be selected if there are issues with keeping solids suspended or cloth blinding. Automatic filter presses may be the most common choice—despite their greater costs, they typically produce drier filter cake. They are cheaper than tower presses but have a larger footprint. Developments in liquid–solid separation have focused on increasing recoveries and lowering costs and, more recently, on safety, liability, public perception, and similar issues. Some areas where advances may be expected are: Larger equipment Slurry dilution and distribution in thickeners Instruments and controls, particularly bed profile in thickeners Options for interstage screens
