This study introduces a mechanism for speeding up the bioleaching process. We examine the effects and kinetics of L-cysteine on the bioleaching of chalcopyrite via Potetiodynamic polarisation, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltametry tests in a Leptospirillum ferrooxidans-dominated culture. Both the polarisation curves and the EIS show that adding L-cysteine improves the bioleaching speed, but does not change the controlled step. In addition, the results of the cyclic voltametry test reveal that the anodic and cathodic current signals of the electrodes decrease. Furthermore, all the oxidation peak potentials move positively, and the oxidation peaks of the intermediate species (CuxS) persist throughout the entire bioleaching process.
