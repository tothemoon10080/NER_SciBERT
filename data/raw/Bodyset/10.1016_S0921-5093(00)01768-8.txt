Our magnetisation and Mössbauer effect investigations of magnetic icosahedral quasicrystals (Al, Ge)70Pd15Mn15 and (Al, Si)70Pd15Fe15 have shown that the magnetic atoms Mn and Fe occupy two types of sites, one of which is magnetic and one which is non-magnetic. In certain cases the magnetic atoms couple ferromagnetically.The moment formation in Al-based quasicrystals when 3D (Fe/Mn/Cr/Co) and 4D (Pd) magnetic atoms are simultaneously present has recently been studied Yokoyama et al. Alloys of composition Al X-ray diffraction results show that all samples are single-phase icosohedral alloys. A plot of the variation of centre shift (CS) and quadropole splitting (QS) is given in Our results show that CS=+0.200 In The values of The plot of susceptibility for (b) and (c) in It is observed that the presence of Si and Ge in the Al-Pd-Mn and Al-Pd-Fe icosohedral phases affects the magnetic properties differently. The Si containing Al-Pd-Mn alloys have only small percentage of magnetic atoms which do not couple ferromagnetically. On the other hand 8% Ge containing Al-Pd-Mn alloy produces 1000% paramagnetic Mn atoms. The Al-Pd-Fe-Ge alloys show ferromagnetic behavior within the temperature 4–290
