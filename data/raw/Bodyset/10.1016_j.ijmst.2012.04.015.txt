In real world applications the supply, the demand and the transportation cost per unit of the quantities in a transportation problem are hardly specified precisely because of the changing economic and environmental conditions. It is also important that the time required for transportation should be minimum. In this paper a method has been proposed for the minimization of transportation costs. Supply and transportation costs per unit of the quantities are also determined. The present study was carried out to evaluate the quality of gravel to know its suitability for aggregate (raw material for concrete and road). The samples of gravel were analyzed for petrographic, physical, mechanical and chemical properties. Samples were categorized as quartzite group and carbonate group according to ASTM standard 295. Among these, samples of quartzite group were found dominant. The petrography examination of gravels which was carried out constituted of opal, tridymite, chalcedony, crystobalite and alkali carbonates rocks. Those minerals react with alkalis in cement leading to expansion and cracking of concrete. Other components such as sulfides, sulfates, halites, iron oxides, clay minerals and anhydrites are examined, which might be present as coating and impurities. The present study indicated that all samples are suitable for concrete making and obtain the optimum solution for transporting these materials from quarries to cities with minimum cost according to Egyptian Code.
