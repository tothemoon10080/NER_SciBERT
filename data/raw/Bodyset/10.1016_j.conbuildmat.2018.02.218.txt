As the use of shotcrete (sprayed concrete) to build full-depth structural elements increases in North America, the encapsulation quality of reinforcing bars has become a subject of growing concern. In this investigation, the influence of the mixture consistency and the size of imperfections (created deliberately) behind reinforcing bars on the bond strength of the bars was studied using shotcrete “pull-out” specimens sprayed with the dry-mix process. However, as the desired range of the imperfection sizes could not be obtained, cast-in-place “pull-out” specimens were built with artificially created voids. This strategy allowed to study the reduction of the bond strength by knowing the precise size of the voids. The results suggest that the best bond performance of a bar is obtained, given an appropriate spraying technique, when the optimal combination between the mixture consistency and the airflow rate is used. Moreover, reinforcing bars encased with shotcrete slip less, relative to concrete, than those encased with cast-in-place concrete because of the high compaction with which the mixture is placed. Additionally, a void’s transversal length (in contact with the bar) of about 20% of the bar’s nominal perimeter was found to be the threshold beyond which an important change of the bond performance occurs.Shotcrete is a method of concrete placement in which the mixture is sprayed at high velocity onto a surface using compressed air. Nowadays, its use in North America has increased substantially and structural elements such as shear walls Despite the use of the proper Shotcrete “pull-out” specimens were built in the laboratory using the Two nozzlemen (referred henceforth as N1 and N2) sprayed the concrete using an ALIVA® 246.5 spraying machine with the water ring installed 2.2 m upstream from a “double-bubble” nozzle. Both nozzlemen were asked to spray the concrete using three different flows of water ranging from high (the “wettest” The blocks were stripped 1 day after the spraying or the casting operations and were subsequently cured for one week using wet burlap. The blocks were then cut following the dotted lines shown in  The The remaining concrete from the blocks was cored to obtain cylinders Due to the different nature of the mixing process between sprayed and cast-in-place concrete, a slight change in the latter’s mixture design was done to obtain comparable concrete properties. Firstly, a constant The reinforcing bars came from the same heat of steel and their mechanical properties were obtained from three (3) samples. Additional samples were cut longitudinally at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the plan of the longitudinal ribs to measure the geometrical properties as shown in The measurements were performed over 10 ribs using high-resolution photographs and a CAD software for each longitudinal cut. The specimens were tested using a 322 MTS test frame and the slip of the reinforcing bars was recorded by two linear position sensors with return spring attached to the loaded end of the bar as shown in Shotcrete specimens had to be capped with self-leveling epoxy because of their sometimes less perfect top surface due to the presence of entrapped aggregates at the corners. Tests were conducted at 1.0 mm/min displacement control and were performed 21 days after the specimens were cast or sprayed; this represented the minimal time required to prepare the specimens for testing (curing, cutting, drilling cores, capping, etc.). The parameters studied for each method of concrete placement and their respective material properties, measured at 21 days, are summarized in Only Three (3) and two (2) specimens were built for each configuration of the shotcrete and the cast-in-place families respectively, however, only two (2) out of three (3) specimens sprayed by nozzleman N1 could be tested due to excessive rebound in some areas of the panel. Individual specimens within each family of both methods of concrete placement were labeled alphabetically (A, B or C). The standard deviation is presented in parentheses in The following section presents the results of the “pull-out” specimens divided into 3 main sections. Firstly, the bond strength of the bars is correlated to the mixture The loads measured at 0.25 mm of the bars’ slip (P The whiskers indicate the minimal and the maximal values measured away from the means.

Additional information about the ANOVA test and the LSD method is provided by Montgomery In general, the results confirm the presence of significant differences between specimens sprayed with Although the spraying technique used by both nozzlemen followed good practice guidelines To study their impact on the reduction of the bond strength, the As can be observed, the scatter away from the mean The use of The minimal and maximal values of each mean Thus, the results obtained with To assess if the use of the To confirm this, both linear functions were compared based on a hypothesis testing procedure The test resulted in a At this point, the suitability of using As can be observed, the To formally support these statements, a pairwise comparison between the ultimate load (P The The results support the assertion that the ultimate load obtained with shotcrete specimens can be adequately reproduced using cast-in-place specimens. Indeed, Thus, After specimens failed, their bottom surface was inspected to determine if a The general trend, albeit more obvious for the shotcrete specimens, is that the presence of voids induces a The influence of the mixture Since voids may be created even if the adequate The findings could help set The authors are grateful to the
