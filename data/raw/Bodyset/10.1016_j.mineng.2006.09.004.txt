The objective of this work was the study of the selectivity of apatite flotation in a column by means of kinetic analysis. The recovery and apatite content in the concentrate were correlated to the collector dosage, depressant dosage and air flow rate. The test results were subjected to statistical analysis aimed at identifying the experimental conditions producing the best P2O5 content and recovery.Apatite flotation is difficult due to its physicochemical properties being similar to other minerals present in phosphate ores ( The selectivity of the flotation process can be better understood and improved by kinetic studies. Establishment of relationships between the main process variables affecting flotation selectivity for each chemical species that make up the ore can improve the recovery and the phosphate content in the concentrate. Using this concept, the main goal of this work was the study of the kinetics and selectivity of the apatite flotation process in a batch column. The recovery and the P The phosphate ore sample used in this work, supplied by the Bunge company, was from the Barreiro carbonatite complex, located in Arax√°, in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The shape of the complex is roughly circular, with a diameter of 4.5 The material came from the current apatite flotation feed from the company. The chemical composition of this material was: 23.0% P A specific conditioning procedure was employed to render the surfaces of the apatite hydrophobic, using corn meal, rough rice oil, and sodium hydroxide. The conditioning procedure was carried out at pH 11.5. The batch column, built in acrylic, had an internal diameter of 40 The flotation kinetics constant can be linked to the cumulative recovery ( The relative floatability ( In order to analyse the individual effects, as well as the interactions between the independent variables, a factorial experimental design of the central composite type was conducted ( The The independent variables were transformed into the dimensionless variables The empirical equations obtained, which represent the variations of the content (   The obtained results showed that the floatability of P The P The methodology used in this work for the flotation of apatite in a batch column produced the following conclusions: The highest P The best conditions for P Apatite floatability is greater than for the species Fe
