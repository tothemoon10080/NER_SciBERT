This chapter presents a detailed overview of aluminum recycling with a brief introduction to primary aluminum production. Bauxites are preponderantly mined in open pits, very rarely in underground mines. Aluminum recycling is limited to metal containing material, which is called scrap. Scrap can be generated during melting, manufacturing, fabrication or machining of products made of aluminum alloys, called prompt or new scrap, because it has not seen a customer and has not entered the use-cycle. The other source of scrap is the products manufactured from aluminum alloys after their lifetime, called old or collected scrap. Old or collected scrap originates from end-of-life products, implying that there is a time between production of products and generation of scrapâ€”that is, its lifetime. In contrast to new scrap, the future generation of old scrap can be estimated and the evaluated figures compared with actual tonnages. Statistical data are available for aluminum consumed by various endues sectors. Their average lifetime, collection rates and metallurgical yield lead to data, which can be compared with actual data.
