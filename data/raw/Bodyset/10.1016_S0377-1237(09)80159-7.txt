Dear Editor, I will like to thank the reader in showing interest in the article. Most of the questions raised by the author are very pertinent. Surgical treatment of diaphyseal clavicular fractures is a controversial and debated issue that has recently received support in the orthopaedic literature. Recent studies have shown that nonoperative treatment is not uniformly associated with a successful outcome [ In 2003, when our study started there was little clinical evidence available supporting primary plating of midshaft displaced clavicle fractures. The available biomechanical studies supported plating the superior surface of the clavicle as that was the tension surface of the bone [ Elastic nailing of the displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is another treatment option which has shown promising results [ The last word on management of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures awaits the results of two large multicentric studies of randomized design (University of Tennessee, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, USA and University of Ghent, Belgium) which are currently recruiting; they are expected to be out by 2010 or 2011. We are also recruiting patients in a prospective cohort study comparing conservative management and plating for displaced midshaft clavicle fractures in young adults. We have already recruited eighty patients and interim analysis would be soon presented.
