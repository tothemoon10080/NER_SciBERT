Two hundred and fifty-two consecutive digital replantations and revascularizations in 201 patients were retrospectively reviewed to determine factors influencing survival. Children under 9 years of age, women, complete amputations, blood transfusions and secondary thrombectomy were poor prognostic factors. In addition, low haemoglobin and haematocrit levels during the postoperative period were associated with a higher failure rate. Inappropriate use of anticoagulants and excessive postoperative anaemia should be avoided following replantation.
