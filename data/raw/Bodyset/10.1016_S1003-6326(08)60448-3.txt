High purity titanium was prepared by thermal decomposition of titanium iodide. The feasible synthetic route and optimum decompositon temperaure were obtained by thermodynamic analysis in the process of thermal decomposition of titanium iodide and nucleation growth theory. The temperature for the formation of titanium iodide is in the range of 800–900 K, at which a large amount of titanium iodide vapour can be obtained. The decomposition temperature of titanium iodide is in the range of 1 300–1 500 K, at which a favourable decomposition rate can be achieved. The experiment results show that the purity of the produced titanium is more than 99.995%.
