This paper proposes a novel approach to sulfur removal with active carbon supplementation in alkali digestion process. The effects of active carbon dosage on the concentrations of different valence sulfur in sodium aluminate solution were investigated. The results demonstrated that along with increases of active carbon dosage high-valence sulfur (S2O3

                     2−, SO4
                     2−) concentration decreased, but the concentration of the S2− increased. This suggests that active carbon reacts with high-valence sulfur to generate low-valence sulfur at digestion temperature, which is consistent with our thermodynamic calculation results. As active carbon dosage increases, sulfur digestion rate decreases while sulfur content in red mud markedly increases; the alumina digestion rate, conversely, remains fairly stable. This suggests that high-valence sulfur in the sodium aluminate solution can be converted to S2− and then enter red mud by adding active carbon during the digestion process.Bauxite resources become scarce because of extensive and rapid developments of alumina industry. There are over 800 million tons of diasporic high-sulfur bauxite in China, if effective methods of removing sulfur of this bauxite are made available, it is highly valuable. The most common sulfur-bearing minerals in high-sulfur bauxite are pyrite and its isomers as well as sulfates such as CaSO Fe as the composition of equipment forming Na To date, relatively few researchers have investigated sulfur removal in the alumina production process because high-sulfur bauxite is seldom used in alumina production outside of China. Recent years have seen a few relevant studies in China ( Large swaths of China's high-sulfur bauxite reserves are unable to be developed or utilized due to the lack of appropriate sulfur removal method for alumina production. This paper proposes a new method of sulfur removal by adding active carbon in digestion process, the active carbon can react with high-valence sulfur (S The high-sulfur bauxite used in this experiment was obtained from Zunyi mining area in China. The chemical components of mineral samples were analyzed by XRF, as shown in As shown in The chemical components of the alkali solution used in the experiment are listed in Digestion experiments on high-sulfur bauxite were conducted in a XYF-6 digester, as shown in The alkali solution, high-sulfur bauxite and active carbon were placed in a 100 mL stee1 bomb which was sealed in the experiment. The digester was heated to 533 K (260 °C) and held for 5 min, then the steel bomb was placed inside and the digestion process was run 60 min. The sodium aluminate solution was then filtered and the Al The digestion rate of alumina (η (A/S) (A/S) The digestion rate of sulfur (η S S F F Active carbon dosage was varied between 0% and 5% through a series of digestion experiments at temperature of 533 K (260 °C), digestion time of 60 min, and digestion liquor α  This suggests that active carbon can react with high-valence sulfur to generate low-valence sulfur at the digestion temperature, which is consistent with our thermodynamic calculations (as shown in It also can be seen from The standard Gibbs free energy of the reactions of active carbon with high-valence sulfur (S As can be seen from Again, six different active carbon dosages (between 0% and 5%) were tested under the same other conditions described above.
