Background
                  Inadequate serum vitamin D levels are associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone turnover, bone loss and increased fracture risk. Vitamin D is well recognized to be suboptimal in older patients when compared to age-matched controls. There are no published studies on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in Indian population with fragility fractures around the hip associated with osteoporosis and comminution at the fracture site.
               
                  Aim
                  To investigate the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted with osteoporotic hip fractures and associated fracture site comminution in a South Indian Institute.
               
                  Material & Methods
                  A prospective cross sectional study was conducted on 100 patients admitted with osteoporotic hip fracture. Measurement of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was done and the same was correlated with the degree of osteoporosis using Singh’s index and fracture site comminution.
               
                  Results
                  Out of 100 patients studied, 92% had hypovitaminosis D with mean vitamin D level of 16.08 ± 5.95 ng/dl (65% vitamin D deficiency with mean 13.16 ± 4.24 ng/dl and 27% vitamin D insufficiency with mean 23.11 ± 2.62 ng/dl) and 94% had osteoporosis with Singh’s index grade 3 or less. Out of the 36 patients with fracture site comminution 34 patients (94%) had hypovitaminosis D and 33 patients (91.6%) had osteoporosis. Statistical significance was established for all the variables.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Significant association was found between hypovitaminosis D, osteoporosis and fracture site comminution. High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients presenting with hip fractures and fracture site comminution implicates the necessity for proper evaluation and effective supplementation of vitamin D in elderly patients along with anti-osteoporotic regimens for effective prevention and appropriate management of osteoporotic hip fractures.Vitamin D deficiency is rampant in elderly population and house bound patients. Synthesis of vitamin D3 in the skin under the influence of UV light and absorption from the gut decreases with age due to decreased functional capacity and insufficient sunlight exposure. A balanced diet without additional supplements serves only a minor part of the daily Vit.D requirement. In a given case, Vit.D can be low due to 1) Dietary deficiency of Vit.D and inadequate exposure to sunlight 2) Inability to absorb Vit.D from the intestines or inadequacy of production from skin 3) Inability to process Vit.D by liver and kidney into its active and functional forms Osteomalacia is a disorder of disturbed mineralization of the organic bone matrix in adults. As mineralization of bones is controlled by Vit.D, its deficiency leads to accumulation of under mineralized osteoid leading to softening, bending and fragility fractures. Deficiency of vitamin D is also known to cause proximal muscle weakness adversely affecting the mobility and functional ability to put an elderly person at increased risk of falling and sustaining hip and other fractures. Prevention of such eventualities is feasible by adequate sunlight exposure, food fortification and supplementation of vitamin D for at risk population as a cost-effective measure in prevention of hip and other geriatric fractures. Very few studies have shown that osteomalacia coexists with osteoporosis and therefore aggravates the bone fragility and propensity for hip fractures. There is a paucity of data on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (Hypo.D) in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures and associated fracture site comminution. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (Vit.D < 30 ng/ml) among the patients with osteoporotic hip fractures and the associated factors like fracture site comminution in a South Indian scenario with abundant sunlight all throughout the year. One hundred patients between 45–90 years of age admitted at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad between 2014–17’ with a history of trivial trauma and fractures of proximal femur were prospectively evaluated after obtaining the approval of institutional ethics committee. All the patients with fracture following a trivial trauma like slip and fall while standing/walking were included in the study and patients with significant history of trauma like road traffic accidents/fall from height and pathological fractures were excluded. Written informed consent was taken from the patients after explaining all the details of the study including the risks and benefits involved. Detailed history of the patient and exact details of the injury were recorded. Past history of falls/trauma, fractures, surgeries, drug history and medical co-morbidities were recorded in detail. Digital radiograph of pelvis with both hips (antero-posterior view) and lateral view of involved side was taken. Type of fracture, comminution and severity was assessed independently by a radiologist duly using the fracture classification system of Boyd & Griffin In addition to the routine investigations, serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH Vit.D) were measured by Chemiluminescence Immuno Assay (CLIA) on an automated analyser in our laboratory. Serum level of Vit.D < 20 ng/ml was considered as deficiency, Vit.D level between 20–29 ng/ml was considered as insufficiency, Vit.D <30 ng/ml was considered as hypovitaminosis D (Hypo.D) and Vit.D level 30–100 ng/ml was considered as normal. After necessary consultations and pre anaesthetic check up, patients were operated with Dynamic hip screw or Proximal femoral nail for intertrochanteric fracture and hemi replacement hip arthroplasty for fracture neck of femur ( Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in patients with osteoporotic hip fractures, correlation between the levels of vitamin-D and osteoporosis measured by Singh’s index and the presence of comminution at fracture site were studied in patients with proximal femoral fractures following trivial trauma. Statistical analysis was done by using MedCalc version 13. One hundred patients within the age group of 45–90 years who presented with fracture neck of femur and inter trochanteric fracture following trivial trauma during a period of 3 years were studied. The mean age of the patients at presentation was 62.7 ± 9.90 years, 95% CI was 60.75–64.68 (range 45–90years) with 61% of them being < 65 years of age. Maximum incidence of fracture was seen in the age group of 55–65 years (42%). Female predominance (63%) was noted when compared to males (37%). No significant correlation was found between the age and Vit.D levels r = 0.002, p = 0.98, 95% CI for r = −0.19 to 0.20. No significant association was noted between the age and Singh’s index grade Chi-square:106.9, Df = 93, p = 0.154. There was no significant association between age and fracture site comminution (Chi-square: 24.49, Df = 31, p = 0.79). Hypovitaminosis D was noted in 92% of the patients with mean Vit.D level of 16.08 ± 5.95 ng/ml, 95% CI = 14.85–17.31 ng/ml, of which 65% had Vit.D deficiency with mean Vit.D level of 3.16 ± 4.24 ng/ml, 95% CI = 12.11–14.22 ng/ml and 27% had vitamin-D insufficiency with mean Vit.D level of 23.11 ± 2.62 ng/ml, 95% CI = 22.07–24.15 ng/ml ( The overall mean Vit.D level in our study was 17.72 ± 8.05 ng/ml, 95% CI was 16.12–19.31 ng/ml (range 4–44 ng/ml) with non normal distribution. Out of the 8 patients with normal serum level of Vit.D, the mean Vit.D level was 36.5 ± 4.31 ng/ml, 95% CI was 32.89–40.10 ng/ml (range 31–44 ng/ml). The difference in Vit.D levels between the genders was insignificant (Chi-square:0.085, Df = 1, P value: 0.77). 73 patients (73%) had intertrochanteric fracture (IT#) of femur (males-26, females-47) with mean Vit. D level of 18.21 ± 8.40 ng/ml, 95% CI = 16.25–20.17 ng/ml. 27 patients (27%) had intracapsular (IC#) fracture neck of femur (males-11, females-16) with mean Vit.D level of 16.37 ± 6.98 ng/ml, 95% CI = 13.61–19.13 ng/ml. There was no significant difference in the mean Vit.D levels of both the groups (IT# vs IC#), t= -1.014, p = 0.313. Out of the 100 patients studied 94 had osteoporosis with Singh’s Index grade of 3 or less. Females predominance (n = 61) was noted when compared to males (n = 33) (Chi-square:9.942, Df = 2, p = 0.007). Of the 94 patients with osteoporosis, 87 patients had hypovitaminosis D with mean Vit.D = 16.04 ± 5.89 ng/ml, 95% CI = 4.78–17.29 ng/ml and 7 patients had normal Vit.D with mean Vit.D of 35.86 ± 4.22 ng/ml, 95% CI = 31.95–39.76 ng/ml. The mean difference in Vit.D level between these two groups with osteoporosis is significant t = 8.71, Df = 92, p < 0.0001. Out of the 94 patients with osteoporosis 63 patients had Vit.D deficiency (mean 13.27 ± 4.15 ng/ml, 95% CI was 12.23–14.32 ng/ml) and 24 patients had Vit. D insufficiency (mean 23.29 ± 2.73 ng/ml, 95% CI was 22.13–24.44 ng/ml). The mean difference in Vit.D level between these two groups with osteoporosis is highly significant t = 10.93, Df = 85, p < 0.0001 ( Out of the 100 patients studied, 36 patients had fracture site comminution and 34 of them had hypovitaminosis D. The mean Vit.D level in patients with fracture site comminution (n = 36) was 13.61 ± 7.06 ng/ml, 95% CI was 11.22–16 ng/ml. The mean Vit.D level in patients without fracture site comminution (n = 64) was 20.02 ± 7.69 ng/ml, 95% CI was 18.10–21.95 ng/ml. Independent sample Out of the 73 cases of IT fractures, 30 cases (41%) had fracture site comminution with mean Vit. D level of 13.93 ± 7.09 ng/ml, 95% CI was 11.28–16.58 ng/ml (range 4 −34 ng/ml). The mean Vit.D level for patients with IT fracture without comminution (43 cases) was 21.2 ± 8.01 ng/ml, 95% CI was 18.74–23.66 ng/ml (range 9–44 ng/ml). Independent sample Out of 36 patients who had fracture site comminution, only 3 patients (8.3%) had normal bone density and highly significant number of patients (n = 33, 91.6%) were found to have osteoporosis (Chi-square: 23.36, Df = 1, P < 0.0001) ( Hip fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and are associated with chronic pain, disability and an increasing degree of dependence. These injuries are costly to treat and have a significant physical and social impact. Approximately 50 million people in India are either osteoporotic or osteopenic. The Endocrine society clinical practice guidelines defined Vit.D deficiency as serum concentration of Vit.D < 20 ng/ml and insufficiency as 21 to 29 ng/ml. In an U.K based study, Vit.D deficiency was reported in 51% and insufficiency in 40% of the population. Singh et al reported that, 80.6% of the studied cases (n = 40) had vitamin D deficiency and 42.5% had osteoporosis. Fracture site comminution gives an insight about the mode of injury and the bone strength. It adversely affects the fracture stability. As the mode of injury was same for all the patients (slip and fall while walking), the role of bone strength was looked into, as correlation of fracture site comminution with osteoporosis and concomitant vitamin D deficiency was not studied earlier. In our study, fracture site comminution was noted in 36% of cases (n = 30 in IT and n = 6 in IC fractures) and the mean vitamin-D levels in these patients was 13.61 ± 7.06 ng/ml (13.93 ± 7.06 ng/ml in IT and 12.02 ± 7.36 ng/ml in IC fractures) suggesting deficiency. The difference in the mean Vit.D level between the cases with comminution compared to those without comminution was highly significant (p = 0.0001). Similarly statistically significant number of patients with fracture site comminution had osteoporosis (p < 0.0001) implying high prevalence and strong association of hypovitaminosis D and osteoporosis in patients with fracture site comminution suggesting the necessity of prompt correction for a better functional outcome. Our study established a strong correlation between hypovitaminosis D, osteoporosis and fracture site comminution as coexisting co morbidities. Identifying and treating these patients early with vitamin D for osteomalacia and anti-osteoporotic regimens for osteoporosis will improve the bone, muscle and overall health thereby reducing falls and fractures. Further efforts are needed to improve the guidelines and practices for primary and secondary prevention of hip fractures in Indian population by duly incorporating the inferences from similar studies performed on a larger scale. This is an observational study with patients from a single hospital. The sample may not be fully reflective of rural and urban variations as they are mixed. Further research may be carried out in several other centers on a large scale to ascertain the national prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association with osteoporosis and fracture site comminution, so that effective guidelines may be drawn for prevention and effective treatment of the coexisting co morbidities.
