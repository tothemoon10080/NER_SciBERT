A synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) system consisting of LIX 63 and Ionquest 801 was identified and developed to recover germanium from a synthetic leach solution of zinc refinery cementation residues. A significant synergistic effect was identified with this novel SSX system, which selectively extracted germanium over other metals in the synthetic leach solution. The SSX system consisting of 0.13M anti-oxime from LIX 63 and 0.13M Ionquest 801 in ShellSol 2046 is an optimised composition for the extraction of germanium from the synthetic leach solution containing 1g/L Ge(IV) and 1.0M H2SO4.
                  The germanium(IV) extraction kinetics was slow with the equilibrium reached after 20min of mixing at 40°C. The stripping kinetics of germanium(IV) with strip solution containing 0.5M NaOH and 1.0M Na2SO4 was very fast with the equilibrium reached in 1min of mixing.
                  Slope analysis showed that, most possibly, the extracted Ge(IV)-organic species is 2Ge(SO4)2·(HA)·(HB)2·H2SO4 via a solvating mechanism with the SSX system consisting of Ionquest 801 (HA) and LIX 63 (HB).Over the last two decades, germanium has gained much interest as a semiconductor material for opto-electronic and electronic applications ( Chelating extractant Kelex 100 was used for the separation of Ge(IV) from zinc, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, arsenic, copper and iron(III) ( LIX 63 gave good separation of germanium from copper, nickel, arsenic, chloride and ferrous iron from a strong acidic solution of > A new extractant G315 was tested to recover gallium and germanium from solutions of zinc leach residues (  A synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) system consisting of D2EHPA and TBP was used for separation of germanium(IV) from zinc(II), gallium(III) and iron(III) in sulphate solutions with a high acidity of >  Synergistic systems consisting of LIX 63 and D2EHPA, M2EHPA and OPAP were developed ( A synergistic system consisting of LIX 63 and LIX 26 was used for the extraction of germanium from an aqueous solution containing (g/L) 3.5 Ge(IV), 0.8 As(III), 1.5 Fe(III) and 50 H The extraction of germanium using a mixed organic system consisting of a hydroxamic acid HGS98 (chemical structure undisclosed) and D2EHPA in kerosene from an indium raffinate solution in the hydrometallurgical zinc process was investigated by A common disadvantage of the above SX or SSX processes for germanium(IV) extraction is the use of strong NaOH for stripping. Not only is NaOH expensive, but it has to be neutralised for germanium(IV) recovery. In addition, some reagents are not commercially available. Therefore, more efficient and effective SX or SSX systems are required for ease in stripping with acids or weak base solutions using commercially available reagents, which will be reported in the current paper.
