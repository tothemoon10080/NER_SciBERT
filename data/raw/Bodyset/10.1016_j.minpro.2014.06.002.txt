The authors regret to inform the readers that there is a typographical error in Section 3.4.—Purification of metals by solvent extraction. The concentration of La, Ce, and Sc mentioned as “g/L” may please be read as “mg/L”. Revised text: A feasibility trial was carried out to purify lanthanum, cerium and scandium (in mg/L: 0.065 La, 0.096 Ce, 0.041 Sc) from the leach liquor of red mud using solvent extraction. The corresponding author communicates the apology on behalf of all authors for the inadvertent omission and inconvenience caused.
