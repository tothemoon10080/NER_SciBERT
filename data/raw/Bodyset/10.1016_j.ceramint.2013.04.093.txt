Alumina powder was wet-milled by zirconia balls with varying diameter at varying rotation speed, and the resultant particle size of the milled powder was analyzed. At a given rotation speed, there exists an optimum ball size to yield minimum particle size of alumina. The optimum ball diameter decreases as the rotation speed increases. This result has been interpreted in light of the competition between the reduced kinetic energy of the smaller balls (a negative source for milling efficiency) and the increased number of contact points of the smaller balls (a positive source), which yields the optimum ball diameter at an intermediate size. As the rotation speed increases, kinetic energy of the balls increases, which, in turn, shifts the optimum ball size toward a smaller value. As the powder loading increases from 1 to 35g at a given rotation speed and ball size, the milling efficiency decreases monotonically.Wet ball mill is one of the most predominantly used method for the purpose of mixing and grinding of raw materials in laboratories and industry There have been investigations on the influences of parameters associated with grinding balls such as ball size distribution As for the influence of the characteristics of wet medium on the milling efficiency, several groups 10 For the investigation of the effect of powder loading on the milling efficiency, varying quantity (5â€“35 The effect of ball size on the particle size reduction has been investigated first for varying rotation speed of the container. Percent passing and size distributions of the milled Al In The particle size reduction results from the complicated dynamic interaction of the balls with turbulent slurry during the ball mill process, imposing a difficulty in quantitative interpretation of the observed phenomena of: (1) the existence of the optimized ball size at a given rotation speed; and (2) the decreased optimum ball size with increased rotation speed (rpm). As seen in In order to explain the observed phenomena in the present study, here we consider the case of the collision between newly falling/entering balls to the slurry and the balls existing already in the slurry medium (marked as A in The number of balls ( For the analysis of the change of kinetic energy of the colliding balls (at A) by the change of ball size, one needs to consider the changes of ball mass and colliding velocity. The mass ( As for the change of collision velocity by the change of ball size, note that, after the balls reach a maximum height which is fixed at a given rotation speed ( By combining the mass dependency on ball size ( From above considerations, the experimentally observed phenomenon that there exists an optimal ball size for efficient milling at a given rotation speed (rpm) is interpreted to be resulted from the competition between the positive influence of a smaller ball size (increased number of contact points) and the negative influence of the smaller balls (decreased kinetic energy of the sedimenting balls). The best (optimal) milling efficiency will then appear at an intermediate ball size ( As for the reason why the optimal ball size for efficient milling decreases with the rotation speed of the mill, it is first conceived that the higher rotation speed will increase the average height of the balls from which the balls start to fall down, unless the balls rotate simultaneously with the container (centrifugation) due to an overly high rotation speed. Then, the entering (falling) speed of the balls into the surface of the turbulent slurry medium will increase. This increased initial velocity of the balls in the slurry medium will lead to a higher collision velocity to the balls already located in the slurry medium, unless the terminal velocity of the balls is reached before the collision. The increased collision velocity of the balls at higher rotation speed will certainly increase kinetic energy of the sedimenting balls at a given size of the ball ( Although the current work seeks optimal ball size for efficient milling at varying rotation speed, the degree of ZrO  For the interpretation of the decreasing trend of the milling efficiency with powder loading observed in the current work, at least two physical origins can be conceived of. First, the increased powder loading will increase the viscosity of the slurry. It is known that the viscosity is linearly proportional to the powder loading up to a critical powder loading at which the viscosity increases abruptly. The critical powder loading is approximately 40 10 This work was financially supported by the
