Several attempts have been made to quantify microbial protein flow from the rumen; however, few studies have evaluated tradeoffs between empirical equations (microbial N as a function of diet composition) and more mechanistic equations (microbial N as a function of ruminal carbohydrate digestibility). Although more mechanistic approaches have been touted because they represent more of the biology and thus might behave more appropriately in extreme scenarios, their precision is difficult to evaluate. The objective of this study was to derive equations describing starch, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and organic matter total-tract and ruminal digestibilities; use these equations as inputs to equations predicting microbial N (MicN) production; and evaluate the implications of the different calculation methods in terms of their precision and accuracy. Models were evaluated based on root estimated variance

Ruminal digestibility of NDF was positively associated with DMI and concentrations of NDF and CP and was negatively associated with concentration of starch and the ratio of acid detergent fiber to NDF (CCC=0.946). Apparent ruminal starch digestibility was increased by omasal sampling (compared with duodenal sampling), was positively associated with forage NDF and starch concentrations, and was negatively associated with wet forage DMI and total dietary DMI (CCC=0.908). Models were further evaluated by calculating fit statistics from a common data set, using stochastic simulation, and extreme scenario testing. In the stochastic simulation, variance in input variables were drawn from a multi-variate random normal distribution reflective of input measurement errors and predicting MicN while accounting for the measurement errors. Extreme scenario testing evaluated each MicN model against a data subset. When compared against an identical data set, predicting MicN empirically had the lowest prediction error, though differences were slight (

Despite the hypothesized benefits of a more mechanistic prediction approach, few differences between the calculation approaches were identified.Precision protein feeding is gaining interest in the dairy industry because dietary protein sources can be expensive and excessive N excretion is an environmental concern ( Several attempts have been made at quantifying microbial N production ( To more mechanistically represent the role of ruminal carbohydrate digestibility in microbial protein synthesis, it is useful to compare equation methods that directly predict MicN flow with those that predict ruminal carbohydrate (starch + NDF) digestibility as a first step to subsequently multiply by a predicted efficiency of microbial protein synthesis ( The objectives of this study were to derive equations describing starch, NDF, and OM total-tract and ruminal digestibility; to use ruminal equations as inputs to predictions of ruminal MicN production; and to evaluate the implications of the different calculation methods in terms of their precision and accuracy. We hypothesized that more mechanistic approaches to estimating MicN would yield poorer statistical fit when compared with more empirical approaches but that the precision of mechanistically estimated MicN, given the potential global variation in input parameters, will be favorable compared with the empirical approaches, thus supporting the use of the latter in models. Furthermore, we hypothesized that MicN production in scenarios that are notably different from average would be better predicted by more mechanistic prediction approaches. Data were collected and prepared for analysis as described in Roman-Garcia et al. (2016). Briefly, a literature search was conducted to identify studies that measured duodenal or omasal N flows. A total of 183 studies (613 treatments) were collected from the available literature. Most studies reported the inclusion rates of the ingredients used in diets; however, few studies reported nutrient composition of all ingredients. When ingredient nutrient composition data were available, they were used to calculate dietary nutrient provision. When ingredient-level data were not available, data were filled in from the Three estimates of MicN production were derived in a companion paper (Roman-Garcia et al., 2016). Models were based on diet ( To deploy The initial equation tested to predict rumen starch digestibility was very similar: Roman-Garcia et al. (2016) also derived an equation for EMPS ( Previous calculation schemes have relied on TDN to predict rumen MicN ( An important and somewhat poorly understood feedback loop apparent in ruminant biology is that of DMI and digestibility. Increasing ruminal digestibility of NDF alleviates bulk fill restriction of DMI; in contrast, increasing DMI can increase ruminal passage rate and decrease digestibility ( To better evaluate the relationship between DMI and ruminal carbohydrate digestibility, a more complex DMI prediction equation was derived to include terms for ruminal starch and NDF digestibilities. Although this equation was impractical to use in estimating MicN because of the circular calculation structure, it did enable more robust evaluation of the factors influencing the DMI and digestibility relationship. The starting model included All statistical analysis was completed in R v. 3.1.0 ( Monte Carlo cross validation was performed to evaluate all models against independent data sets. During this cross-validation procedure, the data set was split so 70% of the treatments were used for model derivation and 30% of the data were used for model evaluation. The data splitting, model derivation, and model evaluation was repeated 1,000 times using unique strings of random numbers to identify which treatments were used for evaluation and which were used for evaluation. The root mean square prediction error ( The differences between mechanistic and empirical modeling approaches extend beyond statistical goodness of fit. Mechanistic models have been proposed to have more bounded responses when input errors exist because the model complexity provides feedback that prevents prediction of extreme responses. Empirical models, however, are highly influenced by input errors ( Variance in input parameters (DMI, NDF, starch, ByNDF, ForNDF, DMIWetFor, DMIDryFor, CP, and ADF) were simulated by generating a multi-variate random normal distribution reflective of input measurement errors. Generating input errors in this manner offers a unique opportunity to better account for the covariation among inputs and allows for more grounded analysis of the sensitivity of the models. The mean of each vector within the distribution was assigned a value of 0 (0% different from true mean) assuming measurements were correct on average. A correlation matrix was calculated on mean difference values ( Mechanistic models are proposed to have improved capacity to replicate biology during extreme scenarios from which empirical estimations may be extrapolated ( When compared on an identical data set (a subset of the derivation data), The models of rumen starch, NDF, and OM digestibilities derived in this study are presented in The primary differences between ruminal and total-tract NDF digestibility predictions ( Previous work has demonstrated that ruminal starch digestibility is significantly affected by grain type ( Previous meta-analysis of rumen OM digestibility suggested that DMI, CP, silage type, and concentrate fat intake affects rumen OM digestibility ( A major challenge in deriving equations for use in empirical ration balancing systems is the prediction of voluntary intake and the correlations between intake and digestibility. Several theories regarding regulation of DMI in ruminants suggest that intake is regulated by NDF digestibility and starch fermentation, among other factors ( Although a DMI equation independent of rumen carbohydrate digestibility was derived to avoid this circular calculation issue, we also derived an equation that predicted DMI as a function of ruminal nutrient digestibility ( Empirical and mechanistic models have been used extensively to predict microbial protein flow ( To understand tradeoffs in model accuracy and precision, The cross-validation procedure also favored the empirical microbial N equation because this approach had the lowest RMSPE and smallest standard error of any microbial N prediction. Although differences between Stochastic model evaluation is gaining popularity as a means of understanding the error bounds around a simulation or prediction equation ( The mean residuals of The consistency of The differences between the modeling approaches were consistent when DMI was measured or predicted ( One proposed benefit of mechanistic models is the ability to behave more realistically in extreme scenarios. In the extreme scenarios tested in this evaluation, the empirical function ( Although The objectives of this study were to derive equations describing starch, fiber, and OM ruminal and total-tract OM digestibilities; use these equations as inputs to equations predicting MicN production; and evaluate the implications of the different calculation methods in terms of their precision and accuracy. Differences were identified among total-tract and rumen digestibility models, which supports future work evaluating predictions of hindgut digestibility. Dry matter intake was predicted by ruminal carbohydrate digestibility, but additional work modeling the interrelationship between DMI and digestibility is needed before this relationship can be incorporated into models estimating rumen carbohydrate digestibility. When compared against an identical data set, predicting microbial protein empirically had the lowest prediction error and highest concordance of any approach. Minimal differences were observed between empirical microbial protein prediction and microbial protein prediction from rumen carbohydrate digestibility in the stochastic analysis. Extreme scenario testing favored empirical and rumen digestibility-based microbial protein prediction in all scenarios. Despite the hypothesized benefits of a more mechanistic prediction approach, few differences could be identified between the empirical prediction and the equation relying on rumen carbohydrate digestibility. This work was carried out and supported, partially, as an activity of the
