The influence of silica content in concentrated aluminate solution on the crystallization of monosodium aluminate hydrate (MAH) has been investigated systematically. The resultant crystals were found to be round flakes, with a high silica concentration significantly inhibiting the crystallization. The conversion ratio and the average particle size of MAH crystals decreased with increasing SiO2 concentration in solution. The silicate impurity phases which crystallized simultaneously with MAH were identified as NaAlSiO4 and Na2SiO3 from low silica solution, Ca3Al2Si3O12, Ca3Al2(SiO4)2(OH)4, and Na4Ca4(Si6O18) we obtained when there was a high silica concentration. These phases have a much higher silica content than the more common desilication product Ca3Al2(SiO4)n(OH)12–4n

The temperature of the solution in the crystallizer was controlled within ± The seed particles were added and the time was recorded when the temperature of the solution in the crystallizer reached the reaction value. Slurry samples were withdrawn from the crystallizer at different times, filtered immediately and washed with anhydrous ethanol. The filtrate was analyzed to calculate the MAH crystallization conversion ratio, and the crystals were dried for PSD and XRD analysis and the identification of their morphology. The solid products were melted at high temperature in platinum crucibles, and then dissolved in acid solution to permit chemical analysis. The sodium aluminate solutions were made up to reflect the composition of a leach solution from caustic leaching of a diasporic bauxite, as listed in The chemical compositions of solutions were analyzed using an Optima 5300DV ICP-AES, and the PSDs of dried crystals were measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000MU after dispersion in anhydrous ethanol using ultrasonication. The morphologies of produced crystals were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6700 The crystallization conversion ratio ( Where Where The silicate concentration in supersaturated sodium aluminate solutions significantly affects the MAH crystallization ratio, as shown in In the presence of silica in the solution, the surface tension and viscosity of the sodium aluminate solution increase ( The PSD curves of MAH crystallized from the aluminate solution with various silica concentrations are shown in The XRD patterns of silicate compounds in the MAH crystalline from the aluminate solution with various silica contents are shown in Hydrogarnet phases have been shown to crystallize from the more dilute aluminate solutions present during the leaching and desilication steps of the Bayer process ( For MAH production, the silicon content in the product can be increased significantly by increasing the initial SiO The MAH crystallized from the concentrated sodium aluminate solution with silica, iron and calcium ions are round flakes, as shown in The conversion ratio and the average particle size for MAH crystallization decreased significantly with increasing silica concentration in a sodium aluminate solution. The crystals produced were either individual flakes or aggregates of flakes, depending on the solution silica concentration. The silicate phases present with MAH were NaAlSiO The authors acknowledge the financial support by the
