An oxygen pressure leaching–flotation joint process was proposed to treat Jinbaoshan platinum group minerals to produce a desired concentrate. The result demonstrates that leaching parameters which include particle size, stirring speed, liquid–solid ratio, and the dosage of calcium lignosulfonate, simultaneously affect the leaching rates of base metals and the recovery of platinum group metals (PGMs). The complete dissolution of base metals sulfides leads to a reduction in the amount of flotation carrier for enriching PGMs, decreasing the recovery of PGMs. The optimum leaching conditions are determined as follows: liquid–solid ratio of 10 mL/g, 73% occupancy of ore particle size below 0.043 mm, stirring speed of 400 r/min, and 0.6 g dosage of calcium lignosulfonate. Under optimal conditions, the leaching rates of Cu, Ni and Fe are 87.6%, 87.6% and 90.3%, respectively. The grade of PGMs enriched in the flotation concentrate is 420 g/t through the flotation technology.
