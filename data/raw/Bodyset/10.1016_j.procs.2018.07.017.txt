E-glass woven composite structures embedded with shape memory alloys are developed using hand layup technique. In the current work, actuation analysis of smart composites was performed to develop a controlled actuation using the programmable logic device. Active control of the composite structure was achieved with a Lab view program interfaced to data acquisition system (DAQ). The active smart structure has the deflection of 4.29mm in the time span of 60 s at 17V and 2A.
