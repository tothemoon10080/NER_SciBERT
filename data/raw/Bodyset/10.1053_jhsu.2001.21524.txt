Fourteen consecutive patients with acute displaced scaphoid waist fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. The operative technique consisted of anatomic reduction of the displaced scaphoid waist fracture, correction of carpal instability, radial bone grafting for comminution, and internal fixation with K-wires or Herbert screw. The patients were evaluated an average of 26 months (range, 4-48 months) after surgery. Thirteen of the 14 (93%) fractures united. The average time to union was 11.5 weeks (range, 8-20 weeks). Fracture union was confirmed with trispiral tomography. Final radiographic assessment consistently revealed a healed scaphoid fracture, restored intrascaphoid alignment, and no evidence of carpal instability. All patients regained functional wrist range of motion (wrist extension, 57°; wrist flexion, 52°) and grip strength. Open reduction and internal fixation of acute displaced scaphoid waist fractures restores scaphoid alignment and leads to predictable union. Early operative intervention avoids malunion and carpal instability that often occurs with closed management of these complex fractures. (J Hand Surg 2001;26A:271-276.
