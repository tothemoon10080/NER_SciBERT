Copper adsorption by orange peel, which was chemically modified with sodium hydroxide, was investigated. The adsorbent was characterized using surface area analyzer, infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Total negative charge and zeta potentials on the adsorbent surface were determined. Equilibrium isotherms and kinetics were obtained and the effects of solution pH value, adsorbent concentration and temperature were studied in batch experiments. Column experiments were performed to study practical applicability, and breakthrough curves were obtained. Equilibrium is well described by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, and kinetics is found to fit pseudo-second order type adsorption kinetics. According to Langmuir equation, the maximum adsorption capacity for Cu(II) is 50.25 mg/g at pH value of 5.3. The results show additional chemical modification of the adsorbent by NaOH and the increased adsorption capacity.
