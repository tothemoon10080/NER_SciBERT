Polarization characteristics of the electrodeposition processes of Fe powders from different citrate electrolytes and the morphology of the obtained powders were investigated. The effect of complexing agents on the cathodic polarization, the current efficiency and morphology of electrodeposited Fe powders were investigated. The morphology of obtained powders depends on the kind of supporting electrolyte, but not on the current density in investigated range. A characteristic feature of powders deposited from citrate-chloride supporting electrolyte is cauliflower-like compressed structure. On the other side, Fe powders electrodeposited from citrate-sulfate supporting electrolyte appeared in the form of spongy-like agglomerates. Possibility of Fe powders protection from corrosion in the process of production and during long-term storing has been shown.
