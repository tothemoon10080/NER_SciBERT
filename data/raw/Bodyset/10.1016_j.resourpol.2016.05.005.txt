In an open pit mining operation, the heterogeneity of the grade-tonnage distribution of the deposit dictates that all available material within the boundaries of an open pit may not be processed. Given this heterogeneity, it is imperative that the valuable (ore) and waste materials are clearly identified. In this context, the cut-off grade defines the quantity of ore and waste, ensuring smooth supply of ore to the processing streams. While, the earliest significant effort towards the development of models for cut-off grade policy dates back to 1960s, a number of contributions on this vital aspect of a mining operation have been made since then. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the available literature on cut-off grade policy models and suggests possible areas of future research. Cut-off grade is the most important economic criterion that defines the supply of ore and waste material from the mine to subsequent processing streams and waste dumps, respectively ( Given this definition, a cut-off grade policy thus describes a schedule or sequence of cut-off grades over the life of an operation, along with the corresponding quantity of material (ore and waste) to be mined, quantity and average (head) grade of ore to be processed, and the quantity of metal to be refined ( A grasp on the nature of inputs to cut-off grade models is fundamental to the understanding of these models. Accordingly, the cut-off calculation models consider economic, geological, and operational parameters as inputs ( The economic parameters include metal selling price ($ per tonne of metal, $ per pound of metal, or $ per gram of metal), refining, market and/or sales cost ($ per tonne of metal, $ per pound of metal, or $ per gram of metal), mining cost ($ per tonne of material), processing cost ($ per tonne of ore), fixed or period cost ($ per period or year), and discount rate (%). An orebody model delineating the resource mineralization on a block-by-block basis becomes the primary geological input. Depending upon the size of the orebody, a typical orebody model constitutes several thousand mining blocks, with location (spatial coordinates), metal content (grade), and quantity of material (tonnes) associated to each mining block. However, this primary geological input is then translated into grade-tonnage curve or distribution that constitutes grade categories/increments along with corresponding quantity of material (tonnage) within each grade category/increment ( Finally, the operational parameters include mining, processing, and refining capacities, and metallurgical recovery. Given the overall objective of a mining operation, it is the general understanding within the mine planning community that an optimal cut-off grade policy, derived from these inputs, would identify the best possible schedule of cut-off grades and the corresponding quantities of material to be mined Realizing the importance of the procedures that define such policy, this paper presents a comprehensive review of cut-off grade models. As such, in the following sections, we discuss the details of breakeven model, Lane's model, extensions in Lane's model, stochastic models, and mathematical programming models. Possible areas of future research are discussed in the concluding remarks. The traditional or breakeven model takes the metal selling price Consequently, at breakeven point, the In this model, depending on the mineral commodity, Moreover, as part of the strategic mine planning activity, Once an ultimate pit limit is established (irrespective of the nature, whether ore or waste, all mining blocks within the ultimate pit limit will be mined), the next decision is whether a mining block should be sent to the processing streams or waste dumps. At this stage, a mining block that is capable of covering the processing and refining, marketing, and/or sales costs shall be sent to the processing streams; otherwise, it shall be hauled to the waste dumps. This leads to the modified As opposed to the mining cut-off grade that takes the orebody model ( Aligning with the breakeven model, However, irrespective of these variations, it is evident that in the cut-off policy derived from the breakeven model, Unlike breakeven model, the cut-off grade calculation in Lane's model not only considers the grade-tonnage distribution of the mineralization, but also it honours the production capacities of various components of the mining operation. The model aligns with the overall objective of a mining operation, as it maximises the NPV subject to the mining, processing, and refining capacity constraints. Subjected to Here, In this context, given the grade-tonnage distribution and production capacities, if Now, if next While, Thus, an increase in the present value Substituting Now, time Finally, the optimum value of cut-off grade According to the Lane's model, Moreover, the point of intersection of curves While, the optimum cut-off grade Given the complexity and a number of repetitive iterations in these calculations, it is best to implement the Lane's model through an algorithm.  Lane's model is the pioneer work that describes the general theory of cut-off grades as well as its relevance to the mine planning aspects of an open pit mining operation. As explained in previous sections, a careful comparison of both Lane and breakeven models demonstrates the significance of Lane's model, and this became a reason for its large-scale acceptance in the mining industry. Today, not only the Lane's model has been implemented in the standard strategic mine planning software ( In this context,               Whereas, the contributions discussed above focused on the extension in Lane's model applicable to the mineral deposits with single economic mineral,  Here, This indicates that as opposed to a single optimum cut-off grade The convergence at the optimum values for     The metal selling price and grade-tonnage distribution are among the most important inputs for the development of the cut-off grade policy. While, the conventional studies discussed in the breakeven and Lane's model consider the constant (deterministic) values for metal selling price and the grade-tonnage distribution, in reality, being merely estimated values during the life of a mining operation, both parameters are subject to change or variation. The variation in metal selling price is market driven, and the impact of this change on mining operations is enormous, specially, during the periods of economic downturn or declining metal prices ( Not only this validates that cut-off grade policies derived from constant inputs for metal selling price and grade-tonnage curve may be biased or unrealistic, but also it demonstrates the importance of stochastic models for defining the cut-off grade policy under market and/or grade uncertainties ( Given this new framework of inputs, some contributions (           It has been established that not only Lane's model integrates grade-tonnage distribution and mining system capacities into the calculation of cut-off grade policy, but also it may be modified or extended to incorporate various important dimensions of a realistic mining operations, such as stockpiles, multiple processing streams, environmental issues, stochasticity of inputs into the algorithmic implementation of the model. However, the inherent assumptions and nature of the procedure in Lane's model as well as these additional considerations contribute to the complexity of the problem, which makes it prone to miss the optimum values for cut-off grades ( Therefore, the basic Lane's model remains heuristic, and it indicates the need to develop and implement mathematical programming models, ensuring the optimal solution to the problem (     While breakeven model provides a basic understanding into the calculation of cut-off grades, the drawbacks of its application to realistic, large-scale, and complex open pit mining operations are obvious, as it is proven that keeping a constant cut-off grade throughout the life of operation allows exposure to serious economic risks. Lane's model not only overcomes the deficiencies in breakeven model but also apart from the importance of economic inputs, it recognises the production based limitations of a mining operation as well as the relevance of the grade-tonnage distribution. Thus, it follows a systematic approach to define an optimal cut-off grade policy, which becomes a valid reason for its acceptability in both mining industry and academia. Specially, the extensions in both basic (single mineral) and multiple-minerals based Lane's models are a proven evidence of its flexibility or adaptation to implementation under varying inputs and solution approaches. These extensions cover economic, technical, environmental, and algorithmic (solution methods) variations, offering an expansion in the value and applicability of the Lane's approach. Moreover, apart from a few exceptions, a majority of the stochastic models also offers an extension into the basic Lane's model. These stochastic models consider commodity price and/or grade uncertainty and generate risk quantified cut-off grade policies, but they work within the confines of the conceptual framework defined in basic Lane's approach. The stochastic models are realistic and more relevant, but a very limited number of studies consider stochastic nature of the inputs to cut-off grade models. Thus, in future, there exists enormous scope of contribution through the development and implementation of stochastic models for defining the schedule of cut-off grades in open pit mining operations. Given the nature of Lane's models and their extensions, not only their algorithmic implementations rely on a pre-defined mining sequence but also being iterative generate solutions by trial and error method ( Nevertheless, given the scale of open pit mining operations, the size or number of decision variables within the mathematical models is excessive, which leads to the computational complexity of these models. Consequently, generating the solution to the mathematical programming based cut-off grade models within reasonable time becomes a challenge. Thus, the development of new methods or algorithms to solve these models is another emerging field of future research. So far, in the context of inputs to cut-off grade models, while the nature of economic or operational inputs varies from one model to the next, the structure of the geological input remains same, i.e. the grade-tonnage curve of the deposit as the geological input is the common factor among these models. Nevertheless, as explained in previous sections, apart from known mining sequence, uniform distribution of grades in a given mineralization is the basic assumption in conversion of the orebody model ( This limitation of the available heuristic as well as mathematical programming based models presents an opportunity on the development and implementation of mathematical models that take orebody models (
