An industrial wastewater effluent from the beverage industry has been treated in a pilot plant using a photo-Fenton process, which was intensified with persulfate. Under optimal conditions in a photo-Fenton process, 53% mineralization was achieved after two hours. The remaining Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was mainly composed of acetate and formate, whose decarboxylation was limited via hydroxyl radical reactions. Thus, persulfate (PS) was added to the system after 2h to obtain a more efficient decarboxylation by sulfate radicals (SR, SO4
                     
                        −). Different conditions were studied to activate PS (UV-C, thermal, Fe(II) and H2O2). The hydroxyl radical concentration in the solution was also measured, which supports the results in the sulfate-radical-based process.
                  The combined treatment with UV-C irradiation and thermally activated persulfate enhanced the mineralization efficiency. Under the best conditions, 76% mineralization was achieved in 4h: photo-Fenton reaction (UV-C/Fe(II)/H2O2) was achieved in the first two hours and UV-C/Fe(II)/H2O2/PS/thermal in the second two hours (65°C) (pH=2.9, [H2O2]=4000mg/L; [Fe(II)]=375mg/L). Strong inhibition of the oxidation of Fe(III)-oxalic complexes in the last stage of the treatment is not probable because its removal by precipitation does not improve the mineralization rate. Thus, the low reactivity of acetic acid and the formation of oxalic acid are responsible for the slow mineralization at the end of the process. The formation of undesirable chlorinated oxidation products is also improbable.The beverage industry produces huge volumes of wastewater effluent because water can be used to make beverages as an ingredient as well as clean and disinfect plant machinery and work zones. The composition of the wastewater can be affected by seasonal variations, source variations and unit operations, among other factors. However, this effluent typically contains high concentrations of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) because of the use of oranges, grapes or sugar Biological processes are commonly used in the industry because they are cost-effective treatments, but there are inconveniences, which include the following: i) high concentrations of toxic compounds inhibit mineralization Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are used to oxidize organic compounds in wastewater, which are difficult to biologically handle into simpler end products Among different advanced oxidation processes, the homogeneous photo-Fenton reaction is commonly the most effective method to generate hydroxyl radicals of HO However, SR-AOPs are strongly affected by the presence of main water constituents, i.e., Cl This paper aims to study the applicability of a combination of the photo-Fenton process and SR-AOPs to efficiently mineralize an industrial effluent from the beverage industry at a pilot plant scale so that a biological procedure is not needed. The concentrations of HO Analytical-grade ferrous sulfate (FeSO The UV pilot plant is shown in In a typical photo-Fenton run, the reactor is charged with wastewater, H Some preliminary tests to study the effect of persulfate (see Section The chemical composition of the industrial wastewater is summarized in The Total Organic Carbon was analyzed using a TOC analyzer (TOC-5050 Shimadzu). The H Formate, acetate and other ions were analyzed with high-performance ion chromatography using a Methrom chromatograph fitted with an ASUPP5 250 column and an ionic conductivity detector at 10–12 The hydroxyl radicals were quantified using disodium salt of terephthalic acid (NaTA) In the preliminary tests, a significant decrease in the TOC removal rate was observed after 120 a factorial design 2 axial of star points (codified values α central, replicates of the central point (3 experiments) However, after the results were observed, the design was extended to higher H The applied Neural Network (NN) in this work is solved with two neurones and uses a simple exponential activation function with a strategy based on a back-propagation calculation. Further details can be found in the literature Finally, the saliency of the input variables was measured based on the connection weights of the neural networks The experimental results and NN fittings are shown in The results of the saliency analysis on the input variables for each neural network (%) are also shown in  The mineralization degree clearly increases with the initial H However, when the optimal concentration of H Meanwhile, an increase in initial concentration of Fe(II) improves the overall mineralization process according to the following reaction: Four additional experiments ( A long test (5 The release of organic ions was confirmed by the experiments. The evolution of hydrogen peroxide in the solution ( This low concentration did not cause the low mineralization rate after the first hour because the HO Meanwhile, in the Fenton and photo-Fenton systems, chloride ions can form complexes with iron (FeCl Sulfate radicals have been used in the literature to degrade acetates A previous study has proven that persulfate can be simultaneously activated by heat energy, UV-C light, Fe (II) ions and H In this study, wastewater comes from a beverage industry, so the applicability of this system must be confirmed. First of all, different experiments were undertaken at a 1-L lab reactor adding persulfate under different conditions at pH At pH If hydrogen peroxide is also added (PS/Fe/H The amount of hydroxyl radicals that forms (not shown here) is notably low in all cases (<40 An increase in pH is expected to produce a higher mineralization degree The concentration of hydroxyl radicals during the reaction ( Based on these results, another study was performed in the pilot plant at the typical photo-Fenton pH (2.9) because of the marginal increase in mineralization with an increase in pH compared to the photo-Fenton system and the complications of sludge generated by iron hydroxide precipitation if both treatments (photo-Fenton and PS) are combined at pH Long tests (240 Additionally, the thermal activation of S The mineralization degree after 4 Sulfate radicals may undergo different reactions, as follows: i) production of hydroxyl radicals via Eq. PS is effectively thermally activated at high temperatures (50 The attack of the hydroxyl radical on acetic acid yields Guinea et al. (2009) reported the formation of Fe(III)-acetate complexes when oxidating carboxylic acids under a solar photo-assisted anodic oxidation in the presence of Fe (III) In addition, the oxalic acid does not react with H An additional experiment was performed to precipitate Fe(III) after 2 The evolution of hydroxyl radicals in the reaction is shown in The prices of materials (reagents and catalyst) and the electrical consumption of the different devices used for calculating the costs under optimal selected conditions are shown in Maintenance expense and depreciation have already been calculated for this pilot plant If the wastewater is treated up to seven hours to meet the discharge limit, the expense will increase sharply. However, this total cost can be reduced when operating at a bigger scale or by subtracting the electrical costs if solar energy and photovoltaic panels are used   In the photo-Fenton treatment, a fast primary mineralization stage is observed (first 2 Under optimal conditions, up to 76% mineralization is achieved after four hours using a combined photo-Fenton (2 Strong inhibition of the oxidation of Fe(III)-oxalic complexes in the last stage of the treatment is improbable because its removal by precipitation does not improve the mineralization rate. Thus, it is confirmed that the low reactivity of acetic acid and the formation of oxalic acid are responsible for the slow TOC removal at the end of the process. The formation of undesirable chlorinated oxidation products is also improbable.
