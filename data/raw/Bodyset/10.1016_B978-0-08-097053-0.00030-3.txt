 Maximum separation efficiency ( Computations: Column 4: conversion of Pb assay to PbS Column 5: determination of gangue (G) assay, 100-column 3b Column 6: intermediate step in calculation for recovery of PbS, column 2×column 4 Column 7: determination of increment PbS recovery, column 6/Σ column 6 (“head”) Column 8: cumulative recovery of PbS (or Pb) Column 9: intermediate step in calculation for recovery of G, column 2×column 5 Column 10: determination of increment G recovery, column 6/Σ column 9 (“head”) Column 11: cumulative recovery of G Column 12: determination of separation efficiency, column 8 – column 11 Maximum separation efficiency is determined from:  plot of Column 12 (CR PbS−CR G) versus time; and from plot of increment Pb grade (assay, %Pb, column 3) versus time, both given in Determination of flotation rate constant: disappearance plot ( Computations: Column 2: same as column 8 above Column 3: calculation of mass remaining, converted to fraction From the plot of column 3 (1−Cum In principle the same computations could be applied to gangue. In that case you will find an
