Part of tin in the magnetite-type tin-bearing ores existed as isomorphous Sn4+ in the lattice of magnetite (Fe3-xSnxO4, X=0–1.0), which was impossible to separate and recover by physical beneficiation methods In this study, a calcified roasting process under CO-CO2 atmosphere was applied to separate tin from the magnetite-type tin-bearing tailings, and the results indicated that the isomorphous Sn4+ in the magnetite was removed effectively. Then, Fe2.6Sn0.4O4 was synthesized to investigate the interface reaction mechanisms between CaO and Fe3-xSnxO4. The results indicated that the calcified roasting process can be divided into three stages: the ionic migration of Sn4+ on the interface between CaO and Fe3-xSnxO4 and formation of calcium stannates (Ca2SnO4/CaSnO3), diffusion of Sn4+ through the product layer (CaSnO4/Ca2SnO4), the oxidation of FeO to Fe3O4 by CO2. These findings can provide theoretical support for the utilization of magnetite-type tin-bearing tailings by the calcified roasting process.Tin-bearing iron ores is considered as one of typical complex resources in China Our previous studies indicated that Ca The content of lattce Sn Based on previous researches, Fe All the roasting tests were conducted in a horizontal-tube furnace, and the schematic diagram of experimental equipment was the same as our previous studies The mineral constituents of the roasted samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550PC, Japan Rigaku Co., Ltd) with the step of 0.005° at 10° In this section, magnetite type tin-bearing tailings taken from Yunnan province of China were used as raw materials. The total iron and tin content in the tailings were as high as 38.83 The results of Test 1# indicated the tin content in the magnetic material of Test 1# was as high as 0.253 The molecular formula of tin-bearing magnetite could be expressed as Fe  The effect of roasting temperature on the phase transformation of Fe  The XRD results of Previous studies have proved that the saturation magnetization of tin-doped magnetite decreased obviously as the increase of tin content in the Fe The SEM-EDS images of the roasting products (Sample 3# in In order to further investigate the interface reaction between CaO and Fe XPS analysis was conducted to check the chemical state of the roasted products at different roasting time and the raw material. The Fe 2p and Sn 3d photoelectron spectra are shown in Based on the results of previous literatures, the Sn in the Fe However, under weak CO-CO In a word, the reaction mechanism between CaO and Fe Then Fe The schematic diagram for the interface reaction between Fe  The interface reaction between CaO and Fe During the roasting process, weak CO-CO The reaction between CaO and Fe The authors would express their heartful thanks to
