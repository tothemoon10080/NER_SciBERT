We report a case of atypical femoral fracture related to long-term use of bisphosphonates and discuss the clinical presentation and imaging findings. A 61-year-old woman visited the emergency room with left hip pain after a fall from a standing position. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, and she was undergoing treatment with alendronate (70Â mg/week) for almost 2 years. The plain film revealed a transverse fracture of the left subtrochanter ( Bisphosphonate-related atypical femoral fracture is different from insufficiency fractures in clinical presentation and radiologic characteristics. Clinically, patients with atypical femoral fractures often present with prodromal symptoms, specifically femoral pain, before the fracture Bisphosphonates have been effectively used for many years to prevent complications caused by osteoporosis Checking bilateral femora may be warranted in patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. Early presentation of cortical thickening, separated fragments, or other radiologic characteristics demonstrates the possibility of bisphosphonate-related atypical femoral fractures and helps the radiologist and clinician to work toward early prevention of these fractures. However, further research is required to decide whether a change in our current therapy for osteoporosis is warranted.
