Mineral carbonation is an ex situ CO2 storage option that could allow to fix large amounts of CO2 in a solid and thermodynamically stable form. Its feasibility has been proven at lab-scale both employing natural minerals or alkaline industrial residues. However the energy requirements of this process can be quite significant depending on the type of material and operating conditions adopted and thus represent a crucial factor for its full scale applicability. The focus of this paper is the assessment of the energy requirements of CO2 storage by accelerated carbonation of alkaline materials applying the direct aqueous route. From the analysis of the main studies on energy penalties associated to the carbonation process large differences were observed on the assumptions made, the selected layout and operating conditions, in particular for alkaline residues. In addition most of the evaluations were carried out considering only experimental tests performed with high liquid to solid ratios (slurry phase route) while specific evaluations for tests with liquid to solid ratios lower than 1 (wet route) were not carried out. The overall aim of this study is to estimate the energy duties required to store the CO2 emissions of a small-medium size power plant (20 MW) by carbonation of different types of residues (steel slags and waste incineration residues) applying either the slurry phase or wet routes. In this paper the layouts of the proposed carbonation processes are presented and discussed.
