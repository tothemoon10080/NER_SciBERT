The feasibility of the removal of Ag+ ions in a model solution and a sample of rinse water provided from an industrial plating plantwas investigated in a batch electrodialysis system. The experiments were carried out using two different types of ion-exchange membranes. The effects of applied potential, pH value and initial silver concentration on the duration of electrodialysis and energy consumption were examined. Full removal of Ag+ ions was achieved from model solutions and the sample of rinse water. The most convenient applied voltage and energy consumption values to remove silver ions are reported. These results will be useful for designing and operating different capacities of electrodialysis plants for recovering Ag+ ions.
