CeO2–SiO2 composite thin films were prepared by e-beam evaporation and ion beam-assisted deposition (IBAD) using an End-Hall ion source. The refractive index of composite thin films exhibited a maximum value at 20–35% SiO2 fraction, indicating the highest packing density. Optical analysis revealed that the transmittance and reflectance spectra of composite films were consistent with the results of the refractive index. The results from X-ray diffractometry (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements showed that composite thin films containing 20–35% SiO2 concentration had a dense and smooth amorphous surface, compared to the roughened granular structure of the pure SiO2 and CeO2 thin films.Optical films deposited by e-beam (electron beam) evaporation show a microstructure of columns and noticeable pores, resulting in instability of the refractive index and the mechanical properties due to water absorption In this study, we investigate CeO The composite films were deposited by e-beam evaporation on glass and Si(100) wafer substrates that were irradiated during growth by argon and oxygen ions from an End-Hall ion gun. The microstructure of the thin films was modified without the damage from high-energy ions due to low ion energy and high current of the End-Hall ion source. The anode voltage of the End-Hall ion gun was 150 V (the mean ion energy of 90 eV) and the ion beam current incident on the substrate measured by a Faraday cup was 100 μA/cm The optical transmittance and reflectance of thin films deposited on glass substrates have been recorded by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101PC) in the wavelength ranges of 250–800 nm. An Al-coated reflector was used as a reference for the reflectance. The refractive index for thin films deposited on the Si(100) substrates was measured at 633 nm by a L117 ellipsometer (Gaertner Scientific). The structure of the films on glass substrates was determined by XRD (Rigaku, D/max-RINT 2700) operating at 30 kV, 20 mA, using Cu Kα1 line ( Variations of the refractive index of CeO   In general, the optical loss by scattering depends significantly on the surface roughness and is less for amorphous films than the crystalline ones CeO
