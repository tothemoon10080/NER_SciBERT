This chapter focuses on the investment and production costs of producing copper metal from ore and how these costs are affected by factors such as ore grade, process choice, and inflation. The economic feasibility of a project can be examined before spending significant funds for piloting, market studies, land surveys, and acquisition. The investment costs are expressed in terms of investment cost per annual ton of product copper. The total cost of producing copper from ore is made up of direct operating costs and finance or indirect costs. The total direct plus indirect cost of producing electrorefined copper from ore either by conventional mining, concentration, smelting, or refining is in the range of $1.5 to $2.2 per kg of copper, whereas the cost of producing electrowon copper cathodes from oxide and chalcocite ores is $0.7 to $1.5 per kg of copper. Copper extraction is distinctly profitable when the selling price of copper is âˆ¼$2.5 per kg, whereas it is unprofitable when the selling price falls below $1.5 per kg. At the former price, the industry tends to expand and at the latter price, it contracts.
