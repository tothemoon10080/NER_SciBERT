The rare-earth element complexes with DCTA of the Ln(dcta)−type show an unusual sequence of affinity for the polystyrene anion exchangers. Taking into account the position of Y(III), Sm(III) and Nd(III) in this affinity series, for the polyacrylate anion exchangers Amberlite IRA 458, Amberlite IRA 68 and Amberlite IRA 958, the distribution coefficients of these complexes were determined. Taking into consideration their values, the purification of Y(III) from Nd(III) and Y(III) from Sm(III) in the macro–micro system on the polyacrylate gel and macroporous strong basic, as well as weakly basic gel anion exchangers, was studied.
                  Using the above method, it is possible to obtain about 90 g Y2O3 purified from Nd2O3 and 81 g Y2O3 purified from Sm2O3 on 1 L of Amberlite IRA 68 in the acetate form with the yield about 50%.
                  These results indicate that the unique properties of polyacrylate anion exchangers enable their application for separation of rare-earth elements.Ion-exchange chromatography is one of the methods for preparation of rare-earth elements in a high state of purity. Eluents such as aminopolycarboxylic acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids or simple aliphatic carboxylic acids are made use of in the cation-exchange process to extract rare-earth elements Rare-earth elements have been separated on anion exchangers from nitrate solution containing an organic solvent Anionic rare-earth complexes with aminopolycarboxylic acids offer new possibilities for separation of these elements on anion exchangers. Recent investigations on the affinity series of anion lanthanide complexes with aminopolycarboxylic acids for strongly basic polystyrene anion exchangers are nontypical and nonmonotonic The affinity of rare-earth DCTA complexes for anion exchangers has proved very useful for their separation in the macro–micro system by the frontal analysis technique. Separation of Y(III) from Nd(III), Sm(III) and Eu(III) has been done on the polystyrene anion exchangers Dowex 1×4 and Dowex 1×2 Acrylate anion exchangers are used in industries to remove Fe cyanide from mill wastewater and to recover polyvalent metal (Ni, Fe, Cu, Co) cyanide complexes in a fluidized bed The aim of the paper was to study applicability of strongly and weakly basic anion exchangers with a polyacrylic skeleton for the separation of selected pairs of rare-earth complexes with DCTA (Ln(dcta) The structures of the three gel anion exchangers tested for separation of Y(III) from Nd(III) and Y(III) from Sm(III) complexes with DCTA are presented in Amberlite IRA 458, Amberlite IRA 68 and Amberlite IRA 958 of Rohm and Haas and Dowex 2×8 of the Dow Chemical were used in the investigations. The specifications of these materials are as follows: Amberlite IRA 458: polyacrylic, type 1, strongly basic, gel, bead size 600–900 μm, capacity 1.25 mEq/mL. Amberlite IRA 68: polyacrylic, type 1, weakly basic, gel, bead size 350–450 μm, capacity 1.6 mEq/mL. Amberlite IRA 958: polyacrylic, type 1, strongly basic, macroporous, bead size 675–875 μm, capacity 0.80 mEq/mL. Dowex 2×8: polystyrene, type 2, strongly basic, gel, bead size 150–300 μm, capacity 1.4 mEq/mL. The complexed solutions of rare-earth elements were prepared by heating the oxides with 1% excess of stoichiometric quantities of DCTA solution (Ln(III)/DCTA=1:1). The breakthrough curves were determined using 40 mL of the anion exchanger in the Cl The breakthrough curves of yttrium(III), neodymium(III) and samarium(III) were determined using the solutions of complexed rare-earth elements at a concentration 4.0 mM. Solutions of a concentration of about 1.5 g Ln The percentage of neodymium in yttrium was determined by the UV–visible spectrophotometric analysis using a SPECORD M 40 spectrophotometer (Zeiss, Germany). The determination was made directly at neodymium absorption maximum The percentage of samarium in yttrium was determined by X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) on the spectrometer CANBERRA PACKARD, USA. The samples with the addition of silica were homogenized and then pressed into tablets of surface density 0.0478 g/cm The rare-earth element complexes of DCTA of the type Ln(dcta) The chromatographic separations of Y(III) from Nd(III) and Y(III) from Sm(III) complexes with DCTA using polyacrylate gel and macroporous strongly basic as well as weakly basic gel anion exchangers were investigated in this paper. For the analogous complexes of Y(III) and Nd(III), comparative studies were carried out on the polystyrene anion exchanger Dowex 2×8 (type 2) with the functional groups—N The breakthrough curves of Y(III), Sm(III) and Nd(III) complexes with DCTA at pH 4.8 on the polyacrylate anion exchangers: strongly basic, gel Amberlite IRA 458, weakly basic, gel Amberlite IRA 68 and strongly basic, macroporous Amberlite IRA 958 in the acetate form are presented in The breakthrough curves of Nd(III) and Sm(III) complexes with DCTA exhibit higher affinity for both strongly basic and weakly basic polyacrylate anion exchangers. The corresponding Y(III) complexes and their affinity is arranged in the same order as for strongly basic polystyrene anion exchangers. Assuming that 1:1 complexes are formed, the ion exchange can be written as: The curves make it possible to calculate the values of the weight ( The estimated values of the distribution coefficients are presented in The breakthrough curve of Nd(III) complexes with DCTA was also determined on the Amberlite IRA 458 in the DCTA form The results of separation of Y(III) from Nd(III) (Nd The data indicate that the strongly basic, polyacrylate, gel anion exchanger Amberlite IRA 458 is more effective in purification of Y(III) from Nd(III) in comparison with the strongly basic, macroporous anion exchanger Amberlite IRA 958. It is shown that the weakly basic polyacrylate gel anion exchanger Amberlite IRA 68 is more effective than the strongly basic, gel anion exchangers of polyacrylate and polystyrene types The earlier results The polyacrylate anion exchangers with respect to their efficiency in purification of Y(III) from Nd(III) and Sm(III) complexes with DCTA can be arranged as follows: The weakly basic polyacrylate gel anion exchanger Amberlite IRA 68 is more effective in purification of Y(III) from Nd(III) and Sm(III) complexes with DCTA than the strongly basic anion exchangers of this type. The results in this paper, as well as those in earlier papers concerning the anion exchange process of rare-earth element complexes with aminopolycarboxylic acids (IMDA, HEDTA, EDTA, DCTA), indicate that the changes in affinity of suitable complexes of these elements for anion exchangers do not occur in the position of gadolinium which suggests that this affinity may result from the gradual change in the structure of complexes depending on the size of lanthanide ionic radius as well as from the character of interactions with an anion exchanger but not from the effect of the semifilled shell 4f.
