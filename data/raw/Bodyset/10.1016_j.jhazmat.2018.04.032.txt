Applying recycled iron-bearing waste materials (RIM) into iron ore sintering process is the general disposal approach worldwide, while its use is still a thorny problem. Results showed that adding RIM increased contents of hazardous elements (K, Na, Pb, Zn, and Cl) in sinter product, and also enhanced emission concentration of PM2.5 in flue gas; increasing reaction temperature, and contents of CaO & coke breeze in raw mixtures improved hazardous elements removal. Based on these features, a novel method through granulating natural iron ores and RIM separately and distributing granulated RIM in bottom sintering layers was proposed for clean RIM cycle. When recycling 5% RIM, granulating RIM separately with higher contents of CaO and coke breeze removed hazardous elements effectively, the contents of which in sinter were reduced to comparable level of the case without RIM. Moreover, distributing RIM in bottom sintering layer reached intensive release of hazardous elements and PM2.5 during sintering, which reduced the flue gas volume needing purification by about 2/3. Through activated carbon purification, about 60% of PM2.5 comprised high contents of hazardous elements was removed. Novel technique eliminated the negative impact of RIM and has the prospect to reach clean recycle in sinter-making plants.China has been ranked first in terms of crude steel output throughout the world since 1996, with annual output even exceeding 800 million tons in recent years [ Throughout the whole steelmaking process, iron ore sintering is the first high-temperature process with its purpose to prepare lump burden for ironmaking in blast furnace. During sintering process, iron ore fines, recycled iron-bearing materials (dusts and slags), fluxes (dolomite, limestone, etc.), and fossil fuels, such as coke breeze and anthracite, are thoroughly mixed and agglomerated into lump-like sinter under about 1300 °C provided by the combustion of fossil fuels [ In this investigation, when recycled iron-bearing materials were used, for producing sinter with lower contents of hazardous elements in cleaner manner, the influences of applying RIM on sinter quality, emission concentration of hazardous elements and PM In this investigation, the raw materials necessitated for producing sinter product were provided by integrated steelworks in South China. For elucidating the influence of applying RIM on sintering performance, three schemes were arranged through regulating the proportions of RIM, of which the proportion increased from 0% to 10%, as shown in Sinter pot trials were conducted to simulate the industrial-scale sinter-making process, where a sinter pot of depth 700 mm and diameter 180 mm was used ( Typical sintering indexes including sintering speed, sinter yield, tumbler index, productivity, etc., were examined. The sintering speed is the ratio of layer height and sintering time, mm min The whole sintering process was divided into 6 typical stages for elucidating the PM Whatman QMA Quartz fiber filters was used to collect particulate matter (PM) samples. It has the function to remove the PM > 10 μm, and then divided the PM ≤ 10 μm into 6 parts, with grain size of 0–1.4 μm, 1.4–2.5 μm, 2.5–3.6 μm, 3.6–5.0 μm, 5.0–6.9 μm, and 6.9–10 μm according to their aerodynamic diameter. PM The mass concentrations of hazardous elements like K, Na, Pb, Zn, etc. in raw mixtures and finished sinter were examined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES Optima 30, JobinYvon, France). Detailed analytical steps could be described as ground samples were dissolved by acid digestion with aqua regia added to fluorhydric acid (6 ml HCl, 2 ml HNO The influences of adding RIM on sintering indexes and contents of K, Na, Pb, Zn and Cl in sinter are given in The influence of adding RIM on the emission concentration of PM The influences of using RIM on chemical composition of PM  For further verifying the function of coke breeze, CaO, and reaction temperature on the removal of K, Na, Pb and Zn in sintering bed, the influences of these factors were given in The emission property of PM According to the emission concentration and chemical composition of PM As stated above, applying 5% RIM increased the contents of hazardous elements in finished sinter product, and it also enhanced the emission concentrations of PM Taking above analyses into consideration, the RIM was separately granulated and then placed at different positions of the sintering bed. Detailed separate granulation method can be found elsewhere [ The influences of regulating RIM distribution on sintering indexes are shown in The influences of RIM distribution on the emission property of PM The influences of distributing RIM in bottom layer with higher contents of coke breeze and basicity (Case-5) on the emission concentrations of hazardous elements are shown in As a consequence, distributing RIM in bottom layer with higher coke breeze content and basicity facilitated the production of sinter with lower hazardous elements due to increased removal rate. Moreover, the distributing method successfully made hazardous elements and PM In laboratory scale, the effect of activated carbon process purifying the flue gas of temperature rising process was preliminarily examined. When keeping the grain size of industrial activated carbon was 3–5 mm and airspeed (ratio of the flue gas flow to volume of activated carbon layer) was 15 min In the future, the real application of regulating RIM distribution in sintering machine is illustrated in Compared with conventional flue gas treatments method, the recommended novel technology seemed to increase the technical cost for activated carbon absorption tower. However, it is worth mentioning that the activated carbon can also remove SOx efficiently (>95%). The intensive emission area of PM  Adding RIM exerted adverse influence on sintering indexes, and increasing its proportion decreased the sintering indexes further, enhanced the contents of hazardous elements (K, Na, Pb, Zn, and Cl) in sinter, and increased the emission concentration of hazardous elements and PM The removal characteristics of hazardous elements during sintering process showed that the removal rates of K, Na, Pb, and Zn were increased from top sintering layer to bottom layer, and increasing reaction temperature, contents of CaO and coke breeze in mixtures facilitated the improvement of removal rates. Moreover, PM Granulating RIM and iron ores separately and distributed in different sintering layers indicated that distributing RIM in bottom layer with higher contents of CaO and coke breeze obviously improved the removal rates of hazardous elements, and made them together with PM The intensive releasing property of PM This work was supported by the
