In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical model (a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs) to capture some of the dynamical effects produced by adding charcoal to fertile soils. The main goal is to understand to which extent charcoal is able to lock up carbon in soils. Our results are preliminary in the sense that we do not solve the

                  We show that our model is well-posed and has interesting large-time behaviour. Depending on the reference parameter range (e.g., type of soil) and chosen time scale, numerical simulations suggest that adding charcoal typically postpones the release of

                     .In his Nature paper In mathematical terms, our main question is:  In this context, the major issue is the complexity of the situation – it is It is worth noting that charcoal is characterized by a very special porous structure (see The paper is organized as follows: In Section We hope that our paper will bring the attention of the mathematical modeling community on the biochar issue. Note that, cf. Section In this section we provide a simple model for the chemical reactions taking place in charcoal-enriched soil. We model only those processes that are relevant to carbon dioxide emission: the break down of soil organic matter and charcoal by microbes and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide, the reproduction and death of the microbes, and the effect of charcoal on soil fertility. We denote the species appearing in the chemical reactions by Microbes in the soil break down the organic matter and charcoal (this is called mineralization), releasing the carbon, which then combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Experimental evidence indicates that generally there is no shortage of oxygen in the soil. Having this mind we assume that oxygen is present everywhere in equal amounts and thus it enters our model as a parameter. We model the complex system of mineralization processes by means of the following chemical reactions mechanism: The microbes need organic matter and oxygen to reproduce. Since we assumed that there is an abundance of oxygen, we can model the reproduction of microbes by means of We model the death of microbes by the chemical reaction We denote the concentration of species Within the framework of this paper, we consider a “continuously stirred tank reactor” case, a scenario intensively used in chemical engineering; see, e.g., Applying the We start by introducing a set of assumptions on the model parameters entering We assume that  In addition to choosing that Since the Finally, we assume that the initial concentrations are positive and bounded, i.e., In this section we show that the concentrations We prove that the concentrations From the positivity of Relying on the Based on the positivity and the  Furthermore, a Gronwall-like argument can be employed to show that this classical solution depends continuously on the initial data and First note that We first search for the equilibria of the decoupled system given by It immediately follows from By inserting Therefore, depending on the parameter To test the stability of the equilibrium points We follow the same procedure for In summary, for each Before solving the system numerically, we rescale it (very much in the spirit of Here we illustrate numerically the behaviour of the solution to our ODE system. The main interest lies in predicting how the emission of We start by choosing the following linear constitutive functions for the reaction rates: Equality in The reproduction and death of microbes is considerably faster than the break down of organic matter. The latter is still faster than the break down of charcoal. There should be a stable equilibrium with The parameters and reference values that are still free for us to choose, are listed in The values in The resulting simulation showed minor response in the values for  The concentrations On an intermediate time scale On a long time scale ( On the same long time scale, the The graphs of the Still we like to understand the sensitivity of the In contrast to putting as much parameters and reference values equal to 1, we now take characteristic values for  We aim to get similar results as depicted in We start by taking By taking The results of the simulation are shown in Within this framework, we translated the problem of charcoal sequestration in soils in terms of the large-time asymptotics of classical solutions to a set of nonlinear differential equations describing a lumped chemistry between charcoal and chemical composition of soils. Proving basic results (positivity and What concerns the system’s sensitivity with respect to varying parameters, we observe strong effects especially on intermediate time scales. Most importantly, for a rather large range of parameter values, our simulations clearly indicate that the short-time behaviour of our system can be significantly different from the long-time behaviour. Therefore, when testing experimentally the effect of adding charcoal to soil on Our model incorporates a large set of parameters and reference constants. To identify reasonable numerical ranges for them, we would need more experimental data (i.e., the Our simulation output shows that there is enough freedom to change the relative difference in We thank the two reviewers for helping us improve our manuscript.
