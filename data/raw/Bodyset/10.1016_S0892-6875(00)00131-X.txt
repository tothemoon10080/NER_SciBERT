A linear multivariable model for a flotation column is derived from process analysis and experimental data. The data have been taken from a pilot-scale column (height 720 cm; diameter 5.1 cm) with all necessary instrumentation installed. The flotation column was operated in a water-air system. The model has been derived aimed at utilisation in the design of the control system. The model describes the relationship between controlled variables (froth layer height, bias and air holdup in the recovery zone) and manipulated variables (wash water, air and non-floated fraction flowrates). It has been validated comparing the experimental data with those obtained from simulations. Finally, the conditions under which the model is applicable are presented.
