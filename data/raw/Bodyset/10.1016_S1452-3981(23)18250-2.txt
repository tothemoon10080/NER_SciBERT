Corrosion and inhibitor protection of mild steel specimens immersed in acid chloride solution was investigated at ambient temperature by gravimetric and potential monitoring methods. The electrode potential monitoring was performed using a digital voltmeter and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Extracts of kola plant and tobacco in different concentrations were used as ‘green’ inhibitors. This paper reports the results obtained from the weight loss method, calculated corrosion rates and the observed electrochemical response from the electrochemical potential monitoring of the mild steel during the experiments. A reduction in the active corrosion reactions behaviour of the mild steel test specimens in the strong acid chloride was obtained with the addition of different concentrations of the plants extracts. There was a drastic reduction in the weight loss and in the corrosion rate of the test samples. This behaviour was attributed to the protective film provided on the steel’s surface by the complex chemical constituents of the plants extracts. Effective protection of the mild steel was achieved in nearly all the extracts for the greater part of the experimental period. However, the most effective results were obtained from the tobacco extract and also from the extract of kola leaf.
