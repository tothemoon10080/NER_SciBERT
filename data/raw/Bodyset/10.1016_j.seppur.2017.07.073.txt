An innovative process was developed for the leaching of niobium- and rare earth elements-bearing pyrochlores ores and the subsequent separation of Nb from the REE. Compared to the conventional Nb hydrometallurgical methods, the proposed leaching process is based on a triphasic system: H2SO4(aq)-SO2(g)-activated carbon/ore. The implementation of this leaching step allows the selective dissolution of the non-valuable phases while significantly reducing the H2SO4 consumption. The results obtained in continuous operation, at the pilot scale, show a reduction of the sulfur consumption by 48% when compared to the classical H2SO4 pasting-roasting process. The presence of activated carbon, at concentration as low as 0.4% (w/w), was found to considerably fasten the dissolution reactions and allows optimizing the SO2 utilization to a nearly quantitative rate. The triphasic leaching also affords concentrating the Nb stream which decreases the energy consumption of the down-stream operations and especially for the subsequent Nb-REE-bearing pyrochlores roasting step. The process was optimized at the laboratory scale and then tested in continuous operation for 15days at a flow of 15kgh−1 of dry equivalent of non-magnetic Nb-REE pyrochlore ore from the Gabonese Mabounié deposit and the equivalent of 8.25kgh−1 of H2SO4 and 0.15kgh−1 of activated carbon.Although not well known to the general public, niobium (Nb, Z Besides the presence of several valuable elements, the Nb-bearing ores also contain a large amount of impurities, among which iron plays a central role. The currently exploited niobium raw ores typically contain 5–18 In this regard, the Gabonese deposit called The original flowsheet of the up-stream part of the hydrometallurgical process developed for the recovery of Nb and the REE from the In the present paper, we report a significant improvement of the process by developing a leaching step based on a triphasic system: H The composition of the non-magnetic ore used during this study is given in Powder XRD spectra were collected using Cu K Al, Fe, P, S, Ce, La, Nd, Gd, Pr, Y and Nb concentrations were determined by ICP-OES using an iCAP 6000 series spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Others REE (Sm, Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu), Sc and U were determined by ICP-MS using an Aurora M90 spectrometer (Brucker). Liquid samples were diluted in 2% HNO Iron(III) concentrations were determined according to the UV–Vis spectrophotometric method described by Afeworki and Chandravanshi The experimental setup used for the determination of the SO Typically, 200 50 300 Recovery yields were calculated using liquid and solid analyses and according to the following formula: With m %M: the content of element M in the dried solid, V [M] V [M]   [Fe   SO         In order to reduce the acid and energy consumption of the pyrochlores roasting step, and of the global process in general ( Combining Eqs. Though converting FeOOH into Fe The balanced equation for Eqs.  The influence of the concentration of AC catalyzer, used for the leaching step, on the iron reduction rate was then studied ( Besides the ore weight loss, which is directly linked to the energy consumption of the process, the other important parameter is the acidity of the pregnant leach solution. Indeed, in the case of the process developed here, the pregnant leach solution (PLS) does not contain the elements of interest (Nb and REE) since the refractory pyrochlores, which bear the valuable elements, are only attacked during the following roasting step. Nonetheless, as detailed below (  In order to evaluate the effect of AC on the SO The influence of the SO It is worth mentioning that the SO Before considering a catalytic mechanism, it must be proved that the activated carbon serves as a catalyzer and not a reductant. This was achieved using two different points. Firstly, during ore acid leaching tests, the activated carbon was mixed with ore in acidic conditions and the mixture was heated up to 95 Once the role of catalyzer confirmed for the activated carbon, it was possible to propose a mechanism. It can be supposed that the dissolved HSO In order to validate the leaching process developed at the laboratory scale, a continuous running test was performed at the pilot scale. Due to the presence of uranium in the ore, the pilot test was performed at AREVA Mines’ facility located at Bessines sur Gartempe (FRANCE). The process was operated for 15 During the first 5 The Fe(III) reduction rate reached 100 (±2)% throughout the 15 The average dissolution yields and composition of the leaching concentrate obtained during the pilot campaign are given in A triphasic leaching step was developed for the selective dissolution of the iron phases of Pyrochlore ores containing niobium and rare earth elements.
