This chapter reviews the melting and casting technology in copper extraction of electrorefined and electrowon cathodes. These are the last steps in a copper smelter or refinery. The choice of melting and casting technology is based on the quality of the input copper, required chemistry of the desired product, and the type of final product. The main products of melting and casting are continuous rectangular bars for rolling to rod and drawing to wire, round billets for extrusion and drawing to tube, and flat strip for rolling to sheet and forming into welded tube. The vast majority of this copper is “tough pitch” copper. This copper is only used for the most demanding high conductivity applications because of its expensive production. These pure copper products account for about 70% of copper use and the remainder is used in the form of copper alloy, mainly brass and bronze. The principal melting tool for cathodes is the Asarco shaft furnace. Casting machines are divided into three main types: billet, bar, and strip casting. The bar casters are efficient because their hot bar can be fed directly into continuous rod-rolling machines. The quality of cathode copper is tested severely by its performance during casting, rolling, and drawing to fine wire.
