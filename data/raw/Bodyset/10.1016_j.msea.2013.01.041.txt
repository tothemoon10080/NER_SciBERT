Fully dense amorphous Al86Ni6Y4.5Co2La1.5 alloy with a 10mm diameter has been fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). It showed record fracture strength of 1250MPa for aluminium alloys. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed good interfacial bonding. The activation energy for the SPS process depends on the applied pressure and is substantially higher than that for the self-diffusion of aluminium.Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) continue to draw significant attention because of their unique physical and mechanical properties Given the challenges for the fabrication of Al-based BMGs from liquid, alternative approaches are desired. Powder metallurgy offers such an option, in particular the spark plasma sintering (SPS) process Nitrogen gas-atomized Al  The sintered densities are shown in  To understand the influence of the pressure on the SPS of the amorphous alloy, the activation energy for the SPS process was assessed using the model below The considerable difference in the activation energy confirms that it is much easier to consolidate Al-based metallic glass powder under 600  Fully dense 10  We gas-atomised an Al-based metallic glass alloy to fine (<25μm) amorphous powder and fabricated 10 mm diameter fully dense and amorphous Al-BMGs using spark plasma sintering (SPS) These fully dense large Al-BMG samples showed record fracture strength with good interfacial bonding revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) We experimentally determined the activation energy for the consolidation process which suggests a unique densification mechanism We showed that crystallization depends more on temperature than pressure while densification depends more on pressure than temperature in the temperature range of 248.5°C to 268.5°C and the pressure range of 200 MPa to 600 MPa.
