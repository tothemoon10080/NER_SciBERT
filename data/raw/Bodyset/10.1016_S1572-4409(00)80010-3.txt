Mechanochemistry as a branch of solid state chemistry which enquires into processes which proceed in solids due to the application of mechanical energy. The central problem of the solid state chemistry is the relationship between structure and reactivity of solids. Mechanochemistry helps us to solve this problem by the intentional formation of defects in the structure of solid substances by the application of mechanical forces using intensive grinding equipments. This book aims to be the collection of the knowledge obtained by mechanical activation of minerals which contribute to the theoretical elucidation of the corresponding structural transformations. Identification of the transformations in mechanically activated sulfide minerals has enabled one to evaluate the sensitivity of subsequent reactivity to structural changes during activation. The publication presents examples illustrating that many solid phase reactions are structure sensitive processes. The factors influencing this structural sensitivity are identified.
