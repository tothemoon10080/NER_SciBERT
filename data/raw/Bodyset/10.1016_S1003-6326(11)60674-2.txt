Commercial aluminum (grade 1900) in rotary motion was exposed to slurry of sand in water. Samples were mounted at various angles and rotated at different speeds. Wear rate was calculated using mass loss measurement. The results show that wear rates increase with increasing impingement angle up to 90°. Contrary to the conventional understanding of maximum loss of ductile material at about 45° impingement angle, maximum wear rate was observed in case of the aluminum sample fixed at 90°. However, increasing rotation speed of the samples results in exponential increase in wear rate. The findings are substantiated with the metallographic study of worn surface.
