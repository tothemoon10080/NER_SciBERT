Degradation of cyanuric acid in aqueous suspensions of Degussa P25 TiO2 has been achieved by the addition of fluoride ion at low pH. Consistent with the work of Minero and Pelizzetti [Langmuir 16 (2000) 2632, Langmuir 16 (2000) 8964], it is suggested that this is due to the formation of homogeneous phase hydroxyl radicals. Support for this hypothesis is brought from successful degradations using other hydroxyl-generating conditions and the successful degradation of 4-t-butylpyridine, another organic compound previously shown to be resistant to TiO2-mediated photocatalytic degradation.Nearly every organic molecule ever tested is degraded to CO One of the very few organic molecules known to survive such treatment is cyanuric acid, ( In neutral to acidic solution, ( A few reasonable hypotheses might be proposed to account for the stability of ( A second hypothesis is that hydroxyl radical addition does occur, but is reversible because loss of water or HO The factor that suggested this idea to us was the recent report from Nedoloujko that 4- Here, we report the degradation of cyanuric acid, both using Fenton chemistry and the TiO All chemicals were obtained from Aldrich in the highest purity available and used as received, except as noted.

Consistent with the data in We further infer from the results of the Fenton and hydrogen peroxide photolysis experiments that the relative unreactivity of ( When cyanuric acid is subjected to TiO Moreover, the observation of “ordinary” hydroxylation intermediates in the TiO The pH sensitivity of the degradation of ( Previous to this, we are aware of only a single report of degradation of cyanuric acid by any TiO The addition of fluoride to aqueous suspensions of titania has proved to be an important mechanistic tool in unraveling a long-standing conundrum in photocatalytic degradation. By using this method in parallel with other methods for producing homogeneous hydroxyl-type reagents, it is shown that cyanuric acid is susceptible to degradation under easily accessible conditions.
