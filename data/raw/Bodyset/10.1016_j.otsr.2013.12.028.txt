This article presents a rare case of traumatic complete expulsion of the helical blade after successful treatment of an intertrochanteric fracture with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). A 94-year-old woman sustained an intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur. Fracture fixation was performed by using PFNA-II. At six months FU, the patient presented with pain at the proximal lateral left thigh after she had fallen. A protrusion was noted. Radiographs showed a complete expulsion of the helical blade with a healed intertrochanteric fracture. The PFNA-II was removed and a cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty was performed. At 5 months after surgery, the patient was able to walk with a walker without pain. Traumatic complete expulsion of the blade should be considered as a possible complication of PFNA/PFNA-II.As life expectancy continues to increase, the incidence of hip fracture rises drastically A 94-year-old woman sustained an intertrochanteric fracture (AO/OTA classification: 31-A1) of her left femur after a fall ( At 6 months, a protrusion at the proximal lateral left thigh was noted after a fall ( The use of PFNA/PFNA-II allows a minimally invasive approach that provides stable fixation and allows for early full weight-bearing mobilization. Most of the complications documented in the literature involved cutout and perforation of the femoral head by the blade The complete backout of the helical blade is rare. A literature review showed only six descriptions of excessive blade backout in six earlier reports The present case showed proper postoperative reduction and blade position Biomechanically, the PFNA/PFNA-II is constructed so that the helical blade slides in a lateral direction. Radiographs 3 months after surgery revealed 13-mm lateral sliding of the helical blade (telescope effect) ( The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this article.
