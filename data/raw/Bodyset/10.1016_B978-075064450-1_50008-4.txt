This chapter presents different types of primary as well as secondary crushers and defines their working and usage in detail. Crushing is the first mechanical stage in the process of comminution in which the main objective is the liberation of the valuable minerals from the gangue. Primary crushers are commonly designed to operate 75% of the available time, mainly because of interruptions caused by insufficient crusher feed and by mechanical delays in the crusher. Secondary crushing includes all operations for reclaiming the primary crusher product from ore storage to the disposal of the final crusher product, which is usually between 0.5 and 2 cm in diameter. The primary crusher product from most metalliferous ores can be crushed and screened satisfactorily. The secondary plant generally consists of one or two size-reduction stages with appropriate crushers and screens. The chapter explains various stages of secondary crushing. A washing stage is included, which is often necessary for sticky ores containing clay that may lead to problems in crushing and screening. It also explains open or closed circuit crushing depending on product size. In open circuit crushing, undersize material from the screen is combined with the crusher product and is then routed to the next operation. Open circuit crushing is often used in intermediate crushing stages or when the secondary crushing plant is producing a rod mill feed. If the crusher is producing ball-mill feed, it is a good practice to use closed-circuit crushing in which the undersize from the screen is the finished product.
