A nanostructured surface layer of Ti-6Al-4V alloy was obtained through ultrasonic shot peening (USSP). The microstructure and microhardness were studied using an optical microscope and a nanoindentation tester. The corrosion performance of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The composition of the passive film formed on the surface was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that the grain size of the surface layer is on nanometer scale and increases gradually from the surface to the matrix after USSP treatment. The surface microhardness reaches up to approximately 7 GPa, which is significantly higher than that of the matrix. The self-corrosion potential of the USSP samples increases compared with that of the untreated sample, and the corrosion current density decreases by two orders of magnitude, the capacitive resistance is much larger. A compact and stable passive film forms on the surface after USSP treatment. High-density nanograin boundaries and dislocations generated from surface nanocrystallization provide more channels for Ti4+ to form passive oxide films.
