Fine sphalerite was pressed into a thermosetting graphitic polymer matrix and a reusable electrode suitable for dynamic electrochemical measurements was obtained. After activation of the sphalerite by PbII, cyclic voltammetry was performed in the absence and presence of potassium ethyl xanthate. The resultant anodic and cathodic waves were compared with voltammograms obtained from the literature, ‘stripping’ analysis of a graphitic electrode, as well as with the behaviour of galena and CuII activated sphalerite electrodes. This work suggests that adsorbed PbII on sphalerite is present as a simple ionic species, behaving similarly to Pb(OH)2 during reduction and reacting with ethyl xanthate by ion exchange.
