The interfacial behavior of spark plasma sintered ZrB2–SiC nanocomposite doped with graphene nano-platelets was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A powder mixture including ZrB2 matrix, 20 vol% SiC and 10 vol% graphene was used as the starting material. X-ray diffraction analysis did not exhibit any in situ phase formation in the prepared nanocomposite. TEM observations verified the diffusion-controlled sintering. This study clarifies that graphene nano-platelets additive in the prepared nanocomposite did not engage in reactive sintering process, unlike many previous research studies addressing reactive sintering role for carbon additives.Spark plasma sintering (SPS) process is known as a recently developed high-tech sintering route for the fabrication of powder-based materials. In this method, an electrical field supplies the required heat for the sintering of powder materials. Similar to the conventional hot pressing (HP) procedure, an external pressure is applied to the compacted powder during the sintering process. However, compared to the HP, a lower practicable temperature with a worthwhile shorter dwell time is needed to fabricate the dense products by the SPS By applying this procedure, an improved densification and minimized grain growth could be achieved for the ZrB Ultrahigh temperature ceramic (UHTC) composites including ZrB Graphene as a nano–sized reinforcement additive is added into UHTCs to enhance the thermomechanical properties of such composite materials due to its high two-dimensional aspect ratio Commercial grade ZrB Bulk density of the spark plasma sintered sample was determined by the Archimedes’ rule in a distilled water medium. Relative density was evaluated with reference to the theoretical density of composite sample which was estimated by the rule of mixture based on the true densities of ZrB  It is previously reported and proved that carbon additives can react with the surface oxide impurities of SiC and ZrB As it can be clearly seen in  It is reported that the presence of carbonaceous materials as sintering additives, lead to the removal of oxide impurities on the surface of composite components ( Atomic diffusion through interfaces can be clearly observed in high magnification TEM nanographs in It is noteworthy that in contrary with HP sintered ZrB The formation of diffusion boundaries in the interfaces of grains/particles is also visible in  As a result of carbon diffusion, vacancies can form inside the graphene nano-platelet, just behind the ZrB In conclusion, it seems that graphene nano-platelets as sinter-additives for ZrB ZrB
