The effect of solute Nb on the ferrite lattice parameter in low carbon steels was examined using X-ray diffraction and related to atomic size difference. The concentration of solute Nb in ferrite of a furnace-cooled steel was successfully predicted using the measured coefficient of Nb atoms on the ferrite lattice parameter.The carbo-nitride-forming elements such as Nb, Ti and V have great influence on microstructure and mechanical properties of low carbon microalloyed steels. A small addition of Nb to low carbon steels is very effective in grain refinement and precipitation hardening as solute Nb atoms or NbC precipitates. The amounts of the solute Nb and NbC precipitates in microalloyed steels have been investigated by using different experimental methods such as inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and stress relaxation Although the size and chemical composition of the precipitates can be evaluated from TEM-EDS work, it is still difficult to acquire the amount of the precipitates, especially in the case of very fine particles less than 100 The X-ray diffraction technique is expected to be useful to quantitatively determine the amount of the solute Nb based on the relationship between the lattice parameters of austenite and ferrite and the concentration of an alloying element as follows Eq. The five ingots of Fe–X%C–0.2%Si–1.2%Mn–Y%Nb steels were prepared using a vacuum induction furnace. The chemical composition of homogenized ingots is listed in To examine the lattice parameter of ferrite, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were performed at room temperature after the calibration of the standard Si powders using “Rigaku D/Max-RC” diffractometer with the Cu target whose Kα wavelength The effect of Nb on the lattice parameter of ferrite in the ultra-low carbon microalloyed steels (A1, Strictly speaking, however, the distribution of the solute Nb atoms would be unlikely uniform in the ferrite matrix during furnace cooling, because the segregation of Nb atoms to the grain boundaries can occur at such a slow cooling rate The variation in lattice parameter of ferrite is plotted against Nb content in atomic percent in The intersection point between a fitted straight line and Assuming that the variation in lattice parameters of austenite and ferrite with the addition of an alloying element is closely related to the difference in atomic radius The coefficient of the alloying element on the lattice parameter of austenite is increased with the increase in difference in atomic radius between Fe and the alloying element. Specially, the coefficient of Nb in Eq. In the same way, the coefficient of Nb on the lattice parameter of ferrite is estimated by fitting the coefficients of alloying elements against the difference in atomic radius between Fe and the alloying elements in ferrite The quantitative analysis of solute Nb in ferrite of the steel A5, which was never used for the coefficient of Nb on the lattice parameter of ferrite, was investigated by measuring the lattice parameter of ferrite of the steel from X-ray diffraction tests. The steel A5 was solution treated at 1170 The measured ferrite lattice parameter is plotted as a square mark together with those of the ultra-low carbon microalloyed steels in The coefficient of the solute Nb on ferrite lattice parameter is 0.000625 This research was performed as a part of the POSCO project titled “Development of Simulator for Predicting Phase Transformations and Mechanical Properties of Microalloyed and Low Alloy Steels”.
