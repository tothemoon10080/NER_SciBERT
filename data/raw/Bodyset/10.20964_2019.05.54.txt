In this study, β-PbO2-WC composite coatings were synthesized on a substrate using the electrodeposition method in an electrolyte containing Pb2+ and WC particles. The preparation process study shows that the β-PbO2 bath containing WC particles becomes more stable for an ultrasonic dispersion time within 30 minutes. WC particles in the β-PbO2 bath are positively charged, with anions being adsorbed onto the particles. Compared to the β-PbO2 composite electrode, the oxygen evolution overpotentials for the P-PbO2-WC electrode are decreased, which demonstrates an energy-saving effect. The nucleation behavior study shows that the co-deposition of WC particles into the layer has little effect on the crystal growth of P-PbO2. The main process during the deposition time of 0~5 min were the nucleation of the β-PbO2 grains, the adsorption of WC particles, growth of β-PbO2 grains, and WC particles coated.
