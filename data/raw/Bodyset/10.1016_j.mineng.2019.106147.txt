The devices most commonly used for classification in the mining industry are hydrocyclones. Hydrocyclones have been preferred over most other devices due to low operating cost and a small footprint and have not received as much attention as more expensive comminution units, and their technological progress has been incremental.
                  A classification study using semi-inverted hydrocyclones was conducted to determine if a hydrocyclone could be operated in a way that would produce similar results to a screen. The results from the study were encouraging with substantial reduction in water split to coarse product (

                     ) and much coarser cut sizes. A hydrocyclone with lower water split to underflow (

                     ) will improve classification of fines which would otherwise be sent back to the grinding circuit. The ability of hydrocyclones to cut coarser would potentially expand their application in the areas where the fine screens are currently in use. Therefore, the very low

                      and coarser cut are of paramount importance for a step change in future industrial operation. Other potential benefit compared with fine screens are reduction of the footprint required for the installation and in challenges in even slurry distribution.
                  The classification performance of a semi-inverted hydrocyclone will be presented in this paper.To achieve productivity improvements and more sustainable development, mining companies require innovations that lead to new, better and more efficient processes. An area of interest to the mining industry is the ability to improve classification. In wet grinding circuits, hydrocyclone became the dominant classifier in the 1950s, and despite its relatively poor process performance, it is still commonly used for classification, The performance of any solid-liquid classifier is represented by the actual ( It was reported by Napier-Munn (1996) that the corrected classification curve to underflow can be modelled with two parameters d50c and α using Whiten’s expression: Fine particles are prone to be entrained by water flow. Therefore, how effectively a classifier removes water from the coarse product is an important indicator of its classification performance. However, different d50 sizes for minerals with different specific gravities and the inefficiency of the hydrocyclone in removing fine particles from the coarse product have forced the industry to consider using more expensive (both in the capital and operational cost) alternatives such as fine screens. The importance of classification in a closed circuit grinding circuit has been reported by many researchers An additional drawback for hydrocyclone applications is that they cannot achieve a coarse cut size suited to a coarse grind unless a large, difficult to control hydrocyclone is used and/or a higher feed percent solids is used Increasing the cut size by increasing the feed density has a negative effect on the classification efficiency as less water is available in the feed to carry fine particles into the fine product. As hydrocyclones do have major operational advantages, it is important to investigate potential changes to operation and modifications to the hydrocyclone to overcome some of its limitations and to achieve classification performance similar to that of fine screens. In the 1980s, While many authors have covered the effects of inclination below horizontal (represented as 90° inclination angle in More recently, In this study, a 250 mm (10″) SIV hydrocyclone has been tested at SMI-JKMRC, the University of Queensland using a porphyry copper ore and the results are compared to the performance of fine screening reported in the literature. The material used in testing was a very low grade (0.17% Cu) porphyry copper ore with disseminated chalcopyrite/bornite/pyrite. The hydrocyclone was tested using the test rig ( The ore sample was crushed to −6 mm and divided into bags using the rotary splitter. A series of grinding tests were carried out to establish the grind time required for a target feed sizing of 80% passing 250 μm. A rod mill was used to grind the crushed ore. The ground product was spilt into similar samples and bagged. Bags were randomly grouped into: Group 1-material for preparing 50% feed solids slurry Group 2-material for preparing 40% feed solids slurry The measured size distribution of the prepared samples are presented in Two batches of experiments were carried out (using 40% and 50% feed solids). In each batch, the hydrocyclone was tested for three different setups (vertical operation and two semi-inverted positions, as in During the test, overflow and underflow samples (or fine and coarse) were collected through automatic Vezin samplers and a feed sample was collected through a valve next to the hydrocyclone feed inlet. Three samples representing each stream (feed, overflow, and underflow) were collected in buckets weighed and dried. Material below 38 μm was removed using wet sieving and the +38 μm material was dry sized using a square root of two sieve series. The masses of wet and dry screened −38 μm were added together to produce the reported size distributions. For the purposes of discussion, the “fines” are material less than 38 μm. The mass balancing and model fitting functions in the JKSimMet simulation software package were used to estimate the hydrocyclone model parameters: water split (  Summary of results In total, 22 experiments were conducted. Volumetric flow (pulp flow), solids flow and water flow for all the streams under different operating conditions for 40% and 50 w%w feed solids is presented in Reproducibility of results The experiments were repeated at four different hydrocyclone operating conditions. For each pair of repeats, the 2-sided 90% confidence limits for Stream densities Information about pulp density and percent solids (by volume and weight) for all stream in case of 40% feed solids is provided in By comparing the size distribution of the hydrocyclone underflow streams for 0° and 135° inclination (  The highest percent solids by weight of coarse product were achieved by the SIV cyclone at 120° inclination. The measured pulp density was about 8% higher than could be achieved in the underflow of the vertical cyclone. Water split to underflow The water splits to underflow achieved by SIV hydrocyclone operation for 40% feed solids are 50–65% less than those for the vertical hydrocyclone; from 19 to 20% for the vertical hydrocyclone down to 6–10% water split to the coarse product ( It should be noted that the water split to underflow for the vertical hydrocyclone, in this case, was lower than the values typical for closed circuit grinding operations (30–40%); this is because the hydrocyclone feed percent solids were lower than they would be in a grinding circuit. The values for water split to underflow for 50% feed solids are presented in Lower water split achieved by the SIV hydrocyclone can be explained by direction of fluid forces compared to gravity ( Cut sizes  At higher feed solids, conventional hydrocyclones cut coarser (88–94 μm) as expected – see It should be noted that the SIV 250 mm (10″) hydrocyclone cuts as coarse as a much larger vertical hydrocyclone would in typical operation. Sharpness of separation responses In case of low feed percent solids, the sharpness of classification (α) for the vertical hydrocyclone ( However, a major increase of the water split to the fine product has much more effect on actual efficiency than an improvement in alpha at a lower water split. The sharpness of classification (α) is lower compared to the 40% feed solids case, especially, for the SIV hydrocyclone ( Hydrocyclone vs screen classification performance The results for fine wet screening presented in The cut sizes presented in   Cut size Based on the experimental data, it can be concluded that the SIV hydrocyclone (250 mm in diameter) cuts approximately two times coarser than the vertical hydrocyclone as shown in  Water split The water split to the coarse product of the SIV hydrocyclone is reduced by 50–65% compared with that achievable with a vertical hydrocyclone. This means that water splits of 90–95% to the fine product become possible. The reduced water split to underflow causes higher percent solids and less fine material in the underflow (coarse product) stream. The reduction in fine material in the coarse product allows it to flow more readily than would be expected for the underflow of a vertical cyclone at a similar percent solids. These results are comparable to reported results for fine wet screening ( Closed circuit grinding  Other applications A much more efficient classifier which can cut at coarse sizes offers many process possibilities. For example, the very low water split to a coarse product indicates that an SIV hydrocyclone might be used in some dewatering applications or as part of a dry stacked tailing system. A second possibility is the production of narrow size fractions which are required for coarse particle flotation. This paper demonstrates that operating hydrocyclones in a semi-inverted orientation can provide similar classification performance to that achievable using fine screens. Other potential benefits compared with fine screens are reduction in the footprint required for the installation and in the challenges of achieving even slurry distribution to large numbers of fine screens. This capability offers many process opportunities especially in closed circuit grinding and for water management. However, such a substantial improvement in classification performance will typically require re-optimisation of a grinding circuit and its operating targets.
