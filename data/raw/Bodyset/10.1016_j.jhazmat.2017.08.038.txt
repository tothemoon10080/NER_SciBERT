Simultaneous multi-metal leaching from industrial pyrite ash is reported for the first time using a novel bioreactor system that allows natural diffusion of atmospheric O2 and CO2 along with the required temperature maintenance. The waste containing economically important metals (Cu, Co, Zn & As) was leached using an adapted consortium of meso-acidophilic Fe2+ and S oxidising bacteria. The unique property of the sample supported adequate growth and activity of the acidophiles, thereby, driving the (bio) chemical reactions. Oxido-reductive potentials were seen to improve with time and the system’s pH lowered as a result of active S oxidation. Increase in sulphur dosage (>1g/L) and agitation speed (>150rpm) did not bear any significant effect on metal dissolution. The consortium was able to leach 94.01% Cu (11.75% dissolution/d), 98.54% Co (12.3% dissolution/d), 75.95% Zn (9.49% dissolution/d) and 60.80% As (7.6% dissolution/d) at 150rpm, 1g/L sulphur, 30°C in 8days.Pulp density: 10% (w/v) pH: 1.8 Temperature: 30 Initial inoculum: 10% (v/v) Lixiviant: Working volume: 1L Impeller speed: 150 Reaction time: 8 Atmospheric diffusion of O Pulp density: 10% (w/v) pH: 1.8 Temperature: 30 Initial inoculum: 10% (v/v) Lixiviant: Working volume: 1L Sulphur dosage: 1 Reaction time: 8 Atmospheric diffusion of O Pulp density: 10% (w/v) pH: 1.8 Temperature: 30 Initial inoculum: 10% (v/v) Lixiviant: 9 Sulphur dosage: 0 Working volume: 1L Reaction time: 8 Atmospheric diffusion of O Pulp density: 10% (w/v) pH: 1.8 Temperature: 30 Initial inoculum: NIL  Working volume: 1L Reaction time: 8 Atmospheric diffusion of O Millions of tonnes of poor but metal bearing resources (either from primary or secondary sources) are available throughout the world which still await the introduction of an efficient technology. Over the years, with rapid increase in industrial activities, the requirement for raw materials has also increased significantly. One such example is the utilization of pyrite (FeS In case of this industry, the source of sulphur (as in step 1) is FeS The combustion of pyrite ore is accompanied by generation of a waste material commonly known as “pyrite ash”. Although this by-product is a waste material, it has got a number of advantages that finds application in different sectors. Several strategies have been adopted to utilize the ash material. For example, it is used: (a) as an iron ore in the iron-steel industry since it contains around 50–60% Fe Over the past few decades, the use of selected microorganisms such as those of the iron and sulphur oxidising bacteria have invited attention of many researchers. Their application to leach metal values in an eco-friendly and economic way from various industrial wastes is slowly gaining momentum It is important to note that industrial pyrite ash still await for the introduction of an efficient biotechnological application for recovery of valuable metals and very few or no studies are available in this regard. A preliminary attempt has been made towards optimization of several physico-chemical and biological parameters in shake flask for bioleaching of Cu, Co, Zn and As from pyrite ash obtained from Bandirma Etibank sulphuric acid production factory in Turkey The as received “pyrite ash” sample (size <10 In the present study, 1L capacity (working volume) double layered jacketed bioreactors of brand − Rettberg (Germany) were used for the bioleaching studies. A total of 4 reactors were connected in series with a single water heating and circulation system in order to simultaneously study the scale-up parameters under similar experimental conditions. The heated water was circulated through the jackets of the bioreactor in order to maintain the required temperature of 30 The microorganisms used in this study are aerobic autotrophs that require O Owing to the specific nature of the material used, the present study was thus aimed at providing a novel experimental approach for a scale-up application. It was therefore decided to notice the metal dissolution from the PAE sample under no external supply of O For determination of the metal content, 5 In our preliminary lab scale (shake flask) studies it was observed that active sulphur oxidation by the sulphur oxidising bacteria (SOB) within a consortium significantly contributed towards metal leaching from the pyrite ash along with biogenic Fe The generation of sulphuric acid by the SOB in the growth medium is a two steps process as shown in Eqs.  To shed more light on the metal dissolution aspects from the material, cumulative rate of metal dissolution (CRD) was calculated. It is important to note that CRD is considered as an important scale-up feature that determines the productivity of the leaching system and helps in designing of the downstream processing steps for an industrial application The dissolution patterns of Cu, Co, Zn and As clearly indicate that higher sulphur dose of 1 or 1.5 As discussed in the previous section (3.1.1), the leaching of respective metals was seen to be higher at an initial sulphur dose of 1 The leaching of Cu, Co, Zn and As along with their CRD values at varying initial sulphur dosages at 200 The CRD values for Cu, Co, Zn and As are shown in A parallel set of control agitated leaching experiments (+ve and −ve) were performed in order to directly compare the dissolution of the respective metals with that of the experimental test conditions ( In order to notice whether supply of external O Active iron and sulphur oxidation is associated with several process parameters that influence or drive the biochemical reactions for successful metal dissolution. These parameters provide more supportive information on the possible mechanism towards the metal dissolution obtained under varied experimental conditions. The variation in system pH, changes in redox potentials, ferrous and total iron concentrations in the leaching media at varying sulphur dose and control conditions is shown in  The changes in oxido-reductive potentials (ORP) of the leaching systems at 150 and 200 Fe The total iron content in both the systems at varying initial sulphur dosage is shown in Bioleaching for simultaneous dissolution of Cu, Co, Zn and As were performed using a novel bioreactor system without external supply of O
