Mineralogical analysis is often used to assess the liberation properties of particles. A direct method of estimating liberation is to actually break particles and then directly obtain liberation information from applying mineralogical analysis to each size-class of the product.
                  Another technique is to artificially apply random breakage to the feed particle sections to estimate the resultant distribution of product particle sections. This technique provides a useful alternative estimation method.
                  Because this technique is applied to particle sections, the actual liberation properties for particles can only be estimated by applying stereological correction. A recent stereological technique has been developed that allows the discrepancy between the linear intercept composition distribution and the particle section composition distribution to be used as guide for estimating the particle composition distribution.
                  The paper will show results validating this new technique using numerical simulation.Textural information about ores is increasingly being used to predict overall plant performance. There are numerous difficulties with such an approach of which the two main ones are characterisation and obtaining a statistically representative sample. Generally texture models are based on identifying the textural characteristics of the ore such as whether it is a Boolean texture ore a Poisson polyhedara texture ( The next step in the process is to predict how well the ore floats. This is achieved by crushing the ore, and applying flotation tests to the ground product. Such a test often ignores the fact that, due to preferential breakage, the composition distribution of particles for a particular size-class actually depends on the average size at which the particles are broken. Although these limitations exist, laboratory testwork on samples provides a useful method for assessing the optimal methods of beneficiation. Increasingly, the textural information is being used in conjunction with the laboratory testwork with the objective of being able to predict overall plant performance directly from the ore ( This paper explores the problem of estimating the estimation of the particle mineral composition distribution using ore texture. The work is largely an extension of The problem of estimating the mineral composition distribution can be divided into three problems. The first problem is to estimate resulting particle sections resulting from nonpreferential breakage; the second problem is to apply stereological correction; and the third problem is to consider the affects of preferential breakage. The format of this paper is as follows. Section For this paper particles are treated as binary. However multimineral modelling of particles is now becoming increasingly common ( A key assumption when considering modelling particle composition distribution of particles is the assumption of nonpreferential breakage. Here, the definition of nonpreferential breakage is that breakage occurs independent of mineral content. Or in other words, all minerals have the same ‘hardness’. This assumption is in many cases untrue (   Recent work by  The work in this paper is based on a numerical simulation, and for this simulation breakage is simulated nonpreferentially. However, some consideration of modelling preferential breakage is required for real cases involving ore. This issue is discussed in It is abundantly clear that in the absence of information about hardness it would be impossible to estimate the affects of preferential breakage. However, if we suppose that one mineral is harder than another, we would expect the first mineral to be more concentrated in the larger particles, and the second mineral to be more concentrated in the finer particles. A computer-simulated ore was created and a single planar section was taken through it. The ore in this case was a Boolean texture with spherical grains (see  The ore was broken into particles by superimposing particles on the ore.   The results from The work in this paper thus far shows that for a numerical simulation, the characteristics of liberation can be determined from the texture. It then follows that if a flotation model can be developed to estimate grade and recovery of concentrate from knowing the particle composition distribution, then the texture can be used to estimate flotation performance. Furthermore, this work is only immediately useful for a simple circuit consisting of a grinding circuit followed by a flotation circuit, but without any regrinding. The model presented in this paper is used to relate texture to mineral liberation, however A key concept in the probability-based model is that of particle types. A particle type is a particle with some defined geometric properties. In particular, particle types are considered as having numerous minerals, rather than just two minerals. In this way, the model is able to be applied to multimineral particles rather than just binary particles. Once the kernel is determined, the liberation model for comminution must be linked to a comminution model. The comminution model gives a transfer function, represented by Note that Given a progeny particle is initially from size-class Let This paper has shown, through numerical simulation, that the resulting mineral composition distribution of particles for specified size-classes can be estimated directly from the ore texture by also using a simple stereological correction. By linking this simple texture model with a liberation model for comminution one is able to estimate the feed liberation distribution of particles derived from a parent particle composition distribution. Ideas regarding inclusion of preferential breakage were discussed in The texture model can be linked to the probability-based liberation model, and then further linked to the comminution model. Accurate prediction of the product mineral composition distribution, given the feed mineral composition distribution and operational conditions of the mill, should then be achieved. Although substantial inroads have now been made in the area of liberation such as: texture modelling, kernel estimation, inclusion of preferential breakage and linking with comminution models, more research and much more validation is required. The stereological correction procedure tested here is the simplest that the author could conceive and still provide reasonably accurate results. The procedure is discussed in more detail by linear intercepts, particle sections, particles. Thus The basis idea is to consider the adjustment required for linear intercepts to particle sections. This adjustment is Now a very simple correction is to assume that this adjustment is the same as for particle sections to particles. Thus However, instead of using this adjustment without any calibration, a calibration factor is introduced so that Thus, by using Eq. This equation can only be used if The mean of the particle composition distribution is the same as for the particle section composition distribution, and is also the same as for the linear intercept composition distribution. Eq. From Eq. Thus if the particle composition variance is known (as well as the particle section composition variance and linear intercept variance) then This section explains how to estimate particle composition variance. The following notation is used:        For this paper there are three main equations of interest. All equations are explained in more detail by Notice that if particles are similarly sized (or particle composition distribution does not change with volume) then the left-hand terms of Eqs. The particle variance can be estimated from the particle sections (or the linear intercepts), and is given by Eq. In this paper, it is assumed that particles are similarly sized. There are methods to deal with the problem of different-sized particles, yet this consideration would substantially complicate the present paper and detract from its main focus. Hence Eq. The frequency values of a composition distribution cannot be negative. Thus, a condition is imposed to ensure that if a value is to be negative it is set at zero. However enforcing such a condition means that other constraints will be violated. The method for dealing with this problem is to use a maximum entropy-based technique. This method is best explained by considering Eq. The subscript With The solution is The inclusion of preferential breakage in mathematical models for liberation substantially increases the complexity. In particular, if breakage is nonpreferential, liberation modelling can largely be decoupled from comminution modelling. However with the inclusion of preferential breakage, this cannot be done. As yet, there does not appear to be any standard method for inclusion of preferential breakage in combined/liberation comminution models. However this is not to say that there has been no progress in the area of including preferential breakage. Indeed recent work ( In this appendix, an explanation is given of how to estimate the composition distribution of particles for a particular size-class given the texture and the average composition for the size-class. In order to consider this problem the following notation is used. All variables are treated as by volume unless specified otherwise.  Clearly It is then also a reasonable assumption that if Based on these assumptions it is then entirely reasonable to model For a texture model, Once the actual liberation distribution is known a liberation/communition model can be used to estimate the kernel (as discussed in the section: Integration of the texture model with current models of liberation and comminution).
