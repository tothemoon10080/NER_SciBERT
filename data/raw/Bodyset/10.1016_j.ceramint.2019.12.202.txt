Spark plasma sintering was employed for the fabrication of ZrB2–V–C composites at different consolidation temperatures (1800, 1900 and 2000 °C) using an external pressure of 40 MPa for 7 min under vacuum atmosphere. Vanadium powders and graphite nano-flakes were applied as metallic and carbonaceous sinter additives, respectively, in the ZrB2 matrix ultrahigh temperature ceramic composites. All composites approached their theoretical densities as the relative density values were >99%. The in-situ synthesis of VB2 and ZrC compounds, during the reactive sintering process at all temperatures, was verified by phase and microstructural analyses. It was found that vanadium and graphite were entirely consumed via reaction with the matrix by sintering at 1900 °C, while the majority of them were left intact at the temperature of 1800 °C. However, the compounds of VB2 and ZrC were partially reacted together, at 2000 °C, which led to the synthesis of extra complex phases of V1.54B50 and V3Zr3C. The hardness of composites slightly decreased with increasing the sintering temperature, while the fracture toughness was remarkably enhanced.Among ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs), refractory transition metal diborides The introduction of reinforcement phase, sintering aids and production method can improve the properties and sinterability of UHTCs [ A few research articles have been published on the manufacturing and characterization of ZrB Recent studies on the synergistic effects of WC and SiC on the sinterability, thermosphysical and thermomechanical performance of ZrB Formation of in-situ ZrC and VB Up to now, there is no detailed study focusing on the effect of processing conditions for the microstructure evolution, sinterability improvement, and chemical reactions leading to the new secondary phase formation during the sintering. Hence, in this present research, we investigated the effect of SPS temperature on the densification behavior, microstructural development, and mechanical properties, three composite samples were prepared using ZrB Commercially available ZrB Phase identification of the as-sintered ZrB  The XRD pattern of the composite sintered at 1900 °C is displayed in  The back-scattered SEM micrographs of ZrB The theoretical densities of ZrB  ZrB The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
