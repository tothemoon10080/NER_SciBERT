The rupture strengths of individual asphaltene clusters in heptane-diluted bitumen were directly measured using a novel microcantilever technique. The majority of the ruptures occurred in the form of micron-sized fragments detaching from the original cluster (i.e. via ‘surface erosion’). The average rupture strength of the clusters was found to be ∼0.4 μN. Within the resolution of the present technique, the strength of reflocculation (i.e. adhesive force between two already-separated flocs) was undetectable.High-grade synthetic crude oil is produced from bitumen deposited in Athabasca's oil sand ores (in northern Alberta, Canada) Deaerated bitumen froth was obtained from Syncrude Canada Ltd. After removal of most of the excess water by mechanical stirring, the froth was diluted with an aliphatic solvent at a 1:4 (froth:solvent) weight ratio. The aliphatic solvent was HPLC grade  A frequency histogram of the rupture strengths is shown in This work was support by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
