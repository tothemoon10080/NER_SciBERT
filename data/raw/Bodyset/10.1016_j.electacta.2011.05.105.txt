The removal of the anthraquinone dye Alizarin Red S (AR) has been investigated by electro-Fenton process using a commercial graphite-felt to electrogenerate in situ hydrogen peroxide and regenerate ferrous ions as catalyst. The effect of operating conditions such as applied current, catalyst concentration, and initial dye content on AR degradation has been studied. AR decay kinetic, the evolution of its oxidation intermediates and the mineralization of the aqueous solutions were monitored during the electrolysis by UV–Vis analysis and TOC measurements. The experimental results showed that AR was completely removed by the reaction with OH radicals generated from electrochemically assisted Fenton's reaction, and the decay kinetic always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction. Applying a current of 300mA and with catalyst concentration of 0.2mM Fe2+, 95% of the initial TOC was removed in 210min of electrolysis, meaning the almost complete mineralization of the organic content of the treated solution.The treatment of wastewater containing residual dyes is a great environmental problem because synthetic dyes usually contains aromatic rings that make them harmful and biologically recalcitrant compounds. Furthermore, even low concentration of dyes in the effluents is a source of turbidity and non-aesthetic pollution and their discharge is particularly troublesome. Traditional physico-chemical methods for the treatment of dyeing wastewater, including adsorption Among the AOPs, the Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs) are a promising alternative because they are environmentally clean and can produce large amount of hydroxyl radicals under control of applied current Alternatively, hydroxyl radicals production can take place in solution bulk through electrochemically assisted Fenton's reaction (reaction Reaction This process, called “Electro-Fenton” has been also applied for the treatment of many dyes Alizarin Red (AR) is an anthraquinone dye used in textile industry since early antiquity because it contains hydroxyls groups that make it soluble in water and with great affinity for wool and silk without the aid of auxiliary binding agents, and recently it is also widely used in biochemical assays. For these reasons AR has been chosen as target pollutants in many researchers on dye treatment In this study we report a detailed discussion on the degradation of AR by electro-Fenton process using commercial graphite-felt as cathode for the production in situ of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of some operating parameters such as applied current, catalyst and dye concentration on the oxidation of AR was also investigated. The dyestuff solutions were prepared by dissolving different amounts of AR (C A JascoV-570 UV/VIS spectrophotometer using silica cells of path length 1 Solution TOC was measured during electrolysis using a Dr. Lange LASA50 system. The mineralization current efficiency (MCE, in %) for each treated solution at a given electrolysis time The experiments were performed using an undivided cylindrical cell with a diameter of 7.4 The pH of solutions was adjusted to 3 by sulphuric acid (H The oxidation of organic pollutants in the electro-Fenton system is related to the amount of It can be also seen that for all the current values the concentration of AR decreased exponentially and it can be satisfactory described by a pseudo-first order reaction kinetic (inset of The effect of Fe Consequently 0.2 The effect of ferrous ions can be seen also in The effect of AR concentration on its decay kinetic during electro-Fenton process at 300 The complete disappearance of AR is not an indication that all the organic compounds presents in the solution oxidation have been degraded because of formation of oxidation reaction intermediates. Thus, the mineralization of AR was monitored measuring the TOC of the solution during the electrolysis of 200 The inset of In order to clarify the changes in the molecule of AR and to elucidate the mechanism of electro-Fenton degradation, samples obtained during the electrolysis of 200 From the results of the TOC and UV–Vis measurements, and in agreement with the mechanism proposed by Liu et al. Aqueous solutions of AR have been treated by electro-Fenton process using a graphite-felt cathode to electrogenerate H the decay kinetic of AR follows a pseudo-first-order reaction and the oxidation rate largely depends on applied current and Fe during the electrolysis AR is oxidised firstly to colourless intermediates and finally these intermediates are mineralised to carbon dioxide; comparative degradation with anodic oxidation at BDD anode gave a lower oxidation rate compared to electro-Fenton process due to mass-transport limitation to BDD surface; while the degradation rate and current efficiency by electro-Fenton using graphite-felt or GDE cathode were similar.
