The problem of the high-level processing of coal into synthetic motor fuels assumes worldwide actual meaning nowadays. Thereat, it is important especially for countries and regions which possess extensive coal resources and are forced to be guided by the import of liquid and gas hydrocarbons. However, a greater emphasis is paid to the given issue in Russia-The development of the federal program for high-level processing of coal into synthetic motor fuels was initiated. This article describes options of underground coal gasification (UCG) use for the generation of hydrocarbons from UCG gas in the process of the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). The technical and economic analysis of the integrated UCG–FTS power-chemical factories has detected their investment attractiveness and practicability of experimental–industrial testing at coal deposits of the Russian Federation.
