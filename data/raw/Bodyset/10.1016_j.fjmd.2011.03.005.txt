The medial tubercle fracture of the talar posterior process rarely occurs. Generally, the avulsion of the insertion of posterior talotibial ligament caused by the pronationâ€“dorsiflexion force is the reason for the injury. Both nonsurgical and surgical strategies have been already reported with acceptable outcomes. In this case report, a 24-year-old patient with acute fracture of the posterior medial tubercle of the talus underwent the treatment of close reduction and internal fixation. The clinical follow-up and radiographic evaluation indicated bone union with satisfactory function.
