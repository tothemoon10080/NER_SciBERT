This work presents a study on the chemical and electrochemical properties of Sm(III) solutions in two molten chloride mixtures with different acidity properties: (i) the eutectic LiCl–KCl, in the temperature range 673–823K and (ii) the equimolar CaCl2–NaCl melt at 823K. In both media and on a W inert electrode, the electro-reduction of Sm(III) takes place via one step Sm(III)/Sm(II). The second system Sm(II)/Sm(0) has not been observed within the electrochemical windows, because of the prior reduction of Li(I) and Na(I) from the solvent, which inhibits the electro-extraction of Sm species from the salts on the inert substrate.
                  On the W electrode, the electro-reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II) takes place in a quasi-reversible electrochemical mode. Accurate values of the reversible half wave potential, the intrinsic rate constant of charge transfer, k
                     0, and the charge transfer coefficient, α, have been calculated for the first time in both molten chlorides, by simulation of the cyclic voltammograms and logarithmic analysis of the convoluted curves. The diffusion coefficient of Sm(III) has been also calculated by different electrochemical techniques, avoiding the meniscus effect by modification of the immersion dept of the working electrode in stages. The values of the diffusion coefficient indicate that Sm(III) diffuses slower in the equimolar CaCl2–NaCl than in the eutectic LiCl–KCl. This behaviour can be explained by the different viscosities of both media, which significantly reduces the mobility of Sm(III) in the CaCl2–NaCl melt.
                  The identification of the SmO compounds that are stable in the melts as well as the determination of their solubility products were carried out by potentiometric titration using an yttria stabilised zirconia membrane electrode (YSZME). The results indicated that SmOCl is a solid stable compound in the studied melts and that Sm2O3 is a strong oxobase leading to the formation of SmOCl. The best chlorination conditions have been extracted from the comparison of the E-pO2− diagram of samarium and that of some gaseous chlorinating mixtures previously reported.Managing spent nuclear fuel in a safe, economic and proliferation resistant manner represents one of the most important issues connected to the sustainable development of nuclear energy. In this way, actinide (Ans) recycling by separation from the fission products (FPs) and subsequent transmutation, is considered worldwide as a promising strategy for an efficient use of the nuclear fuel as well as for nuclear waste minimization To date, the reprocessing of nuclear fuels has been carried out by hydrometallurgy (the PUREX Process). However, in the long term strategies on nuclear fuel cycle, this process could be inadequate for the reprocessing of future nuclear fuels, which will contain large amounts of transuranium elements and refractory matrix The strategies proposed to carry out pyrochemical separation between Ans and FPs are: (i) molten salt–liquid metal reductive extraction, and (ii) electrodeposition on a solid or liquid metal cathodes On the other hand, due to their extremely reactive character, Ans and Lns readily form oxides even in the presence of small amounts of oxide ions. Besides, the use of oxide fuels in the nuclear industry has introduced the need of pyrochemical reprocessing methods for this kind of fuel. Therefore, the solubility of Ans and Lns oxides in molten chloride salts must be well known and the chlorination capacity of different chlorinating reagents must be established. Our team is being engaged in a research program in which a two-step process is foreseen for Ans–Lns separation in molten chlorides, corresponding to (i) the selective extraction of Ans and (ii) the extraction of rare earths (REs) for decontamination of the salt. Our studies are devoted to the acquisition of fundamental data of REs to allow conceptual design and assessment of reprocessing processes involving as separation steps (i) electrolytic extraction using inert (e.g. W, Mo) and reactive (e.g. Cd, Bi or Al) cathodes and (ii) selective dissolution/precipitation of rare earth oxides As a part of the program to look into the Lns series in chloride melts, the present work is concerned with the chemical and electrochemical behaviour of samarium, one of the most abundant fission products in nuclear reactors The present work has been carried out in two molten chloride mixtures with different acidity properties: (i) the eutectic LiCl–KCl, in the temperature range 673–823 The chloride mixtures LiCl–KCl or CaCl The mixture was fused under vacuum, then raised to atmospheric pressure using dry argon; afterwards it was purified by bubbling HCl through the melt for at least 30 Solutions of Sm(III) were prepared by direct additions of anhydrous SmCl The reference electrode consisted of a silver wire (1 The pO All the electrochemical studies were performed with either (i) a PAR EG&G Model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by a computer using the EG&G M270 software package or (ii) an Autolab PGSTAT 320N potentiostat/galvanostat controlled by the research software NOVA.  The number of electrons involved in the electrochemical step One example of the cyclic voltammograms recorded in the eutectic LiCl–KCl is shown in As it is shown in As a result, the extraction of metallic samarium from the molten solution is not conceivable on an inert electrode. The diffusion coefficient, A detailed investigation of Sm(III)/Sm(II) redox system was performed. A series of voltammograms were recorded at a W electrode in the purified melts containing Sm(III) ions, for a variety of sweep rates ( Despite the quasi-reversibility of the electrochemical system, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(III) could be determined from the voltammograms obtained at low potential sweep rates (below 0.6 In the determination of the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species it is really difficult to define the exact electroactive area of the working electrode in the molten salt electrolyte, mainly due to the wetting between the electrode and the molten salt, i.e. meniscus effect. Nevertheless, it is possible to cancel this effect by comparing the obtained peak current values at various immersion depths of the working electrode when the concentration of Sm(III) in solution, the sweep rate and the temperature, are kept constant. Under these conditions, the peak current should only be function of the surface area of the working electrode, in agreement with Eq.   The obtained results are gathered in The diffusion coefficient of Sm(III) ions was also determined by chronopotentiometry by using the Sand's equation   The Arrhenius law has been verified in the eutectic LiCl–KCl: According to these results, the electro-reduction of Sm(III) involves a diffusion step of Sm(III) ions from the bulk solution to the electrode, an one-electron transfer step characterized by the intrinsic rate constant, The kinetic parameters Cyclic voltammograms were very reproducible, and it was found that the information of interest could be easily extracted from these voltammograms by comparison to simulated voltammograms calculated using a simulation computer program (M271 COOL kinetic analysis software 1.10), for a quasi-reversible mechanism in which the charge-transfer rate constant, The simulation method is based on a non-linear simplex optimization of the parameters in a normalized space derived from linear regression of the measured current on a calculated dimensionless current function As an alternative approach to the estimation of the kinetic parameters, an analysis of the convoluted curves was carried out according to a quasi-reversible reaction, by applying Eq.  The average values of The identification of the Sm The e.m.f. between the pO It has been proven Continuous stirring with dry Ar was used to help the dissolution of the solid oxide donor, and near the equivalent point, the titrant was added every 45 Titration curves were obtained by plotting pO This result was confirmed by XRD analysis of the solid recovered at the bottom of the crucible at the end of the experiments ( The theoretical equation corresponding to the titration curve can be elucidated from the mass balance equations: The Gauss–Newton non-linear least squares method was applied to equation The mean value of p The activity coefficient of SmCl In which the hypothetical supercooled liquid, SC Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the solubility product of Sm The obtained values are gathered on The above results indicate that samarium sesquioxide behaves as a stronger oxobase in the equimolar CaCl The stability constant The knowledge of the oxo-acidity properties of samarium in the molten salt mixtures allows their influence on the oxidation-reduction and electrochemical properties to be predicted. The main phenomena can be expressed in equilibrium diagrams potential,  From the comparison of these diagrams and those corresponding to some gaseous mixtures previously reported A gaseous mixture whose A gaseous mixture whose According to this, the chlorinating conditions of Sm Experimental solubilisation test of solid SmOCl generated “in situ” by bubling dry hydrogen chloride through the cell were carried out. The progress of the reaction was followed by the The electrochemical properties of samarium have been studied at the surface of a tungsten electrode in two molten chlorides with different acidity properties, the eutectic LiCl–KCl in the temperature range 673–823 In both media, the electroreduction of Sm(III) on the inert electrode takes place in a single electrochemical step with an exchange of one electron. The electroreduction of Sm(II) to Sm(0) was not observed due to the prior or simultaneous reduction of Li(I) or Na(I) from the solvent, which inhibits the electro-extraction of Sm species from the salts on the inert substrate. The diffusion coefficient of the Sm(III) ions was calculated using different electrochemical techniques (i.e. cyclic voltammetry, convolution and chronopotentiometry) avoiding the meniscus effect by modification of the immersion depth of the working electrode. The statistical treatment of the values showed that, with a 95% confidence level, all the electrochemical methods used for the evaluation of By combining different electrochemical techniques (i.e. voltammetry, convolution of the voltammograms and chronopotentiometry), it was possible to accurately determine the kinetic parameters characterizing the mass and the charge transfers occurring in the reduction process. The reversible half wave potential, On the other hand, using an YSZME, it was possible to record the pO By combination of experimental results and thermodynamic calculations it has been possible to estimate the activity coefficient of Sm(III) and the solubility product of Sm All the obtained results have being summarised in an Authors thank the
