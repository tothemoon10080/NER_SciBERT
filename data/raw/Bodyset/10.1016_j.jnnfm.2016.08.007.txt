The extrudate swell of an industrial grade high molecular weight high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in capillary dies is studied using the integral K-BKZ constitutive model. The non-linear viscoelastic flow properties of the polymer resin are studied for a broad range of large step shear strains and high shear rates using the cone partitioned plate (CPP) geometry of the stress/strain controlled rotational rheometer. This allowed the determination of the rheological parameters accurately, in particular the damping function, which is proven to be the most important in simulating transient flows such as extrudate swell. A series of simulations performed using the integral K-BKZ Wagner model with different values of the Wagner exponent n, ranging from n
                     =0.15–0.5, demonstrates that the extrudate swell predictions are extremely sensitive to the Wagner damping function exponent. Using the correct n-value resulted in extrudate swell predictions that are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.The analysis of viscoelastic phenomena such as extrudate swell in polymer melts is of great importance, especially in processing operations such as profile extrusion, blow molding, film blowing and fiber spinning Most of the early computational works study the extrudate swell of highly viscoelastic polymer melts, such as linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) melts, using integral constitutive equations On the other hand, several authors have successfully demonstrated the use of differential constitutive equations such as the PTT, Giesekus and XPP models for the simulation of extrudate swell in polymer melts or solutions A detailed analysis on the applicability and validity of various rheological (integral and differential) models in describing the extrudate swell of a highly viscoelastic HDPE melt in capillary dies at high shear rates (in the range of 5–160 s In this study, we first discuss the new rheological data obtained by using step strain and stress relaxation for a highly viscoelastic HDPE melt for a broad range of shear strains in the range from 0.1 to 7.5. Steady shear experiments at large shear rates up to 20 A high molecular weight industrial grade HDPE (with weight average molecular weight, Four types of rheological measurements were performed; namely, small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS), step-strain stress relaxation at large strains now possible due to the use of the cone-partitioned plate (CPP), transient steady shear at large shear rates, and uniaxial extension experiments using the SER. The time–temperature superposition (TTS) was used on the frequency sweep curves at different temperatures ranging from 160–220 °C to generate the master curves The new experimental testing to complete the rheological characterization was the step-strain stress relaxation experiments for shear strains ranging from 0.1 to 7.5 and the start-up of steady shear experiments for shear rates in the range of 0.05–20 A pressure-driven Instron capillary rheometer of constant piston speed has been used to study the extrudate swell and processing/slip behavior of the polymer melt used in this study. More details on the slip analysis and swell measurements of this resin can be found elsewhere The general set of governing equations for the flow simulation of incompressible fluids such as polymer melts under isothermal, creeping and steady flow conditions include continuity, momentum balance and constitutive equations as given below The integral K-BKZ constitutive model proposed by Papanastasiou et al. The strain-dependent damping or memory function, The following general set of boundary conditions for integral constitutive equations such as the integral K-BKZ model are used for the extrudate swell simulations, as reported in the literature The flow simulations using an integral K-BKZ constitutive equation use the primitive variable approach in terms of velocities and pressure, i.e., A typical FEM grid for a capillary die with length-to-diameter ratio of The criteria considered for mesh independency of the numerical predictions is that the differences between the overall pressures and swell ratios from both meshes shall be < While rheological characterization was previously performed on this polymer, with the availability of the partitioned plate this was extended into the nonlinear range. The measurement of linear viscoelastic properties using a small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) test was well-established. The master curves of the dynamic moduli As previously mentioned, determination of reliable data in the non-linear viscoelastic regime for a broad range of shear strains or strain rates is vital for accurate rheological modeling of the polymer melts particularly for shear free flows. These types of measurements for highly viscoelastic polymer melts is difficult due to complications and instabilities, such as wall slip and edge fracture observed at high shear strains or shear/strain rates    In pure shear flow, the first invariants of the Cauchy–Green tensor  In our earlier study To further study the effect of damping function on extrudate swell predictions, simulations were performed for different values of the Wagner exponent, Apart from the importance of the exponent Finally, we have also studied the effect of material constant ‘ Similar conclusions can be drawn from the predictions of the whole extrudate profile. Similarly,  In particular, the differences between the normal stress difference profiles along the wall and the symmetry axis (refer The damping function sensitivity analysis of two other highly viscoelastic HDPE melts has also been carried out (not shown here). These polymer melts have also displayed similar trends and extreme sensitivity to the Wagner exponent ‘ Apart from rheological properties or material functions, an ideal constitutive equation should be able to capture the memory effects accurately. A check to validate this is to see if the swell predictions using the new Wagner exponent ( As mentioned earlier, an important aspect of extrudate swell in polymer melts is that it continuously evolves as it exits the die in the downstream direction, i.e., the direction of extrusion. This was observed in several experimental studies and is related to the continuous stress relaxation with distance in the downstream direction from the exit The extrudate swell behavior in capillary dies of a well characterized high-molecular weight industrial grade HDPE melt was studied. The non-linear shear flow properties of the polymer melt were investigated by the use of a cone-and-partitioned plate (CPP) fixture of Anton Paar MCR702, which allowed us to characterize the polymer by procuring reliable rheological data for a broad range of shear strains and shear rates. It was found that the swell ratios computed using the 2D FEM based axisymmetric extrudate swell simulations including the reservoir match the experimental measurements well. In addition, the extreme sensitivity of the swell predictions to the Wagner exponent value, Financial assistance from NSERC (Automotive Partnership Canada), the federal funding agency of Canada, is acknowledged.
