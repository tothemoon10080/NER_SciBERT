A novel process is proposed in this paper for a green and efficient utilization of copper slag. The basic premise involved the addition of different amounts of Na2O into molten copper slag and evaluation of the effects on the magnetic fraction and the properties of ceramics generated from the non-magnetic residue, and mechanisms of the effects were further studied by XRD, SEM, EDS, viscosity test, hysteresis loop and FTIR. The results showed that Na2O additions dropped the viscosity of the slag markedly, which promoted the growth of magnetite, but decrease quantity of magnetite due to oxidization of Fe2+ and precipitation of crystals containing Fe3+. With the addition of 4 % Na2O, solidification temperature of slag decreased from 1790 K to 1530 K, optimum iron recovery rate of 81.08 % was achieved. Na2O as flux in ceramics obviously reduced its sintering temperature and meantime decreased its bending strength because of insufficient crystallization of its main minerals. The non-magnetic residue from magnetic separation of slag with addition of 4% Na2O was converted into ceramics with a much low sintering temperature of 1268 K (995 °C) and qualified bending strength of 64.5 MPa.Copper slag is the waste produced in the process of pyro-metallurgical copper smelting. 2.2−3 tonnes of copper slag are generated for the production of one tonne of copper ( In recent years, several studies have been carried out to recover iron from copper slag by hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes such as chemical leaching, bioleaching, magnetic roasting, selective agglomeration-reverse flotation, slag modification-physical separation and direct reduction-magnetic separation. Pyrometallurgical processes are commonly used in utilization of copper slag due to its less secondary pollution than hydrometallurgical methods ( Mixing additives directly into discharging hot slag is an energy saving method for avoiding energy consumption of heating cold slag ( As oxidization reaction is an exothermic process and has less requirement in system composition, oxidization method for extracting iron from copper slag is simpler and required less additives than reduction method, and thereby more promising in industrialization. Many researchers conducted experiments on oxidation of Fe With the high cost of natural minerals used as raw materials and the rising emphasis on sustainable construction, there is a need for the construction industry to obtain alternative materials for ceramic production. As copper slag mainly contains SiO In this paper, the objective was to optimize the factors governing crystallization of magnetite by adding Na The industrial copper slag used in the current study was obtained from Shandong Fangyuan Non-ferrous Metals Group (Shandong Province, China). The chemical composition of the slag was determined using an X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF, Shimadzu Corp, Japan) and the results are presented in S6-N and S7-N is respectively the non-magnetic residue of S6 and S7 after magnetic separation, and they were chosen to prepare ceramics. The chemical compositions of S6-N and S7-N were shown in All the samples were each mixed thoroughly, placed in an alumina crucible, heated in a muffle furnace heated at a rate of 5 K/min to 1773 K under an air atmosphere and subsequently cooled slowly to room temperature in the furnace. During the heating process, S1-S5 held in the liquid state at 1773 K for 60 min, and S6- S7 were held at 1773 K for 120 min. The samples were then granulated to a size smaller than 75 μm, mixed with water in the ratio of powder: water of 1:10 for treatment in a magnetic separator (xcgs-φ50, ShunZe Mining and Metallurgical Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd., China). Using a current of 2A and a magnetic field intensity of 0.22 T, the magnetic component was separated from the non-magnetic slurry. S6-N and S7-N were collected, dried and granulated to smaller than 75 μm with 5 wt.% moisture as the ceramic green samples. Ceramic green samples from S6-N and S7-N were pressed and molded under a pressure of 15 MPa. After shaping, the samples were dried at 383 K (110 °C) for 2 h and then heated to different sintered temperatures from 1268 K (995 °C) to 1493 K (1220 °C) at a rate of 5 K/min and held for 30 mins at this temperature. Finally, all samples were cooled to room temperature in the furnace. S1-S7 with different Na Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicoiet, USA) was used for structural investigations. As Si, Ca, Al and O were the main elements in copper slags after extracting Fe, the phase diagram for the CaO-SiO During the isothermal transformation, when the slag is in contact with air, oxygen dissolves in the melt leading to the breaking of the strongly bonded silicate anions by oxidation of Fe Effect of Na XRD analysis shown in For industrial slags, most of fayalite in raw copper slag had changed into magnetite in S6 and S7 after re-melting process in the air atmosphere. By comparing SEM spectra of S1 in The hysteresis loops of S1-S3 containing different amounts of Na The effect of temperature on the viscosity of slag samples S1-S3 is shown in From As occurrence of T  In order to understand slag structure with different Na The characteristic absorption peaks at 466, 584, and 650 cm Two batches of ceramics were prepared from the non-magnetic residue, S6-N and S7-N with different contents of Na The variation in linear shrinkage was consistent with the bending strength and inversely proportional to the water absorption for both samples. Based on the changes of linear shrinkage and the water absorption, it was deduced that densification complete at 1373 K (1100 °C) for S6-N and at 1268 K (995 °C) for S7-N. Accordingly, the sintering ranges for S6-N were from 1373 K (1100 °C) to 1433 K(1160 °C), and those for S7-N from 1268 K (995 °C) to 1358 K (1085 °C). S6-N sintered at 1373 K (1100 °C) had an optimum properties with the highest bending strength of 93.16 MPa and water absorption rate of 0.09 %, and S7-N sintered at 1268 K (995 °C) had the maximum bending strength of 64.5 MPa and the water absorption of 1.02 % The properties of the both ceramics met requirement of Chinese national standard of ceramics tiles(GB/T 4100−2015) ( Since S6-N sintered at 1268 K (995 °C) and S7-N sintered at 1373 K (1100 °C) respectively gained the highest flexural strength ceramics sintered at both of the two temperatures were selected to conduct XRD test for further comparative analysis and the results are shown in Iron recovery by magnetic separation from slag depends on two factors, quantity of magnetite and size (quality) of magnetite. Addition of Na Low viscosity accelerates diffusion of iron ions and promotes crystallization of magnetite. Viscosity of S1, S2 and S3 decreased with addition of Na Meanwhile, increasing Na Furthermore, viscosity of S3 during temperature above 1598 K possessed of lower viscosity than that of S1 at 1793 K, and diffusion ability of O Compared with iron recovery rate of S1, that of S2 with 2 wt.% Na Addition of Na Crystals in S6-N and in S7-N were different as well (in Precipitation of cristobalite/ weak diopside in S6-N and aegirine/ strong diopside in S7-N meaned that SiO Bending strength of ceramics mainly depend on its densification degree and crystal phases. Relative change of crystals with hematite as reference in ceramics can be compared from S6-N sintered at 1373 K had the highest bending strength of 93.16 MPa and low water absorption rate of 0.09 %, and while S7-N sintered at 1298 K had the nearly same densification degree with water absorption rate of 0.24 %, but its bending strength was 52.2 MPa, which is obviously lower than that of S6-N. Their crystals were contributed to the different bending strength. Higher temperature helped crystallization as shown in S6-N sintered at 1373 K, but in S7-N higher temperature resulted in reduce of crystals due to the flux role of Na Therefore, Na The new process was put forward, which was that instead of traditional addition of CaO, Na Addition of Na Na  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
