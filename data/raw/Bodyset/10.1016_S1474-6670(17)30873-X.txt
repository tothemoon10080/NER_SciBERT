Fault detection and diagnosis is a challenging problem in process engineering and there has been considerable interest shown in this field. In this paper, fault detection techniques such as model-based residual generation and process-history based feature extractions are discussed briefly. Some integrated approaches in fault detection are also introduced. Model based inference approaches and the knowledge based inference approaches in fault diagnosis such as rule-based and case-based reasoning are described. Since, model-based reasoning is the more promising approach and developing a reliable model is always crucial, the diagnosis techniques based on causal type qualitative representation; Sign Directed Graph (SDG) and Fault Tree, coinciding with easily available quantitative information, seem to be more attractive alternatives.
