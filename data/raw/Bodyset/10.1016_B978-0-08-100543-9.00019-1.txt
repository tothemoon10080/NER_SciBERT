In this chapter, the major methods of copper and copper alloy powder production, including atomization, solid-phase reduction of copper oxide, electrolysis, hydrometallurgical processing, and oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) are discussed. Atomization of copper, brass, bronze, irregular Cu-Pb-Sn powder, nickel-silver powder, and premix bronze powder is considered. Oxidation of copper powders, the reduction of copper oxide, the postreduction procedure, and the recycling of initial materials—the steps of the solid-phase reduction technique are discussed. Hydrometallurgical technologies including copper precipitation from sulfuric acid media, ammonia media and organic phases, reduction of copper oxide, the anhydride process, cementation, and electrowinning are considered. Several ODS methods such as simple mechanical mixing of the copper and oxide powders, coprecipitation from a salt solution, and mechanical alloying are described. Copper and copper alloy powders for structural and functional applications, including bearings, electrical parts, friction materials, structural materials, brushes, filters, additives to iron powders (alloying as well as infiltration), catalysts, pigments, and paints are considered. The morphology and structure of powder particles are illustrated by SEM and TEM micrographs.

Copper has high electrical and thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. It can easily be wrought both hot and cold. Copper is exceeded only by silver among the materials used for electrical applications. Copper-based powders are used to make self-lubricating bearings, the application of which in the PM industry dates back to the 1920s and still accounts for the major portion of PM copper and copper alloy applications. Other important uses for copper and copper-base PM materials include friction materials, electrical parts, filters, additives to iron, aluminum powder alloying, catalysts, paints, and pigments. The copper-based PM products achieved a record 54,100 mt globally in 2000, as shown in Copper powders above 99% purity are commercially available. The four cardinal techniques of producing copper powders are atomization, oxide reduction, electrolysis, and hydrometallurgy. Of the above methods, atomization and oxide reduction are presently applied on a large global scale. Hydrometallurgical copper powders have not been manufactured in the United States since the early 1980s, but they are produced in Europe and Japan. A large portion of electrolytic powder manufacture is in Russia, where the Uralelectromed Company, located in proximity to Yekaterinburg, annually produces about 6000 tons while its production facility for copper powder is estimated at a total of about 12,000 tons per annum. Electrolytic powder on a large scale is manufactured by the GGP Metalpowder AG company in Fürst, Germany. In this process, molten metal flows from a tundish through a refractory nozzle, and the liquid stream is disintegrated into droplets by the impact of water or gas jets. The droplets solidify into powder particles. Inert gas atomization produces spherical particles while the shape of water-atomized powders can be regulated from irregular to nearly spherical by controlling the interaction conditions between the water jet and the metal stream, including liquid flow rate, water pressure, and atomizer design. The particle shapes of gas and water-atomized copper powder are shown in Spherical copper powders have insufficient green strength for use in conventional PM. To give them compressibility, their particle shape and morphology may be transformed by means of mechanical processing and/or oxidation and reduction, as described below in this chapter under subtitle “Reduction of copper oxide.” Water is the preferred atomizing medium for producing copper and copper alloy powders. The copper powder of compacting-grade quality is produced from high-quality copper by water atomization. The obtained dried powder may be then subjected to an elevated temperature in a reducing atmosphere. Details of atomization, including fundamentals and atomizer design, are contained in Generally, the copper is superheated to 100–150 The conductivity of copper depends very strongly on the impurities. The effect of impurities in the solid solution on the electrical conductivity of oxygen-free copper is illustrated in The need for oxygen control at this stage of the process depends on the subsequent processing and end use of the powder. In the conventional refining of copper, poling and steam-generated hydrogen keep copper oxidation with the equilibrium curves shown in If the powder is used in the as-atomized state, a lower oxygen content is generally necessary because of the deleterious effects of oxygen in many applications. Oxygen is present partly as the surface oxide of copper particles and partly as the copper oxide within the particles. Removal of oxygen requires reduction temperatures of approximately 973 In the reduction process, hydrogen readily diffuses through solid copper to react with oxygen and form steam. The large steam molecules, unable to diffuse through solid copper, break their way through grain boundaries, where a phenomenon known as hydrogen embitterment of copper reveals itself in the formation of blisters and cracks. These defects improve both compatibility and sintering rate during liquid-phase sintering of copper mixed with tin. Some applications of copper powders require apparent densities lower than those reachable with water atomization. These powders can be produced by the addition of negligible quantities, up to 0.2%, of certain elements such as magnesium, titanium, calcium, and lithium, to the copper melt prior to atomization. These metal additions decrease the surface tension of copper and/or form oxide films on the particle surface during atomization. Magnesium additions are usually used to produce PM grade such as design parts, filters, and additives for iron powders. Such powders may have apparent densities as low as 2 The addition of small amounts of phosphorous (0.1–0.3 Spherical copper powders with controlled particle size are used in applications such as thermal spray coatings, metal impregnated plastics, and heat exchangers. Irregular copper powders are used in compacting applications such as bronze mixes for self-lubricating bearings, friction materials, electrical brushes, electrical parts requiring high strength and electrical/thermal conductivity, additions to iron mixes, and diamond cutting wheels. Irregular copper powders are also used in brazing compounds and various chemical applications such as catalysts and in the production of copper compounds. The typical properties of commercial grades of water- and gas-atomized copper powders are given in A flow diagram of the water atomization process for copper and copper alloy powder production is shown in The first stage in the atomization process is the preparation of charge material for melting. Copper cathodes are cut by shears into pieces suitable for charging into the furnace. Charge components are weighed, heated up to 423 The procedure is as follows. The copper is charged into the furnace and heated to 1290–1310 The copper powder pulp in a weight ratio of solid to water at approximately 1–10 is dewatered in vacuum filters. Powder with water up to 15 To avoid moisture condensation in the duct of the drying unit, the system is preheated for about 15 Powders from storage bins in the required ratio (depending on commercial powder size distribution) are blended in a double-cone or a toroidal vibrating mixer. To prevent oxidation, the powder is covered by a passivating addition based on polymeric compounds. The powder is charged into the container, ensuring uniform descent of powder layers in the container cross-section during powder unloading, which prevents its segregation. A container with commercial powder is installed into a unit of proportioning and packing, and powder is poured into the polyethylene bags with capacity up to 20 A study of the properties of water-atomized copper powder produced using a broad range of atomization pressures (0.2–40 Commercial copper alloy powders, including brasses, bronzes, and nickel silver, are manufactured in a similar way to copper. Usually, the same integrated manufacturing facilities are used to complete the melting process, atomization, dewatering, drying, particle size separation, and blending of a lot. High purity row materials are used. To ensure continuity and homogeneity, the molten batch is transferred to a second furnace with a greater holding capacity than the primary melting furnace. Induction heating is preferred for the final melting process to ensure the continuous induced liquid metal movement required for alloy homogeneity, including uniform heavy alloying element dispersion, such as lead in lead-bearing alloys. Atomization is achieved by maintaining a constant flow of molten stream from the secondary furnace and by controlling the pressure of the atomizing medium. The adjustment of powder properties, including particle size distribution, apparent density, and the green strength of the compacts of each alloy is achieved by controlled variation of the atomizing process conditions comprising atomizing medium flow rate, molten metal superheating, atomizer design, etc. Subsequent reduction of oxides is not required for standard PM copper alloy grades. Air-cooled, air-atomized powder is collected and passed over a primary screen to separate oversized particles. Usually, these are remelted during the processing of each alloy. In conclusion, the screened powder may be blended with dry organic lubricants, such as zinc stearate, for use in the manufacture of PM structural components. Powder properties are maintained constant by periodically recording the atomizing parameters and evaluating the properties of representative samples from the in-process atomized product. Brasses include the larger portion of copper-base alloy powders used for PM part fabrication. Typical copper-zinc brass powders have zinc content ranging from 10 to 30 For typical commercial brass, the compressibility at 414 Ordinary compositions are 90%Cu-10%Sn and 85%Cu-15%Sn, produced by the same technique as brass powder except that high purity copper and tin are used. As base powders for parts fabrication, the use of prealloyed atomized bronze compositions is hampered because of their modular particle form and high apparent density, both of which contribute to poor compacted green strength. The typical properties of the bronze alloy compositions are given in Fine bronze powder 80/20 (SF-BR8020) is produced by ultrahigh-pressure water atomization. Such powders, manufactured by Nippon Atomized Metal Powders, have an irregular shape with a mean diameter of 5, 10, and 15 Compressibility for typical bronze powder, such as 90/10 composition, is 7.4 Spherical 89/11 and 90/10 bronze powders are used to manufacture filters. These powders are usually made by horizontal air atomizing and dry collection and separation. The spherical shape is attained due to the addition of small amounts of phosphorus in the range from 0.2 to 0.45 The spherical powders with particle size usually ranging from 45 to 850 μm are screened to produce a number of grades, each with a narrow particle size range. Thus, the commercial spherical bronze powders produced by Makin Metal Powder include 16 grades varying in size from 45/63 Properties of filter materials produced by loose powder sintering of spherical powders are strongly dependent on the particle size. Characteristically, a sintered filter made from spherical powder with a particle size between 180 and 125 A study on the effect of a gas recirculation system on the powder quality was carried out by Uhlenwinkel et al. The powders generated with the ffa ( Several compositions as 70Cu—30Pb, 84Cu–8Pb–8Sn, and 80Cu–10Pb–10Sn are manufactured by water atomization. The apparent density is in range from 3.3 to 4.0 Varied commercial bronze powders for diamond tools are produced by ultrahigh-pressure water atomization. These powder grades include: CuSnAl, contains 27–29 Nickel-silver base alloy compositions (60–65)Cu–(17–19)Ni–(17–23)Zn are ordinarily used in the PM industry for sintered parts. These alloys can be modified by the addition of lead to improve machinability. The melting technique is similar to that used for brasses, except the melt temperature is 1366 Next to bronze bearings, nickel silvers along with brasses are the most widely used materials for structural PM parts. Typical applications include hardware for latch bolts and cylinders for locks and shutter components for cameras; gears, cams, and actuator bars in timing assemblies and in small generator drive assemblies; and decorative trims and medallions. In many of these applications, corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and artistic appearance play important roles. Currently, a number of companies manufacture premixed bronze powders in a “press ready” condition that is formulated to a customer’ requirements (  Oxide reduction was the first large-scale production of copper powders. In the United States, it still remains one of the main commercial processes for copper powder manufacturing. In this process, particulate copper oxide is transformed to copper at elevated temperatures in reducing gases. The sintered porous cake produced is then ground to powder. Originally, the initial charge for reduction was copper mill scale or cement copper. However, as copper powder of higher purity was required, particulate copper of high purity (chopped scrap or atomized powder) as the starting material was oxidized to cuprous, cupric oxide, or a mixture of both. Melting is usually carried out in either fuel-fired or induction furnaces. It is important to ensure a very low content of elements that form very stable oxides—such as aluminum and silicon which make the powders less compressible and very abrasive, while tin and lead additions cause difficulties in pouring the melt due to incrustation and clogging in the furnaces and nozzles. In the case of applications of copper powder for electrical and friction parts, it is important to remove the impurities with a harmful effect on electrical and thermal conductivity (see Large-scale atomization usually is run as a continuous process. Molten copper may be discharged through a tube in the side of the furnace wall and directly atomized, or through a tundish. Both air and water may be used as the atomizing medium, but horizontal air atomization into a rotating drum eliminates the need for dewatering and drying of the powder. Micrographs of air-atomized and water-atomized powders are shown in There are two copper oxides: the red cuprous oxide, Cu Oxidation or roasting of copper powder in commercial conditions is usually carried out in air at temperatures above 923 Both oxides of powders, cuprous oxide and cupric oxide, are brittle and easy to grind to particle size below 150 μm. Furthermore, they are porous. Reducing atmospheres include hydrogen, dissociated ammonia, or other exothermic or endothermic gas mixtures. The typical reduction temperature ranges from 698 to 923 The reaction of the copper oxide reduction with hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be written: Regulation of the reduction process allows control of the particle porosity, pore size, and particle size distribution of the final powder over a wide range. As with other metal oxides, low reduction temperatures usually lead to the production of particles having fine porosity and a correspondingly high specific surface. High reduction temperatures lead to the production of particles containing large pores and low specific surface. High reduction temperatures generally result in more complete reduction and interparticle sintering. The reduced copper oxide appears from the reduction belt furnace as a porous cake. It is usually disintegrated in two stages. Primarily, the cake is broken into smaller pieces in a jaw crusher or similar equipment, accompanied by fine grinding in hammer mills. Then, the reduced and milled powder is screened and, if necessary, blended and generally treated by proprietary antioxidants to stabilize it against oxidation. Without this treatment, copper powders, especially when exposed to moist air, usually tarnish with attendant detriment to green strength and other side effects. With increasing oxidation, the color of the powder changes from orange to purple to black. Oxygen content increases from a typical 0.1–0.2 Complete lots of powder are subjected to a series of tests designed to ensure performance in various applications. Various combinations of the controlling parameters during melting, atomization, oxidation, reduction, and grinding permit the manufacture of powders with characteristics tailored to the requirements of all major applications. Typical properties of a commercial copper powder produced by the solid phase reduction of copper oxide are shown in When using copper mill scale as the starting material for making oxide-reduced copper powder, additional treatment to remove impurities is required before reduction. A typical copper scale contains 75–87 The scale is normally annealed in air at temperatures above 900 A copper scale treatment technique is also known If the feed material includes impurities, they are preliminarily eliminated by hydrochemical processes. Thus, processing of a low-grade scrap by the ammonia method–ammonium-carbonate leaching and distillation of the solution (120–160 Depending on scrap composition, the precipitate can include nickel, cobalt, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium, that is, elements soluble in ammonia. The precipitate is washed, dried, and converted to copper by hydrogen reduction. Finished copper powder is 98.5–99.4 In the electrolytic process, copper is electrodeposed to obtain a spongy powder deposit at the cathode rather than a smooth, adherent one. In this feature it differs from the process of copper refining, where a strongly adherent product is desired. Low copper ion concentration and high acid content in the electrolyte favor the formation of powder deposits. High cathode current density and use of an electrolytically refined copper anode also facilitate the formation of powder electrodeposition. Along with these conditions, the control of additional variables is necessary to produce powders that satisfy commercial requirements. These variable parameters include the quantity and type of addition agent, temperature and circulation rate of the electrolyte, size and type of the anode and cathode, electrode spacing, and brush-down interval. A technological scheme for the electrolytic process is shown in Copper content in the electrolyte must be fairly low to prevent adherent deposits. In the desired range, current efficiency rises with increasing ion concentration, with a maximum to 92% in the range from 23 to 33 Certain addition agents to the sulfate/sulfuric acid electrolyte are used to alter powder characteristics. It was reported High current density accelerates the powder formation, but has a minor effect on current efficiency. An appreciable decrease in particle size takes place as current density is increased. Thus, in an electrolyte containing 25 Raising the operating temperature of the cell increases the current efficiency and reduces the cell voltage. However, cell operation is hindered at temperatures higher than 333 The method used to remove the powder deposit from the cathode and the brush-down intervals have a significant effect on powder properties. Commonly the powder is removed mechanically by means of brushing. The brush-down interval assists in control of the particle size of the deposit. As shown in article Details of operating conditions, including fundamentals of the electrolytic crystallization of dendrite deposits, are contained in As has been mentioned, the production of the electrolytic copper powder, as illustrated in Generally, the anodes are electrolytically refined copper and the cathodes are antimonial lead sheet. In a typical installation, the cathodes are 610 Copper is deposited on the cathodes in the form of dendritic particles removed periodically by brushing. Regularly, after operating the bath for several days, the power is turned off. Most of the electrolyte is drained from the bath, and the powder slurry is removed. The powder is dewatered in a filter, washed several times, and again dewatered. A treatment, for example, with an aqueous solution of gelatin protects the powder from oxidation during subsequent operations. Then, the damp powder is subjected to a furnace treatment. The furnace processing also alters certain properties, including particle size and shape, apparent density, and green strength of compacts made from the powder. Typically, an electric mesh belt furnace is used. To prevent the powder from spilling through the belt, a continuous sheet of high wet-strength paper is fed to the belt as undercoat for the powder. A roller compresses the powder to improve heat transfer. As it enters the furnace, water is vaporized and the paper burns, but not before the powder has been sintered enough to prevent it from spilling through the belt. The furnace atmosphere is produced in units in which natural gas and air are mixed to yield an atmosphere containing 17% H In another method Such a technique is used at the copper-smelting plant of the Uralelectromed Company. The electrolyte (copper sulfate and sulfuric acid) circulates in a closed-loop system, passing through the electrolyzers, pressure tanks, and heat exchanger. The dendritic copper powder deposited on the cathodes is removed once per 2–3 Grinding is another operation in which powder properties can be altered. When fine grinding is performed at high speed, hammer mills, feed rate, mill speed, and discharge screen openings under the mill can be varied to obtain the powder characteristics desired. The powder leaving the hammer mills is delivered to screens, where the oversize is separated and returned for additional grinding. The undersize of the 150 The finished powders are stored in the drams to which a drying agent such as silica gel or camphor is added to prevent further oxidation. In the case of high volume finished powder that meets customer specifications, powder is selected from various batches in appropriate proportions and mixed in a blender. The lot is sampled before being removed from the blender, and if required, corrections to the particle size distribution are made before the powder is packed in shipping drums.  The properties of electrolytic copper powder depend on various parameters of the operation and, therefore, can be adjusted by modification of certain process variables. Properties of typical commercial grades of electrolytic powders are shown in A feature of powder produced by the electrolytic process is high purity, with a copper content usually exceeding 99.5 Particle size distribution is selected to suit the application and can be varied over a wide range. Several combinations are shown in Generally, powders with a density of less than about 1.3 The green density is a function of the compacting pressure. Depending on particle distribution of the dendritic powder blends used, the green densities amount to 6.0–6.3 The particle shape of deposited electrolytic copper is generally dendritic, as shown in The compacting pressure is an important variable to take into account because the pressing and sintering conditions have an appreciable influence on the properties of sintered compacts. During sintering, the gases from the atmosphere, from the products of reduction, or from the lubricant must escape if conducting compacts are to be obtained. So, when the compacting pressure is too high, the flow through interconnected pores may be hindered, and gas cannot escape. Compacting pressures not higher than 275 The tensile strength and elongation of parts made from a typical powder blend in relationship to compacting pressure and sintering time are shown in Powder metallurgy techniques have long been successful in the production of parts containing highly conductive copper. Even small amounts of impurities in the copper drastically reduce its conductivity. As conductivities above 90% IACS are required, only high purity copper powder can be considered as starting material. In this connection, the electrolytic copper powder provides the best conditions for this. However, high conductivity can be achieved only in high-density compacts, as shown in The test data represent an example of such processing ( Compression should not be too high during the first compacting because this would hinder the escape of the lubricant from the specimen to be sintered. Even small lubricant residues spoil the electrical conductivity. Currently, electrolytic copper powder is produced in England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, India, and Brazil, where it is used in most copper powder applications. The production of electrolytic copper powder has recommenced in the United States where, in the early 1980s, it was stopped and replaced by oxide reduction or water atomization. Electrolytic copper powder is still the powder of choice in many electrical and electronic applications, where high electrical and thermal conductivity is required. Complex parts such as armature bearing blocks, contacts for circuit breakers, heavy-duty contacts for circuit breakers, high-duty vacuum contact materials for contact tubes and electrode caps for welding, shading coils for contactors, switch gear components for use in switch boxes with capacities up to 600 Electrolytic copper is still the preferred powder in the manufacture of electrical brushes due to the combination of purity, high electrical conductivity, high surface area, and particle dendritic shape, which allow a large volume of graphite to be accommodated in a copper matrix with high conductivity and high green strength. Electrolytic copper powder is used with various nonmetallic materials to produce friction parts, such as linings for clutches and brakes. Premixes of iron-copper or iron-copper-carbon are utilized in various automotive applications (gears, sprockets, piston rings) and similar components. The basic hydrometallurgical processing steps consist of leaching the raw material, accompanied by the precipitation of the metal from the solution. The most significant precipitation methods are cementation, reduction generally with hydrogen at normal or elevated atmospheric pressure, and electrolysis. The use of some leaching precipitation steps or the addition of solvent extraction, flotation, or ion exchange improves the purity of the final product. The leaching of copper sulfide and copper oxide ores entails partial dissolution to cupric sulfate with sulfuric acid and iron sulfate. The presence of pyrites in many ore deposits, and its reaction with water and oxygen to form iron sulfate and sulfuric acid, creates an important source of acid. In dump leaching, the pH of the solution is maintained between 1.5 and 3.0, partly to preserve bacteria that promote and accelerate the oxidation of purity and copper sulfate minerals and also to prevent hydrolysis of iron salts. The copper content of the solution varies from < Another leaching method is ammonia leaching, which is used for certain copper oxide ores. These methods are called leach-precipitation-flotation and are applied to mixed sulfide ores. There are also leaching techniques involving the precipitation of the metal from organic phases Copper powders can be precipitated from ammoniacal, sulfurous, and organic media by reduction with hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. The most effective reducer is hydrogen. Thermodynamic data for a number of reactions of copper precipitation under pressure are provided in The reduction of Cu (II) ions includes the stage of Cu (I) ion formation; their equilibrium concentration under the conditions (when temperature ranges from 313 to 473 The kinetics of copper precipitation from sulfate and ammoniacal media have special features, as shown in the generalized equations given in The kinetics of Cu (I) ion formation are described by the equation: It is correct in the ranges: Due to Cu (I) ion formation, the accompanying ion impurities have great importance, which can lead to: • The oxidation of Cu (I) ions (Fe • The formation of sparingly soluble compounds with Cu (I) ions, which thus pollute the powder (halides, thiocyanates, TeO Accumulated acid during precipitation equimolar to precipitated copper impairs the kinetics of the process and increases solution aggressivity. An expediency is to add ammonium sulfate or sulfates of the first-group metals (Na Copper precipitation from sulfurous solutions is characterized by high selectivity toward the accompanying impurities. Coprecipitation of ions As (III), Bi (III), and Sb (III) occurs after precipitation of 90%–95% Cu. The noble metals are precipitated quantitatively. The mechanism of Cu (II) reduction with hydrogen is heterolytic and includes the following stages: Solution of gas and saturation by the aqueous phase. Activation of hydrogen by Cu (II) and Cu (I) ions Cu Formation and accumulation of Cu (I) ions Cu(II) + CuH Disproportionation of excess Cu (I) ions in respect of the equilibrium concentration ones Process parameters accelerating copper precipitation lead to the production of powder with more fine, dense, roundish particles. At An increase in inert sulfate content causes the formation of dispersed roundish powder particles that increase its flow rate and apparent density. The particle shape depends on the sulfate type: roundish with (ammonia or Fe (II) sulfates), elongated with (zinc sulfate 0.08–0.16 Varying by the type and surfactant consumption, the copper powder properties are changed within the following limits: specific surface area ranges 0.02–0.18 An increase in the number of densifications from 1 to 6 results in an increase of powder apparent density and flow rate 1.6 times and powder size 1.67 times while powder surface decreases 2 times; conglomerates are formed, the sedimentation rate increases and dewatering becomes easier. The powder particle precipitation rate is 6–9.6 On reduction of product in the hydrogen current, the temperatures up to 520–670 At compacting pressure By varying the parameters of the powder precipitation and its subsequent processing, the powder properties can be altered within the following limits: apparent density of 0.5–2.5 Copper as copper (I) chloride was precipitated from the chloride solutions (25 Organic reducing agents (sugar, glucose, starch, fructose, and sawdust of varied arboreal kinds) precipitate copper powder with density max 15–20 For hydroxide pulp processing (400–450 Nanosized Cu powders from copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO Copper sulfate (CuSO  A process rate with a kinetics constant Optimal content of free ammonia should provide production of copper complexes [Cu (NH Ammonia media stimulate coreduction of nickel together with copper and powder contamination, especially where the ratio of Cu Zinc is present in the powder as a result of zinc ammine hydrolysis (insufficient amount of total ammonia, elevated temperature); its hydroxide or alkaline carbonates are eliminated from the powder by means of a weak acid solution at the washing stage. Basic solution includes 150–160 If the temperature is raised from 436 to 477 Surfactant additives of polyacrylic acid or ammonium polyacrilate base added in a quantity of 0.005–0.5 The process includes the following steps: Copper content usually exceeds 99.5% and powder particle size ranges from 5 to 40 The flowsheet of copper powder production by hydrometallurgical processing from scrap copper, grout copper and copper concentrate, matte, and solutions supplied from adjacent fabrications is shown in Processing of lean ores by heap or underground leaching yields weak solutions from which copper is extracted using organic agents to form a saturated metal–organic solution containing 2–10 Promising results are obtained by treatment of an organic solution (33% tertiary carbonic acid From the copper-saturated extractants (LIX-64, LIX-65 During processing of the ammoniacal solution by sulfur dioxide, the ammonium sulfate copper (I) salt is precipitated and decomposed hydrothermally (by treatment of aqueous solution at elevated temperature) or by acidation, the copper powder is made ( Copper scrap and metal-bearing precipitates are used rather than other copper-bearing materials. By leaching of copper scrap and metal precipitate (at 310–330 At 300–350 Copper powder is produced by acidation of the slurry, which contains Cu(NH Powder composition is as follows: 99.3–99.8 A process where the copper salt is dissolved in acetonitrile (AN) is described as: (330 The anhydride method uses simpler equipment, consumes less power, and production costs are lower in comparison with autoclave reduction under pressure. However, it is necessity to utilize the generated ammonium sulfate, the yield of copper directly extracted is less and their recirculating load increases. The precipitation of a metal from solution by the addition of another less noble metal is known as cementation. The fundamental equation for copper recovery from copper-bearing liquors using zinc is: Sulfate solution contains 50 The general precipitation reaction of copper recovery from cupric sulfate by the addition of iron is: Practically, scrap iron, such as detinned and shredded cans, is used. Subsequent separation, washing, reduction, and pulverizing results in the production of a copper powder that contains considerable amounts of iron and acid insolubles, such as alumina and silica. For this process, chemical analyses of cement copper from different sources Electrowinning is used to recover copper from leach solutions containing more than approximately 25 Copper may be precipitated from low content leach solutions by solvent extraction, followed by stripping with dilute sulfuric acid into an aqueous solution and electrowinning. Carboxylic acid and hydroxylamine-based compounds have been found to be selective solvents of low water solubility, to have good stability, and to be compatible with inexpensive diluents. Another technique is used for obtaining copper powder with electrochemical regeneration of the reducer. Copper is reduced in the solution by titanium ions (III) in the anode space of an electrolyzer ( Copper ions go to the anode space from the soluble anodes. Suspended powder in electrolyte permanently enters to filtering, then the filtered electrolyte is returned into the cathode space, where the reducer, namely titanium ions (III), is regenerated on the perforated lead cathode. Anode space is separated from the cathode by a diaphragm made of chlorine fiber previously tightened by boiling in distilled water for 20 Various characteristic methods for electrowinning copper and copper alloy powders from leach solutions can be found in Because of its high electrical and thermal conductivity, copper is widely used in industry; however, it has relatively low strength, especially at elevated temperatures. It can be strengthened by using stable oxides such as alumina, zirconia, titania, thoria, or yttria. For this, the PM technique is used. Because the above oxides are insoluble in molten copper, dispersion-strengthened copper cannot be made by conventional ingot metallurgy. Oxide dispersion-strengthened copper can be produced by several methods The internal oxidation method is based on the principle that a copper-aluminum solid solution is internally oxidized at elevated temperature. For effective internal oxidation, oxygen must diffuse into the matrix (copper) several orders of value rather than the solute element (aluminum). Powder metallurgy possesses the advantage that powder particles can be internally rapidly oxidized and then consolidated into the required shape. The internal oxidation process involves the low aluminum addition in copper and atomizing the melt by means of a high-pressure inert gas such as nitrogen. The powder obtained is mixed with an oxidant that consists of fine copper oxide powder. Then, the mixture is heated to a high temperature at which the oxide dissociates and the oxygen produced diffuses into the particles of the copper-aluminum solid solution. Because aluminum forms oxide more readily than copper, the aluminum in the alloy is oxidized to aluminum oxide. After entire oxidation of the aluminum, surplus oxygen in the powder is reduced by heating the powder in hydrogen or in a dissociated ammonia atmosphere. Three grades of ODS copper are commercially available, which are designated as C15715, C15725, and C15760 by the Copper Development Association The powder is consolidated into fully dense shapes by various techniques. Semiproducts, such as rod and bar, are made by sealing the powder in a suitable metal container, usually copper, and hot extruding it to the given size. Strip is manufactured either by rolling rods of extruded rectangular bars or by directly rolling powder with or without a container. Wire is produced by cold drawing of a rod. The HIP of powder sealed in a container is used when large pieces cannot be made by hot extrusion. Such shapes can also be made by forging sealed powder or green compacts. Finished parts are made from semiproducts by machining, brazing, and soldering. Fusion welding is not applicable because it causes the aluminum oxide to precipitate from the liquid copper matrix, accompanied with the loss of dispersion strengthening. Flash welding, in which the liquid metal is squeezed out of the weld joint, and electron beam welding, in which a small heat-affected zone is created, have been used with success. The properties of ODS copper strongly depend on aluminum oxide content. They can be altered to meet a wide range of design requirements by varying the aluminum oxide content and/or cold work. Typical for rod stock in the hot extruded condition, increasing the aluminum oxide content from 0.45 to 2.7 Physical properties of ODS copper closely resemble those of pure copper because the former contains small amounts of aluminum oxide as discrete particles in an essentially pure copper matrix. The free or reducible oxygen content of the above three ODS coppers ( Electrical and thermal conductivities at room temperature range from 78% to 92% of those for pure copper. In combination with the high strengths of these materials, they enhance the electrical and heat conduction capabilities for a given section's size and structural strength. Therefore, they enable reduction of section size for component miniaturization without damage to structural strength or electrical and heat conduction capabilities. At elevated temperature, the decrease in electrical and thermal conductivities of ODS coppers does not differ from those of pure copper. ODS copper has high resistance to softening, even after exposure to temperatures close to the melting point of copper because the aluminum oxide particles are stable at these temperatures and retain their original size and spacing. At typical brazing and glass-to-metal sealing temperatures (above 830 Oxide dispersion-strengthened copper has received wide market acceptance in series applications         Basic applications for copper and copper-base PM materials are summarized in An assortment of bearings and parts of sintered bronze are shown in Various configurations of carbon brushes suitable to conduct electrical current in sliding contacts are pictured in Friction materials are required as linings for clutches and brakes. Typical arrangements are shown in Formation and functional effectiveness of the supporting of the metallic matrix depend substantially on the metal powder used. Dendritic copper powders ensure high green strength, intensive bonding between particles, and high sintering activity, especially with the addition of elementary tin and liquid phase sintering. Filters made of sintered bronze, exhibited in Generally, manufacture is by the loose powder sintering process, and sintering is done in graphite or steel dies, mostly under hydrogen or cracked ammonia. Sintering temperatures are about 1058 Recent advances in mobile electronics lead the trend toward smaller electronic systems, and effective heat dissipation becomes one of the critical issues. Therefore, the micro copper pipes show promise due to their high heat-removing properties. The micro heat pipe has been commonly manufactured by conventional machining processes or lithography processes Powder characteristics that enable metal injection molding of high conductivity copper heat sinks are investigated by Johnson et al. Thin-walled structures, which have 0.19 Several binders were utilized. The mixing process was carried out with a twin extrude type mixer, with 30 Inspirable copper dust takes a predominantly fibrous effect. The long-term expose limit (8 The ALV of copper aerosol in the workplace atmosphere as the shift time-weighted average concentration is 0.5 Copper in drinking water imparts a foul taste and is related to the third class of danger; the TLV is 1.0 Copper powder <
