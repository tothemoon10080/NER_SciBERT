Methods are proposed for improving effectiveness of control of ionic composition of flotation pulp liquid phase, sewage and circulating waters at concentrators. Applying new ways in systems for sample delivery, subsystems for checking and calibration of ionic composition analyzers, correction of measuring results allows to increase 5-10% measurement preciseness and 2-3 times service period between repairs. This allows to improve efficiency of systems for automatic control of flotation agent regimes and systems for control of processes of cleaning sewage and circulating waters.
