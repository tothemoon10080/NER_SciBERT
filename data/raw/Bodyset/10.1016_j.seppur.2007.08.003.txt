A mathematical model of the electrocoagulation process has been developed and tested with experimental data obtained during the treatment of kaolin suspensions. The model determines the concentration of the different aluminium species as a function of the total aluminium concentration and of the pH, and then it classifies these actual species into several model species as a function of their reactivity with the pollutant contained in the wastewater. The reactive processes involving coagulant and pollutant species are assumed to develop rapidly and they are modelled by pseudoequilibria approaches. In the case of the electrocoagulation of kaolin suspensions, two processes are assumed to be the primary ones: the charge neutralization of kaolin particles (by adsorption of cations or by the precipitation of charged aluminium hydroxides onto the kaolin particles) and the enmeshment of particles into a growing precipitate. The good reproducibility of the experimental observations (r

Once the models are validated with experimental data, they can be used to design processes and to analyze the possible operating situations. For this reason, in recent years several models have been developed to reproduce the behaviour of the electrocoagulation process for the treatment of different types of wastewaters, although a model that can reliably represent every process involved in this type of treatment is still a long way off. The present state of knowledge concerns different models that involve different descriptive approaches for some of the physical processes taking place in the cell. In this context, Matteson et al. A different approach to this problem was proposed by Szpyrkowicz Another approach to the modelling problem was proposed by the group of Lapicque In addition to these approaches, there are other models that reproduce some specific phenomena taking place during the electrocoagulation treatment. In this context, Chen et al. On the other hand, Emamjomeh and Sivakumar The aim of our work was to develop a general model for the electrocoagulation process with aluminium electrodes and to test this model with different types of wastewaters. The scope of the model is not focussed on the reproduction of all the aspects observed experimentally, but only on the most significant factors (the effect of the coagulant dosing and the pH). A simplified description was used for specific factors (effects like the type of electrolyte) that otherwise would lead to an unnecessary increase in the complexity of the model. With this general aim in mind, the first part of the work covers general assumptions made in the model and the modelling of the electrochemical treatment of wastes polluted with kaolin, as a representative example of a colloidal suspension. The general model is based on the following assumptions: In the electrochemical cell the addition of coagulant to the wastewater takes place through the electrochemical and chemical dissolution (corrosion) of the aluminium electrodes The fluid-dynamic model for the electrochemical cell is a macroscopic approach, which considers that the parameters depend only on time and The coagulation process only takes place in the bulk zone of the electrochemical cell and not in proximity to the electrodes, despite the fact that in these zones the pH conditions are different The concentration of the different aluminium species generated in the reaction medium depends on the pH and the total aluminium concentration. These values can be calculated by pseudoequilibria approaches, as reported in a previous publication by our group Al Al Al Al All of these model species are expressed in mg Polymeric aluminium species are not considered in the pseudoequilibria approaches, as the equilibrium constants for their formation are not well defined in the literature and in fact, contradictory data can be found. Thus the effect of the coagulation (by charge neutralization) of pollutants by polymeric aluminium will also be represented by Al In a similar way to the coagulant species, the pollutant species need to be classified into different categories (pollutant species of the model). The classification depends on the type of pollutant and on the reactivity of these model species with the different coagulant species. Therefore, the classification has to be made according to the description of the coagulation mechanisms considered in the model for each type of wastewater. The reactive processes involving coagulant and pollutant species are assumed to develop rapidly and they are modelled by pseudoequilibria approaches. These general assumptions must be combined with other specific assumptions for each type of pollutant. In this section the mathematical model is used to reproduce the electrocoagulation process for the treatment of wastewaters polluted with kaolin, as an example of colloidal waste. The specific assumptions considered in this case are: According to the literature In addition to the coagulation mechanisms involving the dosing of aluminium, and according to the experimental observations, one must also consider the charge neutralization of kaolin particles by the adsorption of protons onto the surface of the kaolin particles. The kaolin contained in the suspension is expressed in the model in terms of turbidity and the model speciation of kaolin considers the following contributions:        All of these model species are expressed in NTU. According to the speciation described, the total turbidity can be written as Eq. The values of The kaolin coagulation mechanisms by neutralization can be expressed as equilibrium reactions The equilibrium constant In addition to the charge neutralization by aluminium species, the charge neutralization of the kaolin particles by adsorption of protons has been observed experimentally. The removal of turbidity by the adsorption of protons can be expressed by Eq. Finally, the enmeshment of kaolin particles into a growing precipitate can be represented by Eq. This parameter, Al Rearrangement of the mass balance of the aluminium The values for The electrocoagulation experiments were carried out in a bench-scale plant described elsewhere Experiments were carried out under galvanostatic conditions. Prior to each experiment the electrodes were treated (by rinsing) with a solution of 1.30 In the continuous operation mode, the kaolin suspension was pumped from the feed tank into the cell and then it was collected in a different tank. Samples were taken at the outlet of the cell and left for 20 The accurate measurement of the total aluminium dissolved in the cell in each experiment is difficult due to the aluminium content of the kaolin particles and also to the adsorption capabilities of this colloid towards aluminium species. Consequently, many sources of errors could be present in the analyses. In order to obtain precise data, each experiment (continuous or batch) was repeated while maintaining the same operation conditions but replacing the kaolin suspension by an aqueous solution with the same concentration of electrolyte. These experiments were used to quantify the aluminium supplied by the electrochemical system. Results obtained in preliminary experiments (with the total dissolution of kaolin with hydrogen fluoride and determination of the total aluminium) demonstrate that the concentration of aluminium is not affected by kaolin and that a simple and more accurate measurement is obtained with the procedure proposed. After the experiments, the concentration of aluminium was measured off-line using an Inductively Coupled Plasma LIBERTY SEQUENTIAL VARIAN spectrometer according to a standard method The proposed model was run in order to simulate the electrocoagulation process (in continuous and discontinuous operation mode) in kaolin suspensions. An optimization procedure was used to calculate the best values for all of the adjustable parameters. The model parameter Parameter The best values of the fitting parameters were used to model different experimental studies. The experimental and modelled influence of pH on the changes in turbidity monitored during experiments without the addition of aluminium are shown in It can be observed that in all cases the model fits the experimental data well and this validates the assumptions on which the model is based. Finally, a comparison of the modelled and experimental turbidity for the different experiments is made in From this work the following conclusions can be drawn: The electrocoagulation process for the treatment of wastewaters can be easily modelled using a model that considers a macroscopic approach for the fluid-dynamic behaviour (idealizing the cell as a perfectly mixed flow reactor), five aluminium species (which can be estimated from the total aluminium concentration and pH), a variable number of pollutant species (related to the primary coagulation mechanisms for each pollutant) and a proposal for the main reaction mechanisms. This model considers that the interactions between pollutant and coagulant species are very fast and that they can be expressed by means of pseudoequilibria equations. The model proposed for the electrocoagulation of kaolin suspensions considers that the main coagulation mechanisms for these types of wastewaters are as follows: (i) the charge neutralization of the kaolin by adsorption of aluminium cations and protons, (ii) charge neutralization by precipitation (for low aluminium concentrations) and (iii) the enmeshment of kaolin particles in a growing precipitate (for high aluminium concentrations and pH values close to neutral). The model developed enables the experimental results to be reproduced with a regression coefficient of 0.92 ( This work was supported by the MCT (Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, Spain) and by the EU (European Union) through project CTM2004-03817/TECNO and through Project CONSOLIDER-INGENIO 2010 (CSD2006-0044).
