The novel dissolved air flotation (DAF) process that uses hydrophobically-modified polymers (HMPs) to generate positively charged bubbles (PosiDAF) has been shown to separate negatively charged algal cells without the need for coagulation-flocculation. Previous research has been limited to HMPs of poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and, while they were effective at bench-scale, performance at pilot-scale was better using commercial poly(N,N-diallyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC). Hence, the aim of this research was to compare the effectiveness of PDADMAC modified with aliphatic and aromatic moieties in comparison to previously tested PDMAEMA HMPs in respect to algal cell separation and minimisation of effluent polymer concentration, as well as defining the underlying polymer-bubble interaction mechanisms. Polymer-bubble adhesion properties were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) while polymer concentration was monitored via zeta potential and, where possible, assays using fluorescence spectroscopy. Both PDADMAC functionalised with a fluorinated aromatic group (PDADMAC-BCF) and PDMAEMA modified with 1-bromodecane respectively, gave effective cell separation, while the treated effluent zeta potential values at maximum cell removal were lower than the other polymers trialled. The effluent polymer concentration when using PDADMAC-BCF was four times lower in comparison to another aromatically modified PDADMAC polymer. AFM studies indicated that, in contrast to the PDMAEMA-based polymers, the PDADMAC-based polymers did not adsorb closely to the bubble surface. The different polymer-bubble interactions indicate that separation mechanisms will also vary, potentially leading to differences in process effectiveness when explored at pilot scale.Expansion atomic force microscopy Australian National Algae Culture Collection algal organic matter Culture Collection for Algae and Protozoa Chan-Dagastine-White model Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation  dissolved air flotation 2-( fluorescence excitation emission matrix hydrophile-lipophile balance hydrophobically modified polymer   molecular weight nuclear magnetic resonance particle charge detector poly( PDADMAC quaternised with benzyl chloride PDADMAC quaternised with 4-fluoro benzyl chloride PDADMAC quaternised with 1-chlorobutane PDADMAC quaternised with 1-chloropentane PDADMAC quaternised with 1-chlorodecane poly( PDMAEMA quaternised with 1-brompdecane Polymers are frequently used to aid floc formation in water treatment, prior to separation by either sedimentation or dissolved air flotation (DAF), in which flocs attach to anionic microbubbles and are floated from solution It was identified that increasing the surface activity of cationic water treatment polymers to encourage adhesion of the polymer to the bubble surface and minimise carryover to downstream processes had potential Recently, the functionalisation of PDADMAC with pendant hydrophobic groups to generate polymers with differing charge and structural characteristics was demonstrated The underlying mechanisms driving separation using PosiDAF remain unidentified. Separation effectiveness when using polymers as opposed to surfactants is much higher than can be modelled using the white water model Hence, in the current study, a comparison of hydrophobically-modified PDMAEMA and PDADMAC based polymers, using both aromatic and aliphatic groups, was undertaken for PosiDAF, to separate one strain of Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any further purification. Low M  The synthesis of hydrophobically functionalised PDADMAC was carried out in a two-step de-methylation and quaternisation of the polymer. The de-methylation of PDADMAC was carried out in the same manner as de-methylation of chiral [3,22]-ionenes by generating the corresponding tertiary polyamine The quaternisation of the selectively de-methylated PDADMAC was carried out in the presence of n-alkyl halides The following PDADMAC based polymers quaternised with aliphatic and aromatic groups with varying charges were synthesised: (1) PDADMAC quaternised with 1-chlorobutane (PD-C4); (2) 1-chloropentane (PD-C5); (3) 1-chlorodecane (PD-C10); (4) benzyl chloride (PDADMAC-BC); and (5) 4-fluoro benzylchloride (PDADMAC-BCF). PDADMAC was used as the standard to verify the performance of the synthesised polymers with prior studies Following the same procedure as in the previous study To prepare the synthetic DAF influent water, cultured cells were diluted to 6 × 10 A DAF Batch Tester, Model DBT6 (EC Engineering, Alberta, Canada), was used for the PosiDAF jar testing. The saturator influent and recycle flow consisted of DI water buffered with 0.5 mM NaHCO The polymer stock solutions were prepared and stirred at 200 rpm for 1 h before use. Aliquots of buffered solution were dosed with various polymer concentrations and added to the saturator prior to pressurisation. The performance of the polymers functionalised with hydrophobic moieties was compared against unmodified commercially available PDADMAC. The cells were characterised by size using a Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern, Australia) and zeta potential using a Zetasizer Nano NZ (Malvern, Australia). These cell samples were analysed at the onset of the stationary phase during their growth cycles (10–13 days) and immediately prior to undertaking the jar tests. The polymers were characterised using Direct force measurements were carried out between two bubbles in solutions of PDADMAC-BCF, PDADMAC, PDMAEMA-C10 and PDMAEMA. From these measurements and the use of the Chan-Dagastine-White (CDW) Analysis of the treated water after the jar tests included measurement of algae cell concentration achieved by cell counting using a haemocytometer and Leica DM500 light microscope (Leica Microsystems Ltd, Switzerland) and measurement of the zeta potential of treated water using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, Australia). For select samples such as those that were treated with PDADMAC-BC and PDADMAC-BCF, the residual polymer detection was carried out through fluorescence spectroscopy using a Horiba Spectrophotometer. The full procedure for residual polymer detection is outlined in the Appendix. All the cells had similar spherical, unicellular morphology when grown in the laboratory and were comparable with previous studies All polymers were cationic at pH 7 with the charge and zeta potentials varying from 1.21 to 6.55 meq/g and +30 mV to +65 mV, respectively ( The modified polymers had higher surface tensions in comparison to their respective native scaffolds when measured using the Du-Nuoy ring method ( With the exception of PDMAEMA-C10, the surface tensions of all polymers at the microbubble air-liquid interface were almost equivalent to that of Milli-Q water until the concentrations were increased to at least 0.5 mg/L ( While no coalescence was seen for bubbles coated with the PDMAEMA polymers, it was interesting to observe PDADMAC and PDADMAC-BCF coated bubbles coalescing at polymer concentrations of 2 mg/L ( Overall, the surface tension measurements from the AFM studies were found to contrast with those carried out by the Du-Nuoy ring method. For example, PDMAEMA-C10 had the highest surface tension as measured using a Du-Nuoy ring surface tensiometer and thus may have been expected to have the least attachment; however, in contrast, it was shown to readily adsorb on the bubble at a concentration of 0.3 mg/L. Furthermore, PDMAEMA which had the lowest surface tension (44 mN/m as detected by Du-Nuoy ring) was found to have poor polymer adsorption at 0.3 mg/L. These results show that conventional surface tension measurements of polymer solutions by Du-Nuoy ring method do not elucidate polymer-bubble interactions when compared to measurements of surface activity of the polymers at the microbubble through advanced physical measurements such as AFM. From Results from jar tests demonstrated that maximum cell removals of Micro-floc networks started to appear simultaneously as the cell removal of The initial zeta potential of the system with no added polymer was found to be −27.8 ± 4.5 mV for When the treated effluent was tested for the presence of polymers ( It was previously hypothesised that the incorporation of hydrophobic groups on the polymer backbone might lead to enhanced attachment of cationic HMPs to microbubble surfaces relative to those without any modification, and thus reduced polymer in the effluent. In this study, highly stable anionic zeta potentials of treated water were observed, indicating a low effluent polymer concentration, but only with two HMPs, namely PDMAEMA-C10 and PDADMAC-BCF ( Apart from the polymer configurations, the concentrations of the polymers dosed were also seen to have a profound impact on polymer adsorption on the bubble. For example, the rapid decrease in cell removal from 70% to 35% for The specific conclusions drawn from this work are as follows: Hydrophobic modification of PDADMAC with various pendant groups for bubble surface modification in PosiDAF was successful and the results indicate that all the polymers trialled achieved increased or comparable cell removal when compared to prior studies that utilised commercially available PDADMAC and hydrophobically modified PDMAEMA. Stable negative zeta potentials between −22 mV and −6 mV were observed in PosiDAF treated effluent across the entire dose range and for all species when PDADMAC-BCF and PDMAEMA-C10 were used as the bubble modification chemicals. Furthermore, the zeta potential of these two polymer treated effluents at maximum cell removal was found to be lower than the other polymers trialled. This indicates that very low amounts of the polymer remained in the treated water, thereby confirming better adhesion of the polymer to the bubble surface. Aromatically substituted polymers (PDADMAC-BC and PDADMAC-BCF) were quantifiable for residual polymers in the treated effluent through F-EEM analysis. It was observed that the treated effluent concentration of PDADMAC-BCF was four to six times less than that when using PDADMAC-BC. The adsorption conformation of the polymer on the bubble surface alters dependent on both the polymer backbone and the type of hydrophobic moiety incorporated. PDMAEMA and its derivative were found to adsorb very tightly to the bubble surface unlike PDADMAC derivatives which tend to project away from the into the surrounding matrix as evidenced by the AFM results.
