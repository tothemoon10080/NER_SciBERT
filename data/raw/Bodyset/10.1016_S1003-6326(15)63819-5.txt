Basicity has an important effect on the sinter quality, especially for low-titanium vanadium–titanium sinter. The effect of basicity on sintering behavior of low-titanium vanadium–titanium mixture, and the transference and distribution of element in sintering process were researched by sinter pot test, mineralogical analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The results show that CaO preferentially reacts with TiO2, generating pervoskite, so that the total liquid phase content of the sinter is low. There is an increase in the perovskite concentration of the sinter with the basicity ranging from 1.9:1 to 2.7:1. With increasing the basicity, the calcium ferrite content increases slightly and then rises rapidly, while the silicate content decreases and the metallurgical property of the sinter is improved. As for the distribution of these elements in the sinter, Ti occurs mainly in perovskite, V occurs mainly in silicate, and Fe occurs mainly in magnetite and hematite. The most abundant occurrence of Ca and Si occurs in silicate and perovskite. With increasing the basicity, the contents of Al and Mg increase in calcium ferrite, while they decrease in other minerals.
