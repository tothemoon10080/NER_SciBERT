 THE USE OF CHEMICAL TREATMENTS FOR IMPROVED COMMINUTION OF ARTIFICIAL STONES (vol. 171, pp. 1797–1801) All of the following techniques may be used to assess the influence of chemolytic substances on urinary stones except: wave impedance measurement microhardness measurement bulk modulus measurement infrared spectroscopy distribution of fragments after shock wave lithotripsy RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION OF SMALL RENAL TUMORS: INTERMEDIATE RESULTS (vol. 171, pp. 1814–1818) Concerning radio frequency ablation (RFA) ablation of renal tumors, which of the following is true? low energy RFA ablation is rarely associated with the heat sink phenomenon the efficacy of RFA renal ablation is not known as higher wattage devices are only recently being evaluated central renal tumors are untreatable with RFA early results with high wattage RFA devices are similar to those with low wattage devices percutaneous RFA is more efficacious than laparoscopic RFA CLINICAL USE OF FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE F18 POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY FOR DETECTION OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (vol. 171, pp. 1806–1809) The optimum use of positron emission tomography imaging for renal cell carcinoma depends on which characteristics or attributes? low specificity for bone metastases high sensitivity, poor specificity for primary renal cancer high sensitivity and specificity for lung metastases poor sensitivity and high specificity for primary and metastatic renal cell carcinoma poor sensitivity and poor specificity with no role in this disease DETECTION OF PROSTATE CANCER USING SERUM PROTEOMICS PATTERN IN A HISTOLOGICALLY CONFIRMED POPULATION (vol. 171, pp. 1782–1787) In the proteomics technique SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry, SELDI stands for: sensitivity enhanced laser desorption/ionization specificity enhanced laser desorption/ionization surface enhanced laser depletion/ionization surface enhanced laser desorption/identification surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization ACCURACY AND CLINICAL ROLE OF FINE NEEDLE PERCUTANEOUS BIOPSY WITH COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY-GUIDANCE OF SMALL (LESS THAN 4.0 CM) RENAL MASSES (vol. 171, pp. 1802–1805) Biopsies of small renal masses: are performed with a 14 gauge needle are benign in 30% of cases have an accuracy of approximately 60% for histological evaluation give information to tailor the treatment for a specific tumor type are 90% accurate for Fuhrman grade evaluation
