In the present investigation, the nanocrystalline/nanoparticle ZnO powder was synthesized using high energy ball milling process. It has been found mechanical milling is a very effective, low cost and simple technique to produce nanocrystalline/nanoparticle ZnO powder. Structural and morphological investigations of the powders during the process were carried out by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X'Pert HighScore and Clemex Vision image analysis software. The results showed that after milling for 8h, in best condition, ZnO powder particles with crystallite size of 15nm, particle size of about 60nm and lattice strain of 0.67% were obtained.Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a versatile, multifunctional and one of the most promising materials in the family of wide-gap semiconductors. Due to its unique properties, such as chemical, radiation and thermal resistance, optical transparency and high piezoelectric properties, it has been extensively used in industrial and medical applications Commercially obtained ZnO powder particles with purity of 99.9% and average particle size of about 8  The typical FESEM images of elemental and also milled powder for 8 As a result of this investigation, in contrast with other similar manufacturing processes and technologies working at high temperatures or complex reaction conditions, high energy ball milling process could be a very efficient, practically simple and low-cost process for synthesis of nanocrystalline/nanoparticle ZnO powder particles. This technique is mainly used due to its ease of application. Based on the results obtained from the research and experiments used in the present work, the following conclusions can be inferred: Nanocrystalline/nanoparticle ZnO was successfully synthesized directly from ZnO microsize powder using high energy ball milling process. 8 After 8
