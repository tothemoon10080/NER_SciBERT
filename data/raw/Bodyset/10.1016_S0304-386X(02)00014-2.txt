There are 274 articles, with focus areas spreading over the various disciplines of minerals and materials processing, hydro and biohydrometallurgy, waste treatment and recycling. The Proceedings of the XXI International Mineral Processing Congress offer insight into the understanding between mineral processing and hydrometallurgy. The proceedings are a “must” for any mineral-processing library and would be a valuable addition to the bookshelf of many hydrometallurgists, especially those working at the minerals–hydrometallurgy interface.
