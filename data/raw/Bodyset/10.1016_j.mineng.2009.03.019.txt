A mathematical approach is proposed to describe the multiphase flow in a 1000mm industrial dense medium cyclone. A mixture multiphase model is employed to describe the flow of the dense medium (comprising finely ground magnetite contaminated with non-magnetic material in water) and the air core, where the turbulence is described by the well established Reynolds stress model. The stochastic Lagrangian particle tracking method is used to simulate the flow of coal particles. The proposed approach was qualitatively validated using literature and industrial data and then used to study the effects of medium properties including medium density, magnetite type and non-magnetic content. It is found that as the medium density increases, the pressure drop increases, resulting in a high pressure gradient force on coal particles and reduced separating efficiencies. The segregation of magnetite particles becomes serious as magnetite particle size increases, which leads to a high density differential and a high off-set. The viscosity of medium decreases and the segregation of magnetite particles become significant with the decrease of non-magnetic content, resulting in a high density differential and off-set.drag coefficient particle diameter, m turbulent diffusion term acceleration due to gravity, m kinetic energy, m static pressure, Pa stress production term Reynolds number time, s instantaneous velocity, m instantaneous velocity, m instantaneous velocity, m dispersion velocity, m time average velocity in axial direction, m axis, m volume fraction dissipation term pressure strain term fluid viscosity, kg density, kg normally distributed random number continuous phase solid phase drift velocity 1,2,3 mixture particle  Dense medium cyclones (DMCs), also known as heavy medium cyclones, are the work horses of the modern coal industry to upgrade run-of-mine coal in the 0.5–50 The flow in a DMC is very complicated with the presence of swirling turbulence, air core and particle segregation, and involves multiple phases: gas, liquid, coal and magnetic/non-magnetic particles of different sizes and densities. Normally, the slurry including water, magnetite and non-magnetic content is termed “medium”. Precise measurement of the velocity field in a DMC is very difficult, mainly because of the presence of magnetite particles in the medium. Medium properties play an important role in DMC operation. The factors that control the fluid mechanical medium properties in industry are medium density (solids content), magnetite type (largely expressed by particle size distribution) and non-magnetic content. This paper reports our recent effort in modelling the gas–liquid–solid flow in a 1000 Recognising that the flow in a DMC is quite complicated, we divided our modelling into three steps, as shown as In Step 2, six additional phases are introduced to describe the behaviour of magnetite particles with different sizes. The multiphase model is changed from the VOF to the so-called mixture multiphase model. A correction is also necessary to estimate the viscosity effect of magnetite and non-magnetic particle size distribution. Detailed density and velocity distributions of different phases are obtained at the end of this step. In Step 3, the results of the fluid flow are used in the simulation of the flow of coal particles described by the stochastic Lagrangian particle tracking model (LPT). The characteristics of the DMC separating performance, such as partition curve and medium split, are then estimated.Therefore, the whole process involves four CFD models for different phases and one viscosity correction model, with their governing equations listed in A 1000 The whole computational domain is represented by hexahedron grids. In the vicinity of the walls and vortex finder, a finer grid is used than for the remainder of the cyclone. In total, 80,318 cells were used in the present work, with trial numerical results indicating a greater number did not change the solution.  Six different sized magnetite particles, with their volume fractions approximated by a Rosin–Rammler distribution, are used to describe the behaviour of magnetite phases (data in brackets represent volume fraction): 10 (30.5%), 20 (25.6%), 30 (14.6%), 40 (11.5%), 50 (9.9%) and 80 This model ignores the effects of coal particles on the slurry phase and the interaction between individual coal particles. This treatment has been widely accepted for dilute flows ( The effect of changing the medium properties was examined through a parametric study. The proposed model was initially validated by comparing the experimental and simulation results generated for a 350           As shown in     As shown in In order to understand the effects of medium properties such as the medium density, magnetite type and non-magnetic content on DMCs performance, a CFD model has been developed and used to quantify the flow and particle fields in a 1000 As the medium feed density increases, the operational head and the medium split remain constant. The off-set increases but the Ep is relatively insensitive to medium feed density. The pressures drop increases significantly with increasing medium feed density, resulting in a high inward pressure gradient force on particles and reduced separating efficiencies. The operating head and the medium split decrease, and the density differential increases, as the magnetite particles become coarser (from ultrafine to medium grade). The off-set increases and Ep increases slightly for coarse particles and remains almost constant for fine particles as the magnetite particles become coarser. The separation performance in the cylindrical section is insensitive to magnetite particle size. However, since the magnetite segregates near the spigot, the local pressure gradient, medium density and viscosity all increase, which leads to a higher density differential. The difference between the pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force becomes large in this area and the particles there have more opportunities to move into the upward bulk flow, resulting in a higher off-set and Ep. As the non-magnetic content in the medium increases, both the operating head and density differential decrease. The medium split increases to a maximum and then decreases. The off-set decreases for large particles and remains constant for small particles as the non-magnetic content increases. Ep increases slightly for coarse particles and significantly for fine particles. Since the magnetite segregation near the spigot is very significant when operating with low non-magnetic content, the local pressure force tends to be high, resulting in a high density differential and off-set compared to the high non-magnetic content.
