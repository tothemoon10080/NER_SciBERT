Since November, 2018, France has been facing violent contestation with the national so-called yellow vests protests, resulting in about 4000 casualties. Facial injuries related to NLHHWs share common characteristics, such as bone comminution and severe soft-tissue wounds, highlighting the high-velocity kinetic mechanism. Notably, we observed multifocal mandibular and dentoalveolar fractures, sometimes associated with transfixing wounds of the lip, and comminuted zygomatic fractures and orbital wall blow-out fractures, which were frequently associated with severe ocular traumatisms ( Although rubber bullets from NLHHWs are designed to induce blunt injuries to incapacitate violent individuals without using firearms, they might induce death as well as severe trauma with irreversible functional consequences and long-term social implications. The social unrest in France has been an informative time regarding facial injuries induced by NLHHWs, which need to be treated quickly and efficiently in trauma centres by an experienced multidisciplinary team. Training courses will have to be provided to optimise initial patient care by prehospital medical services. We declare no competing interests.
