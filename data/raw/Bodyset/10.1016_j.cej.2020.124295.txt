In this study, Bi2Te3 nanostructures were synthesized with controlled morphologies by using a solvothermal process and then sintered by spark plasma sintering to obtain bulk samples with controllable texture degrees. The sintered nanostructured Bi2Te3 pellets show texture-dependent thermoelectric properties, in which their Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity can be optimized by the proper texture design to simultaneously secure a high carrier mobility and strong phonon scattering, resulting in a peak ZT value of ~0.69 at 333 K. This study reveals the potential of texture engineering in developing high performance anisotropic thermoelectric materials.Thermoelectric (TE) technology has been considered as an eco-friendly solution for tackling the global energy crisis through solid-state conversion between heat and electricity Among all the state-of-art TE materials Herein, we report a facile texturing method for Bi Bismuth oxide (Bi Bi The ultrathin Bi X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained using a Shimazu XRD-6100 diffractometer with Cu-Kα In order to measure the TE properties, the as-synthesized powder samples were sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS, Japan LABOX-325) under a pressure of 60 MPa at 300 ℃ for 10 min to form a disk-shaped pellet (   The as-synthesized powders were sintered into pellets by SPS for TE property measurement.   The temperature-dependent It is well-known that layer-structured bulks with high orientation degree are easy to suffer layered failure, which largely reduces the reliability and life time of devices In summary, we fabricated Bi The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
