Radiographs are frequently used to classify joint depression calcaneal fractures and assess the degree of repair of such injuries. To associate the degree of repair with clinical outcomes such as foot-related quality of life and subjective patient satisfaction, it would be useful to have a valid measuring instrument that has been shown to reliably categorize the alignment of the posterior facet of the calcaneus. To be considered valid, the measurement must have inter-rater and intrarater reliability. In an effort to demonstrate the validity of a coronal plane computed tomographic measurement for categorizing the alignment of the posterior facet after repair of joint depression fractures of the calcaneus, we measured the inter-rater and intrarater reliability of the classification system.Calcaneal fractures constitute approximately 2% of all fractures, and, because of axial loading, most (70% to 75%) of these fractures are intra-articular Over the years, the treatment of calcaneal fractures has varied greatly, ranging from nonsurgical therapy to open reduction and internal fixation. Regardless of the treatment method, a common goal in the treatment of CJDF has been anatomic reduction of the posterior facet Instead of the existing wide variety of radiographic measurements related to the classification of joint depression fractures of the calcaneus, it would be helpful have to a particular radiographic (or arthroscopic) measurement that could be taken during the course of an operation to repair the posterior facer or in the immediate postoperative period and then correlated with the long-term clinical outcome. Also, owing to the theoretical and practical importance of accurately reconstructing the posterior facet of the subtalar joint after CJDF, it would be useful to surgeons to have a reliable method for determining the alignment of the posterior facet at surgery. The first step in developing such an instrument would be to show that the results of the measurement possess inter-rater and intrarater reliability We developed a CT rating scale to categorize alignment of the posterior facet of the calcaneus after open reduction and internal fixation of CJDFs ( For the first assessment, the inter-rater reliability for the correlation (agreement) between the categorization of the alignment of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint ( For the second assessment, the inter-rater reliability for the correlation between the categorization of the alignment of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint by raters 1 and 2, as measured using Spearman's ρ, was 0.8567, and the probability that the ratings were independent was .0015 ( The intra-rater reliability for the correlation between the categorization of the alignment of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint by rater 1 between the first and second assessments (2 weeks apart), as measured using Spearman's ρ, was 0.9938, and the probability that the ratings were independent was less than .0001 ( The correlation coefficients computed in the present study ( We recognize that our investigation was subject to a number of shortcomings that could potentially threaten the validity of the results obtained using the rating scale we used to categorize the alignment of the posterior facet of the calcaneus. Although we considered using the intraclass correlation coefficient In conclusion, the results of the present investigation have shown that the 7-category rating scale used to describe the alignment of the posterior facet of the calcaneus, as viewed on selected CT scans, is reliable in regard to the inter-rater and intrarater agreement. Because reliability is a part of the foundation on which validity is based, the results of our investigation have indicated that the rating scale can be used to produce valid information pertaining to the alignment of the posterior facet of the calcaneus. Thus, this rating scale can be used to describe the alignment of the posterior facet before and after repair of a CJDF and might be applicable to arthroscopic inspection of the posterior facet at operative repair. The rating scale, moreover, can be used in future prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled clinical trials that focus on the diagnosis and treatment and long-term sequelae of joint depression fractures of the calcaneus.
