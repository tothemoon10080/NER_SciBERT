It is natural to extend conventional unimodal optimization to challenging multimodal optimization design of composite structures by means of emergent niching particle swarm optimization (PSO), due to multimodal characteristics of composite structures by nature. The advanced multimodal PSO algorithms adopted in the present study include the species-based PSO (SPSO), the fitness Euclidean-distance ratio based PSO (FER-PSO), the ring topology based PSO and the Euclidean distance-based locally informed particle swarm (LIPS) optimizer, which are applied to a multimodal buckling maximization problem of composite panels. SPSO, FER-PSO, the ring topology based PSO and the variant of LIPS succeed to simultaneously indentify not only the first-best-fitness solutions (the global optima) but also the second-best-fitness solutions (the global sub-optima) to this buckling optimization design in a single optimization process. The fifteen second-best-fitness solutions are discovered for the first time and the buckling-resistance difference between the seven first-best-fitness solutions and the fifteen second-best-fitness solutions is definitely negligible from the viewpoint of practical applications. Based on the new findings of twenty-two acceptable solutions, this specific buckling maximization design of composite panels can be served as a benchmark problem of real-world multimodal optimization. In terms of the statistical outcomes on algorithmic performance assessments, the ring topology based PSO without any niching parameter is suitable and reliable for multimodal optimization of composite structures in comparison with SPSO, FER-PSO and the variant of LIPS.In the recent decades, fiber reinforced composite materials have been growingly adopted in different engineering applications, such as civil, aerospace, maritime, and automotive practices, because of their high stiffness/strength and light weight characteristics, as compared with traditional materials such as metals. Moreover, composite laminates provide great flexibility in tailing structural performances to meet specific requirements for real-world applications. One of the challenging issues about taking advantage of this tailing flexibility is that optimal designs of composite laminated structures are usually typical multimodal optimization problems, in which there are multiple global optimal solutions with identical objective/fitness function values. Furthermore, fitness functions of optimization objectives normally have complex and high-dimensional search landscapes due to highly nonlinear mechanic responses of composite structures with a great number of design variables. A lot of studies in the literature have successfully solved unimodal optimization of composite structures to find a single optimal solution in a single optimization process by using different optimization methods, such as various evolutionary algorithms (EA) More importantly, however, it is quite necessary to extend conventional unimodal optimization to challenging multimodal optimization of composite structures by successfully identifying multiple global optima (first-best-fitness solutions) and even global sub-optima (second-best-fitness solutions) for practical designs. This is because multimodal optimization of composite structures is able to not only provide engineers with better insights into multimodal characteristics of composite structures by nature, but also offer more alternative optimal designs to allow for final appropriate applications of composite structures in various circumstances, especially in case the fitness-value difference between first-best-fitness solutions and second-best-fitness solutions is negligible in the view of engineering practices. To solve multimodal optimization problem for composite structures, EA optimization procedures based on population search mechanism have natural advantages over traditional optimization techniques. For example, EA based methods do not require gradient information and hence they avoid the possibility of solutions being trapped by local optima. In addition, EA based techniques can be applied to highly non-linear optimization problems and the optimization results are independent of the initial guess of the design variables. Techniques to detect and preserve multiple solutions for multimodal optimization are commonly referred to “niching” methods. Standard EA procedures, such as genetic algorithms (GA), evolution strategies (ES), differential evolution (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), could be modified to tackle multimodal optimization by incorporating niching techniques in order to simultaneously identify multiple global optimal solutions in a single optimization process PSO has been recognized as one of the robust and efficient algorithms in solving optimization problems since it was first introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart The aforementioned multimodal PSO algorithms involve empirically pre-specifying niching parameters, which might limit the real-world applications of the niching parameters based algorithms as it is hard to choose the suitable values of niching parameters for different optimization problems. Hence an adaptive niching parameters PSO (ANPSO) Based on the recent development of niching PSO for multimodal optimization summarized above, it is rather natural and necessary to employ the emergent multimodal PSO techniques for the optimal designs of composite laminated structures with multiple optimum solutions by nature, and further to investigate the adaptability and performance of these advanced multimodal PSO algorithms for the real-world practices. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, however, the multimodal optimization of composite structures using advanced niching PSO techniques has not yet been available in the published literature. It is noted that PSO and DE are two popular algorithms having recently gained increasing interest of researchers working on multimodal optimization problems due to their robustness, efficiency and simplicity, however, the average performance of any pair of algorithms applied over all problems is indistinguishable in light of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem The structure of this paper is organized as follows. Section This section first describes the principle of canonical PSO for unimodal optimization. Four niching PSO algorithms for multimodal optimization, namely SPSO, FER-PSO, LIPS and the ring topology based PSO, are then discussed in detail. It should be noted that SPSO requires pre-specifying the value of a niching parameter by users, while FER-PSO, LIPS and the ring topology based PSO are niching algorithms without using any niching parameter. The mechanism of PSO is inspired by the social and cooperative behavior of animals, such as bird flocking and fish schooling. The PSO algorithm is based on a population (swarm) of potential solutions called particles. These particles explore through the search domain with a specified velocity to find the optimal solution. Each particle maintains a memory, which helps it in keeping the track of its previous best position. The positions of the particles are distinguished as personal best of each individual and global best of the whole swarm. In the past decade, PSO has been successfully applied in many research areas and practical applications. It has been demonstrated that PSO has better computation efficiency compared to other The basic steps of the PSO algorithm are summarized as below Set the swarm’s initial positions and velocities randomly for a given size of population Determine the velocity vector for each particle in the swarm by learning from its own best experience and other particle’s best past experience according to Eq. Update the current position of each particle using the velocity vector and the previous position of each particle according to Eq. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until stopping criteria are achieved The velocity vector In terms of the method for choosing In 2004, Li To determine the species seeds, all of the particles are sorted in decreasing order based on their fitness values. The first dominating species seed is the best-fit particle of the whole population and the second dominating species seed is the best-fit particle in the remaining particles by removing the first dominating species seed and its neighborhood particles within the radius The user-specified niching parameter Inspired by the Fitness-Distance-Ratio based PSO (FDR-PSO) Without prior knowledge of a niche, the The third advanced multimodal PSO algorithm investigated in this study was proposed by Li In 2013, Qu et al. LIPS was originally developed from a fully informed particle swarm (FIPS) In the present paper, a modified version of LIPS denoted as LIPS_m is also proposed and adopted. Like LIPS, “local information” of Euclidean distance-based neighborhood is used in LIPS_m, but A simply supported composite laminated panel consists of Due to the assumptions of the stacking sequence, shear-extension coupling and extension-bending coupling are eliminated in terms of classical lamination theory, thus the governing differential equation for the buckling load This optimal design problem of composite laminates subjected to buckling loads can be formulated as the stacking sequence optimization aimed at maximizing the critical buckling factor This design problem of the 64-ply composite laminate has been investigated in the related works focusing on unimodal optimization The optimization outcomes of the investigated multimodal PSO algorithms for the laminated composite panel design in Section 3 showed that SPSO, FER-PSO, LIPS_m and the ring topology based PSO were capable of finding both the first-best-fitness designs (the global optima) and the second-best-fitness designs (the global sub-optima), while LIPS unexpectedly failed to identify neither the global optima nor the global sub-optima solutions. It is noted that LIPS definitely overwhelmed SPSO, FER-PSO, LIPS_m and the ring topology based PSO on various benchmark unimodal and multimodal functions Using sufficiently large particle population size The seven known first-best-fitness designs with the critical buckling load factor 3973.014 and the fifteen first discovered second-best-fitness designs with the critical buckling load factor 3972.996, as identified by SPSO, FER-PSO, LIPS_m and the ring topology based PSO, were listed in In order to check the independence of the second-best-fitness designs from the first-best-fitness designs in terms of the location difference in the 16-dimensional design space, the stacking sequence components of each second-best-fitness design were compared with those of each first-best-fitness design. As to every first-best-fitness design, the number of the stacking sequence components different from those of a given second-best-fitness design was recorded, and the first-best-fitness design with the minimum number of different components was defined as the nearest first-best-fitness design to this specified second-best-fitness design, as listed in As presented in A series of numerical experiments on the multimodal buckling maximization of composite panels presented in Section 3 were conducted by varying the particle population size In terms of (1) As shown in (2) The numerical experiment outcomes showed that the performance of SPSO was sensitively dependent on the pre-specified niching radius value or the distribution characteristics of multiple optima in the search space. Taking Deb and Goldberg’s method by Eq. (3) According to the experiment results, FER-PSO without niching parameters outperformed the standard unimodal PSO and SPSO ( (4) LIPS_m without the requirement of a niching parameter was overall superior to SPSO ( (5) The statistical results of the experiments also showed that the ring topology based PSO algorithms including r3pso and r2pso without any niching parameter exhibited superior performance and robustness in various combinations of In addition, by comparison between the case of Emergent multimodal optimization of PSO algorithms using niching techniques have been naturally applied and explored in order to extend conventional unimodal optimization to challenging multimodal optimization of composite structures, since optimal designs of composite structures are by nature typical multimodal optimization problems in the real world. The niching PSO algorithms including SPSO, FER-PSO, r3pso, r2pso, LIPS and LIPS_m have been adopted for a multimodal engineering problem, i.e., maximizing the buckling capacity of a composite panel subjected to a combination of in-plane compressive loads. In the optimization process of this specific multimodal optimal design, the performance of LIPS was poor, while SPSO, FER-PSO, r3pso, r2pso and LIPS_m successfully identified the multiple second-best-fitness solutions (the global sub-optima) with the critical buckling load factor 3972.996, apart from the seven first-best-fitness solutions (the global optima) with the critical buckling load factor 3973.014. It should be stressed that these fifteen second-best-fitness solutions are discovered for the first time by means of the multimodal PSO techniques. Thus it is definitely shown that the performance investigation of multimodal niching algorithms applied for engineering optimization practices is indispensable, and that these successful niching PSO algorithms under investigation have strong power in dealing with multimodal optimization of composite structures. It is also found that most of the second-best-fitness designs are mathematically far away from the neighborhood of any first-best-fitness design in the search space. Furthermore, it is observed that the buckling-resistance difference between the known seven first-best-fitness solutions and the new fifteen second-best-fitness solutions is extremely close, and this discrepancy can be undoubtedly neglected from the viewpoint of engineering practices. Consequently, there are twenty-two acceptable optimal designs for this buckling optimization problem. Based on the new findings of twenty-two multiple optimal designs, this buckling maximization design can then be served as one desirable benchmark real-world problem of composite panels to test the adaptability of various multimodal/unimodal optimization algorithms adopted for realistic engineering applications such as optimal design of composite structures. In terms of the statistical results of this optimization problem, the performance of SPSO relies on the size of the niching radius and the distribution uniformity of multiple optima. SPSO with appropriate niching radius value exhibits superior ability in locating multiple global optima even if the optima are non-uniformly distributed in the search space of multimodal optimization.
