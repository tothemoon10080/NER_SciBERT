This study aims to understand the underlying reasons for the poor flotation response of marine microalgae. The flotation performance and hydrophobicity of a freshwater microalga (Chlorella sp. BR2) were compared to those of a marine microalga (Tetraselmis sp. M8) at different salinities in the presence of a cationic collector, tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide. It was found that microalgal hydrophobicity played a more important role than salinity in determining the flotation performance.Microalgae are photosynthetic organisms with great potential to harvest sunlight and convert carbon dioxide into biofuels, health food and animal feed ( Although the selection of suitable algae harvesting techniques depends largely on the microalgae species and the desired final product, several methods have been proposed for algae harvesting, including centrifugation, filtration, membrane separation process, sedimentation with flocculation, gravity sedimentation, and froth flotation ( Flotation is a proven technology to effectively capture small particles up to 500 Marine microalga Flotation experiments were carried out using a 1.5-L agitair flotation cell. Air was supplied to the flotation cell through its bottom, where an impeller was placed to provide the agitation necessary for breaking air into bubbles and dispersing them throughout the cell. The bubbles picked up microalgae and rose to the top, forming a microalgae-laden froth, which was subsequently removed manually. Prior to the flotation process, microalgae cultures were stirred vigorously for 2 The hydrophobicity of microalgae was measured by using the modified adherence-to-hydrocarbon method ( The flotation kinetics of freshwater microalga At a given flotation time, increasing collector dosage clearly increased the flotation recovery ( When considering water rejection for BR2, it was observed that within 6 When the concentration of C At a given C BR2 was cultivated as usual using freshwater but then 35 ppt NaCl was added and algae were incubated for various times before flotation commenced ( Comparative flotation tests for M8 were performed at three different concentrations of C It is noteworthy that both flotation recovery and microalgae hydrophobicity increased with increasing collector dosage ( If no collector was used, the flotation performance of marine microalga M8 was poorer than that of freshwater microalga BR2 because the former had a lower degree of hydrophobicity.
