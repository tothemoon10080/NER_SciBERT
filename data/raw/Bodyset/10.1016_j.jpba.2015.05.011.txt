Bulk crystallisation of protein therapeutic molecules towards their controlled drug delivery is of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry. The complexity of biotherapeutic molecules is likely to lead to complex material properties of crystals in the solid state and to complex transitions. This complexity is explored using batch crystallised lysozyme as a model. The effects of drying and milling on the solid-state transformations of lysozyme crystals were monitored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), FT-Raman, and enzymatic assay. XRPD was used to characterise crystallinity and these data supported those of crystalline lysozyme which gave a distinctive DSC thermogram. The apparent denaturation temperature (T

This structure is consistent with reduced cooperative unit sizes compared to the amorphous lysozyme and is consistent with a reduction in the T

                      of the crystalline form. Evidence was obtained that milling also induced denaturation in the solid-state, with the denatured lysozyme showing no thermal transition. The denaturation of the crystalline lysozyme occurred mainly through its amorphous form. Interestingly, the mechanical denaturation of lysozyme did not affect its biological activity on dissolution. Lysozyme crystals on drying did not become amorphous, while milling-time played a crucial role in the crystalline-amorphous-denatured transformations of lysozyme crystals. DSC is shown to be a key tool to monitor quantitatively these transformations.Lysozymes are a group of enzymes defined as 1,4-β- Zhou et al. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a well-established and widely used technique to monitor solid state transformations. However, the thermal transitions of lysozyme, in common with other proteins, are usually characterized in the solution state, and often using a high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (HSDSC), which is capable of detecting the small changes in enthalpy that arise when proteins unfold within their solutions There is a renewed interest in lysozyme, and its solid state form can have a significant effect on dissolution and stability. We wished to explore how pre-treatment of lysozyme crystals affected thermal behaviour, in an attempt to use thermal profiles as a fingerprinting indicator of prior treatment. In this study, we prepare lysozyme crystals to be dried and/or milled, and appropriate mixtures of the treated forms were prepared. Our aim is to use DSC to monitor the potential solid state transformations of lysozyme during the treatment processes. We use Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), FT-Raman, and enzymatic assay for reference. To our knowledge this is the first application of DSC for the quantitative detection of crystalline, amorphous and denatured lysozyme forms.

Milling times of 3, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 Precipitated samples were also prepared to explain the effect of NaCl on thermal behaviour of lysozyme particles. These amorphous samples were prepared using the same principle of batch crystallization method. Hence solutions containing 2% w/v lysozyme plus different amount of NaCl (0, 0.096, 0.16, and 0.8% w/v) in deionised water were dried under vacuum at a temperature 30 Unprocessed lysozyme and the 3 A Zeiss Axioplan2 polarizing microscope (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH; Hallbergmoos, Germany) was used to visualize the samples. The accompanying software (Axio Vision 4.2) was then used to determine the projected area diameters of the powders. The water content of each sample was estimated using Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA 7 Perkin Elmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, UK). Samples of 3–10 X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the powders were obtained using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer (Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany), using Cu Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Series 7 DSC (Perkin-Elmer Ltd., Beaconsfield, UK). Samples (4–7  FT-Raman spectra of samples were recorded with a Bruker IFS66 optics system using a Bruker FRA 106 Raman module.

The thermograms ( The diffractogram presented in Because lysozyme crystals exist in different forms, the CMPR program (Version 1.32) Dried lysozyme crystals were also characterised using PXRD and data indicated that the degree of crystallinity was predominantly maintained. The fact that the intensity of the XRPD peaks, which did not notably change ( Milling of the dried crystals did produce a loss in crystallinity. XRPD was able to follow the loss of crystallinity of dried lysozyme crystals with comminution time. In case of 3 Lysozyme DSC thermograms, in the solid state, typically show two endothermic peaks. The broad peak ranging from ∼30 to ∼140 Close scrutiny of the thermograms showed that for sample 20 The We can postulate that when the cooperative unit increases, a higher temperature is needed to unfold the lysozyme molecular aggregates, and that the larger the cooperative unit, the higher the  Conventional DSC has been used to estimate the different solid phases in lactose powders. The estimation depended on knowing the enthalpy of solid phase transformation for each form. This DSC approach has been previously verified Applying the same approach to monitor the processing of the lysozyme powders, crystalline lysozyme (i.e. crystals) and amorphous lysozyme (i.e. unprocessed powder) produced similar enthalpies ( To test the quantitative hypothesis amorphous lysozyme (unprocessed sample) and crystalline lysozyme (3 Raman spectroscopy was used to compare the molecular conformation of crystalline (3 Compared to the amorphous form of lysozyme (20 Rich α-helix structures have a low tendency to aggregate compared to rich β-sheet structures Comparison of the spectrum of the denatured lysozyme (sample 60 Interestingly, milled samples did not show a reduction in biological activity (ANOVA: Bulk crystallisation of protein therapeutic molecules for controlled drug delivery studies is of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry. The complexity of biotherapeutic molecules is likely to lead to complex material properties of crystals in the solid state. Here we exemplify, using the model drug lysozyme, the effects of processing lysozyme crystals and are able to show distinct differences in the properties of the materials after processing which could be used in optimising and controlling processes for the purposes of quality by design. By drying lysozyme crystals using a controlled method we were able to evidence the removal of water and maintain crystallinity. However, the size reduction of dried lysozyme crystals by milling was shown to promote formation of an amorphous solid-state form. Raman spectroscopy provided evidence that the amorphous form was then denatured in the solid state by further milling. The milling time was the critical attribute determining the extent of the transformations. DSC was successfully employed in monitoring the three different states of lysozyme (namely crystalline, amorphous, and denatured) in the solid state. The DSC thermogram of the crystalline lysozyme exhibited The authors thank Dr Ian S.
