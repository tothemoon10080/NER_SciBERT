A novel mixed collector (BHOA) was prepared by mixing benzohydroxamic acid (BHA) and sodium oleate (NaOL) and applied to the flotation separation of smithsonite from dolomite. Flotation results showed that NaOL alone had good collecting performance on smithsonite and common gangue mineral dolomite but had poor selectivity. By using a BHA/NaOL mixed system with a molar ratio of 2:1, the recoveries of smithsonite and dolomite reached approximately 90% and 5%, respectively. Surface tension analysis showed that the surface activity of BHOA was a little higher than that of a single NaOL because of synergistic effects. Zeta potential and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicated that surfactants BHA and NaOL co-absorbed on the smithsonite surface and only NaOL was present on the dolomite surface in the presence of BHOA.
