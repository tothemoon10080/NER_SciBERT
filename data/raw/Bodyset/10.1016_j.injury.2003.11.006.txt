A 51-year-old man was transferred from the primary trauma centre after a right elbow fracture dislocation which he sustained in a motor vehicle accident on a major highway. The affected elbow was markedly swollen but there was no neurologic deficit distal to the elbow. The initial radiographs of the elbow revealed a complex fracture of the proximal ulna with severe comminution involving more than 50% of the coronoid process and together with anterior dislocation of the radial head ( Preoperatively, a 12 hole reconstruction plate (AO Mathys, Daus) was contoured to the dorsal surface of the proximal ulna of a plastic bone-model and sterilised. The patient was placed prone on a standard table. The arm was positioned over the edge of the table over a padded bolster with a tourniquet applied, such that the image intensifier could visualise laterally the whole of the proximal ulna. Closed reduction of the dislocated radial head by simple traction was carried out and the length of ulna was restored. The entry site for the reconstruction plate was 2 Three months after the operation, the patient reported mild pain, with active elbow flexion from 20° to 110°, full supination and pronation limited to 60°. Plain radiographs revealed sound bone union without heterotopic ossification ( This kind of injury can be termed an anterior trans-olecranon fracture dislocation. Recently, as the understanding of fracture healing has grown, the emphasis has changed from wide exposures and stable anatomic reduction to limited exposure and preservation of the vascular supply, commonly termed minimal invasive percutaneous plating osteosynthesis (MIPPO). Minimally invasive percutaneous plate osteosynthesis can be a useful alternative in complex elbow fractures or fracture dislocations.
