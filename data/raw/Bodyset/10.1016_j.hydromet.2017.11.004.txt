Due to rapid innovation in electronic industries, the average lifetime of electronic devices has been shortening drastically, leading to a massive electronic waste production (E-waste). As an essential part of E-waste, waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) attract considerable concerns to seek a green and cost-effective recycling approach. In this study, a green chemical, [BSO3HPy]HSO4, was used to replace H2SO4 in a slurry electrolytic system in order to recover valuable metal copper from WPCBs in one-step. The results indicate that as more H2SO4 is replaced by [BSO3HPy]HSO4, copper recovery rate and current efficiency first increased and then decreased, while copper powders purity showed a reverse tendency: increases first and then decreases. The substitution of H2SO4 by [BSO3HPy]HSO4 could effectively reduce the particle size of the obtained powders. When 10% H2SO4 was replaced by [BSO3HPy]HSO4, the recovery rate, current efficiency, purity and particle size of copper powders were 90.94%, 70.68%, 81.69% and 2.30Î¼m, respectively, thus reaching an optimal level. XRD results show that elemental Cu was the main mineral phase in the obtained powders. SEM and TEM results indicate that copper powders obtained in H2SO4-slurry-electrolysis system is dendritic and polycrystalline, whereas those obtained in an electrolytic solution with [BSO3HPy]HSO4 were in form of scattered monocrystalline particles.The average lifetime of electronic devices has been shortened drastically with rapid innovation in electronic industries ( There are many ways for WPCBs reutilization ( Ionic liquids (ILs), consisting of an organic cation and an inorganic or organic anion, are liquid salts at room temperature ( Thus, in this study, a typical ionic liquid, N-butyl sulfonate pyridinium hydrosulfate ([BSO WPCBs powders used in the experiments were supplied by a recycling company in China. The obtained WPCBs powders, after drying at 104 The ionic liquid ([BSO After each electrolytic experiment, the metal powders, collected from the cathodic plate, were first washed with ethyl alcohol (30% v/v) and ultra-pure water for removing foreign ions, and then passivated with a benzotriazole solution (5 Mineral phase compositions of the obtained metal powders-were characterized by X-ray diffraction and its microstructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Carl Zeiss, EV081, Heidenheim, Germany) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Carl Zeiss, Libra 200FE, Heidenheim, Germany). The granularity of the obtained copper powders was analyzed by laser particle size analyzer (LPAS, BI-90plus, New York, America), expressed by D  When the ionic liquid was added to substitute H According to the previous equations, the mathematical relationship between the R This relationship between  Parameter D The phase compositions of the obtained metal powders at different [BSO The microstructure of metal powders, dominated by elemental copper, was analyzed by SEM and TEM. SEM and TEM photos of copper powders, obtained in non- and 10% [BSO  In the sample obtained from a 10% [BSO The results of this research prove that one-step [BSO This research was supported by a grant from the
