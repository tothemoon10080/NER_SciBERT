Liquid–solid fluidized beds are used in mineral processing industries to separate particles based on particle size, density, and shape. Understanding the expanded fluidized bed is vital for accurately assessing its performance. Expansion characteristics of the fluidized bed were studied by performing several experiments with iron ore, chromite, quartz, and coal samples. Using water as liquid medium, experiments were conducted to study the effects of particle size, particle density, and superficial velocity on fluidized bed expansion. The experimental data were utilized to develop an empirical mathematical model based on dimensional analysis to estimate the expansion ratio of the fluidized bed in terms of particle characteristics, operating and design parameters. The predicted expansion ratio obtained from the mathematical model is in good agreement with the experimental data.Fluidized bed separator uses physical characteristics of particles i.e., size, density, and shape for beneficiation of ores. Recently, lots of studies were carried out to understand the liquid–solid fluidized bed separation characteristics ( The heterogeneity of feed is so significant in mineral industries that the same ores from different mines differ in their properties ( Experiments were performed using iron ore, chromite, quartz, and coal samples with densities of 5100, 4100, 2600, and 1500 The schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in The mathematical model for expansion ratio ( Using these dimensionless parameters, expansion ratio ( The final equation can only be developed if constant “ The effects of different dimensionless parameters like velocity ratio ( The correlation graph of experimental expansion ratio versus dimensionless system parameters based on dimensional analysis as explained in Section A mathematical model has been developed by dimensional analysis using operating and design parameters of fluidizing system for predicting liquid–solid fluidized bed expansion ratio. Because of wide variation of properties of ores, in mineral processing industries, ore-specific fluidized bed separator would be required for the processing. The new model fits well with a large date set and thus can be used for scale up study to design the liquid–solid fluidized bed separator. The authors acknowledge the financial support given by
