Slugging flow in offshore oil & gas multi-phase transportation pipelines cause big challenges as the flow regime induces flow and pressure oscillations in the multi-phase pipelines. The negative impacts of the most severe slugs are significant and thus the elimination of slugging flow in the pipelines is a highly investigated topic. To eliminate the slug in an online manner real-time slug detection methods are often required. Traditionally topside pressure transmitters upstream a 3-phase separator have been used as the controlled variable. In this paper Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) has been examined as an alternative to the traditional pressure transmitters. A lab-scaled testing facility has been constructed in order to obtain test data from a ERT transmitter with 12 probes. Different flow regimes have been generated by a pump and a compressor where 2-phase flow can be tested. Based on the results the study concludes that the ERT is able to detect the slug very well when the oil and water is well mixed. Furthermore the traditional pressure transmitters have the limitation that pressure variations can be caused by other operating conditions than slug, such as change in the back pressure from control valves. The biggest limitation using ERT is the lack of ability to distinguish between gas and oil, and thus the ERT can only be used as an effective slug detect measurement when the oil-to-water ratio is low.
