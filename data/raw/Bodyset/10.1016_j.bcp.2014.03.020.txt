Isoquercitrin, a dietary phytoestrogen, is a potential stimulator of bone mineralization used for prophylaxis of osteoporotic disorders. Here we studied the combined effects of isoquercitrin, a cell membrane permeable 3-O-glucoside of quercetin, and polyphosphate [polyP], a naturally occurring inorganic polymer inducing bone formation, on mineralization of human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells. Both compounds isoquercitrin and polyP induce at non-toxic concentrations the mineralization process of SaOS-2 cells. Co-incubation experiments revealed that isoquercitrin (at 0.1 and 0.3μM), if given simultaneously with polyP (as Ca2+ salt; at 3, 10, 30 and 100μM) amplifies the mineralization-enhancing effect of the inorganic polymer. The biomineralization process induced by isoquercitrin and polyP is based on two different modes of action. After incubation of the cells with isoquercitrin or polyP the expression of the Runt-related transcription factor 2 [RUNX2] is significantly upregulated. In addition, isoquercitrin causes a strong increase of the steady-state-levels of the two co-activators of RUNX2, the activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6] and the Ets oncogene homolog 1 [Ets1]. The activating effect of isoquercitrin occurs via a signal transduction pathway involving ATF6, and by that, is independent from the induction cascade initiated by polyP. This conclusion is supported by the finding that isoquercitrin upregulates the expression of the gene encoding for osteocalcin, while polyP strongly increases the expression of the Ets1 gene and of the alkaline phosphatase. We show that the two compounds, polyP and isoquercitrin, have a co-enhancing effect on bone mineral formation and in turn might be of potential therapeutic value for prevention/treatment of osteoporosis.Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and a compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture (reviewed in It has been proposed that polyP, after hydrolysis to monomeric phosphate [P The extracellular level of phosphate can be modulated physiologically, by the action of the hydrolytically-acting enzymes, ALP and ENPP1, or pharmacologically It is the aim of the present study to determine the pharmacological effect of quercetin, acting as a stimulator for the mineralization process The published data show that quercetin causes an anabolic effect on SaOS-2 cells within the range of 1 and 5 In the present study, polyP and isoquercitrin individually, but particularly in combination, are shown to increase bone mineral formation in SaOS-2 cells and to have different modes of action Quercetin 3-β- SaOS-2 cells (human osteogenic sarcoma cells, If not mentioned otherwise the test compounds [isoquercitrin and polyP (Ca The cell density was determined by the colorimetric method based on the tetrazolium salt XTT (Cell Proliferation Kit II; Roche, Mannheim, Germany), following the recommendations of the supplier and as described Applying the Alizarin Red S spectrophotometry the extent of mineralization by SaOS-2 cells was determined quantitatively In one series of experiments the cultures, growing into culture wells were stained directly on the coverslips with 10% Alizarin Red S, after fixation with ethanol The technique of reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was applied to determine the levels of transcription of the following genes in SaOS-2 cells.

Since both compounds are genuine components in animal and plant food they might also be qualified to represent valuable nutritional components and useful therapeutic agents suitable for prevention/treatment of osteoporosis.
