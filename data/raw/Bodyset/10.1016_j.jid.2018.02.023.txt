Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare genetic condition primarily caused by hepatic ABCC6 transporter dysfunction. Most clinical manifestations of PXE are due to premature calcification of elastic fibers. However, the vascular impact of PXE is pleiotropic and remains ill defined. ABCC6 expression has recently been associated with cellular nucleotide export. We studied the impact of ABCC6 deficiency on blood levels of adenosine triphosphate and related metabolites and on soluble nucleotidase activities in PXE patients and Abcc6

                      mice. In addition, we investigated the expression of genes encoding ectocellular purinergic signaling proteins in mouse liver and aorta. Plasma adenosine triphosphate and pyrophosphate levels were significantly reduced in PXE patients and in Abcc6

                      mice. Consistent with alterations of purinergic signaling, the expression of genes involved in purine and phosphate transport/metabolism was dramatically modified in Abcc6

Our findings suggest that these alterations are linked to changes in extracellular nucleotide metabolism that are remote from the liver. This opens new perspectives for the understanding of PXE pathophysiology.Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) (OMIM Our understanding of the pathophysiology of inherited ectopic calcification evolved in the light of three rare diseases, namely, PXE, general arterial calcification of infancy due to NPP1 deficiency (OMIM The redundancy in the clinical presentations of these diseases together sheds light on the central role of extracellular nucleotide phosphohydrolysis in the Pi/PPi ratio. However, little information on the exact molecular function of ABCC6 has been identified. Beside calcifications, other cardiovascular manifestations are frequent in PXE, including peripheral arterial disease, which represents a major determinant of morbidity associated with PXE; ischemic stroke ( Although ectopic calcifications seem to clearly be due to a PPi deficit, structural, ischemic, thrombotic, and other nonmineralizing manifestations associated with PXE may indeed be independent of the mineralization process and extracellular PPi levels. Therefore, we evaluated the global changes in extracellular purine metabolism by measuring the expression of genes implicated in nucleotide and phosphate metabolism; enzymatic activities; and circulating nucleotide, nucleoside, and PPi levels in both PXE patients and the To evaluate circulating nucleotide and PPi concentrations in ABCC6 deficiency, we recruited PXE patients and age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals ( Soluble purine-converting enzymes are present in the bloodstream where they contribute, along with membrane-bound ecto-nucleotidases, to the metabolism of circulating nucleotides in the vasculature ( To evaluate the impact of the PXE condition on hepatic (central) and arterial (distal) gene expression, we used a quantitative real-time PCR approach on liver and thoracic aorta from WT and Gene expression levels showed important changes according to aging in the liver (76% of investigated genes, Volcano plots illustrate the global impact of Calcifications mostly caused by a lack of PPi ( Extracellular nucleotides and ADO (a nucleoside) act as autocrine/paracrine messengers through P2 and P1 membrane receptor activation, respectively ( ADO, through activation of specific P1 receptors, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and vasculoprotective action. A link between the ABCC6 transporter and ADO has indeed been evoked, because a 5′ nucleotidase (ADO-generating enzyme) gene mutation in ACDC causes ectopic calcifications similar to those of PXE ( Along with membrane-bound nucleotidases and other ectoenzymes, soluble purine-converting activities are constitutively present in the bloodstream, thereby representing an important auxiliary effector system for local regulation of purine levels in the vasculature ( An increase in CD73 AMPase activity could be responsible for enhanced AMP hydrolysis and normalized ADO plasma concentration despite reduced ATP and ADP levels in Several in vitro studies using skin fibroblasts with inactivating To evaluate in vivo the local and distal impacts of Abcc6 deficiency on purine and phosphate homeostasis-related gene expression, we used a transcriptomic approach that compared liver, an unaffected tissue expressing Abcc6, versus arteries, which are affected by the pathology but do not express Abcc6. We report that the expressions of 4 of the 46 investigated genes was modified in In the aorta of Finally, two genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis ( Overall, these molecular data suggest an alteration of specific gene expressions in In conclusion, we show here that ABCC6 loss of function has a profound impact on vascular purine metabolism through modified arterial gene expression, soluble nucleotidase activities, and, finally, circulating nucleotide levels. These results may bring some reconciliation between metabolic versus local influence in PXE etiology, because they associate modifications of both circulating factors and altered gene expression specifically in the affected tissue. Purinergic signaling alterations most likely contribute to thrombotic and low-grade inflammation associated with PXE, and the real impact of this disease on mitochondrial function and energy metabolism remains to be investigated. Moreover, the diagnostic and prognostic potential of 5′-nucleotidase in PXE warrants specific investigations. A deeper characterization of purinergic signaling alterations will open new perspectives in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PXE and might help identify new therapeutic targets.
