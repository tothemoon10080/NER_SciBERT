Using the self-designed testing system, the seepage tests for cemented broken rocks were conducted, and the impact of different factors on water-resisting ability was analyzed. The results show that (1) seepage process of the cemented broken rocks can be divided into two categories: in one category, seepage instability occurs after a period of time, in the other, the permeability decreases slowly and tends to be stable, and seepage instability does not occur; (2) cementing performance of cementing agent and grain size distribution are the decisive factors for water-resisting ability, with the increase of cementing performance and the mass percentage of large grains, the water-resisting ability of the specimen strengthens; (3) aggregate type has little effect on seepage stability, for the specimens with different aggregate types, the permeability and the duration of seepage instability have small difference; (4) initial porosity has a certain effect on the water-resisting ability of the specimen, but has no decisive role. With the increase of the initial porosity, the duration of seepage instability decreases.
