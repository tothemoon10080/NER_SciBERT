A method of computation of an accelerating blade profile of a centrifugal rotor-impact mill, providing maximal absolute particle velocity, was developed. The effect of friction coefficient on the optimal blade profile was studied. A comparison of calculated optimal blade profiles with both straight-linear and log-spiral ones was carried out. The calculated optimal profiles enabled significant increase in particle velocities.
