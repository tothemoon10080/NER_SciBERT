Deformation experiments on natural peridotite from the Almklovdalen complex, Norway, were carried out in a Griggs-type apparatus at temperatures of 20, 300, and 600°C, confining pressures of 1.0 to 2.5GPa, and strain rates of 3·10−6 to 8·10−5
                     s−1. The experiments yield maximum differential stresses in the range of 1.0 to 2.9GPa falling mostly between Byerlee's law and Goetze's criterion and thus indicating semi-brittle behaviour. Whereas strength of samples deformed at 20°C increases significantly with increasing confining pressure, a systematic pressure-dependence of strength is not obvious at 300 and 600°C. The intracrystalline deformation features of the main constituent olivine were analysed by light and electron microscopic techniques (SEM/EBSD, TEM). Deformation microstructures systematically vary with temperature, but are insensitive to confining pressure. Samples deformed at 20°C reflect predominantly brittle failure by intragranular microcracks and shear zones. Microstructures from samples deformed at higher temperatures show evidence of low-temperature plasticity of olivine in the form of pronounced undulatory extinction associated with high dislocation densities. Pile-up of dislocations leads to the formation of either fracture arrays at 300°C or deformation lamellae parallel (100) and cellular structures at 600°C, indicating intragranular work hardening. A gradual increase in glide-controlled crystal–plastic deformation of olivine at increasing temperature is interpreted to be responsible for the variation in mechanical behaviour and microstructural characteristics. The mechanical data and microstructural observations consistently suggest a temperature for the transition from the strength-controlling dominance of brittle to crystal–plastic deformation mechanisms close to 600°C. The tested peridotite samples show a lower strength than quartzite samples at comparable experimental conditions, possibly related to crystallographic differences of olivine and quartz. The agreement between microfabrics of experimentally and naturally deformed peridotites demonstrates the importance of low-temperature plasticity of olivine during high-stress deformation at lithospheric conditions related in particular to seismic activity in the mantle.The oceanic lithosphere is generally considered to have a fairly simple composition compared to continental lithosphere. When formed at mid-ocean ridges, the volumetrically lesser part, oceanic crust, is originally composed of basaltic rocks that overlie depleted peridotites, i.e., aggregates dominated by the mineral olivine containing also some orthopyroxene. Subsequent serpentinisation due to water circulation may alter oceanic lithosphere, though, with a significant effect on elastic ( The nucleation of an earthquake requires instability in frictional sliding on a pre-existent or evolving fault plane. In agreement with the depth distribution of earthquake hypocentres, experiments on olivine-gouge indicate that the 600 The correlation between the occurrence and absence of seismic activity and the temperature distribution in oceanic lithosphere strongly suggests a temperature-controlled change in deformation mode from brittle faulting to plastic flow. The transition from seismic to aseismic behaviour likely occurs just before the maximum lithospheric differential stresses are reached, at the transition from the brittle to the semi-brittle regime (e.g., The objective of our study is to constrain the high-stress deformation behaviour of peridotites at lithospheric conditions and to investigate the associated strength-controlling deformation mechanisms at grain scale. While the occurrence of an instability requires strain or velocity softening, the prime pre-requisite for an earthquake is that actual stresses are high in a relative sense, i.e., that they reach the strength of the involved rocks. Thus, the mechanical behaviour of peridotite at maximum possible stresses is especially relevant for understanding deformation associated with seismic activity in the mantle, e.g. during oceanic intraplate earthquakes and earthquakes in downgoing slabs or in the mantle wedge of subduction zones. Well founded constraints on maximum stresses ultimately also improve thermal models for oceanic lithosphere ( Triaxial deformation experiments were performed in a servohydraulically-controlled solid-medium Griggs-type deformation apparatus ( Two types of deformation pistons were used during the experiments, a one-piece tungsten carbide piston and a two-piece piston composed of tungsten carbide at the top glued to dense sintered Al The hit-point is graphically determined as the intersection of the two trend lines for dynamic friction and elastic deformation for strain analysis ( Thin sections (~ The arrangement and density of dislocations were analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in a Philips EM301 microscope operated at 100 The coarse-grained (0.2 to 1 The stress–strain curves do not indicate an unstable stress drop at any condition, but exhibit similar shapes at all conditions ( The maximum differential stresses reached in experiments at confining pressures of 1.0 and 1.5 Consistent with the mechanical data, microstructures of all experimentally deformed samples show evidence of both brittle and crystal–plastic deformation notably of all constituting minerals. Intragranular microcracks constitute the most pronounced deformation feature in olivine and orthopyroxene grains at all deformation conditions. Olivine grains show undulatory extinction, especially in direct vicinity to fractures and in shear zones ( Microcracks occur in a variety of orientations, commonly in conjugate sets with an angle of 30 to 45° to the shortening axis ( In the following, we focus on the intracrystalline features in the main constituent olivine as found after deformation at the different temperatures. The observed dislocation densities after deformation are on the order of 10 In samples deformed at 20 In samples deformed at 300 Deformation lamellae in olivine parallel (100) are restricted to samples deformed at 600 Simulating conditions of lithospheric mantle for polycrystalline rocks currently mandates usage of deformation apparatus transmitting pressure to the sample by a solid medium. The finite strength of the employed confining media constitutes a substantial limit below which sample strength cannot be resolved. Here, the peridotite samples exhibit high strengths well above the stress resolution limit of our Griggs-type apparatus. Indeed, our results for 20 The differences in strength of the varieties of peridotite examined in laboratory tests are likely dominated by compositional differences (as is the sample to sample variation in our study) and differences in grain size apart from uncertainties associated with the various employed techniques. The role of the amount of pyroxene and chlorite present is unresolved, while in general the degree of serpentinisation has been shown to weaken peridotites significantly ( Intragranular microcracks occur in olivine grains deformed at all temperatures ( Deformation lamellae are present in olivine deformed at 600 Tangled dislocations bounding 3-dimensional cells are formed during deformation at 600 The arrangement of dislocations and the absence of any evidence for the development of subgrain boundaries indicate that the rate of dislocation climb is insufficient to allow recovery at the explored deformation conditions — in accord with reports on microstructures from other low-temperature experiments on peridotites or olivine crystals. The dominance of dislocation glide-controlled deformation of olivine at low temperature was previously inferred from the occurrence of deformation lamellae, undulatory extinction and kink bands ( In summary, the observed olivine microstructures reflect microcracking and glide-controlled deformation with work hardening for the cellular structure and the pile-up of dislocations leading to the formation of either fracture arrays or deformation lamellae parallel (100) depending on temperature. These associated brittle and crystal–plastic mechanisms and the absence of an indication of recovery are consistent with low-temperature plasticity. In this section, we combine the microstructural observations with the mechanical data to discuss the deformation behaviour of the peridotites. Observed strength values and microstructures consistently show a marked dependence on temperature ( 20 300 600 The pressure-dependence of strength and the microstructures indicate that microcracking is the strength-controlling mechanism during deformation at 20 For conventional lithospheric strength envelopes, the strength of the uppermost mantle is usually modelled by the rheology of olivine, whereas the strength of the lower crust of continental lithosphere is modelled by the rheology of quartz (e.g., The deformation behaviour and the microstructures of quartz-aggregates and peridotites in experiments show similarities, but at comparable conditions the absolute strength of quartzites appears higher than that found here for peridotite ( Grain size is also an important factor in brittle as well as plastic deformation. A larger grain size is expected to result in a lower strength, as suggested by the Griffith theory (e.g., Our experiments provide microstructural criteria to identify deformation of natural peridotites at high stresses such as associated with major earthquakes in the oceanic lithosphere, e.g., during oceanic intraplate earthquakes and earthquakes in downgoing slabs or in the mantle wedge of subduction zones (e.g., We constrained a temperature of about 600 The agreement between flow laws derived from indentation experiments on single crystals ( Based on the correlation between mechanical behaviour and microstructural development during the deformation experiments the following conclusions can be drawn: The peridotites show semi-brittle behaviour at all experimental conditions. Consistent with the mechanical data, the microstructures of the samples show evidence of brittle and crystal–plastic deformation. In experiments at 20 A gradually increased influence of crystal–plastic deformation of olivine at higher temperatures is interpreted to be responsible for the different mechanical behaviour (reduced strength, weak pressure-dependence of strength) and variations in microstructural characteristics (undulatory extinction, high dislocation density, microcracks, deformation lamellae, cellular structure). Pile-up of dislocations leads to the formation of fracture arrays at 300 The mechanical data and microstructural observations consistently suggest a temperature for the transition from the strength-controlling dominance of brittle to crystal–plastic deformation mechanisms close to 600 Thus, glide-controlled deformation of olivine in the regime of low-temperature plasticity is likely the strength-controlling mechanism during high-stress deformation of peridotite at lithospheric conditions. The mechanical behaviour and the microstructural characteristics for deformation of peridotites compare well to those reported from experimental deformation of quartzites. Yet, the strength of peridotite is lower compared to the strength of quartzite at low temperature and high stresses, which may be related to a lower strength of olivine compared to quartz during glide-controlled deformation in the low-temperature plasticity regime, because of crystallographic differences between the strength-controlling minerals (the neosilicate olivine and the tectosilicate quartz, respectively). For dislocation glide of quartz, Si-O bonds have to be broken, in contrast to glide along (010) for olivine. Our work directly supports the inference regarding the role of olivine plasticity in the absence of seismicity at temperatures above about 600 The work was funded by the
