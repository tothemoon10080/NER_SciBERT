Pyrites can be oxidized by the bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (At. f.), producing H2SO4 and FeSO4. Rock phosphate is dissolved by H2SO4, forming soluble phosphorus. Fe2+ in FeSO4 is oxidized to Fe3+, producing energy to sustain the growth of At. f. The effects of four factors (rock phosphate dosage, pyrite dosage, culture temperature and time) on the fraction of phosphorous leached were investigated. It is suggested that the optimal conditions are as follows: rock phosphate dosage 1g/L, pyrite dosage 30g/L, culture temperature 30Â°C, culture time 84h. The fraction of phosphorous leached is up to 11.8%.The bio-leaching of ores has been widely developed recently, and is successfully applied to copper sulfide ores, uranium ores, and for the pre-oxidation of refractory gold ores, etc. ( The bacterium The strain of  A proper volume of inocula of active Based on Section  As can be seen from  As can be seen from  When pyrites act as substrates, Pyrites are oxidized by Financial support for this work by the Key Project Foundation of the Education Department(Z200515002) in Hubei Province, PR China, Hubei Key Laboratory of Novel Chemical Reactor and Green Chemical Technology, PR China, is gratefully acknowledged.
