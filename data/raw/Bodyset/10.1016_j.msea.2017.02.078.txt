The cyclic quenching with both the rapid heating and cooling was applied on 51CrV4 spring steels by a DIL805A/D dilatometer. The microstructures were observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM), whereas the strengthening mechanism of the test steels was discussed by the general equation of

                     . The results demonstrated that the grain size was the lowest with only 1.76µm, the area fraction of the twins was the highest up to 6.78% and the thickness of the twins was fined to 11.71nm at six times. Also, an excellent comprehensive performance was obtained, such as the yield strength, the tensile strength and the area reduction of the test steels was increased substantially as the cyclic quenching was conducted from 1 to 6 times, where the maximum values were up to 1792.93MPa, 2036.2MPa and 44%, respectively. As a result, the strength increase was mainly attributed to the ultra-refine grain formation, the area fraction increase of the micro-nano scale twins and the size refinement decrease; whereas it was observed that the highest contribution to the strength and ductility was from the micro-nano scale twins.Recently, the nano-twin materials have received an extensive attention due to the corresponding excellent properties. As an example, the hardness of the cubic boron nitride with ultra-fine nano-twins is higher than conventional materials and similar to the hardness of diamond It is well known that the formation of twins is related to the stacking fault energy of the material atomic plane and it is proven difficult for twin or nano-twin with high stacking fault energy to be formed. Therefore, the extensive studies on twins or nano-twins were mainly focused on metals and intermetallic compounds with low stacking fault energy. Besides, almost no reports exist concerning the methods of twins or nano-twins formation and the effects of the micro-nano scale twins on the mechanical properties in materials with high stacking fault energy. In this paper, the 51CrV4 spring steel was utilized for the effects of ultra-refine grains and micro-nano twins on mechanic properties to be investigated, whereas the relationship between the nano scale twins and the mechanical properties of strength and ductility was discussed. The commercial hot-rolled spring steel was utilized in the present study. The chemical composition of the experimental steel was detected by a TASMAN directreading spark spectrometer, as presented in Firstly, the Secondly, the cyclic quenching was designed according to the phase transformation point, with the heat treatment parameters being provided in Thirdly, the uniaxial tension and hardness tests of the test steels were executed on a MTS tensile tester and a HV-1000 micro-hardness tester, respectively. Additionally, the effects of grain refinement, second phase particles and micro-nano scale twins on the strength and ductility were investigated. Finally, the Optical microscopy, the SEM and the TEM were utilized for the micro-structural characterization. The grain size and the distribution of the second phase particles were observed by the high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM-SUPRA40). Also, the second phase particles size and the distance between the adjacent particles were counted in the SEM images. Moreover, the thin foils, which were further mechanically grinded to below 50 The effects of the cyclic quenching times on both the grain size and hardness are presented in  The SEM observations in The samples treated by 1, 3 and 6 quenching times were selected for the distribution analysis of the twins by TEM, as presented in The strengthening increase in the test steels was determined by the combined effects of three strengthening mechanisms (second phases strengthening, grain refinement strengthening and micro-nano twin strengthening), whereas the general equation The aforementioned calculations demonstrated the combined effects of the second phase, grain refinement and micro-nano twin strengthening at various cycle quenching times in The micro-nano twins played an important role in the tested steel strengthening, due to the refinement of the micro-nano twin size and the increase of the micro-nano twin area fraction. It was reported that the tensile strength (  It is well known that the grain refinement strengthening is the most effective strengthening method for the mechanical properties improvement of materials, which improves both the strength and the ductility of the materials. In this work, the grain refinement played an important role in the area reduction( It was easy to be observed that the grain refinement amplitude of times 1–3 was higher by 43.2% than the times 3–6 by 11.1%. On the contrary, the area fraction amplitude of the micro-nano twins was lower by 11.7% in the first stage, whereas the amplitude in the second stage reached up to 88.3%, as presented in The effects of the micro-nano twins on the ductility were discussed from the area fraction and thickness of the twins, as presented in The 51CrV4 spring steel was utilized for the effects of grain size and micro-nano scale twins on both the strength and ductility study. Based on the results, the following conclusions were extracted: The grain size, which was firstly decreased and consequently increased as the number of cycle quenching times increased, was the lowest by only 1.76 The yield strength, the tensile strength and the area reduction in the tested steels increased substantially as the cyclic quenching times increased from 1 to 6, where the maximum values at the sixth time were up to 1792.93 The strength increase in the tested steels was determined by the combined effects of three strengthening mechanisms, whereas the incremental contribution percentages of The relationship between the “ The research documented in this work was financially supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
