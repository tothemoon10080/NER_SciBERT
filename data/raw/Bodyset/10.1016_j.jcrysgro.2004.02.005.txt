                     O3 powder materials doped with Eu3+ using different concentration from x=0 to 2 were prepared by a new sol-lyophilization synthesis and fiber single crystal (Gd2O3–Gd2O3/Eu3+) oxides were grown using laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) technique. X-ray powder diffraction performed at room temperature showed that the materials obtained by lyophilization technique are cubic, lies in the nanometer range and different from bulk materials. The materials are a continued solid solution and the lattice parameter a-axis increases with Eu3+ concentration. The fibers grown by LHPG technique were single crystal, transparent, red in color when Eu3+ concentration is high, and the structure is monoclinic for Eu3+<15%. The luminescence of Eu3+ from C2 crystallographic site was been detected. In the case of nano-particles oxide, an additional peak in emission spectral is obtained at λ=610nm. The influence of Eu3+, particles sizes and the structure on the luminescence spectral of Eu3+ ions was been described.Our research group is involved in crystal growth materials for optical application using different crystal growth techniques and recently we extended our research topics to the design and synthesis of nanoparticles luminescent inorganic materials doped with RE Single crystal fibers were grown using CO X-ray diffraction diagrams were carried out using a D5000 Siemens diffractometer with Cu-Kα Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out using a Philips microscope operating at 20 Using LHPG technique we have grown, under air atmosphere, undoped and Eu We extend our experiment to the utilization of a new lyophilization synthesis method. The initially obtained material is a slightly crystallized Eu  Emission spectra were performed for Gd The emission We have used two different methods to prepare Eu
