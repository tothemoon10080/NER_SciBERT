Diaphyseal fractures involving the radius and ulna, so called “both-bone” or “double-bone” forearm fractures are common orthopedic injuries. These injuries can result in significant loss of function if inadequately treated. As the upper extremity serves to position the hand in space, loss of forearm motion and/or muscle imbalance resulting from a poorly treated fracture can be particularly debilitating. Preservation of the anatomic relationships of the proximal and distal radioulnar joints as well as the interosseous space is critical to preserving function. This article overviews the management of diaphyseal fractures of the radius and ulna in adults.
