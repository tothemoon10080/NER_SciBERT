The study is about pre-treatment of water by O3-based AOPs as O3/UV, O3/ultrasound (O3/US), O3/H2O2, O3/UV/US and O3/US/FeSO4 to remove residuals of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals and to propose a simple modification to an existing drinking water treatment plant (WTP) containing a pre-ozonation unit. Experiments were run in ultrapure and raw water (collected from the aeration tank of the WTP) spiked with 30μM Diclofenac-Na (DCF)-the model compound to represent anti-inflammatory medication. The results showed that the most effective test processes were O3/US/UV and O3/US/Fe2+ (at 2–8mgL−1 O3, 861kHz US, 254nm UV irradiation) that were significantly more effective than ozonation alone or other combinations. The outcome was attributed to the synergy of excess mass transfer and OH radical formation rates, and the presence of additional reaction routes and species. As such, 10-min pre-treatment of pure water by O3/UV/US and O3/US/Fe2+ provided nearly 90% DCF conversion; 26% and 46% mineralization, respectively. The efficiency of the processes for conversion in raw water was slightly lower, but that of mineralization was appreciably higher (55% and 58%, respectively) to be attributed to the synergy of combinations causing the interaction of excited NOM fragments with the intermediate products of DCF, followed by oxidative degradation of all to yield CO2. Coagulation/flocculation of the pretreated streams (of raw water) with alum and without chemicals respectively provided DCF-free water and about 65% DOC mineralization. Hence, integration of the existing water treatment facility with either of the above processes is an excellent option to destroy anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical residues such as DCF and to provide appreciable DOC elimination, thus reducing the likelihood of THM formation in the distribution system. An additional benefit offered by the second process using a ferrous salt was that it allowed for a chemical-free coagulation basin.The presence of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in surface water is due to rapid excretion of the parent compounds and metabolites with urine (to domestic sewage), their low degree of decomposition in sewage treatment facilities and continuous discharge through landfills and wet weather run-off Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) are excellent alternatives for integration with classical water treatment operations via their potential to destroy a wide range of organic chemicals by reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH Ozonation is a well-known process for eliminating pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater treatment plants The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the following processes as pre-treatment options for partial or complete destruction of anti-inflammatory medication in water: (1) ozonation: (i) single (O Owing to its superfluous consumption records and aquatic toxicity, Diclofenac-Na was selected as the test compound to represent the selected group of pharmaceuticals. The formulation is very popular with its availability without prescription and effectiveness in the relief of rheumatic and arthritic pains Diclofenac-Na salt (C HPLC grade acetonitrile, KH All AOP experiments were carried out in a high-frequency plate-type ultrasonic reactor (250 DCF was analyzed by HPLC using a Shimadzu LC-20AT HPLC with a 20A UV–vis photo diode array detector set at 254 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was analyzed by a Shimadzu TOC-V CSH analyzer after filtration of the treated solutions through a 0.45 Two types of test samples were used throughout the experiments: (i) S1: samples of Milli-Q water (MQW) spiked with 30 The experimental method consisted of the following phases: Ozonation of S1 and S2 at varying ozone test concentrations and time periods to select and optimize the aqueous ozone concentration and contact time. Process symbol is P0. Ozonation of S1, S2 and S3 at the selected conditions with: H Sonication of S1, S2 and S3 in the presence of H Coagulation/flocculation of P0-, P3-, P4-, P5- and P6-pretreated samples of S2 followed by gravity settling at pH 6.5. Additionally, P5-pretreated samples (of S2) were exposed to coagulation/flocculation at pH 9.0. In single ozonation experiments ozone contact times and concentrations were selected as 3, 5, 10 Treatability experiments were run in 250 DCF is a highly soluble acidic pharmaceutical (50 The critical operation parameters affecting the efficiency of O We found that the efficiency of oxidation in 3-min was not strongly affected by the water matrix as it was nearly the same in both samples, varying between 20% and 28% in proportion to the applied ozone concentration. Mineralization during the same period was around 6.4–11.0% and slightly higher in S2, due to a larger initial DOC and the likely production of some reactive species via oxidation of NOM by molecular ozone, as also reported in literature The efficiency of conversion was appreciably increased in S2 to 47% and that of mineralization to 17% by extending the contact time to 10 The data in  The last two processes (P4 and P5), in which oxidation is mediated by reactions with OH Analysis of the reaction kinetics showed that the rates obeyed pseudo-first order law during early contact, at which the reactions were considerably faster in MQW (S1) particularly under P2, P3, P4 and P5, as depicted by the fitted curves in The second chart in The outstanding performance of P5 is based on the synergy of ultrasound and catalytic ozonation that lead to enhanced rate of ozone diffusion and decomposition to yield radicals such as The second experimental phase involved sonication in the presence of H A very low degree of mineralization in S2 under US/UV is surprising, because the process was highly effective for the conversion of DCF. The result reconfirms our previous comment on the hydrophilic nature of NOM (that prevents its diffusion near the gaseous cavity bubbles) and earlier studies reporting low degrees of NOM oxidation by UV-254, which is mainly absorbed by aromatic and conjugated fragments Changes in the UV–vis spectra of the samples during reaction showed that under US/UV application the absorption at 254 A very good indicator of raw water treatability by coagulation/flocculation is the value of SUVA, which provides information about the distribution of organic matter (NOM) as hydrophobic/hydrophilic, low/high molecular weight and low/high charge density properties It was found that the selected pre-treatment operations led to significant enhancements in the expected removal of DOC by coagulation as depicted in In accordance, we propose that the pre-ozonation unit of the WTP is operated simultaneously with either of the following: (i) US/UV; (ii) US/Fe Relative efficiencies of lab-scale batch operations by O The study has shown that the presence of pharmaceutical residues such as DCF in natural or surface water can be managed by integrating the existing WTPs with an O We appreciate the financial support by Bogazici University Research Fund to the Project 12Y00D8.
