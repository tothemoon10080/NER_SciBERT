Today, comprehension of supersaturated phenomena in protein solution is one of the most important issue. For example, elucidation of amyloid fibril formation process which is known as a main causative agent causing Alzheimer disease[1] or bio-mineralization process of CaCO[2]. In a recent study, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) for crystallization process of CaCO3 was conducted by A.F. Wallace et al[3]. They simulated that the supersaturated solution has a local metastable state as a microscopic ion cluster (we called nano supersaturated network). On the other hand, until now, an experimental detection system for the nano supersaturated network has not been established so far. In our study, we utilized Diffracted X-ray Tracking (DXT) as a high time resolution (25µs) and high positional accuracy (-pm) detection system for the time resolved dynamical interactions between a single gold nanocrystal(-80nm) and localized prenucleation clusters as a nano supersaturated network at SPring-8(BL40XU). For the target samples, we choose two samples that are the sodium acetate trihydrate and lysozyme supersaturated solution as an inorganic and protein solution system, respectively. From DXT result, we succeeded in observing the localized high and low speed motions of gold nanocrystals interacted with nano supersaturated protein's networks. At this presentation, I explain the DXT method and obtained physical parameters of nano supersaturated networks in inorganic and protein supersaturated solution system from DXT analysis. In finally, I present a comprehensive model of nano supersaturated networks. References [1] Yoshimura Y et al. PNAS, 109 14446-51 (2012). [2] M.E Marsh et al.
