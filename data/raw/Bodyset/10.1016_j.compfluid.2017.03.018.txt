It is demonstrated that the use of an optimized computational domain and mesh resolution (10 spanwise mesh layers to resolve only a half of a pair of the 3D mode) can reduce the computational cost significantly and yet retain adequate accuracy.

It is well known that the flow is governed by a single dimensionless parameter Many early experimental studies have focused on identifying the critical Reynolds number In contrast to the linear stability analysis results, there has been considerable scatter in reported In light of these earlier works, the primary aim of this study is to examine the ability of 3D DNS based on the FVM formulation to accurately predict In an effort to reduce the high computational costs associated with achieving accurate prediction of Since the numerical accuracy and computational cost for the prediction of For other bluff body configurations, e.g. a square cylinder Numerical simulations have been carried out with OpenFOAM ( The computational domain and mesh are determined based on a thorough domain size and mesh resolution dependence study reported separately in Jiang et al. Some key parameters for the standard 3D mesh are specified as follows. A hexahedral computational domain of 50 The boundary conditions adopted in the present study are the same as those used in Jiang et al. The time step ∆ In a previous 3D DNS study by Jiang et al. To improve the precision of the prediction of It is seen in The gradual variations of the spanwise velocity amplitude with time, which represent the gradual convergence or development of the ordered Mode A flow, can be quantified by curve fitting upper and lower envelopes of the time-history of the spanwise velocity in the form of: The cases with As shown in In order to accommodate only a half of a pair of the Mode A structure, the spanwise domain length In order to simulate only a half of a pair of the Mode A structure, symmetry boundary conditions (rather than periodic boundary conditions) are applied at the lateral boundaries perpendicular to the cylinder span. Based on the above modified mesh and the curve-fitting method introduced in The predicted It is suspected that the We then plot and curve-fit the variation of In It is seen from In addition to the mesh resolution in the The influence of the mesh resolution in the spanwise direction on The dependence of The dependence of The computational costs for the cases with ( It is seen in It is also seen in Based on ( It is also seen in Recall that for the mesh dependence study results shown in To extend on the prediction of The neutral curve for the secondary instability predicted by the present 3D DNS is shown in The accuracy of the neutral curve predicted through DNS is improved by taking into account the effect of mesh resolution in the Similarly, for other bluff body flows and other more general flows involving a secondary wake instability characterized by a 3D wake mode with a specific Plot the neutral curve based on a mesh that is less refined in the Improve the accuracy of the neutral curve by taking into account the influence of mesh resolution in the It is worth noting that the neutral curves obtained through DNS and linear stability analysis are slightly different. For example, as shown in In the present DNS, a half of a pair of Mode A is observed for This paper presents a systematic investigation on the prediction of the critical Reynolds number It is also demonstrated that the use of an optimized computational domain and mesh resolution (10 spanwise mesh layers to resolve only a half of a pair of the 3D mode) can reduce the computational cost significantly and yet retain adequate accuracy. The most accurate To the authors’ knowledge, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutral curve for the secondary wake instability can be predicted through 3D DNS with a reasonable computational cost, and the results are in close agreement with the neutral curves determined by previous linear stability analysis. Furthermore, it is important to note that the DNS approach actually predicts the onset points for an unforced secondary instability (with spontaneously generated wake structures) under different span lengths, which are in line with the neutral curves forced to one or more pairs of wake structures but truncated at their first intersection.
