Honeycomb-like structure MgO is prepared from low grade magnesite by a technology including four main steps: calcination of low grade magnesite, carbonization treatment of the calcined magnesite, thermal decomposition of Mg(HCO3)2 and calcination of basic magnesium carbonate. In this study, the main experimental parameters of carbonization treatment and thermal decomposition were optimized. The carbonization conversion ratio of the calcined magnesite was 93% by controlling the ratio of solid and liquid (calcined ore/water) at 10g/L, carbonization time at 45min and CO2 gas flow rate at 0.08m3/h. Decomposition ratio of Mg(HCO3)2 in solution can reach 88% at 50°C for 60min via fixing stirring speed at 600r/min and the Mg2+ content in filtrate at 8g/L. Honeycomb-like structure MgO product with purity of 99% was eventually obtained by calcining basic magnesium carbonate at 800°C for 2h. The decomposition of basic magnesium carbonate was depicted by TGA. The MgO product was characterized by XRD and SEM.The magnesite in China is the richest in the world, and its total reserve reaches up to 31 Low grade magnesite from Northeast, China was firstly calcined in a shaft kiln at 700 Low grade magnesite was firstly calcined in a shaft kiln at 700 The employed carbonization device is shown in      The original magnesite was firstly crushed and ground to a smaller particle size with 0.15 The flow rate of CO When CO The generation of With CO Maintaining solid/liquid ratio at 12 When CO With decomposition temperature of 80 Maintaining stirring speed at 600 Fixing the stirring speed at 600 Initial TG–DTG experiment was conducted under the non-isothermal heating rate of 15 The XRD pattern of the MgO product is given in The morphology of the prepared sample is characterized by SEM.
