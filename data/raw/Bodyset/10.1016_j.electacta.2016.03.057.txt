The degradation of two representative ionic liquids, 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, has been studied in 100cm3 of aqueous sulfate medium of pH 3.0 by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) like anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO-H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF). The electrolytic cell contained a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an air diffusion cathode. The main oxidants were hydroxyl radicals formed at the anode surface from water discharge and in the bulk from Fenton’s reaction between generated H2O2 and added Fe2+. The solutions of both compounds underwent an almost total mineralization with 97% and 94% of dissolved organic abatement by the most powerful PEF at high current density, being similar and slightly lower for AO-H2O2 and EF, respectively. At low current density, the pyridinium-based ionic liquid showed similar mineralization rate by AO-H2O2 and PEF, whereas the imidazolium-based ionic liquid was more rapidly degraded in the sequence: AO-H2O2
                     <EF<PEF, where the positive effect of UVA irradiation in PEF was more apparent. The current efficiency decreased gradually with increasing current density in all EAOPs and its value was always superior for the latter compound. The NO3

Plausible reaction sequences for the mineralization of the cation of each ionic liquid including all detected products are proposed.Ionic liquids are salts with melting points below 100 Over the last two decades, a large number of chemicals, pesticides, dyes and pharmaceuticals as recalcitrant and/or toxic pollutants in wastewaters have been effectively degraded by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) such as anodic oxidation (AO), electro-Fenton (EF) and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) AO is the simplest and most common EAOP utilized for water remediation. This procedure consists in the application of a high EAOPs utilize carbonaceous cathodes to continuously supply H To know the mineralization ability of EAOPs on common ionic liquids in waters, we have undertaken the degradation of 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, representatives of pyridinium- and imidazolium-based ionic liquids, respectively. In this paper, we present the results obtained in the comparative treatment of 100 1-Butyl-4-methylpyridinium chloride (>97% purity) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (98% purity) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions were prepared with ultrapure water from a Millipore Milli-Q system with resistivity >18 Electrolytic trials were performed at lab scale with a cylindrical, open and undivided two-electrode cell of 100 Solutions with 0.83 The solution pH was determined with a Crison GLP 22 pH-meter. The samples withdrawn from the EF and PEF trials were alkalinized to stop the The mineralization of treated solutions was monitored from their DOC abatement, measured on a Shimadzu VCSN TOC analyzer. Aliquots of 50 Carboxylic acids produced during electrolytic trials were detected and quantified by ion-exclusion HPLC using a Waters 600 LC fitted with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX 87H, 300 Inorganic ions were analyzed by ion chromatography upon injection of 25 Heteroaromatic products generated at short electrolysis times of the PEF treatment of a 0.83 Blank experiments were initially performed to assess the stability of a 0.83 The above liquid ionic solution was further treated by AO-H  The operating parameter The nitrogenated inorganic ions released at the end of all the treatments at Based on this reaction, the current efficiencies for the trials of Furthermore, the H On the other hand, the Cl Results of Generated carboxylic acids such as maleic, acetic and oxalic were detected during the mineralization process of the above 0.83  LC-MS analysis of the treated solution at short electrolysis times of PEF at Several blank trials were carried out with a 1.39  The effect of increasing  From the aforementioned results, the total mineralization of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation to carbon dioxide and NO The MCE values for the assays given in The enhancement of Cl Ion-exclusion HPLC analysis of the degraded 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride solution only revealed the production of oxalic acid as final short-linear carboxylic acid. This is not surprising because the parent molecule has two Apart from oxalic acid, two heteroaromatic products and three hydroxylated derivatives were identified by LC-MS at short electrolysis times of the PEF treatment of the above solution at It has been shown that EAOPs with a BDD/air-diffusion cell are viable to decontaminate acidic aqueous solutions of two representative ionic liquids, 1-butyl-4-methylpyridinium chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride.
