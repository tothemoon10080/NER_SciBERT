Biohydrogen production has been demonstrated only at the laboratory scale, and the yield of H2 from any of the tested processes is still low for commercial application. Therefore, much scientific research is needed to address the issue of increasing biohydrogen production rate. For that, in this work, through a brief review of the literature and laboratory data, several genetic modification targets for microalgae hydrogen production enhancement are identified. As a result, a mathematical correlation, with dependence on the process variables, is proposed to calculate the resulting effect on H2 production rate after genetically modifying the microalgae species. The proposed correlation gives an initial assessment on how wild and genetically modified species compare to each other, therefore providing possible means for a consistent strategy for sustainable biohydrogen supply. A simplified mathematical model is proposed for a well stirred photobioreactor based on the species conservation principle. Microalgae growth was simulated for 15 days, showing how a set of microalgae genetic modifications affects H2 production either in combination or individually. For that, a chloroplast targeted total genetic modification parameter was defined, ξ
                     
                        T
                     . The H2 mass production efficiency, η, increasing rate is high up to ξ
                     
                        T
                     
                     ≈4, showing a trend to stabilization thereafter at η
                     ≅10 %, thus there is a value for ξ
                     
                        T
                     , beyond which it is not worth it to increase, since the H2 production is limited by the amount of biomass present in the medium, ξ

Therefore, the model is expected to be an important and simple tool for design, control and optimization of microalgae derived hydrogen processes.frequency factors or pre-exponential values, h coefficients for each algae species mass concentration, kg m activation energy, kJ mol specific specular radiation, W m constants, Eq. extinction coefficient, m constant exponent for the microalgae species total number of genetic modifications percent decay per day of the O photosynthetically active radiation, W m radius, m universal gas constant, 8.317 kJ kmol stoichiometric coefficient for generating species a as species b is produced time, s medium temperature, K mass fraction, kg of component/kg of medium specific coefficients for each algae species maintenance rate, s microalgae biomass consumption rate, s specific growth rate, s genetic modification factor density, kg m average microalgae biomass aerobic stage anaerobic stage species type; type of genetic modification affinity with solar radiation maximum cultivation medium all other substances that compose the medium besides microalgae and H sun total photobioreactor transparent tube initial condition; photobioreactor tube surface The search for sustainable and clean fuels has moved important research groups in a race against time and in favor of the planet. In this scenario, hydrogen emerges as one of the most promising fuel alternatives since: i) H One possible production technology to pursue is the so-called biohydrogen, which has become attractive due to its potential as a sustainable alternative to conventional methods for H Competing with biohydrogen, there are other possible renewable hydrogen producing processes such as water electrolysis, thermolysis, and photoelectrolysis, directly from fresh or salty water, i.e., without using fossil fuel derived hydrocarbons The biological processes, differently from the chemical and electrochemical ones, are catalyzed by microorganisms in water at ambient temperature and pressure, through the action of enzymes called hydrogenases. Additionally, that methodology is adequate for a possible future context of distributed power generation, wherever biomass and residues exist close to the plant site, which in turn has the potential to reduce transport and energy costs. Such processes are usually accomplished by different anaerobic bacteria and microalgae. The characteristics of those organisms are quite different among one another, with respect to the processes substrates and conditions. The advantages and disadvantages of each one of them have been thoroughly discussed by the scientific community at the laboratory scale, but tested methodologies for biohydrogen industrial production are not yet available A possible classification for the studies that address microalgae derived hydrogen is: i) biological, which seek a better understanding of the metabolic processes involved in the production of biohydrogen, and look for a metabolic improvement of the organism, mainly through genetic modifications Although microalgae derived hydrogen has been successfully obtained in the laboratory At this point, it is important to recognize that there will be a ceiling level (or plateau) for the increase in hydrogen production which is a result of optimal operating and design conditions, i.e., with the minimum possible entropy generation level. However, the biological entity that produces hydrogen could undergo selection, breeding, and be genetically engineered, through which the potential for H Organisms that gained more biotechnological relevance after the –omic era, have shown advantages in genetic improvement strategies. Several biotechnologically important microalgae species have already had their genomes sequenced, including From the engineering point of view, aiming at high plant performance and, consequently, possible good results in a life cycle analysis, other biofuels should be considered concomitantly with biohydrogen. Microalgae could provide several types of different biofuels, such as: hydrogen produced by water photolysis during photosynthesis Due to the facts pointed out so far, and based on the sustainability potential of energy plants that use biomass from microalgae cultivated in photobioreactors (PBR) In order to reach biohydrogen production at a larger scale than the laboratory, from the challenges listed previously in the text, this study selected to address: i) the introduction of a mathematical correlation, with dependence on the process variables, to calculate the resulting effect on H In the hydrogen production by biophotolysis, sulfur is a key component of aminoacids for the proteins of photosystem II where O On the other hand, the indirect biophotolysis process in a photobioreactor comprises two stages. First, biomass increases up to stabilization in aerobic conditions (with air supply). Next, hydrogen production is obtained in anaerobic conditions (by cutting air supply) until stabilization, and so on. Therefore, for continuous production, a steady periodic regime should be achieved. The indirect biophotolysis process is shown schematically in The following reactions summarize the process (stage 1 – aerobic) (stage 2 – anaerobic) Adding Eq. The species conservation balance for the microalgal species in a well stirred photobioreactor is written as follows: Equation For a well stirred microalgae cultivation photobioreactor, during the anaerobic stage of the cycle, hydrogen conservation of species states that: The microalgae growth rate and hydrogen production are also affected by the average sun light intensity into the medium, I Equation In order to account for the total effect of In order to elaborate appropriate mathematical correlations for each type of genetic modification aiming at increasing H Mathematical modeling, therefore, is one possible way of getting an initial assessment of the effect of several genetic modifications, in which positive and negative effects could be included in theory. As a result, the trade offs of different simultaneous procedures could be investigated. In this study, a first attempt is made to combine the effect of two of such reported genetic modifications in isolation: 1) a mutant expressing a more O The proposed calculation of For the two selected effects, experimental data are available as follows: Note that the proposed model increases the value of The proposed stoichiometric model implies that substrates and products ratios remain constant, i.e., independently of light energy supply, and nutrients. Also, it is assumed that the biomass molecular formula remains unaltered. Such model fails when the microalgal composition changes, so that for these cases it is necessary the use of a biotic state vector instead of the microalgae mass fraction which would express the dynamic dependence of the biomass composition on external conditions. The illumination inside the photobioreactor containing microalgae depends on the microalgae concentration C (kg m Next, assuming uniform properties in the reactor, I Equation The other parameter that needs to be estimated for Eq. Additional experimental work has been published recently obtaining increased hydrogen yield with lba-transgenic In the simplified model presented in this paper, both the actual mass fractions Regarding the sulphate mass fraction in the medium, Finally, in order to assess the outcome of the process under different conditions, and with different strains, wild and genetically modified, an H A fortran code was written based on the model and all simulations were performed in a laptop Intel (R) Core (TM) i3-3227U CPU @ 1.90 GHz, 4 GB RAM, 64-bit operating system.
