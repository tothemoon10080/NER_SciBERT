A complete form of multinomial expansions is developed in this paper, which shows the detailed structure of each decomposed term.Multinomial expansion has wide applications in theory of number, probability theory and stochastic process. For general purposes, let us consider the following formula: According to multinomial expansion theorem Now and then, for the computation of multinomial expansion expressions with computers, it is unavoidable to explore the complete multinomial expansion expression, which means the expression will show more detailed structure of each decomposed term. Such expression should get rid of all zero values of Let us state that Let us group the decomposed terms of the expanded expression. Let all terms containing one element in a one-element group, expressed by Consequently Now, let us see the structure of our complete expression. In the one-element group, each term contains exactly one element, and the power of each element in any terms is exactly Let us take a simple case first. We know A function takes the following form:
