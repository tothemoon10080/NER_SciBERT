VUV-irradiation experiments with aqueous solutions of melamine and related triazine derivatives were carried out in the presence or absence of molecular oxygen. Substrate degradation, total organic carbon and evolution profiles of intermediates were monitored. Relevant mineralization of the substrates was observed, in particular for melamine, its extent depending on the concentration of dissolved O2 and on the number of amino substituents at the s-triazine moiety of the substrate. In all experiments, cyanuric acid was found to be the only persistent final product. Experimental results indicate that the route of reactions leading to mineralization is independent of that leading to amino group substitution. Mechanistic hypotheses are proposed and compared with findings coming from TiO2-based photocatalysis.The environmental impact of the wide and unrestricted use of pesticides during the last decades [ Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV-) photolysis of water generates HO In a previous work the VUV-technique was used to degrade atrazine [ Aiming at a more detailed description of the reaction manifold of s-triazines degradation induced by the VUV-photolysis of water, in comparison to other AOPs, and with specific emphasis on the widely studied and applied TiO Melamine was chosen as the starting compound, because amino substituents of the s-triazine moiety are also present in intermediates of the oxidative degradation of atrazine, and compounds Moreover melamine based polymers find wide application, and even if melamine is not classified as a health risk, its chronic toxicity is still object of in-depth investigations [ Melamine has been implicated in diagnoses of urinary tract stones and sand like calculi due to contamination of milk products [ Recently melamine degradation by means of TiO The present work aims firstly to evaluate the possibility to attain melamine mineralization by means of VUV-irradiation and secondly to assess the degradation mechanisms in comparison with the findings obtained in TiO Melamine (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-triazine, A cylindrical Xe-excimer radiation source (length: 25 cm, external diameter: 3 cm [ A 500 mL annular reactor (Pyrex, length: 30 cm, external diameter: 5 cm, Mangels, Bornheim, Germany) adapted for the immersion of the Xe-excimer radiation source and equipped with an external electrode [ HPLC analyses were carried out using a HP model 1090 liquid chromatograph with multiwavelength UV–vis detector (wavelength of analysis: 220 nm); column: Lichrospher C  TOC (total organic carbon) analyses were carried out with a Rosemount Analytical Instrument, Dohrmann DC-190. Abiotic AOPs, and in particular those initiated by photochemical means, relay on the generation of hydroxyl radicals, HO, to initiate manifolds of oxidative degradation of organic compounds (pollutants) dissolved in aqueous systems [ Investigating on the UVC-photolysis of H Photochemical enhancement of the second consists in fact of the photochemical reduction of Fe Electronic excitation of TiO While for the first two mentioned AOPs, reductants like HO Hydroperoxide radicals, HO Hydroxyl radicals, HO The VUV-photolysis of pure H The study of the melamine degradation was carried out by establishing the evolution of the concentrations of substrate and intermediates and of the TOC as a function of irradiation time. The effect of the concentration of dissolved oxygen concentration was investigated by working with air-equilibrated stirred solutions or with solutions purged continuously with synthetic air or with Ar. Profiles (normalized values) of the consumption of melamine as well as of the diminution of TOC upon VUV-photolysis of melamine aqueous solutions (initial concentration: 5.5 × 10 Surprisingly, when compared to previous findings, in particular when applying TiO As for intermediate and final products, the amount of melamine not mineralized upon VUV irradiation is yielding ammeline ( Ammeline is produced by the substitution of one amino group of An analogous behavior is featured by ammelide, that upon VUV-photolysis produced It is therefore worth to be noticed that the mineralization process is affected severely by the dissolved O The previously discussed findings regarding substituted s-triazines degradation and mineralization lead to the hypothesis that the substrate transformation is taking place via two different paths: one yielding the formation of cyanuric acid as stable final product and the other leading to a triazine ring opening and the subsequent intermediate mineralization according to the results of the TOC analyses. HO The VUV-photolysis of aqueous solutions of ammelide ( A sequence of reactions leading to mineralization necessarily involves the opening of the Alternatively and according to the general Eq. Electron transfer from Although, the routes of amino group substitution involving In the absence of dissolved O The reactivity of ammeline (  In accordance with the mechanistic hypothesis proposed, the substitution of the amino groups in In accordance with the proposed sequence of reactions implied in the subsitution of the amino groups ( However, during the VUV-photolysis of H Reductions of The experimental results reported in In most AOPs, relatively high concentrations of H The fact that the degradation of organic compounds in aqueous solution by VUV-irradiation is strongly influenced by the concentration of dissolved molecular oxygen in the volume of primary reactions, should not be disregarded. In fact, considering that VUV-radiation of 172 nm is totally absorbed within less than 0.1 mm due to the high absorption cross-section of water and that the intermediates thus generated by the homolysis of water show very short lifetimes, the primary volume of reactions is almost identical with the irradiated fraction of the total reactor volume.
