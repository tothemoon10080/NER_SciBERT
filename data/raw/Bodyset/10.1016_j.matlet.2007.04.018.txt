Barium carbonate (BaCO3) nanostructures with different morphologies were synthesized using Ba(NO3)2 and (NH4)2CO3 in the water/ethylene glycol (EG) mixed solvents by oil bath heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The molar ratio of water to EG had an effect on the morphology of BaCO3. The products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).Barium carbonate (BaCO The EG is a polar solvent which has a reducing ability. It has been widely used in materials synthesis In this paper, we demonstrate that BaCO All chemicals were analytical grade reagents and purchased and used as received without further purification. In a typical experiment, barium nitrate (Ba(NO X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a Rigaku D/MAX 2550 X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (  The morphologies of the samples were investigated with SEM. The morphology of the same sample as in The volume ratio of water to EG had a significant effect on the morphology of BaCO In summary, BaCO Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 50472014), the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the Program for Recruiting Outstanding Overseas Chinese (the Hundred Talents Program), the Opening Project (No. SKL200506SIC) of the State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, and Shanghai Postdoctoral Scientific Program (No. 05R214148) is gratefully acknowledged.
