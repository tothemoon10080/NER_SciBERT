Fractures of the radius and ulna should be treated as a single unit rather than separate bony entities due to the intricate relationship of both bones in the forearm. Injuries can be divided into fractures of both bones, fracture of a single bone, and fracture of single bone associated with joint injuries. Distal radius fractures have been dealt with separately, as they are most common. The aim of treatment is to restore anatomy, and achieve stability to allow early mobilization to achieve good function. In diaphyseal fractures of the forearm, restoration of the relative lengths of both bones to maintain the integrity of the joints is vital and often requires operative intervention. In fractures of distal radius restoration of volar tilt, radial inclination and length should be achieved and maintained during healing by appropriate methods. Stable fixation allows early return to function.Fractures of the forearm bones (radius and ulna) behave differently to diaphyseal fractures of other long bones because of the surgical anatomy peculiar to the forearm. Although the radius and ulna come into contact with each other only at the ends, namely the proximal and distal radioulnar joints, they function as a single unit. They are bound proximally by the capsule of the elbow joint and the annular ligament and distally by the capsule of the wrist joint, the dorsal and volar radioulnar ligaments, and the fibrocartilaginous articular disc. The ulna is a straight bone around which the radius pronates and supinates. The radius of curvature of the radius is complex and should be maintained while treating fractures, as alterations can result in restriction of supination and pronation. The interosseous membrane between the radius and ulna is a complex structure, and has prompted some surgeons to treat fractures of the radius and ulna as intra-articular injuries requiring anatomical reduction, absolute stability and early movement. The classification of forearm fractures is anatomical. The need for awareness of associated joint subluxations of the proximal and distal radioulnar joints cannot be overemphasized.           In addition to the usual findings associated with a fracture, the dislocated radial head can be palpable at the elbow. More important is the neurological examination for posterior interosseous nerve, which may be injured especially in Bado type II injuries. Good outcomes following Monteggia fractures depend on early accurate diagnosis, accurate reduction of the radial head, rigid fixation of the ulna, and postoperative immobilization to allow ligamentous healing about the dislocated radial head. Rigid fixation of the ulna is achieved by using a 3.5 mm dynamic compression plating system applied in static mode to maintain the length of the ulna and hence the reduction of the radial head. This injury consists of a solitary fracture of the radius at the junction of the middle and distal third with subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). The insertion of the pronator quadratus on the palmar surface of the distal fragment, the brachioradialis attachment to the styloid of the distal radius and the abductors and extensors of the thumb cause significant deforming forces to the distal fragment and the DRUJ. These deforming forces make it very difficult to maintain a reduced position in cast. These fractures require accurate reduction of the fracture and DRUJ along with stabilization of the radius fracture. The features of fracture will be accompanied by deformity and tenderness at the DRUJ. Fractures at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the radius are best managed with plate fixation, ensuring accurate reduction of the fracture and the DRUJ ( The distal radius is the most common site of fracture in the forearm. The radiocarpal articulation and distal radioulnar articulation support the carpus. These joints comprise three separate articular surfaces that are of concern in treatment of fractures of the distal radius. The scaphoid fossa and lunate fossa are two concave articular surfaces separated by a dorsal–volar ridge, which define clear articulations for the lunate and scaphoid; and the DRUJ that occurs at the sigmoid notch on the radius and accepts the head of the ulna. The distal articular surface of the radius is aligned to the longitudinal axis of the radius at approximately 11° of volar tilt and 22° of ulnar inclination. The ulnar side of the wrist is supported in addition by the triangular fibro-cartilage (TFCC), which articulates with both the lunate and triquetrum. Fractures of the distal radius that extend into these joints are treated as intra-articular fractures. Those fractures limited to the metaphysis of the distal radius, but not involving the joints, may affect the distal radioulnar articulation and hence its biomechanical properties due to alteration of the relative lengths of the radius and ulna. These factors in the surgical anatomy make it imperative that distal radius fractures are treated carefully so that the anatomical parameters and integrity of the articulations are maintained to achieve the best results. Facture of the distal radius most commonly arises due to a fall on the outstretched hand. This results in an axial load on a wrist that is dorsiflexed. The non-comminuted fracture on the palmar aspect of the radial metaphyseal area, compared with the dorsal comminuted fragments, suggests that the radius fractures in tension on its palmar surface, subsequently propagating dorsally where bending moment forces lead to compression stresses. This results in crushing of the cancellous bone and shortening of the distal radius relative to the ulna. Transmission of these forces onto the radial cortex requires intact ligaments. In the elderly where these fractures are common the metaphyseal bone is the weakest. In younger patients, where greater forces are involved, concomitant ligamentous injuries may occur and have particular relevance to the choice of treatment modalities. The eponymous descriptions associated with distal radius fractures have traditionally been good indicators of the type of injury and treatment.      Various classification systems have been proposed to describe the injury and help formulate a treatment plan. Broadly they tend to be anatomical classifications that group fracture patterns, biomechanical that describe the mechanism of injury and fracture stability or a combination of both. A fracture may be defined as either extra-articular or intra-articular. Extra-articular fractures maybe:   Intra-articular fractures, are either:   Further, displaced articular or nonarticular fractures may be: reducible, stable reducible, unstable complex irreducible. Indicators of instability are (i) shortening of greater than 5 mm, (ii) dorsal angulation greater than 20°, (iii) marked dorsal comminution and (iv) displacement in a plaster of Paris cast. Classification systems proposed for intra-articular fractures include: This classification describes the scaphoid, lunate, and sigmoid notch fossae of the distal radius as separate articulations.     In this classification system intra-articular fractures of the radius are divided into five major fragments, including the radial styloid, ulnar corner, dorsal wall, articular surface, and volar lip fragments. This classification is useful for treatment using fragment-specific fixation. This classification system is based on the mechanism of injury. This system is advantageous because the associated ligamentous lesions, subluxations, and fractures of the neighbouring carpal bones, and soft tissue damage, are directly related to the quality and degree of violence sustained. It also helps in reduction of the fractures by reversing the mechanism.      The dorsal aspect of the hand and wrist is usually quite swollen, and ecchymosis may be present, especially in the elderly. The wrist should be examined for tenderness, not only about the radial fracture site, but also at the distal ulna, elbow and shoulder. Median nerve function and flexor and extensor tendon action should be tested. Standard posterior-anterior and lateral radiographs are obtained to assess displacement, shortening and comminution. A computed tomography scan may be useful in assessing intra-articular extension and other associated fractures or injuries. The aim of treatment is to achieve and maintain reduction until bony union, and to promote rehabilitation to prevent the consequences of immobilization of the wrist and adjacent joints. In intra-articular fractures, anatomical reduction, absolute stability and early mobilization should be achieved. Reduction may be achieved using open or closed means. Closed reduction is achieved by traction through the fingers to disimpact the fragments and correction of the deformity. Reduction of articular fractures may be done by direct visualization using arthroscopy. Indirect reduction is the preferred method and is achieved through the fracture site, where the fractured articular fragments are reduced onto the carpus which serves as a template. Intraoperative radiographs are useful for the assessment of reduction. Maintenance of reduction can be achieved by a variety of methods.     Locked plating systems allow early mobilization and quicker rehabilitation after injury. They carry the risks associated with all surgical procedures. The choice of treatment modality is governed by many factors and should be reached after careful informed consent from the patient, keeping in mind the fracture configuration and the patient expectations.               Nearly 30% of all distal radius fractures in a series of 565 fractures had complications.
