Double potential step chronocoulometic studies on industrial copper anodes are carried out in various acidic copper sulphate electrolytic solutions (60, 100 and 180 gl-1copper sulphate). The aim of this investigation is to understand and decide the optimum conditions to recover pure copper from copper alloy scrap by electrolytic refining. The copper electrode is actually made from the industrial scrap. The composition of the industrial copper anode is: Cu, 96.66 wt. %, Ag, 2.54 wt. % and Zr, 0.8wt. %. Parameters like internal resistance, net coulometric charge and surface excess are determined using this technique. From the surface excess values, 100 gl-1 copper sulphate concentration in the electrolyte is decided to be the optimum for the copper recovery process.
