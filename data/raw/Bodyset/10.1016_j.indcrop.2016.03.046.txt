In order to reduce the amount of choline acetate ([Cho][OAc]), (a less expensive, more biodegradable and biocompatible ionic liquids) used in the pretreatment of sugarcane bagasse, [Cho][OAc] combined with organic solvents pretreatments were attempted. The glucose yields after a 72-h enzymatic saccharification of sugarcane bagasse pretreated with [Cho][OAc] combined with organic cosolvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), or ethylene glycol (EG) at a weight ratio of 1:1 keeping at 130°C for 180min were approximately equal to those from the bagasse treated with [Cho][OAc] alone. The result indicated that the combination use of the cosolvents made it possible to reduce 50% of amount used of [Cho][OAc]. The enhancement effect of the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvent pretreatment on enzymatic saccharification could be attributed to an equal or greater effect on removal of hemicelluloes and lignin compared to the [Cho][OAc] treatment alone, although a lower effect on reduction in cellulose: which was supported by componential and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. The bagasse pretreated with [Cho][OAc]/DMSO (1:1w/w) used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae BA11, and ethanol was produced with a corresponding to conversion ratio of 69.9%.Pretreatment is a requisite step for the production of biofuels or chemicals from lignocellulose through saccharification and fermentation ( Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment has received much attention since certain types of ILs were discovered to be able to dissolve cellulose ( We used choline acetate ([Cho][OAc]), which is a completely bioderived IL, for pretreatment of lignocellulose. [Cho][OAc] has important advantages, such as being less expensive, more biodegradable, and more biocompatible compared to highly effective ILs such as imidazolium-IL ( In order to overcome these problems, this work proposes pretreatment combining [Cho][OAc] with organic solvent. Pretreatments using various organic solvents have been reported, and they have the following advantages: (1) cellulose is recovered as solids with only minor degradation, (2) lignin and hemicelluloses dissolve into organic solvent, which increases the surface area of cellulose, (3) organic solvent can be easily recovered by distillation and recycled ( To evaluate the efficiency of pretreatment combining [Cho][OAc] with organic solvent as cosolvent, hydrolyzabilities of the sugarcane bagasse pretreated with mixtures of [Cho][OAc] and several polar organic solvents were demonstrated. In addition, componential analysis of [Cho][OAc]/cosolvent-pretreated bagasse, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the pretreated microcrystalline cellulose, and ethanol fermentation of the pretreated bagasse were performed. The sugarcane bagasse was kindly provided by Kyuyo Sugar Industry (Okinawa, Japan). The raw bagasse was ground by a cutter mill (D3V-10; Osaka Chemical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for 1 1.5 The ASL, AIL, cellulose, and hemicellulose contents of untreated and pretreated bagasse were determined as follows ( The XRD patterns of the treated Avicel were obtained using the X-ray diffractometer (Multiflex; RIGAKU, Yamanashi, Japan). The samples were scanned in the 2θ range of 5–45° with the step size of 0.2° at 40 Enzymatic saccharification of untreated and pretreated bagasse was performed in a 110-mL vial containing 0.2 All the enzymatic saccharification experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means were calculated.  The SSF experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means were calculated. To evaluate the combination use of [Cho][OAc] and various organic solvents such as DMA, DMF, DMSO, NMP, EG, and G, the bagasse pretreated with [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents was enzymatically hydrolyzed. Since the organic solvents used in this work have high boiling points, it is not necessary to use pressure-resistant equipment and evaporation at 130 The glucose concentration, saccharification ratio, and glucose yield after 72 Subsequently, pretreatment using [Cho][OAc] and solvents with a weight ratio of 1:1 enhanced the saccharification ratio of the treated bagasse to 59.4–97.4%, especially the DMSO (97.4%), NMP (91.6%), and EG (90.7%). In these cases, the glucose yields are approximately equal to those from [Cho][OAc] treatment alone. [Cho][OAc]/DMSO, [Cho][OAc]/NMP, and [Cho][OAc]/EG were 0.392 As described above, the pretreatment combined use of [Cho][OAc] and cosolvents such as DMSO, NMP, and EG promoted the enzymatic saccharification of bagasse approximately equal to the single use of [Cho][OAc] in spite of 50% reduction of the amount of IL used. In general, the enhancement effect on the enzymatic saccharification of IL pretreatment is attributed to an increase in the accessibility of cellulase to cellulose, which is caused by the synergetic effect of the reduction in cellulose crystallinity, and the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses (  The recovery ratios and CrIs of Avicel after the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents treatments were 73.9–87.5% and 61.6–76.3%, respectively. This showed that the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents treatments also had the effect of reduction in cellulose crystallinity, however, the effect was lower than with the [Cho][OAc] treatment. However, these results were not related to the result of the enzymatic saccharification so much. For example, the [Cho][OAc]/EG treatment caused the high saccharification ratio and glucose yield of the enzymatic saccharification equal to the single use of [Cho][OAc], however, its CrI (76.3%) was the highest of all pretreatments. As described above, the enzymatic saccharification is seems to be affected by not only cellulose crystallinity but also other factors. Focusing on the type of the used cosolvent, the higher recovery ratio and CrI were obtained by the combination use of protic polar solvents (EG and G). On the other hand, it was reported that the addition of an aprotic polar solvent such as DMA, DMF, and DMSO to an imidazolium-IL enhanced the cellulose dissolution ( According to the above results, it revealed that all the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents tested in this study had an enhancement effect on the reduction in cellulose crystallinity, although the effect was lower than with the [Cho][OAc] pretreatment alone. As we know, the removal of lignin and hemicelluloses enhances the enzymatic saccharification by making cellulose more accessible to cellulase ( With the pretreatment using [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents except DMSO, the recovery ratios (61.7–80.6%) were lower than or nearly equal to that of the [Cho][OAc] treatment. In these cases, hemicelluloses (14.4–19.8%) and AIL (9.0–14.5%) contents were somewhat decreased compared to the use of [Cho][OAc] alone. In the [Cho][OAc]/DMSO treatment, the recovery ratio and the composition was similar to the [Cho][OAc] treatment. This means that the removal effect of hemicelluloses and AIL by the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvent treatment was equal to or higher than the [Cho][OAc] treatment alone. For this reason, the high hydrolyzability of the pretreated bagasse might be obtained by the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvent pretreatment. On removal of hemicelluloses and lignin, it is known that the treatment with organic solvent at high temperatures and pressures for a specific time causes the degradation of a majority of lignin and hemicelluloses into small molecular weight fragments ( As deccribed above, the difference in the composition of bagasse after the [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents pretreatments could not be completely explained by the cosolvents’ property to dissolve the individual components. It seemed that the chemical composition of bagasse treated with [Cho][OAc]/cosolvents was influenced by various factors in a complex manner. As described previously, the pretreatment using [Cho][OAc] and DMSO, NMP, and EG at a weight ratio of 1:1 enhanced the saccharification ratio of bagasse, and its glucose yields were approximately equal to the [Cho][OAc] treatment. The result suggested that the combination of the cosolvent might be able to reduce the production cost of useful materials such as ethanol. The highest glucose yield among the tested mixtures was obtained from the [Cho][OAc]/DMSO (1:1 To evaluate the fermentability of bagasse pretreated with a [Cho][OAc]/DMSO mixture, which may include residual [Cho][OAc] and DMSO, SSF of ethanol using The pretreatment combining [Cho][OAc] with polar organic solvents was attempted. The glucose yield after 72
