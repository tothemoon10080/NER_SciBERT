This paper presents a simple route of obtaining tough TZP ceramics, based on the mixing of 8 and 0mol% Y- ZrO2 powders followed by sintering under identical conditions. The experimental results clearly revealed that toughness optimization by careful tuning the compositional variation is achievable in this new route. For the first time, the present research has demonstrated that the indentation toughness of 8Y-ZrO2 can be significantly improved by addition of different amounts of yttria free monoclinic zirconia particles. The addition of Y-free zirconia powders is also observed to cause significant microstructural refinement in the sintered materials.It is now commonly accepted that the major drawback of ceramics restricting their wide range of technological application is brittleness, i.e. poor fracture toughness Till today, all the published literature reports on TZP ceramics are typically based on the materials fabricated from either Y-coated or Y-co-precipitated zirconia powders. Sintering and subsequent annealing at high temperature for longer time period have been performed to optimize the transformation toughness The commercial high purity zirconia powders: 8 XRD analysis of the polished surfaces revealed the predominant presence of the t-ZrO The yttria content data, as obtained with EPMA is analyzed in terms of yttria distribution. The Yttria content data is used as an indicative tool to understand the nature of the dopant distribution during sintering. The Yttria content varied from 1.8 to 2.0 The mechanical properties of the ceramics are summarized in Significant toughness improvement in TM-grades is observed when compared to TZ-8Y sample ( The above observation along with the EPMA results ( As a final note, it should be mentioned here that a similar strategy, as adopted in this paper, is followed to develop heterogeneous Y-TZP ceramics and earlier research had revealed that the TZP ceramics, based on mixing of 3 Y-TZP ceramics with tailored toughness were obtained by sintering powder mixtures of 8 The XRD results revealed that t-ZrO For the first time, the experimental results revealed that the optimization of toughness of TZP ceramics is possible by changing the added amount of Y-free ZrO The toughness of the Y-TZP ceramics decrease with increase in yttria content and the toughness of Y-TZP ceramics fabricated adopting this new method is found to be much higher than that of the TZP with same overall yttria content (2 Basu would like to thank the financial grant provided by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.
