The morphology of AlFeSi intermetallic compounds present in the eutectic Al–Si alloy was studied. The study was carried out on the Al–12wt.%Si commercial alloy without any additions and after adding refiners and/or modifiers. A moderate refinement of the secondary β phase was obtained after simultaneous addition of Ti and Sr.Iron is one of the most important impurities in aluminium and is always present in die cast commercial alloys. The solid-state solubility of Fe in Al is very low, the majority of the Fe being present in the form of intermetallic compounds, the nature of which depends mainly on the alloy elements present The eutectic Al–Si–Fe composition occurs for Fe contents of 0.8 Depending on the temperature and on the chemical composition of the mix among other factors, iron may precipitate as an intermetallic compound with different morphologies, the most common being polyhedral crystals, “Chinese scripts” and thin platelets that appear as needles in the two-dimensional optical micrographs. In near-eutectic alloys with iron concentrations of between 0.5 and 1.2 The Al Commercial ingots of the Al–12Si alloy were employed, the composition of which is shown in The metallographic test samples were prepared by conventional mechanical means. The etching solution employed for light microscopy observations was an aqueous solution of HF 0.5  Observation of the microstructure of the Al–12Si commercial alloy allowed us to detect only β-phase needles, as observed in In a hypoeutectic industrial alloy, with a weight composition of 6.23 In work carried out by Couture Semi-quantitative analysis of the needle-shaped intermetallic phase mean linear intercept in the Sr-treated sample revealed the existence of two populations: Thick, long β needles that may act as nucleating agents for the α-Al, which appear to be mainly trapped within these dendrites of primary aluminium, namely primary β (see Small amounts of thin, short needles in the eutectic zones (secondary β), as depicted in The precipitation of primary β needles in the liquid is the result of the higher supersaturation of this element in the presence of the Sr added to the melt. Strontium induces a generalized undercooling in the eutectic When 0.03 An AlFeSi phase with a polygonal morphology develops, as illustrated in High temperature β-phase, i.e. primary, β needles were found (see  The sample with 0.03 The sample with 0.05 The morphology of the iron-rich intermetallic compounds found in the eutectic Al–Si alloys studied was β-AlFeSi platelets predominantly, although polygonal intermetallic precipitation was also detected occasionally. The addition of either Ti or Sr permitted the observation of two size populations of needles, but notably, the population of the smaller size needles which corresponded to the β-AlFeSi needles in the eutectic, were much smaller in the 0.04 The authors wish to express their thanks to Dr. Juan Jose del Campo, former manager of the Thyssen-Krupp Guss foundry, for his help and to the Vice-rectorate for Research of the University of Oviedo for economic support in the preparation of the draft version of this paper.
