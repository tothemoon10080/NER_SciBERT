Secondary electron emission from a cathode material in an AC plasma display panel (PDP) is dominated by potential emission mechanism, which is sensitive to band structure of a protective layer. Therefore, the secondary electron emission property can be modified by a change in the energy band structure of the protective layer. Mg2−2x

                     O2 films were prepared by an e-beam evaporation method to be used as possible substitutes for the conventional MgO protective layer. The oxygen content in the films and in turn, the ratio of metal to oxygen gradually increased with increasing TiO2 content in the starting materials. The stress relaxation, when the [TiO2/(MgO+TiO2)] ratio in the evaporation starting materials was 0.15, seems to be related to the rough surface grown by Stranski–Krastanov mode due to the poor lattice matching condition between substrate and film. The film density, which was calculated from the refractive index, had a maximum at the [TiO2/(MgO+TiO2)] ratio of 0.15 and then gradually decreased with a further increase in the [TiO2/(MgO+TiO2)] ratio in the starting materials. When the [TiO2/(MgO+TiO2)] ratios of 0.1 and 0.15 were used, the deposited films exhibited the secondary electron emission yields improved by 50% compared to that of the conventional MgO protective layer.Color plasma display technology has been advancing quite rapidly in the area of large screen TV set since Fujitsu began the manufacture of the 42-inch full color alternating current plasma display panel (AC PDP) in 1995. Two key issues in order to meet the demands of advanced high vision PDP are production cost and power consumption, which are the stumbling blocks against the mass production of AC PDP There exists an excellent correlation between the firing voltage ( The evaporation sources were prepared using the solid-state reactions The secondary electron emission properties of Mg  The dependence of residual stress of Mg The surface morphologies of 5000-Å thick Mg   Low operation voltage is needed to reduce the cost of driving ICs, which can be obtained by increasing the secondary electron emission yield of a cathode material since the firing voltage is dependent on γ. Thus, it is desirable to measure the secondary electron emission yield of Mg From these results, it can be inferred that the secondary electron emission property of the Mg Mg The authors would like to thank the PDP Research Division (G7 project) in Korea for financial support and Professor Jihwa Lee [?1]at Seoul National University for his technical support on the measurement of secondary electron emission yield.
