This chapter describes direct-to-copper smelting and examines the degree to which its potential advantages have been realized. The chapter also indicates the principal problems with the process. It is the smelting of concentrate directly to molten copper in one furnace. The principal advantage of direct-to-copper smelting is isolation of sulfur dioxide evolution to one furnace of high sulfur dioxide strength gas. Its main disadvantage is the large amount of copper-in-slag. The products of direct-to-copper flash smelting are copper, slag, and offgas with different volumes. Direct-to-copper flash furnaces are similar to conventional flash furnaces with few differences. However, 15-35% of the Cu-in-concentrate is oxidized, ending up as copper oxide dissolved in slag. This copper oxide must be reduced back to metallic copper. The expense of copper-from-slag recovery treatment is the major drawback of direct-to-copper smelting. Hence, chalcopyrite concentrates are mainly treated by multi-furnace processes either by conventional smelting, converting, or continuous multi-furnace processing.
