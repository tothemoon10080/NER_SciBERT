This study focuses on the impact of the interface contamination on the collision efficiency between bubbles and inertial particles. The bubble's surface mobility has been integrated into the collision modelling by using the hydrodynamics stagnant-cap model, in which the clean angle

                     ). The Lagrangian tracking was performed for the solid particles by solving the full particle trajectory equation, in order to find the critical grazing trajectory. The collision efficiency was then calculated, as the ratio of the number of particles located in the body of revolution made by critical trajectory to that of particles located in the cylinder formed by bubble's projection area. The magnitude of hydrodynamic force (buoyancy, drag, shear lift, added mass and history forces) as well as surface forces (electrostatic, Van der Waals and hydrophobic forces) are compared to propose a simplified trajectory equation. The surface contamination was found to play an important effect on the behavior of collision efficiency, especially near

                     , the contact point may be on both mobile and immobile part of the interface and only the positive inertial effect is observed. A simple model has been proposed that makes possible the description of collision efficiency for clean or contaminated bubbles.Capturing small particles in suspension by micro-bubbles is a widely used method in chemical industry, like water treatment, mineral separation and liquid metal purification. Particle–bubble interaction controls the flotation efficiency during heterocoagulation. It combines particle motion in the fluid displaced by the bubble, the dynamics of collision and the physico-chemical properties of interfacial forces linking the bubble and particles that finally form an aggregate. An overall capture efficiency is usually defined as the ratio between the number of particles captured by a bubble and the number of particles in the volume swept out by this bubble. This heterocoagulation capture efficiency is generally considered as the product of the contributions of three successive steps ( The works cited above have considered the collision efficiency with major attention having been paid to two extreme situations: bubbles with clean surface or fully contaminated bubbles. However, it is now well known that not only the surface of fresh bubble is mobile, but the forward surface of aged bubbles where bubble–particle capture takes place can also be mobile ( Appropriate prediction of flotation efficiency during heterocoagulation is the key to modelling of a flotation cell, which requires establishing a kinetic model to describe the number of particles collected per unit of time. If the flotation tank is considered as a Continuous Ideally Stirred-Tank Reactor (CISTR), for a first-order reaction, the temporal variation of the particle concentration can be written as If the spatial variation of particle concentration is considered, like as that in a flotation column, the variation of the particle concentration in a finite volume So we can see that whatever the type of flotation cell is, the determination of the flotation rate constant requires knowledge of the capture efficiency To well understand the effect of the the interfacial contamination on the collection efficiency, we consider here a spherical bubble of radius The objective is to consider intermediate level of interface contamination on the collision efficiency. As shown in The fluid is assumed to be Newtonian and incompressible. We denote its local velocity and pressure by This study is limited to axi-symmetrical flows around the bubble. For a fully contaminated bubble (i.e. solid sphere), the wake loses its axi-symmetry at A particle moving in a fluid experiences several forces: gravity force, buoyancy force, drag force, added inertial mass force, stress gradient force, shear lift force and Basset-Boussinesq history force. Usually the equation of The particle inertia effect is described by using the particle Stokes number Relation ( According to Eq. The above-mentioned parameters for the collision process vary in a very wide range depending upon its application field where collision is involved. As an illustration of these wide ranges, Numerical computations reported below were performed by using the JADIM code described in previous works devoted to bubble and particles dynamics ( The simulation are performed in the reference frame fixed with the bubble. Different boundary conditions are imposed on the computational domain. On the outer boundary, the inflow velocity At the bubble surface, the Stagnant Cap Model ( Validation of the hydrodynamic simulations for partially contaminated bubble can be found in Particle trajectory equation is integrated in time using a second order Runge–Kutta method. The fluid velocity and velocity gradients are interpolated at the particle location using a second order accuracy interpolation ( As explained above, when particles inertia induced effects can be neglected ( The objective of this section is to discuss the order of magnitude of the different forces involved is Eq. When a particle approaches the bubble surface, its trajectory is influenced by the interaction with the interface (mirror effect). When a particle is transported in the vicinity of a bubble interface with a radius of curvature much larger than the radius of the particle ( If the movement of the particle is parallel to the interface, the drag has to be corrected as : If the movement of the particle is perpendicular to the interface, the drag is corrected as: This correction of the drag force has been included in the trajectory equation in order to determine its influence on the collision efficiency. The correction factors We have then tested the effect of the drag correction on the collision efficiency for a small particles Stokes number ( As it is shown in Eq. Electrostatic force Van der Waals forces Hydrophobic forces It should be noted that all the expressions used are valid only in the condition that the surface charge is uniform. On the contrary, different expressions should be used for the clean and the contaminated surface ( In  To conclude, we have shown that the dominant forces are the drag, inertia and buoyancy. History and lift force play a second role and can be neglected. The effect of the drag modification close to the interface on the collision efficiency value remains limited ( Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been performed for various bubble's Reynolds numbers and particle's Stokes numbers. The Navier–Stokes equations has been first solved for the flow field around the bubble. The Lagrangian tracking was performed for the solid particles by solving Eq. DNS results of the case of a bubble with clean or a fully contaminated surface is first presented, followed by the comparison with the similarly studies existing in the literature. Second, a partially contaminated bubble is considered via the study of the influence of level of interface contamination. Finally, a simple model for estimation of the collision efficiency is proposed. We consider in this section two extreme cases: bubble with a mobile or a completely immobile surface. As we have discussed in Inertial forces have been neglected in many studies that provide models valid for very small particles. The inertial forces have been generally overlooked for medium size particles and bubbles with high velocity (  The evolution of the collision angle The behavior reported in these figures reveals two opposite contributions induced by inertia ( When the particle inertia increases, not only the Stokes number effect becomes significant but also gravitational effect has to be considered. The trajectory is now solved by considering these two effects. In order to analyze the effect of the gravitational force, the evolution of the collision efficiency For a clean bubble ( For fully contaminated bubbles ( The evolution of collision efficiency In this section, the numerical results presented above are compared with models from the literature. The The collision efficiency calculated by Eqs. Numerical solutions are now compared with the model proposed by Comparison with models of As discussed in Introduction, in practical conditions in flotation, bubble interface can be neither perfectly clean nor fully contaminated. The objective of this section is to consider the effect of a partially contaminated interface on the collision efficiency. Following the structure of the previous section, we have first investigated this effect for non-settling particles  For the bubble with The variation of the collision efficiency as a function of Concerning the collision angle If If Meanwhile, as For small In this section we consider all the effects induced by inertia. Notably, when the gravitation forces are considered, the collision efficiency is significantly increased, compared to the results presented in the previous section. This figure reveals again two different regimes separated by   For small Stokes number ( For large Stokes number ( For intermediate Stokes (  The effect of bubble contamination has been presented in the previous section by varying the bubbles Reynolds number ( The first term The second term in Eq. The model given by expression ( In this paper, the inertial particle bubble collision efficiency has been evaluated by solving the full particle trajectory equation of particles moving in the flow field generated by a rising bubble.
