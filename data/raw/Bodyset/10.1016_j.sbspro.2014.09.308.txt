This study aims at investigating the relationship between educational internet use self-efficacy beliefs and their self-regulatory learning skills. This research is designed as relational scanning model. The sample of this study, Environmental, Chemistry, Electrical-Electronics, Computer, Geology, Mining, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical department (355) final year students from the Faculty of Engineering has formed. In the study, Educational Internet Use Self-efficacy Beliefs Scale (EIUSBS), developed by Şahin (2009) and Self-regulating Learning Skills Scale (SRLSS), developed by Turan (2009) are used as tool of data collection.

The significant differences weren’t found between gender and graduated secondary school with EIUSBS; but according to department, significant differences were found between with EIUSBS in favor of Computer Engineering department. The significant differences weren’t found between department and graduated secondary school with SRLSS; but according to gender, significant differences were found between with SRLSS in favor of girls.
