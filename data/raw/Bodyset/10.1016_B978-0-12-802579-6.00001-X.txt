STEM fields currently reflect disparity between the number of males and females. The gap persists despite efforts to reduce it. This chapter posits that the gap is fed by cultural beliefs, organizational structures, and gendered interaction patterns. Such beliefs and communication practices are reinforced through language, especially metaphors and storytelling, as well as through social norms.Elizabeth's Story Threshing It Out  We have a problem attracting and retaining women in STEM fields, especially in engineering and computer science, and the key question is simply Yet, some question the existence of this leaky pipeline. Alexandra A. Killewald, Harvard sociologist, says, “A lot of things we think about in inequality of access to science are inequality to higher education” ( Why does it matter? We seem to be in a cultural shift in which a lower percentage of males graduates from high school and fewer of those graduates go to college, while a higher percentage of females graduates from high school and chooses to attend college—but they are not heading into STEM. In raw numbers, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that more women attend college than do men. More women attend as full-time students, and more women attend as part-time students. More than 57% of all undergraduate students in 2013 were female, and NCES projects this percentage to hold constant through 2024. Women are not, however, flocking to STEM fields despite the higher incomes available to STEM graduates. Yet, our aging and increasingly technical society requires more individuals pursuing careers and research in STEM areas. Indeed, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology calls for one million more STEM professionals in the United States, meaning the United States must “increase the number of students who receive undergraduate STEM degrees by about 34% annually over current rates” (2012). Thus, at a time when we need more students going into STEM fields, the traditional pool of students who choose these fields is not growing ( The National Science Foundation reports that by 2010, women reached numeric parity with men in social sciences as well as biosciences; however, women are underrepresented in physical sciences, mathematics, computer science, and engineering. This disparity is STEM fields, perhaps especially computer science and engineering, are gendered male, not necessarily by some misogynistic design but because historically they have been largely populated by males. We tend to think of organizations as gender neutral, but as Acker posited in 1990, they are not. Thinking about organizations as gendered entities moves us from accepting traditional (gendered male) patterns of interaction and structure as normal and toward recognizing the inherent and persistent frames of “advantage and disadvantage, exploitation and control, action and emotion, meaning and identity” they contain. First, A third aspect of gendering within organizational structure relates to patterns of interaction between/among organizational members, and this aspect is particularly salient for this book. Consider for a moment your experiences in interacting with other members of your gender and then consider the differences when you interact with another gender. Interactions between men, between women, and between women and men differ in terms of interruptions, turn-taking, topic setting, and conversational flow, among other ways. Frequently, men are perceived as the actors, the ones doing things and controlling the interaction, while women are expected to provide emotional support. These behaviors are part of self-presentation, a fourth aspect of organizational gendering, and males and females are expected to act in ways that reflect societal and organizational norms. Adhering to such societal norms is deemed appropriate and polite by others; failing to adhere to the norms is penalized. Women tend to be penalized more frequently and more harshly. Finally, gender is embedded in organizational logic, as seen in written work rules, labor contracts, managerial directives, job evaluations, etc. The so-called unencumbered white male is privileged over others, especially women, because the rules are written to favor those “committed to paid employment [as] more suited to responsibility and authority” while women, who “must divide their commitments” between public/organizational and domestic work, are disadvantaged. The real problem, as Acker (1990, p. 152) notes: Each of these aspects of gendering burgeons in organizations and disciplines that have reflected these norms. Culturally, STEM fields are not supposed to be attractive to females. Gendering—learning how to be girls and boys—starts early, often before birth. As soon as a mother learns the biological sex of her baby, she begins thinking about names, planning the nursery, and buying clothing to match the child's biologically identified gender. Infant girls begin receiving dolls before they are even born; boys get dump trucks and action figures. In school, girls are expected to perform better on verbal tasks and to be less active; boys are expected to perform better in science and math and to be more active (and are much more likely to be identified with having attention deficit and hyperactivity issues). Girls are supposed to be polite, obedient; boys are expected to be rowdier, louder, and even less obedient at times. Children who don't conform to these gender stereotypes are often ostracized and teased, even bullied by their peers. Building things, dissecting things, gaming, and programming are considered masculine activities. Girls are supposed to be impressed by what boys build and repulsed by dissected carcasses. These gendered behaviors as well as other cultural expectations or norms are perpetuated through communication, verbally and nonverbally. Several female engineers, when discussing their undergraduate experience, noted how frequently professors used car analogies in effort to clarify concepts. While these analogies seemed to work for male students, they did not clarify anything for the females. Most female engineers, particularly those in mechanical, civil, and electrical disciplines, reported being either the only female or one of three females in their engineering courses.  The norm of using automobiles mechanics or maintenance makes sense if professors are working under the assumption that everyone in the class is interested in and knowledgeable about how they work, and this assumption feeds from the stereotype that engineers—traditionally gendered male—obviously work on cars and other types of machinery. This assumption may be wrong for both the females and males in the classroom, excluding females who generally comply with their traditional gendered interests and males who do not comply or do not show interest in car maintenance and mechanics. A 2013 study of commonly used K-12 science textbooks found biases against women and minorities, and these biases were greatest in the lower K-3 texts. As Blumberg writes in 2015 UNESCO report, “Their domination of instruction, coupled with their pervasive gender stereotyping and underrepresentation of females, result in textbooks often being cited as limiting girls' academic achievements and adult options” (p. 1). Blumberg recommends revising textbooks for inclusion and training teachers to mitigate the negative impacts. The relationship between culture and communication is intimate, even somewhat symbiotic. Culture influences what is perceived and valued, and these perceptions and values are shared through communication via storytelling, language, and social norms that guide appropriateness of speech, behaviors, and interaction. Storytelling serves many purposes, including teaching others what to pay attention to and what matters. For example, the Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing at Samford University uses Mrs. Moffett's story to convey that nursing is more than a job or profession: it is a “calling,” a “mission.” Mrs. Moffett is praised for having a “devout character and never-ending sense of compassion [through which she] touched the hearts and lives of countless patients and professionals” ( Compare that story to this brief statement on Cal Tech's website: “Caltech's founding fathers—astronomer George Ellery Hale, We gain deeper knowledge of culture through looking at stories as well as by studying language. Thus, most high school and college students study foreign languages, and businesses value those fluent in multiple languages. Yet, we also learn about our own cultures by studying our language and how we use it. Linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's        Through such language, the concept of argument as war is shared and promulgated. We are still learning how much language matters in shaping our thoughts, as Through language use as well as nonverbal communication, we learn social norms. We learn how to exchange greetings and who is expected to speak first. We learn how to shake hands and the etiquette that goes with it. In some parts of the United States for example, women are still expected to initiate handshakes if they want to participate in this ritualistic greeting. Similarly, in the southern part of the United States, men are expected to hold doors open for women. These nonverbal behaviors bleed into expectations in the workplace, and sometimes they create ambiguities and awkward interactions. For example, if a man has been brought up to hold doors for women and he continues this practice in the workplace, a female peer may perceive it as demeaning or patriarchal rather than as politeness, as a sign that she is not considered an equal. Similarly, if he fails to hold the door, he may be perceived as rude, lacking manners and basic courtesy. Such behaviors undergo scrutiny and sometimes create uncomfortable and awkward interactions, and both males and females are challenged by changing social practice. Importantly, because males have traditionally held more power relative to women's power, subtleties in social norms can exclude women, discriminate against them, or simply make them question whether they belong in that particular place—e.g., an engineering classroom. Gender roles, both their negative and positive aspects, are deeply embedded in society and are central to self-identification and perception. Gender theorists, psychologists, and sociologists offer descriptions and criticisms of gender-based stereotyping, extending their discussions from women to the LGBTQ community and finally to men. Many individuals, women, men, and LGBTQ individuals have collectively fought for equity in social and professional realms, and they have made significant progress in some areas. Yet, inequities persist. Culture changes slowly. Thus, the female chemist, quoted at the beginning of this chapter, interrogates her perceptions as well as her peers' behaviors to understand why the men comfortably stop by each other's work spaces to notify each other of their routine lunch date, yet rarely stop by hers. If she attends We use language to construct gender and social norms, and linguists frequently parse such language use in terms of discursive engagement, discursive content, and personas (McGonnell-Ginet offers extensive discussion of these concepts in much of her work. See for example, Speech, discursive content, sometimes conveys unchallenged assumptions, stereotypes, and biases. For example, we frequently specify gender when it isn't necessary: a lady doctor, a female engineer, a male nurse, or male kindergarten teacher, etc. Such delineation implies something unusual about the particular person in that role: women aren't surgeons or engineers and men aren't nurses and kindergarten teachers. Thus, individuals who work in fields outside the perceived gender norm must somehow come to terms with being perceived as anomalies, and they do so in a variety of ways, sometimes apologetically and sometimes defiantly. How they come to terms with those roles, specifically how they portray their gender in such roles, signals their personas. Gender is always present in how we act and interact. As I was drafting this book, James Damore published his lengthy screed against Google's and society's efforts to recruit and retain women in STEM. His “Google's Ideological Echo Chamber” is perhaps more convincing, albeit unintentionally so, than I have been in positing why we need to address the leaky pipeline. His belief that women somehow are not interested in STEM because they are women belies the deep cultural constraints that discourage them. Damore's message and its popularity among a significant number of people, not to mention the publicity he received, conveys how widespread this belief is, how ingrained it is, and how emotionally and socially challenging such fields are for women. YouTube CEO and Google employee Susan Wojcicki references her own experience in technology in Forbes: Damore is not the first and probably will not be the last male to suggest that women are incapable of some job or activity or intellectual pursuit by virtue of being a woman. It's actually a fairly common and well-worn trope. I'm always curious, however, as to what motivates someone to reframe it every few years. I've heard a male faculty member tell a class of graduate students—five females, one male—that “ This book is about how communication practices, particularly gendered practices, may impede the inclusion and progress of In gathering information for this book, I was fortunate to interview 49 women in various STEM disciplines. While a few work in academe, most participants are gainfully employed in STEM professions as engineers, information technologists, chemists, technical sales, etc. Some are actively involved in community service to engage young girls and/or minorities in STEM fields. They are giving back even as some described being discouraged by older women in their fields. They are observant and committed to their disciplines. They ranged in age from their early twenties to their late fifties. These women represent a geographically diverse sampling. After talking with one woman, I was frequently referred to a friend or former classmate in another state. I met women in coffee shops and restaurants and spoke with some over the phone. To protect their identities, I refer to them by profession or pseudonyms. Their stories are unique yet share common threads of success, exclusion, exception, and second-guessing. From their stories, we see examples of how communication practices in STEM disciplines may discourage How have you heard the gender disparity in STEM fields explained or excused? What is your response to Damone? To what extent do you accept or agree with his points? How might you respond to a peer, a faculty member, or supervisor who espouses views similar to Damone's? If you are a mentor, what sorts of views, prejudices, and myths persist in your field that discourage and/or disparage females? Brainstorm some ways to address these exclusionary views and myths in your local group. Gather information by asking the women around you about their experiences with these issues. Talk with young women in your fields and convey support by acknowledging the unfounded views and encouraging the women to persist as you work with them to change the culture.
