We present a case of a man who sustained a closed dorsal fractureâ€“dislocation of his left ring finger proximal interphalangeal joint in a fall. The patient was treated surgically with plate and screw fixation via a volar approach. This method theoretically provides more secure fixation than internal fixation with screws alone, allowing early rehabilitation with active range of motion and potentially better functional outcome.
