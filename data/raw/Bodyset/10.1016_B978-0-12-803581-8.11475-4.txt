Industrial waste management has become a worldwide problem not only because of the increasing generation rates, but also due to the fact that traditional practice of landfilling is not an environmentally sound technique. In addition to the needs for reducing generation rates, environmentally sound recycling and reusing techniques are being sought. On the other hand, geopolymerization technology has gained increasing attention because of its potentials in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission (compared to the traditional Portland cement technology), recycling aluminosilicate industrial wastes as precursor materials and immobilizing their heavy metal contents. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the current state of knowledge in recycling non-fly ash aluminosilicate industrial wastes such as construction and demolition wastes, waste glass, red mud, mining tailings, etc., into geopolymer material.Rapid development of infrastructures in developing countries over the past several decades has made the Portland cement (PC) as the key construction material with a world demand projected to rise 4.5% per year to 5.2 billion metric tons in 2019 ( Geopolymer cements can be considered as a sub-group of alkali-activated materials that are produced by chemical activation of suitable reactive aluminosilicate materials using highly alkaline activator solutions. Alkali-activated materials have a long history dating back to the 1940s with the introduction of alkali-activated Blast furnace slag by Based on definitions given by The mechanism and chemistry of geopolymerization reactions have been the subject of much scientific discussion over the past two decades showing that the mechanism and chemistry of the binder depend on the properties of both the aluminosilicate precursor material and the alkali-activator. The presence of calcium, for example, is very determinative in the mechanism and the type of binding compound being formed. In the absence of calcium or presence of low amount of which N–A–S–(H) binding compound and geopolymer material is formed (  The properties of geopolymer materials greatly depend on both the composition and properties of the starting materials and the processing conditions applied. According to Geopolymer cements can be produced either by using raw/processed aluminosilicate natural source materials such as natural pozzolans ( A survey in 2008 reported that only 43% of total annual production of FA in the United States, which amounts to about 131 million tons, is re-used with the remaining ash piles causing increased environmental threats ( The majority of the research works on alkali-activated and geopolymer materials are focused on granulated Blast furnace slag from pig iron production process and FA as a waste residue in coal combustion process due to their worldwide availability and also their high contents of reactive silica and alumina. However, many different aluminosilicate industrial waste materials can be used as a suitable precursor for synthesis of geopolymer materials. The determining key-factor for suitability of a precursor for geopolymer production is to contain enough amounts of reactive silica and alumina that are easily dissolved in alkali activator solution that provides a high pH medium. For this reason, many attempts have been devoted to the development of geopolymer materials from aluminosilicate industrial waste materials other than FA. This paper is devoted to a systematic review on the last decade published literature on recycling non-fly ash aluminosilicate industrial waste materials such as construction and demolition wastes, waste glass, red mud, mining tailings, etc., into geopolymer material. Granulated Blast furnace slag and other calcium silicate slags are not of concern in this study, since alkali activation of these materials results in formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) and calcium(-sodium) aluminosilicate hydrate (C,N–(A)–S–H) as the main binding compounds compared to geopolymer materials, which are mainly composed of sodium aluminosilicate hydrate (N–A–S–(H)). Due to potential environmental and technical advantages of geopolymer binding materials over PC, conversion of aluminosilicate industrial waste materials into geopolymer material has been considered as an appropriate solution for effective management of aluminosilicate industrial waste materials. This has motivated researchers to evaluate the potential of different aluminosilicate industrial waste materials as alternative precursor for geopolymer material. Here, we briefly review and discuss the relevant literature chronologically. CDW is one of the largest waste streams generated in both advanced and developing countries and its management has become an important worldwide problem. It is defined as waste materials generated from construction projects, demolition of buildings, structures and roads and land clearing activities. CDW consists of numerous materials, including concrete, bricks, ceramic and tile, gypsum boards, glass, wood, etc., many of which have potential to be recycled. In Europe, construction sector produces 820 million tons of CDW annually that is equal to about 46% of the total waste generation according to (  CDW can be used for production of quality aggregate. In the aggregate washing stage, however, a significant amount of filter cake waste mainly composed of fine silt particles is produced that has no use and is normally landfilled.        Alkali activated pastes based on red mud alone exhibited very low compressive strengths and incorporation of red mud into alkali activated slag resulted in significant compressive strength loss. As      In a recent study, It is a serious challenge to dispose million tons of waste glass generated all over the world annually. In 2005, USA, China and European Union produced 20 Mt, 32 Mt, and 33 Mt waste glass, respectively (                  RM is an aluminosilicate industrial waste produced in the production process of alumina from bauxite ore, the Bayer process. Disposal of RM in huge holding ponds without any treatment has led to a global environmental crisis due to its large production volume, high alkalinity and small particle size. It is estimated that each year approximately 120 Mt of RM is added to the existing stockpiles worldwide with an estimated total amount of 4 billion tons in 2015 (  In a different work, the same authors (                     Recycling of aluminosilicate industrial wastes as precursor materials for geopolymer production is an important step towards sustainable waste management due to its significant environmental benefits including (1) alleviating the pressure due to landfilling expenses and environmental impacts, (2) the potential in reducing energy consumption and CO
