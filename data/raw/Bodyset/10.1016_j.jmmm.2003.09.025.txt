                     Mn0.7Co0.3O3 (0.1⩽x⩽0.5) have been investigated. From the magnetic measurement it is evident that high spin Co3+ transforms to low spin Co3+ (diamagnetic) at low temperatures which influences its magnetic and transport properties. Change in spin state of Co3+ leads to change in the magnetic structure. The experimental resistivity data are examined using the small-polaron transport model and it finds a good theoretical fit.Transition metal oxides with perovskite structure (ABO The solid solution of cobaltite and manganite having the general formula La  The temperature dependence of magnetization, Resistivity measurements of the La Here Room temperature resistivity is a function of inverse of the number of charge carriers and the peak resistivity is a product of Jadhao et al. As pointed earlier two separate phase boundaries are observed for all the composition at We have investigated the series of compounds with general formula La We are grateful to Prof. C.M. Srivastava for useful discussions and to the Department of Science and Technology for support of the project.
