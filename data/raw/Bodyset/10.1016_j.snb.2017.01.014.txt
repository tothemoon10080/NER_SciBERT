Great efforts have been devoted on the detection of the volatile organic compounds indoor for human health. The detection of formaldehyde is one of the most important and popular issues for the wide usage of formaldehyde and its toxic. However, it is a challenge to monitor trace gaseous formaldehyde at lower working temperature. Herein, we present a sensor with a significantly improved sensing response and dramatically decreased operating temperature based on porous PtO2/SnO2 microspheres. And the PtO2/SnO2-5 mol% composite shows the most outstanding sensing performance among all products. What’s more, the above sensor can detect gaseous formaldehyde in the ppb level (100ppb) at low operating temperature (100°C). The excellent sensing performance should be attributed to the high catalytic activity of PtO2 nanoparticles decorated on the surface of SnO2 microspheres and the porosity of the composite.Recently, great concern is given on the detection of trace toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As we all know, formaldehyde (HCHO) is the most popular one among VOCs emerged in room for their wide usage in many products, especially for furniture, adhesive agents, textiles, paints, and so on Among the above metal oxide, tin oxide (SnO In the present work, porous PtO Stannic chloride pentahydrate (SnCl Porous SnO The crystallization information of the final products were collected on a Rigaku D/Max 2550 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation operated at 200 The fabrication process of gas sensor can be described as follows: an appropriate amount of as-synthesized porous PtO The phase composition of the as-synthesized samples was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, and the typical diffraction patterns of porous SnO The morphology and size of SnO To understand the microstructure of the PtO To further confirm the presence of PtO The porous structure of the SnO For the practical application of a gas sensor, the operating temperature is important for a gas sensor due to its great influence on the contact reaction during the gas-sensing process. Combining the peculiarity of porous SnO The dynamic response-recovery curve of the above sensor to different concentrations of gaseous formaldehyde (0.1–100 The selectivity towards the target gas is another important aspect for a sensor except the high response and excellent reproducibility for practical applications. Thus, we also measured the responses of this sensor towards 100 Typically, SnO After decorated PtO In summary, by decorating PtO This work was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article:
