Rhenium is recovered during pyrometallurgical processing of molybdenum sulfide and copper sulfide ores; the traditional technology involves removing rhenium(VII) oxide, Re2O7, from the sulfurous gas phase generated during multiple hearth roasting (in molybdenum processing) and smelting (in copper processing). A new technology platform called Looping Sulfide Oxidation (LSO) has been proposed to produce molybdenum and copper using alternative process chemistries. A detailed thermodynamic study of the reaction conditions used in LSO process indicates that rhenium recovery is possible at higher rates than currently realized in the industry. Conditions at which Re2O7 is reduced to rhenium metal by S2 have been identified and key process conditions are outlined to maximize performance of the LSO scheme and rhenium recovery.Rhenium (Re) is a rare metal (whose average concentration in the Earth's crust is in the order of 1 part per billion) valued for its extremely high melting point. Rhenium is produced by Chile, The Netherlands, Germany, Kazakhstan, the United Kingdom, Poland and the United States; yearly production in 2011 was 49 Rhenium does not form ore bodies in nature and the industrially relevant mineralization is rheniite, ReS A new technology known as Looping Sulfide Oxidation (LSO) has been proposed to process MoS Thermodynamic modeling was performed using FactSageÂ® 6.3 software and HSC Chemistry for Windows A description of the LSO process for the conversion of MoS LSO was developed as a means to generate energy during processing of metal sulfides in a manner previously unused in the industry In the LSO processing of MoS The goal during MoS The LSO processing of CuFeS This reaction stoichiometry can be adjusted to modify the slag properties and achieve maximum yield to metallic Cu. Similar to the Mo process, a certain fraction of Cu is exothermically oxidized to CuO and recycled. In both LSO schemes, the behavior of ReS Thermodynamic simulations performed using the Cu feed in stoichiometric CuO and air show that ReS Importantly, the ReS Thermodynamic simulations of the Mo feed using stoichiometric MoO Alternative MoO In general, the increased excess of oxidants leads to an elevated metallic rhenium formation temperature but a decreased MoO High temperature reduction of Re It is proposed, therefore, that S Complementary to These findings establish LSO reactor conditions for the processing of MoS During conventional rhenium recovery from the sulfurous off gas from Cu smelters and Mo multiple hearth roasters the gas is scrubbed in several stages, one of which removes rhenium. This is an equilibrium process and the driving force establishing the chemical potential for rhenium removal from the gas phase is directly proportional to the concentration of the Re An excess of air is used during Mo multiple hearth roasting; the excess air dilutes the SO A similar comparison between Cu LSO and conventional Cu smelting is more difficult due to the variety of Cu smelting technologies employed in the industry today Taken together, in both LSO processes, the expected higher rates of Re The LSO process has been proposed as alternative process schemes to convert Cu and Mo sulfides into Cu and MoO
