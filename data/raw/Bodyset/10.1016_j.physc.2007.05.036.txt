                      (BSCCO-2212) tubes were fabricated by melt and solidification process. BSCCO-2212 powder compact was melted in a resistance furnace using a Pt crucible and poured in a rotating cylindrical mold. The solidified BSCCO-2212 tube samples were heat-treated at various temperatures in oxygen atmosphere. The current–voltage curves at 77K of the samples were obtained by transport measurement, and the microstructure was investigated by scanning electron microscope. It was found that the critical current (I
                     c) of the BSCCO-2212 samples was dependent on the heating schedule regarding the grain growth of the BSCCO-2212 plates and the formation of the second phase.High Much effort has been made on the enhancement of In this study, BSCCO-2212 bulk was made by melting technique and the effect of heat-treatment on electrical properties of BSCCO-2212 tube was investigated. Bi The powder mixture was put in a Pt crucible or alumina crucible, then the crucible was placed at the center of the electric furnace and was heated to 1200 The phase formed after the solidification of the melt in a mold was identified by X-ray diffraction as a semi-amorphous phase due to the slow kinetics of the melt to BSCCO-2212 phase. To understand the effect of heat-treatment on the development of microstructure and phase changes, the tubes were heat-treated at 750–850 The current–voltage curves at 77     BSCCO-2212 tubes were made by melt and solidification technique using BSCCO and 10 This research was supported by Electric Power Industry R&D program funded by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy, Republic of Korea.
