Eight patients (9 fractures) who have been treated with Dall-Miles plating in this unit between April 1996 and October 1997 for ipsilateral periprosthetic fractures around total hip replacement (7 cases) and total knee replacement (2 cases) have been reviewed. Four were men, and 4 were women. The average age at the time of operation was 77 years (range, 65–89 years). The average follow-up period was 14.6 months (range, 6–24 months). Three fractures healed satisfactorily with no evidence of malunion (3 of 9). The final results was unsatisfactory in the other 6 fractures. The femoral component had been inserted in a varus position in all the failures but was in a neutral position in the 3 successes. Procedures other than Dall-Miles plating might be more appropriate in the management of periprosthetic fractures in which the femoral component is in a varus position.
