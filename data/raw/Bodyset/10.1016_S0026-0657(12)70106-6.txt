BASF has opened a global mining research and development facility at the Australian Minerals Research Centre (AMRC) in Perth. At the new facility, scientists will study specific innovation needs for mineral processing and metal production, to help reduce energy and reuse water in mines. “With the latest advances in mining solutions research, BASF aims to help mining operations to minimize water consumption, maximize recovery, reduce land areas consumed by tailings disposal and minimize the cost and time required to rehabilitate sites,” said Dr Martin Brudermueller, vice chairman of the executive board.
