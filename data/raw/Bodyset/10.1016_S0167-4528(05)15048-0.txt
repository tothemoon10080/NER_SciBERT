This volume is the culmination of the ongoing efforts of a body of individuals who all contributed to ‘making it happen’. The 42 corresponding authors in particular need to be thanked for their willingness to work extended hours often in their own personal time. The standard of writing and technical content has generally been high, reflecting the degree to which excellence and professionalism is sought in the gold-processing industry. Gratitude is expressed to the various companies who are represented in the authorship, for their permission to allow the authors to tackle their contributions and in some cases, for the supply of material and permission to publish illustrations and photographs. The patience and co-operation of Barry Wills, Series Editor; Marjolein van Breemen, Publishing Editor, and Jasmin Bakker, Publishing Support Manager, with this major undertaking are gratefully acknowledged. A vast amount of thanks are due to Carol Adams for her patience with this commitment and willing assistance with illustrations and formatting as well as followup correspondence and phone calls.
