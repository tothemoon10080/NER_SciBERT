This work presents control systems developed and manufactured by the Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals in Gliwice. designed for IF-type flotation machines offered by the Institute for the processes of mineral material flotation enrichment. The measurement and executive equipment and automatics systems based on PLC controllers have been considered for different machinery types. The example of flotation in the milling cycle has been used to demonstrate the control system structure and engineering as well operation assessment.
