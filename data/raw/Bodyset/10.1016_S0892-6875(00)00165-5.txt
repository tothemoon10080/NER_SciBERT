The influence of Cu2+ or Mg2+ on the Fe2+ oxidation ability of Ni2+ adapted strains was apparent when Cu2+ or Mg2+ was above a certain concentration. The toxicity of ternary combinations of Cu2+, Mg2+ and Ni2+ to Ni2+ adapted strains was stronger than that of binary combinations of Cu2+ and Ni2+ or Mg2+ and Ni2+ to it. Compared with wild strains, Ni2+ adapted strains exhibited better leaching efficiency in the bioleaching of nickel from nickel-bearing pyrrhotite concentrate.
