Dear Sir, Re. Palmar plate fixation of AO type C2 fracture of distal radius using a locking compression plate â€“ a biomechanical study in a cadaveric model. The article by F. Leung et al. (2003) compared the palmarly placed AO LCP locking plate with conventional palmar and dorsal plates in a cadaveric distal radius fracture model. Trauma surgeons need to establish whether the biomechanical properties of the new locking plates are strong enough to allow the palmar approach to dorsally comminuted, intraarticular distal radial fractures. To date there are few reports on the distal radial locking plates, so it is important to evaluate carefully the conclusions from the study by Leung et al. We would like to comment on aspects of their study to help improve future biomechanical studies. Firstly, they describe testing each of their seven cadaver specimens with all three plates. Presumably, this required re-using the same screw holes or drilling adjacent new holes. In either scenario the distal fixation must be compromised, particularly because the LCP screws require a 2.8 Secondly, the fracture model they have used is not one that is commonly found in intraarticular distal radial fractures. We can appreciate that the 5 Thirdly, each configuration was tested to only 100 We suggest that future studies should use specimens without a palmar gap and once only they should be tested at least 500 times at forces greater than 200
