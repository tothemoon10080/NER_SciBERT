Conventional clarification processes imply specific facility footprints that translate into important capital costs. Ballasted flocculation, consisting of injecting ballast medium to increase floc specific gravity and size, is being increasingly used in the water industry owing to its potential for design with very high superficial velocities. However, no systematic approach has yet been proposed to compare and select an appropriate ballast medium with respect to its specific gravity and size. In order to facilitate this procedure, this research project explores the hypothesis that flocculation performance is controlled by the surface area of the medium available for ballasted flocculation. This hypothesis was tested at laboratory scale by evaluating five ballast media with differing specific gravity and size: granular activated carbon, anthracite, silica sand, ilmenite, and magnetite sand having specific gravities of 1.24, 1.45, 2.62, 3.70, and 5.08, respectively. Flocculation kinetics were monitored by measuring floc size through microscopy and with a camera installed directly on the jar-test beaker. Settling performance was monitored using turbidity measurements. This study shows that all ballast media, when expressed as total surface available during flocculation, required similar surface concentrations to achieve settled water turbidity near 1 NTU and lower. In addition, the effects from the ballast media size and specific gravity were lowered for settling time longer than 3 min. Inversely, for settling time of 12 s, larger and denser media produced lower settled water turbidity. For certain applications, lighter ballast media may be more economical because they offer more available surface area for a given mass concentration, hence reducing the amount of ballast media required in the flocculation tank. Finally, the ballast media point of zero charge and shape were not identified as key criteria for ballasted flocculation.Clarification processes require specific footprints that translate into important capital costs, especially in the Nordic climate where settling basins must be located inside heated buildings. Ballasted flocculation, consisting of injecting micron-sized granular media to increase the specific gravity (SG) and size of flocs, is being used increasingly in the water industry owing to its potential for achieving very high superficial design velocities (as high as 85 m/h; The concentration of BM inside the flocculation tank (typically referred to as the maturation tank) is very high, in the range of 4–10 g silica sand (SS)/L for industrial applications. The BM concentration depends on the particle concentration in the flocculated waters (which is linked to the coagulant dosage and the source-water particle concentration). For example, in jar testing, a higher BM concentration was necessary for a wastewater application compared to a drinking water application (2 g of SS/L for surface water of 12 NTU and 3 g of SS/L for municipal wastewater of 130 NTU ( In summary, the selection of an appropriate BM medium is dictated by its SG, size, and the need to minimize un-ballasted flocs. This is because the latter are not well removed during settling at high superficial velocity. In addition, BM availability and cost, its resistance to abrasion, and the effectiveness of its recovery by hydrocyclone are important criteria to consider ( All experiments were conducted at laboratory scale at 21 ± 1 °C using surface water from the Sainte-Rose drinking water treatment plant (10 ± 2 NTU; pH 6.9), which is fed by the Mille-Îles River (Quebec, Canada). The tested surface water exhibits a relatively low alkalinity (30 mg CaCO The jar test sequence and protocol sampling are presented in Flocs size and SG were characterized during flocculation by optical microscopy with a counting cell of 2 mm depth, as described in The media characteristics are presented in The optimal BM concentration (expressed in surface concentration: m         In past research efforts, BM optimal dosages were selected on the basis of mass base concentration (expressed in g/L). However, identical mass base concentration BM media with differing average diameters or densities will generate different particle concentration and surface area. For each medium tested, the settled water turbidities were measured after 12, 60, and 180 s of settling time (reflecting indirectly the superficial velocity of the clarifier) for three different grain size distributions. As presented in  Small and light BM produced the highest settled water turbidities at high settling rates (A at 12 s). For such a challenging settling time, SS, IL, and MS were all found to be suitable options ( The higher settled water turbidity after 12 s, achieved using GAC and ANT, can be explained by the presence of unsettled ballasted flocs. For example, at 21 °C, a spherical GAC and ANT grain of 80 μm requires ballasted jar-test settling times of approximately 116 and 62 s. For a longer settling time of 180 s ( Floc growth kinetics was measured during jar tests using a camera for three conditions of BM size distributions and two surface concentrations (m The theoretical orthokinetic flocculation model for predicting the rate of successful collisions between particles, proposes that collision rates are linearly proportional to This study demonstrated that ballasted flocculation is best described as contact between surfaces (microflocs and BM). Consequently, the BM concentrations should be normalized with respect to surface in order to select an optimal and appropriate BM. For very high settling rates, the BM surface concentration, SG, and size had important effects on turbidity removal. On the other hand, as the superficial velocity applied in the clarifier decreased, it was shown that the BM SG and size were less significant, compared to the BM surface concentration. More specifically, for certain applications, a lighter BM might be more economical because it offers more available surface for a given mass concentration, hence reducing the amount of BM required in the flocculation tank. For all tested conditions, the BM shape and PZC were not correlated with turbidity removal. The impact of hydrodynamic repulsion caused by the use of larger BM still requires deeper evaluation because it is expected to lead to particle disaggregation. In addition, the weathering of BM caused by repeated passage through a hydrocyclone should be quantified to guide the final selection of the BM. These experiments were conducted as part of the
