A novel mesoporous bioactive glass/hydroxyapatite (MBG–HA) nanocomposite was fabricated via hydrothermal synthesis under glucose-assisted conditions using P123 as a mesoporous template. Glucose was used to create hydrophilic carbon spheres, which enriched calcium ions to form HA nanoparticles around the surface. The texture properties of the MBG–HA nanocomposite were determined through a series of characterization techniques. Compared with MBG, HA nanoparticles were distributed around the mesostructure of the MBG–HA matrix. In vitro bioactive assays showed a faster apatite-like phase formation on the surface of the MBG–HA nanocomposite than that on the surface of the MBG. The novel nanocomposite with enhanced biocompatibility can potentially be used as a biomaterial for bone tissue engineering.Hydroxyapatite (Ca Mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) has been an excellent candidate for bone tissue regeneration because of its well-ordered mesoporous structure and superior in vitro bioactivity. In the ternary system SiO    The crystalline structure of the obtained materials was characterized through FESEM/EDS, WAXRD, and FTIR. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of MBG and MBG–HA samples are shown in The presence of nano-HA in the MBG–HA nanocomposite can be also investigated using TEM. The mesostructural properties of the obtained sample were evaluated via SAXRD and N The N In the study, glucose was added to form hydrophilic carbon spheres, which served as a co-template for nano-HA formation and easy removal through air combustion. The schematic illustration of the MBG–HA formation process is shown in The prepared powders were immersed in SBF at 37 The MBG–HA nanocomposite was prepared through hydrothermal synthesis by adding glucose and using P123 as the mesoporous template. Compared with the MBG sample, the nanocomposite exhibited a relatively lower surface area and pore volume with a pore size of 5.1 The research was supported by the
