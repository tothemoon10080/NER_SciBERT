Talar body fractures are typically the result of high-energy trauma and carry significant morbidity. Typically they occur in young men and are predominantly closed injuries. Identification is essential early to reduce patient morbidity as avascular necrosis can ensue even despite timely operative intervention. Plain X-rays are usually sufficient to diagnose the fracture whilst computed tomography (CT) can assist in aiding accurate classification, delineating the degree of comminution and operative planning. A 23-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with a right ankle injury. On arrival he was intoxicated but admitted to falling off the top of a dumpster and falling approximately 8 foot. The ankle was grossly swollen but with normal neurosensory examination. Plain X-rays of the ankle ( Plain radiographs form the basis of initial assessment in most orthopaedic trauma. An anteroposterior and lateral ankle X-ray in most cases are sufficient to diagnose the presence of a talar body fracture. With the tube tilted caudally 20Â° the talonavicular joint can be better visualized whilst the Broden view is useful to diagnose lateral process fractures and assess subtalar joint congruity. In 1977, Sneppen et al. classified talar body fractures into six types depending on the fracture pattern.
