The ion exchange model of the leaching process was determined via batch leaching experiments using the Kerr model, with the selectivity coefficient experimentally determined to be 12.59×10−10 L2/g2. Solute transport laws of ammonium ions (NH4
                     +) and rare earth ions (RE3+) in column leaching were described by the convection−dispersion equation (CDE). The source and sink in the CDE were determined by the Kerr model. The CDE with strong nonlinearity was solved using the sequential non-iterative method. Compared with the breakthrough curve of RE3+, the correlation coefficient between the simulated and experimental curves reached 0.8724. Therefore, this method can simulate the one-dimensional column leaching of weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore. Moreover, the effects of different concentrations of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) solution on the leaching rate of rare earth were analyzed. The optimal concentration of the (NH4)2SO4 solution had a linear relationship with the rare earth grade.
