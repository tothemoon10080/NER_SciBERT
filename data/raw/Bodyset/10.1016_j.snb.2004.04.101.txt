The change in the electrical resistance of the melt-spun Mg90Pd10 amorphous alloy was examined during electrochemical hydrogen charging and discharging. The electrical resistance of the amorphous alloy increased after hydrogen charging and decreased after hydrogen discharging in 6N KOH solution. Moreover, we also examined the change in the electrical resistance of the amorphous alloy immersed in hydrogen-dissolved water. As a result, the electrical resistance of the amorphous alloy increased with immersion time and the increase amount significantly depends on the hydrogen concentration in water. It is expected that the melt-spun Mg90Pd10 amorphous alloy can be used in future as a hydrogen sensor in water.Recently, hydrogen-dissolved water has attracted much attention from the aspect of health in the field of medical science. The catholyte obtained by water electrolysis is called alkali-ion-water and this water has been recognized to give good effects for health such as antacid effects and efficacy against gastrointestinal disorders including hyperchylia, indigestion, abnormal gastrointestinal fermentation and chronic diarrhea. Great efforts have been devoted to find factors relating to these effects Nowadays, the polarography-type hydrogen sensor is commercially available A great number of amorphous alloys have been produced recently in Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Ti-, Zr-, Pd- and Nb-based systems An ingot of the Mg The amorphicity of the alloy was examined by X-ray diffractometry (Cu KÎ±, 40  We also measured the electrical resistance of the amorphous alloy immersed in hydrogen-dissolved water. The amorphous alloy specimens were fixed as shown in Since the amount of hydrogen absorbed in a thin ribbon sample was extremely small, it was impossible to quantify the amount reliably. In this work, the authors focused on the electrical resistance change by the electrochemical charging in KOH solution and by the immersion in the hydrogen-dissolved water, which may correspond to hydrogen absorption.
