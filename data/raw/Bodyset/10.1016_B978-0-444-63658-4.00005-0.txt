Mineralogical investigation is a critical and integral aspect of gold project development and process optimization. The process mineralogy of gold is not limited to the gold minerals, submicroscopic gold, and their carriers but also includes the study of gangue minerals and other species that may affect gold processing, such as cyanicides. Characterization of gold minerals and carriers in composite ore sample can be used to diagnose and predict metallurgical response, identify potential problems, and help in the design of a more robust metallurgical test work program. Gold mineralogical investigation should be carried out on all major ore types, to predict variation in metallurgical response as well as to establish its cause. Detailed gold deportment study of tailing samples with the assistance of all available microbeam techniques is used to determine each form and carrier of gold on a quantitative and independent basis to assess causes for unrecovered gold. Partial gold deportment studies of intermediate products have been used to understand the kinetics and efficiencies of the gold unit process (e.g., flotation, leaching, pressure oxidation, and bioleaching). Gold deportment in final flotation concentrates is carried out in conjunction with the study of cleaner (scavenger) tails to assess the potential for improving rejection of insolubles or pyrite, without sacrificing gold recovery.Companies that have contributed indirectly in building the database are thanked. Without the support of these companies in providing problems to solve and the necessary financial support, this contribution would not have been possible. Mineralogical investigation is a critical and integral aspect of any prefeasibility study as well as one of the quality control measures in the process optimization step ( Mineralogical investigation of tailings and other streams from operational plants has two specific objectives. The first is to determine reasons why design efficiencies are not being achieved, and the second is to provide insight for continued process optimization by identifying opportunities and the means to augment recovery ( A gold deportment study consists of two parts: the first involves a complete gold mineralogical distribution in which all forms and carriers of gold (for definitions, see The process mineralogy of gold is not limited to the gold minerals, submicroscopic gold, and their carriers but also includes the study of gangue minerals and other species that may affect gold processing, such as cyanicides. Gold is the most inert metal; consequently, there are not many naturally occurring gold compounds, as listed in  Solid–solution gold tends to concentrate preferentially in arsenopyrite, with a maximum reported concentration of 1.7% (m/m) ( Pyrite is the most common of the sulfide minerals and may also incorporate significant amounts of gold in its crystal structure, to the point where solid-solution gold becomes the principal form of gold in the ore and pyrite its chief carrier ( In ores with more than one morphological types of pyrite, solid–solution gold is usually confined to one or two types only, which is not surprising given their different origin ( The positive correlation between arsenic and gold concentrations in pyrite was recognized early in the course of routine determinations of solid-solution gold in pyrite by secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) ( The chemical state and location of gold in the pyrite structure are still openly debated, but the consensus appears to be for aurous gold (Au Other minerals that may contain significant concentrations of solid-solution gold are loellingite (Pirila, Finland; Lupin, NWT, Canada), enargite (Chuquicamata and Pascua, Chile; Yanacocha, Perú), and tennantite (ElIndio, Chile). The term Colloidal gold can be the product of exsolution of solid-solution gold or nucleation of adsorbed surface gold ( The preferential host of colloidal gold is pyrite and, to a lesser extent, arsenopyrite. Unlike solid-solution gold, there is no requirement for pyrite to be arsenian (arsenic-bearing typically with more than 0.5% As by mass). This is illustrated in  In nature this preg-robbed surface gold occurs as three species, Au°, The terms Mineralogical parameters affecting the recovery of gold grains by gravity (see Particle size Degree of liberation Mineral density differential Particle shape Composition Hydrophobicity Fine free gold, which is too small to be recovered efficiently, depends on the installed equipment: 500 Examination of rejected free gold grains from numerous flotation plants has led to the following ranking of parameters affecting gold mineral flotation (see Size of gold grains outside normal floatable size classes Silver content of native gold Composition of gold mineral Activators and depressants Collector loading Shape of gold grains (flaky versus equant) Free gold grain losses to the slimes (<5 On the other end of the gold grain size spectrum, coarser gold in the final tails (for example, see Several years ago, while examining the deportment of gold in the Phoenix gold project (NV, USA), it was discovered that silver-poor free gold grains were being lost preferentially. Since then, in many flotation plants, a differentiation has been documented based on the silver content of gold (see also Pure gold metal surfaces are naturally hydrophilic; however, the easy sorption of hydrocarbons imparts some hydrophobicity, resulting in some natural floatability. The oleophilic character of gold makes pine oil an excellent frother for gold collection. The natural floatability of gold invariably needs to be enhanced by the use of flotation collectors common to sulfide flotation. Based on extensive plant experience ( Free gold losses within floatable size classes (7–150 Other free gold depressants include carbonate, arsenate, and phosphate species, some of which can be reverted to activators by sulfidization (NaHS). Iron hydroxide coatings hamper gold flotation but are hardly the main cause for free gold rejection. At Batu Hijau, manganese hydroxides were strongly enriched on the rejected free gold particles. In most flotation plants, sulfur and silver on gold grains (in all likelihood in the form of silver sulfide) promoted gold flotation. Copper must be assisting gold flotation as deciphered from the superior floatability of auricupride [Cu Rock/sulfide mineral binary particles, often referred to as middlings, can be significant gold carriers and warrant special attention in that contained gold grains can be more readily amenable for recovery that gold associated with pyrite, given the coarser size of the gold inclusions. It is not surprising that by matching collectors to free native gold composition (see Given the limitations in efficiently floating gold grains in the slimes fraction, the build-up of surface contaminants (also referred to as Of the gold minerals, calaverite [AuTe Pyrite and arsenopyrite are the principal hosts of submicroscopic gold. In addition, gold minerals are often preferentially associated with these minerals; hence, their floatability is relevant to gold metallurgy. The following possibilities exist in the case of sulfidic gold ores: Bulk sulfide flotation for further treatment (ultrafine grinding [UFG] or preoxidation) Sequential flotation from gold-bearing base metal-sulfide ores Separation of gold-bearing arsenopyrite from barren pyrite When attempting to concentrate submicroscopic and in particular solid–solution gold, it is important to keep in mind the following two peculiarities of the host sulfides: A strong correlation of gold with arsenic in pyrite A strong enrichment of gold in the finer grained varieties of both pyrite and arsenopyrite Although the exact location of arsenic in the pyrite crystal structure is still being debated the general consensus is that arsenic is replacing one of the two sulfur atoms in the sulfur dipole, thus forming AsS In the case of mesothermal pyritic gold ores, pyrite and arsenopyrite are sufficiently coarse grained, which allows for good liberation at modest grind fineness (P Free gold recovery from the slimes fraction can be enhanced by adding some of the “best-match” collector in the regrind mill feed, to build up a heavier collector loading on already free tiny gold particulates as well as coat newly liberated gold grains when their surfaces are still fresh. In ores with gold grains displaying a bimodal or broad silver concentration distribution, a matching collector will enhance flotation kinetics of the slower floating member. Of the gold minerals, only native gold, electrum, and auricupride are readily cyanidable, as listed in The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of plants where a particular contaminant was found to be a problem (interestingly, in four plants, lead could have had a detrimental effect on recovery; PbNO The progressive build-up of surface species was documented by analyzing gold grains down a train of agitated leach tanks, as well as from laboratory test work with varying leach time (see Direct determination of the composition of the surface contaminant on residual free gold grains ( An analogous mechanism is envisaged for silver arsenate (  At least in one Carlin-type gold deposit a progressive decrease of surface gold on carbonaceous matter was documented with increasing distance from the orebody. Surface microbeam technology is available for the in situ quantification of gold on the surface of mineral particles (see Cyanicides ( By forming stronger cyanide complexes than gold (e.g., Cu minerals) By forming new radicals (e.g., SCN By adsorbing CN radicals (e.g., iron sulfides) By consuming dissolved oxygen (e.g., pyrrhotite). Early identification of these species is important in order to take the appropriate corrective measures, either in the form of pretreatment options or adjusting operating parameters during leaching to minimize detrimental effects. The process mineralogy of gold in heap leach pads has some distinct characteristics that are peculiar to this process as a result of several factors, including the much coarser size range of the material treated, agglomeration, stacking, solution channeling, and intermittent solution contact as opposed to complete immersion in tank leaching (see The presence of irregular-shaped gold grains (filling fractures or intergranular) in coarser size (>4 Environmental concerns and stricter legislation have prompted considerable research on alternative lixiviants, with thiosulfate Of the minor and trace element constituents of native gold grains, mercury has been found at least in one case to interfere with gold dissolution in thiosulfate solution, by developing mercury sulfide (Hg Gold thiosulfate has been observed plating on particulates of stainless steel from the grinding media but not on mild steel because of the extensive surface oxidation of the latter. In systems where gold chloride Oxidative pretreatment is a requirement for gold ores with a significant fraction of submicroscopic gold in sulfide minerals (referred to as Issues related to mineralogy during pressure oxidation (see Preg-borrowing by residual pyrite, clays, and modified micas Preg-robbing by carbonaceous matter Submicroscopic gold with iron precipitates Gold encapsulated by calcium sulfate Unreacted locked in chert gold-bearing sulfide inclusions Gold preg-borrowing by pyrite takes place when conditions in the autoclave favor the formation of the gold tetrachloride Iron hydroxide, arsenate, and phosphate precipitated during slurry cooling and neutralization may carry up to one-third of the gold lost in the CIL residue. This gold is submicroscopic with little research done on its origin. Calcium sulfate mostly in the form of bassanite [CaSO Mineralogical factors that usually have an impact on gold extraction from carbonaceous ores by the roasting/CIL process (see Unoxidized locked in rock mineral particles gold-bearing sulfide inclusions Unleached oxidized gold-bearing sulfide (FeO Formation of gold-bearing ferrous pyroarsenite Entrapment by glazing of porous FeO Submicroscopic gold with iron precipitates Preg-robbing by unburnt carbonaceous matter Gold encapsulated by calcium sulfate Additional issues identified by investigating tails of older single-stage roaster/CIL circuits (Gold Giant, Con, NWT, Canada) are: Partially roasted free sulfide particles Low-permeability calcine particles Partially roasted free sulfide particles have been found to be present in single-stage roaster calcine but are not typically observed in two-stage roaster calcine. Partially roasted free pyrite particles display concentric rimmings of hematite [Fe  Maghemite, which essentially is hematite with magnetic properties, is an intermediate product of magnetite to hematite oxidation during roasting. It usually carries marginally more gold than the porous hematite particles, presumably because of its visibly lower porosity. The gold content of maghemite particles increases significantly when maghemite is intergrown with ferrous pyroarsenite [Fe As with leached autoclave residues there will always be some gold associated with precipitated iron hydroxyl-oxides and cyanidable gold that has been encapsulated by calcium sulfate; however, it is typically present in lower absolute (g/t) and relative (%) concentration. Roasters are very efficient at burning carbonaceous matter, but 100% burning efficiency is rarely achieved. Therefore, residual exposed carbonaceous matter can become very active as a result of the roasting process. Such carbonaceous particles are fully loaded with gold, as documented by surface microbeam analysis ( In the coarse-grained (>100 Mineralogical examination of pyrite, arsenopyrite [FeAsS] and loellingite [FeAs Gold encapsulated by elemental sulfur produced during bio-oxidation and gypsum produced during neutralization are potential causes of increasing gold losses. The presence of elemental sulfur also leads to somewhat higher cyanide consumption due to thiocyanate formation. UFG of pyrite concentrates for subsequent leaching is used in ores, where refractoriness to direct cyanidation arises from fine to ultrafine (<20, >0.02 Gold minerals are few, with somewhat unique properties (high specific gravity, brightness and average atomic number) making it relatively easy to pre-concentrate them for characterization and the identification under the optical and electron Diagnostic leaching ( Gravity-recoverable gold (GRG) tests at three successively finer grinds coupled with automated image analysis (AIA) search for gold minerals in each of the three gravity concentrates and the gravity tails ( Gravity concentration using heavy media, screening of the heavy mineral fraction followed by microscopist-assisted or automated search for gold minerals and assaying of the light fraction ( Gold deportments address all forms of gold as part of the same procedure. Unlike the other methods, each form is independently assessed (not by difference unlike the other methods) and where possible are confirmed using a complementary method. Special care is exercised to not miss important fractions of gold, such as free gold in the slimes fraction. Different deportment procedures have been developed to address the specifics of different gold beneficiation processes. Thus, the term Additional characterization includes the size distribution of the associated gold minerals and determining if there is a specific target grind for liberation, as well as the identification of surface contaminants, which hampered recovery of free gold of floatable size classes. A more recent tool to help find ways to augment the recovery of free gold is the matching of a secondary collector to the rejected gold grain composition ( In the case of leach tails the following types of gold are used to characterize the unleached gold: water-soluble gold salts; free and exposed cyanidable gold; enclosed cyanidable gold (including determination of a target grind to expose such gold); submicroscopic gold in sulfides and surface gold on carbonaceous matter. If the sample has a high pyrite or clay mineral content, then surface gold is measured on both. Surface contaminants interfering with gold extraction are determined directly by analyzing the surfaces of residual free gold grains. Speciation of surface gold on carbonaceous matter provides valuable information on the mechanism of gold dissolution and the source of the unwanted gold ligand. In the case of preoxidized samples, the following additional carriers of unrecovered gold are evaluated: gold encapsulated by calcium sulfate (and for certain processes elemental sulfur), gold in precipitated iron hydroxyl-oxides and on oxidized portions of grinding media (see The gold deportment procedure was developed to provide a clear and accurate picture of the disposition of the unrecovered gold in tailing samples, provide a ranking of the causes for the observed losses, identify the means for Given the low grade of the tailings, large samples (1–100 A variety of methods are available for assessing gold grain size distribution, liberation and exposure of gold minerals, with AIA techniques having gained broad acceptance over the last few decades ( SIMS is superior to any other microbeam technique for determining submicroscopic gold because of its accuracy (provided by matching mineral standards; High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) is used to detect, identify, and measure colloidal-size gold nanoinclusions. Gold inclusions as small as 50 Micro-PIXE (particle-induced X-ray emission) has been used to measure submicroscopic gold concentrations in sulfide minerals ( X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy are the two techniques used to determine the chemical state of gold in the crystal structure of arsenopyrite ( Time-of-flight laser-ionization mass spectrometry (TOF-LIMS) is ideal for inorganic surface microanalysis of gold particles ( Time-of-flight resonant ionization mass spectrometry (TOF-RIMS) differs from TOF-LIMS in that the wavelength of the ionizing laser is preselected so as to selectively ionize the element of interest, in this case gold. Using this approach, a minimum detection limit of 0.01 Laser inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (L-ICP-MS) can have subpart per million sensitivity, but it has a very large microanalytical volume ( Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is more suitable for organic surface microanalysis, after choosing carefully operating conditions to preserve molecular ions (see Characterization of gold minerals and carriers in composite ore sample can be used to diagnose and predict metallurgical response, identify potential problems, and help in the design of a more robust metallurgical test work program. The deportment study should be quantitative; however, it does not require the detail of gold deportments for tailings. Modal gold analysis of all fractions including the slimes, coupled with an overall mineralogical study, is usually adequate. It is important to carry out the gold mineralogical investigation on all major ore types, to predict variation in metallurgical response as well as establish its cause. Detailed gold deportment study of tailing samples with the assistance of all available microbeam techniques is used to determine each form and carrier of gold on a quantitative and independent basis to assess unequivocally and to rank causes for not recovering gold. This is perhaps the best approach for identifying problems in gold plants, for setting realistic targets for tails grade and assisting in developing strategies for pushing recovery even higher. Partial (narrow scope) gold deportment studies of intermediate products have been used to understand the kinetics and efficiencies of the gold unit process (e.g., flotation, leaching, pressure oxidation, and bioleaching). Gold deportment in final flotation concentrates is carried out in conjunction with the study of cleaner (scavenger) tails to assess the potential for improving rejection of insolubles or pyrite, without sacrificing gold recovery. Mineralogical investigation of gold ores continues to play a pivotal role in modern gold process plant operations and development projects alike, with a strong focus on process mineralogy. Mike D.
