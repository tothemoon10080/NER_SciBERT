Carbamoylphosphonic acid and carbamoylphosphonate ligands have been synthesized and studied for uranium extraction from phosphates ores. From a structure-selectivity approach, the molecular design of such ligands was optimized leading to a specific one called DEHCNPB which exhibits outstanding results for the selective extraction, and quantitative recovery of uranium in phosphoric acid compared to the URPHOS reference system.
