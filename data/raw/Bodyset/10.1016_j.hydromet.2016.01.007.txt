A synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) system consisting LIX 63 and Versatic 10, which are both commercially available, was selected to recover both Ga(III) and In(III) from synthetic sulfate leach solutions of zinc refinery cementation residues in one circuit. With the optimum composition of the SSX system, 86% In(III) and 92% Ga(III) were extracted in a single contact at pH3.0. The extraction and stripping kinetics of In(III) and Ga(III) were fast at 40°C. In(III) and Ga(III) were stripped readily using solution with low acidity of 0.05M H2SO4. Based on the McCabe–Thiele diagrams constructed, 4 stages of extraction at an A/O ratio of 1.2 and 3 stages of stripping at an O/A ratio of 5 are required for the extraction and stripping of both In(III) and Ga(III). The synergistic effect on In(III) extraction was significant while that on Ga(III), extraction was insignificant. A conceptual flowsheet is proposed including the SSX system consisting of reagents that are all commercially available and offers the advantages of recovering both In(III) and Ga(III) in one circuit and stripping with low acidity solutions.In(III) and Ga(III) are widely used in the electronics industry and their demand has increased significantly in recently years due to the increase in their consumption in electronic products ( Acidic organophosphorus extractants including D2EHPA (di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid), PC-88A (2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) and Cyanex 301 (bis-2,4,4-trimethylpentyl dithiophosphinic acid) have been tested for the recovery of In(III) where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and Cu(II) and As(III) are cemented with iron powder before SX (  In a process developed by A synergistic solvent extraction (SSX) system consisting of D2EHPA and a neutral extractant Cyanex 923 was developed for the separation of In(III) from iron(III) by exploiting their differences in extraction and stripping kinetics ( The previous work to recover In(III) and Ga(III) using various organic systems is summarized in As the above brief literature review has revealed, the drawbacks of the existing SX and SSX systems for In(III) and Ga(III) recovery are (1) stripping with high acidity HCl, harmful HF and HClO The compositions of the synthetic solutions to mimic the leach solution of a typical zinc refinery cementation residue are shown in The organic reagents used in this study and their purity, specific gravity (SG) and provider are shown in All shake-out tests were carried out in stainless steel (grade SS316) rectangular vessels (70 To determine metal extraction pH isotherms (metal extraction against pH) at a constant temperature, fresh organic solution (100 To determine extraction kinetics, a preliminary extraction test was conducted at a selected temperature and a selected pH using an A/O ratio of 1 to determine the amount of basic solution required for pre-equilibration.

After Cu(II) removal and Fe(III) reduction, 97% In(III) and 99% Ga(III) were extracted in a single contact while only 15% Fe(II) and 12% Ge(IV) were co-extracted at pH The extraction kinetics of In(III) was fast and its extraction reached equilibrium in 3 A conceptual flowsheet is proposed to recover In(III) and Ga(III) from leach solutions of zinc cementation residues including an SSX circuit. Compared with previous reported SX and SSX processes, the current one offers the following advantages: (1) recovering both In(III) and Ga(III) in one SSX circuit, (2) stripping with low acidity solution and (3) uisng two commercially available extractants.
