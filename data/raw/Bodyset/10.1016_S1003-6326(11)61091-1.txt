Platinum adsorption on activated carbon, a common adsorbent, from dilute platinum-containing solution of 57.6 mg/L was investigated. The effects of different adsorption parameters on the platinum adsorption were reported in detail. The percentage of platinum adsorption increased with increasing the amount of adsorbent, as well as with increasing contact time and temperature. A platinum adsorption of 75% was obtained using 400 mg of activated carbon at a shaking rate of 200 r/min for 3 h at 25 °C. A platinum adsorption of 88%, however, was obtained at 80 °C using 200 mg of activated carbon within only 1 h, which indicates that temperature plays a vital role in the adsorption process. A platinum adsorption of 99% or above was attained using 400 mg of activated carbon after contact for 3 h at 80 °C.
