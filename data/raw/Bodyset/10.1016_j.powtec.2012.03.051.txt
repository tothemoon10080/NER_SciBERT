The synthesis of CaB6 powders by mechanochemical processing was investigated in the present study. The synthesis was carried out using stoichiometric amounts of Ca/B2O3 powder blends as low cost raw materials. Milling was performed at room temperature in a high energy ball-mill using hardened steel vial and balls with a constant ball-to-powder weight ratio (10:1). The effect of milling duration on the production efficiency of CaB6 powders was investigated. Milled powders were leached by different HCl concentrations under the effect of ultrasonic stirring. The final product was obtained after repeated centrifuging, decanting, washing and drying treatments. Phase and microstructural characterization investigations of the milled and leached powders were carried out by X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) whereas supernatant liquid was characterized by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). The best results for the preparation of CaB6 powders were obtained from the 6h milled and repeated leached (2 and 0.5M HCl solution) powders.Calcium hexaboride (CaB The reported methods for the preparation of CaB Despite all these methods, mechanochemical synthesis of CaB In the present study, the synthesis of submicron CaB Raw materials used in this study were Ca (Riedel-de-Haen™, particle size: 0.2–3 The as-blended powders were milled in a high energy ball-mill (Spex 8000 D Mixer/Mill) with a rotation speed of 1200 Milled powders were leached or repeated leached using 0.5, 2 and 3.6 X-ray investigations of the milled and leached products were carried out using a Bruker™ D8 Advanced Series X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) with CuKα (λ Utilization of Ca and B         The powders shown in  The fabrication of pure and submicron CaB We would like to express our appreciations to
