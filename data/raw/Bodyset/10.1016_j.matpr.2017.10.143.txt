The objective of this research is to study the influence of heat treatment parameters, such as time and temperature, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the forged aluminum grade SFC204 used for orbiting scrolls. The specimens were at first annealed at the temperature of 530 °C for 2 hours. Each specimen was then heated at the different temperature; 175, 185 and 195°C with and different annealing time at 3, 5 and 7 hours. It was found that the annealing temperature and time of the aging process led to the difference of phase morphology. The increasing time and temperature affected the network of the intermetallic compound of the Aluminum (Al) and Silicon (Si) and/or Al and Copper (Cu). The mechanical testing, such as fatigue, hardness and tensile, was investigated. Comparing to the microstructure observation, the intermetallic network of Cu and Al phase played an important role on the mechanical results. The relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties is further discussed.
