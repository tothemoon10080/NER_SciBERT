Low-pressure gas adsorption experiments and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the microtopography of surfactant modified montmorillonites. These two methods not only permit measurement of the specific surface area, mapping the images of surfactant modified montmorillonites on the nano-scale, but also provide the possibility to determine surface roughness and irregularities. The fractal Frenkel–Halsey–Hill model (D

When the dosage of surfactant, expressed as a function of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), increased from 0.2 to 4 CEC, the fractal dimensions changed from D

                     =2.58 to 2.12, reflecting that the surface roughness of montmorillonite was influenced by surfactant loading. Higher surfactant loading caused smoother surfaces, which was consistent with the AFM observation.In the past decades, polymer/clay mineral nanocomposites have attracted great attention due to significant improvement of physical, mechanical and chemical properties compared to unmodified polymers ( Montmorillonite from different deposits and geneses show variation in chemical composition, content of impurity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), particle size and specific surface area (SSA). Clay scientists refer to an assembly of layers as a ‘particle’, and an assembly of particles as an ‘aggregate’ ( During the synthetic processing of clay based nanocomposites, besides the shape and size of organo-montmorillonite particles, attention should be paid on the surface microtopography. When a liquid substrate comes into contact with organo-montmorillonite, the organic material at the exterior surface of the composites particle interacts with the liquid ( Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have been used to observe the microstructure and morphology of the organo-montmorillonites ( The surface heterogeneity of a solid can contribute significantly to the fractal dimension, and the geometrical heterogeneities can be characterized in terms of the fractal dimension. For the clay minerals, the main surface heterogeneity includes different types of crystal planes, growth steps, crystal edges and corners, irregularities in the crystallographical structure of the surface such as cracks and flaws as well as functional groups and impurities ( To elucidate the surface microtopography of organo-montmorillonites and the effect of surfactant modification on the clay mineral surface, the nanometer scaled images from atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to investigate the micro- and nano- scale particles. In this study, mapping the surface of ultrafine montmorillonite particles was applied to provide topographical images of the surfaces at the nanometer scale. Fractal dimension methods were used to quantitatively characterize the surface microtopography of organo-montmorillonite. Our present study demonstrated that AFM is a powerful tool for the investigation of heterogeneous materials made from clay minerals. Combined with the gas adsorption technique, the research provides important information about the surface microtopography of organo-montmorillonites in nano-scale, which is of importance for industrial application of organo-montmorillonites. Montmorillonite (Mt) was obtained from Inner-Mongolia, China and purified by sedimentation. Its structural formula can be expressed as Na Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB) with a purity of 99%, provided by YuanJu Chem. Co., China was used as surfactant. An amount of 20 g montmorillonite was dispersed in about 200 ml of deionized water and the desired amount of CTMAB was slowly added. The amount of CTMAB varied from 0.2 to 4 CEC. The dispersions were stirred at 60 °C for 2 h. All products were washed free of bromide, tested by AgNO The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area, micropore and mesopore volume calculated from the N The pore structural parameters of original montmorillonite (NM) and organic montmorillonite, including Burne–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area and de Boer's The specific surface area of montmorillonite can be calculated from the “unit formula” and the unit cell parameters ( Compared with the specific surface area of untreated montmorillonite, the SSA of organic montmorillonite was very small, the internal surface area decreased from 14 m The raw montmorillonite and organic montmorillonite displayed The desorption branch of all isotherms showed an inflection point “knee” at about 0.45–0.5 P/P Fractal geometry has been used in some theoretical and experimental studies of adsorption on materials to describe the roughness or irregularities of surfaces ( Nitrogen adsorption at 77K is frequently used to determine the surface fractal dimension of porous materials. Several different theories have been developed to analyze gas adsorption data to obtain the fractal dimension (  Since the nitrogen molecules can hardly penetrate into the interlayer space of montmorillonite and organo-montmorillonite, the fractal dimension Above 2.0 CEC, the fractal dimensions, 2.6 for NK and 2.1for FHH, were almost invariable. Perhaps the primary reason is that the external surface and the jagged edge of clay have been covered by surfactant molecules. Typical AFM height and 3D images for Mt are shown in It is difficult to obtain montmorillonite surface images with high spatial resolution that can afford the identification and correlation of atomic-scale parameter. The AFM analysis of montmorillonites was more difficult than that of other clay minerals with larger crystals, such as mica or muscovite. Due to the tiny particles, a series of problems will be encountered in AFM analysis, such as sample preparation, particle picking, crystal face choosing, etc. Therefore, the atomic-scale resolution of AFM images of montmorillonite was presently impossible. Typical AFM height and 3D images for the organo-montmorillonites are shown in It is well known that the sign and density of the charges at the crystal edges depend on the pH of the dispersion. The edge surface of montmorillonite is positively charged at pH The microtopography of montmorillonite and CTMA derivatives has been studied using AFM and nitrogen adsorption methods. With increasing surfactant loading, the specific surface area decreased steeply, and the surface fractal dimension derived from nitrogen adsorption became smaller. The AFM images revealed the microtopography of the montmorillonites. The edge became more smooth with increasing surfactant loading. The surface structure revealed by AFM was in agreement with the fractal dimension analysis.
