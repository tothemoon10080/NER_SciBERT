The aim of the present method is to reduce the dimensional variability of asbestos, elongate mineral particles, and other asbestiform minerals for use in biological assays. Here, the pristine mineral sample is filtered through two nylon meshes of different sizes to obtain a narrower dimensional distribution following a power law. Furthermore, we show that anoxic preparation, autoclaving and storage of the mineral prior to addition into biological cultures did not affect the mineral's chemical properties. This approach avoids the use of highly reactive chemicals modifying mineralogical characteristics and surface properties, which can affect to a major extent mineral toxicity as well as interactions between minerals and biological matter or biofluids. The method can be combined with additional selective approaches to further refine the dimensional range of the minerals. The advantages of this protocol over previous methods are:

Successful sterilization of the resulting mineral particles for use in biological assays without compromising mineralogical characteristics. Applicability of this method across various types of asbestos, elongate mineral particles and, potentially, other hazardous minerals. Specifications table Asbestos is an industrial term that defines a group of regulated, naturally-occurring silicate minerals which, when inhaled, ultimately lead to diseases such as asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma Before working with any powdered materials, all equipment and utensils must be cleaned using 2-propanol or acetone (both water-miscible solvents). Additionally, all personnel must wear personal protective gear ( Chrysotile asbestos was obtained from the Balangero mine in Piedmont, Italy after industrial processing/purification. Tremolite-actinolite was obtained from Passo di Caldenno, in the Province of Sondrio, Italy as a rock with a weight of approximately 200 g. Both minerals were selected for this method because their mineralogical features have been previously characterized [ The 200 g rock containing elongate mineral particles of tremolite-actinolite was first broken into smaller pieces no larger than a couple of cm. This can be done with a hammer after the rock has been wrapped in at least three layers of wet paper towels, followed by at least three layers of plastic bags. Each rock piece was either selected for further manipulation or discarded after a preliminary naked-eye identification to confirm the presence of different phases of interest and their habit. Subsequently, the mineral fragments were visually separated with a 10X lens under a stereomicroscope (Leica M165 C stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica IC80 D camera and an LED illumination system) to remove visible impurities, other accompanying phases, and/or organic material/soil particles. Complex, heterogeneous, cm-wide fragments were further broken up using an agate mortar and pestle with 2-propanol until the pieces were mm-sized. The smaller fragments were inspected again under the stereomicroscope to repeat the purification step until all the mineral fragments appeared as a single phase under the stereomicroscope. At this stage, we observed that the broken fragments consisted of mostly bladed, fibrous (possibly asbestiform) and/or prismatic crystals. To ensure that only tremolite-actinolite particles were present, the pieces were transferred to a large beaker (600 mL) filled with distilled water and left to settle for 3 h at room temperature, as calculated after Pollastri et al. A small portion (about 4 mm The dried ground mineral was resuspended in 500 mL of distilled water in glass bottles, capped, and shaken to separate the particles. The suspension was then transferred to a vacuum filtration system (MilliporeSigma, see The entire suspension was initially allowed to filter through the 5 µm mesh to collect any particles larger than 5 µm. The use of a smaller mesh size (5 µm) before the larger mesh size (20 µm) turned out to be more effective than the other way around in reducing agglomeration of and clogging by massive bundles since smaller particles act as a binding material between larger particles and bundles. To facilitate the filtration process, we attached the system to a vacuum pump and constantly stirred the mineral suspension in a 1000 mL glass Büchner funnel while under vacuum to avoid fiber/particle agglomeration and laminar flow reduction through the mesh holes, which may promote alignment of elongated particles with the mesh holes and thus selection by particle width only. Two batches of 500 mL ground-mineral suspensions (about 10 mm Afterwards, the entire filter flask was thoroughly cleaned initially by wiping with 2-propanol soaked paper-towels, then by wiping and rinsing with distilled water before placing the 20 µm mesh on the filtration system. Distilled water was first filtered while placing a finger over the hose barb (where the vacuum pump would be connected during vacuum filtration) to prevent the water from just passing through the mesh due to the larger pore size. The previously obtained suspension of >5 µm fibers in the 600 mL beaker was poured into the water-containing Büchner funnel and the final volume was brought up to 1000 mL, using the extra volume to wash the 600 mL beaker. At this point, the finger slowly uncovered the hose barb, allowing the mineral suspension to filter through very quickly (though the process can be facilitated with a vacuum pump, if necessary). The suspension should be constantly stirred as it passes through the 20 µm mesh. Once this step is completed, the particles of interest are contained within the filtrate, whereas the mesh should hold all particles larger than 20 µm. The particles on the mesh can be saved, re-ground, and re-filtered. The “5–20” µm particle suspension in the filter flask was transferred to a large beaker and placed on a hot plate under low heat to slowly evaporate the distilled water. The beaker was removed when the water level reached approximately 50–100 mL and left to evaporate in a fume hood at room temperature. Subsequently, the beaker containing the “5–20” µm dry powder was kept covered with parafilm™. The dry powder can be resuspended in water or 2-propanol to prepare SEM stubs or TEM grids for further analyses. For use in biological assays, the filtered “5–20” µm particles were sterilized via autoclave in order to rule out potential contamination in downstream experiments. Dried particles were first carefully placed in glass containers and closed shut to prevent airborne particles from escaping ( Samples of both chrysotile and tremolite-actinolite before (pristine) and after (filtered) the protocol were transferred onto 12.7 mm metal stubs with conductive carbon tabs for analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Specifically, the mineral-particle suspension was initially vigorously shaken, and four droplets were deposited directly on the carbon tape avoiding contact between the pipette tip and carbon tape. The initial shaking and the fast evaporation of the 2-propanol in the fume hood helped in avoiding particle agglomeration. A FEI Quanta 600 FEG Mark II Field SEM was set to environmental mode with a voltage of 30 kV and a chamber pressure of 0.38 torr to image samples. Images were obtained in Secondary Electron (SE) mode at a magnification of 10 The SEM images were used to measure diameter ( Since we expected right-skewed distributions for our data, we first normalized it using the natural logarithm to obtain a bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. A double Grubb's test was subsequently applied to the normalized data distributions to remove outliers at both of its extremes, and the detected outliers were then removed from the original dataset. Treated data were distributed into a number of bins that were calculated using Scott's method The distribution calculated for the filtered mineral-particle populations showed a good rearrangement to generally lower values of Our statistical parameters ( According to the World Health Organization (WHO) The method described here has several advantages over previous methods. First, this method replaces the use of heavy liquids with distilled water, avoiding mineral-surface modifications and preparing selected fibers for direct transfer into biological experiments The authors certify that they have NO affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers’ bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.
