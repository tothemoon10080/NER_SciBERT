Slope stability mining radar in mine slope stability monitoring at open cast mines. It is development on the radar technology, is now being widely used in several countries to provide real time monitoring and advance warning signals before any slope or dump failure in open cast mines. Indian mines 80% mining is open cast and remaining underground mines. So Slope stability monitoring is a vital component in any surface mine and is an essential component for planning deeper and steeper deposits, in terms of economics and safety. Various methods of slope stability monitoring systems have evolved over the last few years. The usage of each monitoring system is governed by factors such as technology available and required accuracy. Similar mining radar involves in mine slope stability monitoring at open cast mines and radar waves adequately penetrate through rain, dust and smoke to give reliable measurements, 24hours a day.
