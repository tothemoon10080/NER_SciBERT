This paper focusses on preliminary analyses conducted to investigate the hierarchical decision-making structure of location and mode choice problems for non-work/school activities. The travel behaviour of two streams of individuals are studied separately. Nested logit models are tested using full information maximum likelihood method after estimating independent models for location and mode choice. The results show that individuals are more inclined to change their destination rather than their mode. The architectural framework of TASHA, the operational agent-based activity-based travel demand model of the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, will be redesigned in the light of these results and further analyses.
