One of the challenges in enhancing the performance of Lithium ion batteries for stable energy storage is looking beyond extraction of single electron per formula unit of cathode material during the delithiation without phase change of the material. We have investigated lithium ferrous silicate by partial substitution of lithium by sodium atoms using density functional theory to achieve this. Our calculations have suggested that the substitution of lithium with sodium in controlled amounts is just sufficient to provide structural and phase stability during delithiation process. The larger size of sodium atom assists in easier extraction of lithium ions by providing wider pathways. These studies suggest the possibility of extracting more than one Li-ion per formula unit making this a promising cathode material for use in Li-ion battery applications.The decreasing level of fossil fuels and an escalating demand for energy globally, has resulted in urgent need not only to generate energy but also to store it using rechargeable batteries. This will enable in making available energy generated especially from non-conventional energy sources, as a sustainable option for long term use. A battery is a transducer that converts chemical energy into electrical and vice versa One of the key features of lithium ion battery is that the lithium ion participates at both electrodes, being reversibly inserted and extracted from the electrode material Intensive research is being pursued to improve the performance of these orthosilicates by implementing techniques such as coating with carbon composite, doping with hetero atoms and reducing grain size First principles calculations using projected augmented wave (PAW) method within the density functional theory as instrumented in Veinna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) were performed Li Each lithium atom in Li The electronic properties can be used to investigate the feasibility of the materials to be used as electrode material for lithium ion batteries. In order to truly explore the potential of Li The DOS of both pure and sodium substituted Li The suitability of these materials as cathode material can be estimated by performing delithiation studies. Lithium atoms were extracted step by step for Li In summary, the P2 This work was supported financially by the
