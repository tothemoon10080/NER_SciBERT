This study describes a hydrometallurgical process to investigate the recovery of lithium from seawater using devised total process including an adsorption process with manganese oxide adsorbent and a precipitation process. First, precipitation experiments on Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, and Mn(OH)2 from CaCl2, MgCl2, and MgCl2 in NaOH-H2O solutions were carried out under various conditions of reaction temperature (25–90°C), NaOH concentration (7–14 pH), and initial amount of CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2 (10 and 100mmol/dm3). The obtained results showed that there was a need to divide the precipitation process into two steps based on the precipitation characteristics of the target elements in NaOH (or HCl)-H2O solutions. These two steps consist of a first stage with precipitation of Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, and Mn(OH)2 by NaOH and a second stage with Li2CO3 recovery by neutralization using HCl, carbonation using Na2CO3, and concentration using evaporation. Chemical modeling with OLI-Systems® software was used to interpret the precipitation behavior of target elements in the first and second stages; it was compared with available experimental data and good agreement was found. On the basis of the above data, it was possible to separate Ca, Mg, and Mn under pH values ranging from 11.5 to 12.5 in the first stage after the process of seawater adsorption with manganese oxide adsorbent and to recover crystalline Li2CO3 with high purity (over 99%) carbonated by Na2CO3 in the second stage, involving neutralization by adjusting the pH value in the range of 6–8 and evaporation at 100°C to obtain the product with high yield.Since less than 100 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent was consumed per annum in the early 20th century, it could be used without difficulty to achieve improved applications in various fields for batteries, lubricating grease, frit, glass, air-conditioning, aluminum, pharmaceuticals, polymers, and other products ( However, the adsorption method has some demerits in terms of the separation and recovery of high-purity lithium from seawater. Undesired species, such as Ca, Mg, Mn, Na, and K, are adsorbed along with Li by the adsorbent ( Chemical modeling involving multiple chemical equilibria can be used to predict an aqueous processing system with the required temperature and concentration; OLI-Systems® software, which chemically provides for the rigorous computation of the principal thermodynamic properties including Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity and volume in an aqueous electrolyte solution, can be used to fit chemical equilibria of a target material in acidic or alkali solutions ( Lithium chloride (LiCl), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), calcium chloride (CaCl All experiments were carried out by putting the desired amount of each reagent into 150 To measure the pH of target solutions, hydrogen ion concentration was checked using a pH meter (Horiba, F-52). The samples with appropriate pH and reaction temperature were filtered from solution on a 0.5 To identify the crystalline phases of product produced from the final precipitation, the obtained sample was measured using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X’pert PRO) for mineralogical analysis. The chemical reaction in the precipitation of Ca(OH) Under high alkali conditions, the concentration of Ca (or Mg and Mn) exceeds its solubility. Then, Ca (or Mg and Mn) cations under the saturated conditions directly form Ca (or Mg and Mn) hydroxide. Reaction temperature, NaOH concentration (pH value), initial amount of CaCl In order to predict the effect of reaction temperature on the precipitation behavior of Ca(OH) The effect of initial amount of CaCl The precipitation behavior of Ca(OH) Among adsorbents used in the adsorption process for lithium recovery from seawater, spinel-type hydrous manganese oxides are interesting materials with high affinity toward lithium ions, and many kinds of lithium ion-sieves, such as λ-MnO To achieve high yield of Li from residual hydrochloric acid solutions containing CaCl After adsorption and desorption processes, as shown in Lithium carbonate produced by carbonation in the second stage can appear and reduce the yield compared with that expected because its precipitation in residual solutions after the first stage depends on the solubility limits in terms of alkali concentration. Therefore, the effect of pH value, in the range from 0 to 14, on the precipitation of Li Li, K, and Na remain as LiCl, KCl, and NaCl in the residual solutions after neutralization. Following the carbonation process in the second stage, lithium is precipitated as Li Lithium recovery from seawater is directly affected by the residual concentrations of CaCl separation of Ca(OH) neutralization of residual solutions after removal of Ca, Mg, and Mn by adjusting the pH value to 7.0 using HCl; carbonation of residual LiCl and KCl in neutralized solutions using Na On the basis of the above assumptions, the formulas below were used to calculate the respective residual concentrations of Li Here, [LiCl] Here, Y The recovery of high-purity Li This study describes a hydrometallurgical process to investigate the recovery of lithium from seawater. Using the obtained results on the precipitation of Ca(OH) First stage: Ca(OH) Second stage: Li, Na, and K remained as LiOH, KOH, and NaOH in residual solutions after the first stage because they are stable as soluble Li On the basis of these results, a high yield of crystalline Li
