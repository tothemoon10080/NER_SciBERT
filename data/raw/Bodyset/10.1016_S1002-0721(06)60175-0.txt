REE geochemical characteristics of the magmatic rocks and gold deposits in Shizishan ore-field of Tongling were studied. Three types of the magmatic rocks have almost the same chondrite-normalized REE patterns, Eu and Ce anomalous values, and ΣREE, ΣLREE/ΣHREE regular changes, which indicates that their magmas come from the same source and their digenetic mechanism is fractional crystallization. In three gold deposits, the mineral ores and related altered rocks have similar chondrite-normalized REE patterns and sharp Eu positive anomalous values. The REE contents reduced from the magmatic rocks to skarnization or alteration magmatic rocks, skarn type ores, sulphide type ores, wall-rocks limestone or marble. The REE geochemical characteristics of the ores and related rocks show that primary fluids originated from magmatic differentiation in lower pressure of shallow crust, ore-forming hydrothermal solutions gained REE and mineralization elements further from leaching the magmatic rocks, then superimposed and reformed the limestones or marbles and deposited ore-forming material.
