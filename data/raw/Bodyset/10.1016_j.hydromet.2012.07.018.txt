This work presents the results of the tungsten recovery from a wolframite concentrate (61.5% WO3) from Igarapé Manteiga (Rondônia — Brazil) after fusion with NaOH followed by leaching with water. The optimum fusion conditions required temperatures above 550°C to avoid partial manganese leaching. 98.6% of tungsten was leached as Na2WO4 after fusion at 650°C for 1h. More than 99% of the element was extracted in one stage with Aliquat 336 or Alamine 336 (5–10vol.% in kerosene, A/O=1 (v/v), 25°C). Stripping was easily performed in one stage (>99.9%) with 2molL−1 NH3(aq.) (A/O=1v/v, 25°C) when Alamine 336 was the extractant. Tungsten was recovered as ammonium paratungstate (APT).At present, world's reserves of tungsten are estimated to be 3 Most tungsten ores contain less than 1% WO Alkali leaching (NaOH or Na Solvent extraction (SX) is a very useful technique to recover tungsten from its leachates ( Aliphatic amines have been widely employed as extractants ( The objective of this work is to develop a process for recovering tungsten from the above concentrate via fusion with sodium hydroxide, followed by water leaching and SX. A wolframite concentrate (61.5% WO NaOH was chosen as the reactant. Fusion can be accomplished at lower temperature than Na The theoretical reactant/concentrate mass ratio is 0.31:1. A 15% excess of NaOH was used. 10 Two extractants were tested: Aliquat 336 (methyl-trioctyl/decyl ammonium chloride) and Alamine 336 (trioctyl/decylamine), dissolved in deodorized aliphatic (> The wolframite concentrate and all solids and solutions obtained during its processing were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (Shimadzu XRF 800HS). Calibration curves (0.1–1000 After fusion at 650 The maximum amount of leached tungsten was 98.6 The concentrations of some elements in the leachate are given in Experiments performed at 450 and 550 These reactions involve consumption of NaOH during fusion, thus reducing the amount available to react with tungsten. After leaching the fused mass with water a deep green color characteristic of manganate(VI) ions (MnO In the pH range tested (1–5), more than 99.9% of tungsten was extracted in one stage using Aliquat 336 (10 If an anionic exchange process is admitted, the behavior of Aliquat 336 (a quaternary amine) may be understood taking into account the following equation: (W When Alamine 336 (5–10 This reaction demonstrates that the extraction of tungsten is dependant on the pH. The yield rapidly decreased as pH increased; at pH 3 only 5% of the element was extracted. Neutralization of the acidic solution after SX of tungsten did not produce any detectable precipitate. Stripping of tungsten loaded in the organic phase with NH APT was obtained with high purity ( 98.6% of tungsten was recovered from the wolframite concentrate of Igarapé Manteiga after fusion with sodium hydroxide (650 Aliquat 336 (5–10 J.
