The basic physicochemical properties of the iron ore materials defines the high reducibility, high temperature of the softening beginning and the small temperature interval of the softening and melting. Influence of the softening and melting interval of iron ore materials on technical and economical parameters of a number of blast furnaces of the Russian plants is calculated using the two-dimensional mathematical model of the blast furnace process. The analysis of influence of the softening and melting temperatures on the location and form of the cohesive zone is made using the complex of the two-dimensional mathematical models of the blast furnace process. In addition the degree of iron reduction in the bulk of the furnace is also considered. Possibility of the taking into account the quality influence the softening properties on the location and form of cohesive zone in the conditions of the radial nonuniform taking into account the blast furnace profile is established.
