Pressure acid leaching was used to extract niobium and tantalum from a ferrocolumbite ore. The leaching was carried out in a pressure reactor using hydrofluoric acid as leachant. Various parameters, such as temperature, reaction time, HF concentration, stirring speed, particle size and solid-to-liquid ratio in the leaching process, were optimized. The reactants and products were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and specific surface area (BET). Experimental results showed that the maximum extraction of Nb and Ta, 90 and 80% respectively, it was achieved at an HF concentration of 9% v/v, reaction temperature of 220°C, particle size of −45μm, solid-to-liquid ratio of 1.82% w/v and reaction time of 80min. Crystalline structures, different from those originally present in the ore, were not detected by XRD analysis of the leaching residues.Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical methods at atmospheric pressure have been widely used for the extraction of Nb and Ta from minerals and other Nb-Ta-bearing materials. However, pressure leaching at elevated temperatures has not yet been extensively studied ( The production of technical grade Nb  The operating variables affecting the autoclave leaching of a ferrocolumbite ore in HF-carboxylic acid media have also been investigated, and it was found that the addition of tartaric and oxalic acids led to Nb and Ta recoveries over 90% ( Other authors investigated the recovery of niobium and tantalum from ore by using highly concentrated caustic potash as an alternative to hydrofluoric acid and they concluded that almost complete extraction of both niobium and tantalum is achieved at temperatures above 300 The extraction kinetics of tantalum using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from a Ta–Nb alkaline leach solution was investigated ( The extraction of Ta (V) from aqueous sulfate/fluoride solution using trioctyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) in MIBK was also investigated ( The present study aimed to establish the optimal operational conditions for Ta and Nb extraction from a ferrocolumbite ore by HF pressure leaching. The ferrocolumbite ore was collected in San Luis Province, Argentina. This ore was ground in a disk mill to a particles size ranging between + The XRD diffractogram, obtained in a Rigaku D-Max III C equipment, operated at 35 The reactor consisted of a 450 For each test, the ore and the leaching solution were put into the reactor. The content was heated under constant stirring and at a heating rate of either 5 or 10 Taking into account the mineral formula and the fact that the dissolution with hydrofluoric acid is not selective, the reaction of dissolution of ferrocolumbite with HF may be represented by the following reaction: The oxide mineral conversion (X) was calculated as follows: The parameters studied in the leaching tests were temperature, solid-to-liquid ratio, acid concentration, reaction time, stirring speed and particle size. The effect of temperature on the leaching of Ta and Nb was evaluated in the range of 75 to 220 In The effect of solid-to-liquid ratio on leaching of Ta and Nb was studied from 0.36 to 3.64% w/v. Conditions of the autoclave leaching were as follows: temperature varying from 75 to 220  The effect of acid concentration on the leaching of Ta and Nb was investigated from 5 to 20% v/v at three different temperatures: 75, 123 and 220 The results shown in These results can be explained bearing in mind that increasing acid concentration results in an increase of the amount of F The influence of reaction time on the Ta and Nb extraction at different temperatures is shown in  These experiments agree with the known fact that the heterogeneous reaction between a mineral and a fluid reactant, either an acid or a base, is generally slow and sensitive to temperature ( The effect of stirring speed on ferrocolumbite dissolution was investigated from 110 to 550 The experimental results showed that a variation in the stirring speed from 110 to 550 The effect of particle size on the dissolution of Ta and Nb was studied from + The results indicated that changes in particle size affect slightly the extraction of niobium and tantalum in the range studied, which means that the increase in the solid surface area did not have a significant influence on the extraction of these metals, since, under such working conditions, the maximum degree of mineral liberation has been reached.  The diffractograms of residues do not show formation of crystalline structures different from those identified in the ore pattern. In addition, In summary, a process including the pressure leaching with HF was employed to extract niobium and tantalum from ferrocolumbite. The experimental results indicate that the augment in the leaching temperature, reaction time and HF concentration increases the dissolution of Ta and Nb oxides. Furthermore, the decrease in the particle size and solid-to-liquid ratio enhances the oxide extraction. The optimal conditions to achieve a niobium and tantalum extraction of 90 and 80%, respectively were as follows: HF concentration, 9% v/v; reaction temperature, 220
