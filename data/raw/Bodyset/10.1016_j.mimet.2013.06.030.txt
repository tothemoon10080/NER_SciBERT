The differential expression of extracellular thiol groups by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans grown on substrates Fe2+ and S0 was investigated by using synchrotron radiation based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) imaging and microbeam X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) mapping. The extracellular thiol groups (SH) were first alkylated by iodoacetic acid forming Protein-SCH2COOH and then the P-SCH2COOH was marked by calcium ions forming P-SCH2COOCa. The STXM imaging and μ-XRF mapping of SH were based on analysis of SCH2COO-bonded Ca2+. The results indicated that the thiol group content of A. ferrooxidans grown on S0 is 3.88 times to that on Fe2+. Combined with selective labeling of SH by Ca2+, the STXM imaging and μ-XRF mapping provided an in situ and rapid analysis of differential expression of extracellular thiol groups.Many studies have mentioned that acidophilic sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB), such as Sulfur produced by SOB can be stored in sulfur globules, located inside and/or outside the bacterial cell ( Several studies have been involved in thiol groups for sulfur activation. Thiol groups in a protein require modification if they are to be analyzed ( Synchrotron radiation is an ideal X-ray source for probing trace elements in biological samples with high sensitivities, high spatial resolutions and in situ analysis ( In the present study, synchrotron radiation based STXM imaging and μ-XRF mapping were applied for comparative analysis of the extracellular thiol groups of  In order to measure the quantities of extracellular thiol groups of All the samples were stored at 4 Due to the thiol groups on the cell surface selectively bonded with Ca The mapping of the spatial distribution for Ca The two-dimensional elemental imaging for Ca The typical two-dimensional STXM imaging of Ca was scanned at two energies which were selected as being before and on the absorption edge of NEXAFS spectra of calcium. NEXAFS spectra provided important information about the electronic and structural properties ( STXM images obtained by dual-energy contrast analysis for  It is worthy to note that although the mechanism of sulfur activation had been postulated to be related with thiol groups of outer membrane proteins, in situ observation of the thiol groups expression has not yet been detected before. In this study the STXM imaging of Ca In synchrotron μ-XRF analysis, the intensity and clarity of the fluorescence depend on the varied beam current intensity of X-ray with scanning time and the differences in size of the beam and the distance between detector and sample ( The μ-XRF mappings for the Ca content in the samples of Since the extracellular thiol groups of Synchrotron radiation based STXM analysis and μ-XRF mapping provide powerful tools for analysis of trace elements in biological samples. By selectively bonding to Ca We are grateful to the staff at beamlines BL08U1A and BL15U1 of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) for their help in beamline operation and data collection.
