A series of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) experiments, which entailed repeatedly switching between a CO (CO/H2/N2) and a CO2 (CO2/H2/N2) feed, were conducted in a fixed bed reactor over a cobalt-based catalyst. It is worth noting that the effect of the CO2 on the properties of a cobalt-based catalyst was very small under the reaction conditions we chose. There was no apparent catalyst deactivation at reaction temperatures of 180°C and 200°C when we continually alternated between the CO and CO2 feeds.
                  We observed dramatic changes in the catalyst activity and product selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation before and after the initial FTS for CO feed at 180°C. In addition, during the initial CO hydrogenation on the cobalt catalyst, both the olefin and paraffin formation rates suddenly changed from one pseudo-stable state to another. These differences may have been caused by liquid products, whether deposited on the catalyst surface or in the catalyst pores during CO FTS.
                  A mild catalyst deactivation was observed at the operating temperatures of 210°C and 220°C, respectively. According to the comparison we made between the conversion of the feed gases and the product formation rates for paraffin and olefin, and our speculations concerning possible side reactions, we conclude that the catalyst deactivation is possibly attributable to the re-oxidation by water.The low-temperature (180–250 As the cobalt catalysts used in FTS are relatively expensive (compared to the cost of iron), they need to have a high metal dispersion and long life to be able to offer a good balance between cost and performance Until recently, the effect of CO Furthermore, the chemical utilization of CO In the research described in this paper, we investigated the effect of CO The Co/TiO We loaded 1 Once the reduction was completed, we allowed the reactor to cool down to room temperature. The CO The monitored results for all the reaction conditions we conducted showed that 72 The tail gas was analyzed every 1.5 The reactant conversions and product selectivity for both the CO and CO The CO conversion, CH The conversions increased when the temperature rose from 180 On the other hand, the results for the CO Similarly to the CO conversion, the CO In comparison with CO hydrogenation, CO The C It is quite interesting to note that the CO It should be noted that when the CO and CO The CO and CO  It is note that although the C The light olefin and paraffin formation rates during the switching between the two feed gases as a function of time on stream are plotted in In summary, when the catalyst was deactivated at 210 In addition, the typical pattern of relatively low yields of ethene and ethane was obtained for the CO feed Because all the products of the CO  the CH the P the P With the subsequent repetition of alternation between the two feeds, we found that each of the paraffin formation rates maintained a pseudo-stable state. When the CO feed was initially introduced into the reactor, the time on stream was 73 each of the olefin products reached its highest rate and then decreased to a stable state, as shown in each of the paraffin products achieved its lowest rate, and then increased to a stable state (see each of the The data revealed that both the olefin and paraffin formation rates were suddenly changed from one pseudo-stable state to another during the initial run of CO hydrogenation. With subsequent repeated switching between the two feeds, we found that both the paraffin and olefin product formation rates and O/P ratio for the CO feed reverted to the values obtained with the time on stream from 120 to 144 Because that the catalyst was not apparently deactivated under reaction conditions at 180 One of the possible reasons for the observed significant changes during the first switching is the formation of the liquid phase either on the catalyst surface or in the catalyst pores. Some researchers Grounding our reasoning on the research reported in the literature and our own experimental results, we postulate that liquid products may be deposited on the catalyst surface or in the catalyst pores during CO FTS. For our experiments, when the CO FTS is a surface catalytic reaction. The H/C (hydrogen to carbon) concentration on the catalyst surface can affect the product selectivity of both of the CO and CO Because that a lower O/P ratio was obtained when the olefin and paraffin formation rates were suddenly changed from one pseudo-state to another during initially introducing the CO feed into the reactor as shown in  When mild catalyst deactivation was observed at a time on stream of 1600–2700 Therefore, we have to consider whether the production of CO Based on the discussion above, we suggest that the main cause of the mild catalyst deactivation we observed was catalyst re-oxidation by water. The cobalt oxide forms have activity for both the WGS and reverse WGS reactions (d). As previously mentioned, the liquid phase on the catalyst surface and in the catalyst pores may affect the catalyst activity and product selectivity. For instance, secondary olefin hydrogenation can be fostered by the liquid phase ( For the experimental work described in this paper, we prepared 10 We have shown that both CO and CO The data show that dramatic changes occurred in the catalyst activity and product selectivity for CO A mild catalyst deactivation was observed at the operating temperatures of 210 Although we could not explain the experimental phenomena fully, we must emphasize that the long term effect of CO The authors are grateful for the support received from Golden Nest International (Pty) Ltd., the National Research Foundation (NRF), the South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI), the Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (THRIP), the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and the South African National Energy Research Institute (SANERI).
