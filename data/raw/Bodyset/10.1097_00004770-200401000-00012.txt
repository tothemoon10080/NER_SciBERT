The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the mineral contents of root-canal dentin before and after treatment with two commonly used gutta-percha solvents: chloroform and halothane. Twenty extracted human premolars, whose crowns and apical thirds had been removed, were used. Pulp tissues were removed and the teeth were randomly divided into two groups including 10 teeth each. Root canals were enlarged with Gates Glidden burs (#1, 2, and 3). Dentin chips were obtained and saved in plates to serve as a control. Rootâ€“canal-dentin walls were then treated with chloroform or halothane for 15 min. Dentin chips were again obtained using Gates Glidden burs (#4, 5, and 6). The levels of five elements, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, and sulfur, in each specimen were analyzed using ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry) technique. Changes in the levels of the chemical elements were recorded. Differences between the groups were statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test. There was a significant decrease in Ca level and significant increase in Mg level after treatment with halothane (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in Mg level after treatment with chloroform. The changes in other elements levels after treatment with gutta-percha solvents were minimal and statistically not significant (p > 0.05). As a result it was concluded that gutta-percha solvents have effect on mineral contents of root dentin.
