Foam-based materials are promising micro-structured materials with interesting thermal and acoustical properties. The control of the material morphology requires counteracting all the destabilizing mechanisms during their production, starting with the drainage process, which remains to be understood in the case of the complex fluids that are commonly used to be foamed. Here we perform measurements for the drainage velocity of aqueous foams made with granular suspensions of hydrophilic monodisperse particles and we show that the effect of the particles can be accounted by two parameters: the volume fraction of particles in the suspension (

                     ) and the confinement parameter (

                     ), that compares the particle size to the size of passage through constrictions in the foam network. We report data over wide ranges for those two parameters and we identify all the regimes and transitions occurring in the

In particular, we highlight a transition which refers to the included/excluded configuration of the particles with respect to the foam network, and makes the drainage velocity evolve from its minimal value (fully included particles) to its maximal one (fully excluded particles). We also determine the conditions (

In the current climate of sustainable development, the production of foam-based materials is destined to expand. The matrix of those foamy materials is often composed of a complex fluid, such as a suspension for example. Typical examples for such mixtures can be found in the production of materials for the building industry The homogeneity of foamy materials can be drastically affected by the drainage of the interstitial phase (the continuous phase between the gas bubbles) and the simultaneous rising of the bubbles, resulting in the degradation of their quality and their functional properties. Note also that the drainage of the liquid phase – and the resulting increase of the gas volume fraction – promotes other detrimental aging processes, such as ripening and coalescence Very recently, some of these effects have been rationalized thanks to experiments with model systems, and the so-called confinement parameter These two mechanisms give some insight into the drainage of foams in the presence of suspended particulate matter. However, the complete understanding of drainage laws requires more experimental work with such model systems. In this paper, we perform new measurements for the drainage velocity of aqueous foams in the presence of spherical particles. Thanks to an improved sample’s generation method we obtain a new set of data for large Samples are prepared from precursor liquid foams which are subsequently mixed with granular suspensions, as described in a previous work The foaming solution contains 10 Bubbles are generated in a T-junction with two entries (nitrogen and foaming solution) and one exit (bubbly solution). The bubble diameter was varied in the range Once the column is filled, the foam is flushed towards a mixing device where the granular suspension is introduced. We have checked that the mixing device does not break bubbles. The parameters of the resulting foamy suspension are controlled by the relative flow rates of the precursor foam ( Then the foam tube is turned to the vertical and we start to measure the drainage kinetics of the sample. We follow the evolution of the height The mixing method reaches practical limits for high concentrations of large particles, i.e. In addition to the parameters Results for the reduced drainage velocity are presented as a function of For low and moderate particle volume fractions, i.e. For the highest investigated particle volume fractions, i.e. The reported drainage behavior can be interpreted in terms of foam permeability. We introduce the general equation of drainage for aqueous foams: Note that this velocity depends on the gas fraction initially set to the foam sample although In the following, we estimate This regime corresponds to particles suspended in the flowing interstitial liquid. It is expected that the foam permeability is equal to that of the particle-free foam with the same gas fraction, i.e. As already mentioned in Eq. Now we focus on the minimum value of the drainage velocity, which is observed for Note that for Obviously, for small particle concentrations, the assumption of particle packings does not hold anymore and another approach should be taken on. For In Whereas particle capture in the present system is expected to be ideally described by a step function at Insofar as the mechanisms leading to the observed velocity decrease have been already identified in As small particles, i.e. This drainage velocity corresponds to the minimal effect (drag) experienced by the draining liquid when particles are trapped in aqueous foams. Eq. Now we consider the transitional regime between the maximal drag configuration ( Note that In combination with Eq. Finally, we address the issue of the vanishing drainage velocity observed for sufficiently high particle concentrations, more precisely when For small As explained above, we stress that Eq. We have tackled the issue of foam drainage in the presence of hydrophilic spherical particles. Through a systematic study of the relevant parameters, i.e. the bubble diameter, the particle diameter, the gas volume fraction and the particle volume fraction, we extent the work performed in previous studies We would like to stress that this work could help researchers dealing with foam stabilization via hydrophobic particles to consider properly the effect of the unattached hydrophobic particles in the foam network. Besides, as the paper also reports the conditions for the foam drainage to be blocked, we anticipate that such a result could be applied to formulate rationally new foamed materials. Further work should aim in investigating the drainage of polydisperse granular suspensions that are more likely to be used in practical situations. We thank D. Hautemayou and C.
