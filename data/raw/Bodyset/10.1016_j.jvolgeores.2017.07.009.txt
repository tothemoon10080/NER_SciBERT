                      represents the failure time. Observations from laboratory creep failure experiments and precursors to volcanic eruptions are used to test the validity of the approach. Both cumulative and simple moving window techniques are developed to perform predictions and to illustrate the effects of data selection on the results. Laboratory creep failure experiments on granites show that the linear relation works well during the final approach to failure. For blind prediction, the simple moving window technique is preferred because it always uses the most recent data and excludes effects of early data deviating significantly from the predicted trend. When the predicted results show only small fluctuations, failure is imminent.Accelerating precursors exhibited by response quantities, such as strain, acoustic emission and seismic events, have been widely accepted as a significant way to predict the time-to-failure. Rates of ground deformation and of local fracturing of the crust or volcanic edifice ( Such acceleration precursors have been confirmed in the laboratory ( A power law relation of the rates of response quantities with respect to the time-to-failure Eqs. Thus, by linearly extrapolating the curve of the inverse rate to zero, the failure time However, the exponent An alternative relation ( In order to highlight the potential of predicting the failure time through monitoring the evolution of Creep failure experiments were performed on prismatic granite blocks ( The experimental protocol is illustrated in Whether a true steady state phase exists, with zero acceleration (constant rate), remains open to debate, and will be discussed in During the tertiary stage before failure, both the strain rate and acceleration increase rapidly and Because Eq. To examine the effects of data point selection on the predicted results, two methods are used: one using all data points, and beginning from some fixed point; and the other using only the most recent data points. In the first method, designated as the “ The two methods are illustrated for three experiments in The predictions are performed in hindsight because the data used for prediction are recognized as a failure precursor that can be described by Eq. Two data sets are used to demonstrate the application to both methods to volcanic eruptions. Data are used from (i) tiltmeter FAMOUS during the growth of a lava dome at Mount St. Helens in October 1986 (  It is not straightforward to determine the actual time when strain acceleration begins. An almost linear secondary creep stage (or stable stage) is usually observed in rock creep experiments. In the present experiments, this is confirmed by a horizontal portion on the strain rate versus time curve ( The inevitable fluctuation in the rate and acceleration data, resulting from the differentiation of the original noisy data is the main cause of scatter in Some data on the curve of Only data close to failure time can be described by Eq. For both the classical FFM ( For point data, such as seismic events, a method developed in Our new method provides a mechanism to perform the prediction without the premise of knowing the exponent beforehand. The failure time can be estimated directly through monitoring the evolution of the response quantity, i.e. It should be mentioned that the proposed model identifies conditions for bulk failure, and not for an eruption. Once bulk failure occurs, magma will need time to ascend to the surface. Model failure times are thus expected to occur before observed eruption times. In the present paper, field data for two eruptions have been compared with the results from creep tests in the laboratory. However, additional loading conditions may also occur before eruption ( A critical linearized relation Eq. The method gives a good prediction for the time to creep failure and for some volcanic eruptions. The predicted results are generally slightly earlier than the real time-to-failure, and thus can warn of the impending failure. During the final phase of the accelerating stage, the data in the time sequences give almost the same prediction by each of the methods proposed. Thus, it is better to capture the data as early as possible to provide the earliest possible warning of the failure time. For blind predictions, the simple moving technique is more suitable for practical applications. This process uses only the most recent data, and excludes the influence of data that deviate significantly from the critical linear trend Eq. This work is supported by
