Al-Si-Mg-Ti alloys reinforced with egg shell particles were synthesized by stir casting process. Microstructures of the fabricated composites were examined using colour metallographic technique and the mechanical properties of the composites: elastic behaviour, ultimate tensile strength and fracture toughness were investigated using tensile studies. The dispersion of egg shell particles found easier as their specific gravity matches with aluminium alloys. The microstructure of the Al/Egg shell composites revealed aluminium matrix, hard intermetallic phase consisting of Al2Si, Mg2Si, Al3Ti and dispersed particles of CaO. The intermetallic phases found segregated along interdendritic arms. The addition of egg shell also resulted in grain refinement of Al alloys. The yield strength and UTS showed both increasing and decreasing trends. At lower wt.% of egg shell the tensile strength decreased due to formation of rosette grouping. However higher additions (>1.5 wt.%) had increased yield strength and UTS. The yield point of Al alloys became obvious by the addition of egg shell particles.
