The kinetics of pressure leaching high iron sphalerite concentrate was studied. The effects of agitation rate, temperature, oxygen partial pressure, initial acid concentration, particle size, iron content in the concentrate and concentration of Fe2- added into the solution on the leaching rate of zinc were examined. The experiment results indicate that if the agitation rate is greater than 600 r/min, its influence on Zn leaching rate is not substantial. A suitable rise in temperature can facilitate the leaching reaction, and the temperature should be controlled at 140–150 °C. The increase trend of Zn leaching rate becomes slow when pressure is greater than 1.2 MPa, so the pressure is controlled at 1.2–1.4 MPa. Under the conditions of this study, Zn leaching rate decreases with a rise in the initial sulfuric acid concentration; and Zn leaching rate increases with a rise of iron content in the concentrate and Fe2- concentration in the solution. Moreover, the experiment demonstrates that the leaching process follows the surface chemical reaction control kinetic law of “shrinking of unreacted core”. The activation energy for pressure leaching high iron sphalerite concentrate is calculated, and a mathematical model for this pressure leaching is obtained. The model is promising to guide the practical operation of pressure leaching high iron sphalerite concentrate.
