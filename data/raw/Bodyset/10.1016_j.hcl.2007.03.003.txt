Distal radius fractures are among the most common fractures encountered by orthopedic surgeons. Because of many fracture patterns and types, it has been difficult to develop a comprehensive classification. Treatment options vary depending on injury severity and stability of the fracture reduction. Closed reduction and immobilization can be used for stable fractures. Common surgeries include pinning with and without external fixation and open reduction and internal fixation. Technological advances such as locking and fixed angle plates have made the volar approach feasible. Dorsal plating with low profile plates and fragment-specific techniques can be successful in treating distal radius fractures. Following fracture reduction and stabilization, assessment of distal radioulnar joint stability is essential and must be stabilized when necessary.
