A formula of calculating curvature radius was deduced according to the theory of rolling, together with the characteristics of rolling process. Moreover, the simulation of producing process is represented. Simulating results indicate that the curvature radius could be reduced by increasing friction coefficient, friction coefficient ratio, reduction or roller radius, while it could be augmented by increasing the thickness of plate. Furthermore, increasing the thickness of plate would cause more effects on front end curvature, whereas reduction would do less. The result provides theoretic basis for eliminating the front end curvature in plate and sheet rolling process, and it is important to protect controlling equipment and reduce scrap as well.
