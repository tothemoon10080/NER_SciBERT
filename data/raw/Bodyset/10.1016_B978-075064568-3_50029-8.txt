This chapter delineates theory of orthokinetic flocculation that can be derived for a constant velocity gradient (uniform shear field, as for a Newtonian fluid shear stress, is proportional to velocity gradient) and it shows that the theory has been extended to velocity gradients that has created turbulent flow conditions, such as paddle stirrers, baffled channels, oscillating paddles, and fluidized beds. This chapter also discusses further development of the concept of solid particle nuclei for fluidized bed flocculation. The combination of a paddle flocculator within a fluidized bed produces much denser flocs by the turbulent eddies, which provide pressure gradients on the flocs. The high density enables high up-flow rates through such modified floc blanket clarifiers and helps in squeezing out interstitial water.
