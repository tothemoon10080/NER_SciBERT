The effect of various factors on the particle size of precipitated calcium carbonate formed in a wet carbonation process has been investigated experimentally. The calcium carbonate particles were fabricated in a glass reactor by bubbling CO2 through a calcium hydroxide solution of 2.5% by weight. The particle size distribution of the particles was determined using a laser technique. The operating factors investigated include the CO2 bubble size (with frit pore size of 17–40 or 101–160μm), the CO2 gas flow rate (3.5 and 4L/min), the CO2 concentration (25 and 100%), the reaction temperature (25 and 80°C) and the additives (terpineol 0.1 and 1vol%, EDTA 0.25 and 1wt%). It was found that the average particle size was between 1 and 3μm. The particle size was reduced slightly with the decrease of the CO2 bubble size, and decrease of the CO2 concentration. The particle size distribution was affected significantly by the addition of terpineol and EDTA, but not necessarily reduced as reported previously.Calcium carbonate (CaCO Techniques to manufacture CaCO There have been a number of studies on the precipitation process in the literature. It has been shown that the characteristics of the particles such as the morphology and particle size can vary greatly in the process. According to Xiang et al. Using surfactants and additives during the precipitation process can modify certain properties of the final precipitate. Researchers have used modifiers such as terpineol, Calcium Lignosulphate, Dispex A40V, Dispex A40, poly acrylic acid and octadecyl dihydrogen phosphate, the effect of which are discussed briefly below.            Research by Agnihotri et al. In the carbonation process, the initial pH levels of the solution does have effects on the morphology of the particles as shown in a study conducted by Cheng et al. Yu et al. From experiments conducted by Wei et al. Suspension concentration also had an effect on the morphology of the CaCO In summary, the parameters that contribute to the change in the particle size of CaCO In spite of the above results, there is still a lack of clear understanding of how the PCC particles of desired size can be produced with a combination of the above operating parameters. This work studied the effect on the particle size distribution of the PCC particles of the following operating factors: the CO The reactor used to manufacture the PCC particle is schematically shown in Due to CaCO The standard procedure of a typical experiment is as follows: first of all, 5 The parameters that have been investigated are CO The particle size distribution of the manufactured particles was determined using a particle sizing machine Malvern Mastersizer 2000. This machine utilizes low angle light scattering technique to determine the particle size based on the Mie theory The machine is ready for measurement as soon as the laser obscuration by the particles is sufficient. As the sample is fed through the machine, the particles will pass by a laser beam. As the laser hits an individual particle, there will be a slight deflection of the beam. This deflection is then registered by the photodiode sensor. This process essentially assigns the laser deflection to a predetermined corresponding particle size that would cause the laser to deflect by that amount. During the particle sizing it was found that the particles were highly agglomerated and ultrasound can break up the particles effectively, as can be seen in As shown in  The effect of temperature on the particle size distribution is shown in Temperature had a pronounced effect on the particle size distribution of the produced particles. The effect of temperature was different for EDTA and terpineol addition. The effect of temperature was more significant when terpineol was added. When terpineol was added, the particle size distribution curves moved to the lower side at higher temperature. The average particle size changed from about 2.5 It appears that the effect of temperature was not sensitive to the amount of terpineol added in the range of 0.1 and 1 When EDTA was added, the effect of temperature was not consistent in all cases. It appears that the particle size distribution became narrower at 80 The effect of temperature was not sensitive to the amount of EDTA added in the range of 0.25 and 1 The above results are different from those reported in the literature. The average particle size (1–3 The effect of CO The effect of EDTA addition on the particle size distribution is summarised in The sample with no additives had three peaks, two of which were in the large particle size range. These two peaks represent the agglomerates that could be due to some primary particles lumped together or some large particles. Addition of EDTA helped eliminate the two peaks and achieved a more even distribution of particles. After adding EDTA of various amounts, the primary particle sizes of the samples with EDTA became slightly larger than the sample without additives. When the amount of EDTA increased from 0.25 to 1 The effect of terpineol addition on particle size distribution is summarised in With the addition of terpineol, the particle size distribution became more even. The particle size was increased after adding terpineol at ambient temperature. However the particle size became smaller at 80 When the amount of terpineol was increased from 0.1 to 1 The effect of CO It has been reported in the literature that the particle size correlates well with the carbonation reaction rate. A higher carbonation rate results in a smaller particle size. This work did not confirm this. As shown in This work confirmed the following literature results: the particle size decreases with the decrease of bubble size, and the decrease of CO There was a good correlation between the pH value and the average particle size, and a higher pH value corresponds with a smaller particle size. This is perhaps due to the effect of pH on the nucleation rate of CaCO The average particle size of calcium carbonate fabricated in a precipitation process at ambient temperature was typically between 1 and 3 The authors are grateful to Prof. Max Lu and Mr. Luke Matthew for their support in laboratory work.
