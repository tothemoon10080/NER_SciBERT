One of the main concerns in the production of electrolytic copper powder is stabilisation. Nonstabilised powder has a large surface area exposed to the effects of oxygen and moisture from the air. This leads to oxidation and formation of corrosion products on the grain surface and, in this way, the powder becomes unsuitable for sintering.
                  Stabilisation is mostly obtained by interaction between the clean surface of the electrodeposited copper powder and a solution of an active substance, which inhibits the corrosion of copper powders.
                  This work describes the stabilisation of copper powders using a new method. The oxygen content, moisture content, and corrosion resistance of the stabilised electrolytic copper powder were determined. These values are compared with the corresponding values of other corrosion inhibitors of copper powder.Copper has been studied more extensively than any other metal, both theoretically and from the point of view of the development of technology for powder production The largest consumer of copper powder is the electrotechnical industry, particularly the manufacturers of electricity generators and motors. Copper powders have attracted attention as good conductive materials as their conductivity is higher than that of nickel powders Electrolysis is not only the most economical method for the recovery of copper powder, but also the obtained copper powder is of the highest quality. The electrolytic powder consists of particles whose dimensions and forms are more suitable for practical applications than powders obtained in other ways. The major advantage of electrolytic methods over other methods lies in the possibility of conducting the process under conditions such that powders with a wide range of apparent density are obtained (0.4–4.0 g/cm According to High purity, low oxygen content, good resistance to oxidation. Dendritic particle shape, good green strength. This combination of properties means that the powders are suitable for the manufacture of carbon brushes and sintered high-conductivity copper parts, as well as friction materials for brakes and clutches. However, copper powders have a high chemical activity because of the large surface area and so readily react with oxygen in air either to form surface oxides or to burn spontaneously Little is known about the corrosion and inhibition of fine copper powders, although copper wires and plates have been studied and the stabilisation of copper has been the subject of several research works It has been shown that copper powder treated with benzotriazole has an increased resistance to oxidation in air at elevated temperatures. The washing of powder in water followed by washing in a weak solution of sodium carbonate to neutralize any traces of acid has been recommended The purpose of this study was to investigate the corrosion of copper powders, surface treatment, and inhibition by benzoic acid, and to obtain some information on the stabilisation of copper powders. The experiments were performed in an enlarged laboratory plastic reactor with a cell volume of 10 dm The enlarged laboratory reactor had a circulation pump, inlet and outlet for the electrolyte, and a heat exchanger. The latter controls the electrolyte temperature. The electrolyte was pumped from a basement storage tank to the enlarged laboratory reactor (electrolyte circulation rate: 0.11 dm The cell was loaded with four copper cathodes at a spacing of 30-mm centres [each holding four vertical copper rods (120 mm long, 8 in mm diameter)] and five copper anodes (120×120×10 mm), which were hung between the cathodes. The distance between the anodes was 60 mm from centre to centre of each anode. The electrodes in the cell were parallel with each other. The electrolyte was prepared from technical-grade chemicals and demineralized water. The electrolytic copper powder was deposited galvanostatically at a current density of 3600 A/m Washing and drying of the copper powder are important operations in the technology of electrolytic copper powder production. Oxidation of the deposit does not occur during its formation in acid electrolytes The wet powder was washed several times with a large amount of demineralized water until the wet powder was free from traces of acid. Acids promote rapid oxidation of the powder during drying. It is essential that the washing takes place immediately, so that oxidation of copper particles is precluded. To inhibit oxidation, some colloidal substances or those consisting of large molecules were added as additives to the water used for washing the copper powder, to protect the powder against subsequent oxidation (see The powder was then dried in a tube furnace under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere at 110–120 °C. The oxygen and copper contents, as well as the moisture and corrosion resistance of the stabilised electrolytic copper powder, were determined in an atmosphere containing CO The copper content was determined by an electrogravimetric method, where the copper was quantitatively deposited on a cathode from solutions acidified by sulphuric and nitric acids The moisture content of the copper powder was determined using a gravimetric method, where the sample was dried at high temperature (105–110 °C) under vacuum to constant mass The corrosion resistance was determined by an accelerated method Quantitative microstructural analyses of the copper powder were performed using a Leica Q500 MC (digital camera system). The powders were prepared and manipulated by Leica Microsystems (Wetzlar, Germany). Photomicrographs of the powder particles were taken at magnifications of ×200, ×1000, and ×3500 using a JOEL T20 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The apparent density of the copper powder was 0.608 g/cm The maximal (max), minimal (min), and average values (mean) of the parameters that characterize a metal powder, as well as the maximum relative error (RSE), are presented in The symbols used have the following meanings:        Typical SEM photomicrographs of copper powder are presented in It is known that corrosion processes occur exclusively at the boundary between the surface of a powder particle and the liquid phase. In this way, it is possible to imagine that moisture adsorption can be prevented by the formation of a film on the surface of the powder particles, which could enable their long-term and safe protection. In relation to this, it was necessary to find stabilizers that would enable the creation of hydrophobic adsorption films on the surface of the powder particles, which would be able to protect and stabilize the metal surface from the effect of moisture As one of the numerous types of stabilisers, high-molecular-weight substances are used, which are characterized by the presence of polarless inert hydrocarbon radicals R or heteropolar molecules, which usually possess free functional groups. These can form typical chemical bonds with the ions that are present on the surface of high-dispersed metals. Here, not only do the attraction forces have an effect, but also the repulsion forces of molecules and water, which create the obviously expressed hydrophobic properties of the film formed on the surface of powder particles. The longer the hydrocarbon length is, the stronger is the reciprocal effect (i.e., hydrophobicity and stability) It is obvious from It appears that the main condition for adequate protection of copper powders is that the particle surface is made hydrophobic. This leads to the conclusion that the best method for testing a stabilised powder is the determination of its wettability with water or aqueous solutions of acids and alkalis. This method gives objective data about the effectiveness of stabilising additives and, as a result, it allows judgement about the probable corrosive stability of processed powders during their contact with moisture and corrosive agents. The wettability and corrosive stability of copper powder with benzoic acid are dependent on concentration, as shown in The corrosive stability, or weight gain, of copper powders, which had been stabilised using different corrosion inhibitors, is shown in The assumption is that benzoic acid produces a film on the copper surface, consisting of a mixture of copper oxides and benzoic acid, which is a very effective inhibitor of copper. The benzoic acid composite film inhibits the corrosion of copper powders without decreasing their conductivity. The corrosion of copper powder in moist air can generally be expressed as follows: Anode reaction (oxidation): Cu→Cu Cathode reaction (reduction): 1/2O That is, during corrosion of copper powders, a transfer of electrons and H The oxygen content in copper powder stabilised by benzoic acid is below the allowed limit of 0.15% (0.09%) and is less than those stabilised by benzotriazole (0.13%) and sodium soap G-30 (0.18%) An identical situation exists with the moisture content (maximum allowed content is 0.05%): benzoic acid–0.01%, benzotriazole–0.05%, and SAP G-30–0.08%. This has been confirmed by a large number of tests.  The possibility of protecting copper powders from corrosion during production and long-term storage has been shown. It has been found that the most effective protection is obtained with stabilisers, which make the surface of powder particles more hydrophobic. From all the tested organic substances, benzoic acid proved itself to be the best stabiliser.
