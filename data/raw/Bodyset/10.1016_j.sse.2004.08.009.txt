We have fabricated highly stable organic electroluminescent devices based on spin-coated poly-p-phenylene-vynylene (PPV) thin films. The electrical properties of aluminum cathode, prepared by ion beam assisted deposition, on PPV have been investigated and compared to those by thermal evaporation. Although energetic particles of Al assisted by Ar+ ion may damage the organic material, I–V–L characteristics are improved by applying thin Al buffer layer. In addition, a dense Al cathode inhibits the permeation of H2O and O2 into PPV film through pinhole defects, and thus retards dark spot growth. It may be deduced from highly packed structure of Al cathode with smaller junction resistance between Al and PPV. In conclusion, the lifetime of organic light-emitting device (OLED) has been extended effectively by dense Al film through ion beam assisted deposition process.Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years because of their potential advantages in low-power, emissive, flexible, cost-competitive, flat panel displays One of the most important factors limiting the durability of OLEDs is the degradation of electron injecting contact. In OLEDs metal cathode layer is commonly deposited by thermal evaporation to minimize the damages of organic materials. In case of using energetic process, such as sputtering, energetic atoms and ions are incident on the organic surface and transfer their energy to the surrounding organic molecules. The interactions between ions and solids can cause substantial damages to organic materials and result in degraded device performance In this paper, we develop the dense aluminum cathode with ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) process to protect OLED device from the O Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass was used as the substrate for OLEDs and it was approximately 200 The Al cathode depositions by IBAD were made in two different conditions, one with the thermally evaporated Al buffer layer about 300  The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of bare PC (polycarbonate) and samples of varying Al deposition process on PC substrate were measured using a MOCON instrument over a range of temperatures varying from 27.8 to 37.8 In The current–voltage ( The From the log In forward bias ( The  When the current density increased above 20 The low-junction resistance reduces a thermal problem caused by joule heating at Al/PPV interface during the device operation. And the constant current test was executed to characterize the lifetime of ion beam assisted, buffered Al device ( The devices with ion beam assisted Al cathodes with buffer layer showed higher current level and luminescence and it indicated lower serial resistance ( Impedance measurements were performed with a Solartron SI1287 impedance analyzer using a frequency range of 20 In this plot the implicit variable is the frequency that increases from right to left (20 Since the contact area between Al and PPV is inversely proportional to the junction resistance and, the junction resistance is less in IBAD case with larger contact area. But there are some problems to conclude that small junction resistance is caused by only large contact area because leakage current is induced at reverse bias regime ( Additionally, Ar In summary, Al cathode deposited by IBAD has the advantage over that by thermal evaporation such that it became the more packed Al structure that inhibited the permeation of H
