External fixation of mandible fractures is a useful technique when an open treatment is contraindicated because of extensive comminution, bone or soft tissue loss, and infection. This technique can also be used temporarily until definitive treatment is delivered. A uniphasic or biphasic system can be placed to reduce and stabilize mandibular fractures. These systems use surgically placed threaded pins and different types of connectors that can be manipulated to optimize the reduction of fractures. External fixation remains a quick, safe, and simple method to treat mandible fractures in selected clinical situations, and it should be part of the armamentarium in surgeons treating these injuries and fractures.
