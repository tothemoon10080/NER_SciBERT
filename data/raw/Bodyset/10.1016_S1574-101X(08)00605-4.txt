Environmental decision making is complicated by the complexity of natural systems and the generally competing needs of multiple stakeholders. Modelling tools are often used to assist at various stages of the environmental decision-making process. If such models are to provide effective decision support, the uncertainties associated with all aspects of the decision-making process need to be taken into account explicitly, including those associated with data, models and human factors. However, as models become more complex to better represent integrated environmental, social and economic systems, achieving this goal becomes more difficult. Some of the important issues that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include:

Risk-based criteria generally relate to the concept of likelihood, the likely magnitude and the likely duration of failure, where failure is defined as the inability of an environmental system to perform its desired function. However, the terminology used in various disciplines differs. Given the increase in the use of integrated models, and the resulting collaboration between people from different disciplines, there is a need to develop a common lexicon, or at least a shared understanding of the meaning of the terminology used.

The development of integrated software frameworks that enable all sources of uncertainty to be incorporated in the environmental decision-making process (see Environmental management presents significant challenges, as:  it is concerned with highly complex systems that are generally not well understood; it generally involves a large number of stakeholders, often with competing objectives; and there are generally a large number of potential management options. As a result, there has been an increase in the use of formal approaches to environmental management. Recently, agent-based models and Bayesian decision networks have been used in an attempt to integrate social, economic and environmental aspects in a single modelling framework, often in a simulation mode that explores impacts in response to scenarios and other hypotheses (e.g. The use of robust decision making (RDM) has been demonstrated by As model complexity increases in order to better represent environmental and socio-environmental systems, there is an increased need to identify potential sources of uncertainty and to quantify their impact, so that appropriate management options can be identified with confidence. Many studies have focused on the identification and quantification of certain aspects of uncertainty, such as the development of risk-based performance measures (e.g. There is a need, however, to examine the decision-making process in an integrated fashion, in order to identify all sources of uncertainty and ways of incorporating them into the decision-making process. Research studies that have focused on modelling uncertainty in an integrated decision analysis context include  discuss the major steps in the environmental decision-making process; identify possible sources of uncertainty at each stage of the environmental decision-making process; and discuss current progress and identify some of the remaining issues, challenges and future directions in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty into the environmental decision-making process, including the development of: appropriate risk-based assessment criteria; methods for quantifying uncertainty associated with human input (see also approaches for increasing computational efficiency; and integrated frameworks for addressing uncertainty as part of the environmental decision-making process. In order to develop model-based decision support tools for environmental management and policy analysis, one or more of the steps in the environmental decision-making process need to be considered. The main factors that have an impact on whether environmental problems are addressed, and how this is done, are shown in Traditionally, model-based decision support tools have been used to help determine which subset of potential management alternatives can be considered “optimal” (i.e. Models can also be used in other steps of the process outlined in Various forms of uncertainty are associated with each of the steps in the environmental decision-making process outlined in Data are used extensively in the environmental decision-making process. For example, data may be used to highlight an environmental problem that needs to be addressed, to determine the magnitude of a particular problem, to help with the selection and screening of potential alternative solutions, to assist with the development of system models (e.g. calibration, validation) and to identify appropriate performance values in multicriteria decision analyses. Uncertainties in data include:      In relation to uncertainty associated with data, it is important to note that uncertainty is the variance that remains after measurements have been corrected for all known errors. Uncertainty is therefore the part of the measurement of which we are unsure ( Models can play an important role at a number of stages of the environmental decision-making process, including identification and quantification of the severity of environmental problems, as well as the identification of potential and optimal solutions. Models can vary significantly in complexity (and hence data requirements) and can serve a variety of purposes. For example, models can be used for simulation purposes in order to obtain a better understanding of complex systems, or for prediction/forecasting to assist managers with assessing the utility of proposed management actions or the response of the system to other types of perturbations. Forecasting and prediction models are generally process-based (deterministic) or data-based (statistical), although the use of hybrid models is becoming increasingly popular. Models can also be used for optimisation or to conduct MCDA. It is well-recognised that predictive models are generally subject to input, model and parameter uncertainty (e.g. One type of uncertainty that has received limited attention in the literature is the uncertainty associated with human input. However, as discussed more fully in The extent to which the above uncertainties have been incorporated into modelling frameworks, and the remaining and emerging challenges of developing model-based decision support tools for integrated environmental management, are discussed in Section If uncertainty is incorporated into models explicitly, the criteria used to assess the performance of alternative solutions need to reflect this. A number of risk-based performance criteria have been proposed for environmental models. These generally relate to the concept of the likelihood, the likely magnitude and the likely duration of failure, where failure is defined as the inability of an environmental system to perform its desired function. For example, Given (i) the increased recognition of the need to incorporate uncertainty into decision support models; (ii) the increase in the utilisation of integrated models, which are generally developed by multidisciplinary teams; and (iii) the diversity of, and confusion surrounding, the definition and estimation of risk-based performance measures, there is a need to develop a common lexicon in relation to risk-based performance criteria across disciplines. There have been some attempts to develop classification systems for risk-based performance criteria (e.g. Uncertainties associated with data, as well as model inputs and parameters, have been recognised for some time, and much work has been done to incorporate these types of uncertainty into modelling frameworks (e.g. Uncertainty due to human input also has a role to play in the ranking of potential management alternatives in accordance with the selected assessment criteria. Assessment criteria generally address competing objectives, which complicates the ranking of proposed alternatives. If there is a limited number of alternatives, some form of multicriteria decision analysis can be used to rank the potential alternatives, such as value-focused approaches (e.g. Weighted Sum Method (WSM), If the number of potential management alternatives is large, multiobjective optimisation approaches (e.g. Historically, the inclusion of uncertainty in even relatively simple simulation models has been a problem from the perspective of computational efficiency. This is because the evaluation of risk-based performance measures generally requires simulation models to be run repeatedly (e.g. as part of Monte Carlo methods). Advances in computing power have made the estimation of risk-based performance measures possible for models with relatively short run times. However, as models are becoming increasingly complex, issues related to computational efficiency are likely to be exacerbated to the point where run times are infeasible. Although processor speed is increasing rapidly, this is unlikely to outweigh the impact of the increased computational requirements of more complex models. Past experience indicates that, as computational power increases, so does the difficulty and complexity of the problems being tackled. Consequently, there is a need to develop alternative means of addressing the problems posed by excessive computer run times. In order to increase computational efficiency, a number of different approaches can be taken, including:    As discussed in Section  standardised methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ecosystem models, including techniques for cross-site comparison; standardised datasets to allow inter-model comparison of uncertainty and sensitivity measures; standardised software interfaces for ecosystem models to allow access to databases for model experiments and results; and databases for model evaluation results to allow scientists, stakeholders and policy makers easy access to information concerning model quality and uncertainty. The above examples incorporate some of the significant criteria that should be addressed when developing integrated software frameworks for decision making that take uncertainty into account. These include explicit treatment of uncertainties arising from incomplete definitions of the model structural framework, spatial/temporal variations in variables that are either not fully captured by the available data or not fully resolved by the model, and the scaling behaviour of variables across space and time. Such frameworks for decision making should also tie together uncertainty related to multicriteria tradeoffs and combined measures of model fit and complexity, as well as discuss data collection needs, i.e. when to cease collecting data and refine the model and, if additional data need to be collected, what should be collected in order to materially reduce model uncertainty. In addition to modelling the behaviour of complex environmental systems, modelling for environmental decision support should provide decision makers with an understanding of the meaning of predictive uncertainty in the context of the decisions being made and in terms that are meaningful to decision makers. To a decision maker, the possible outcomes resulting from a course of action are of main interest, where an “outcome” is defined in terms of the variables of interest to the decision maker. As previously stated, predicting outcomes involves the integration of all sources of uncertainty, including uncertainty in the choice of models, model parameter uncertainty, data errors, missing data, and natural variability in system behaviour. These variables of interest may include social and economic endpoints and other variables outside the expertise of environmental scientists. Nevertheless, these variables may be of primary importance for aiding decision makers in choosing between alternatives. Environmental decision support obviously goes beyond the purposes and methods of traditional environmental scientific modelling and potentially enters into the many sub-fields that make use of results from the decision sciences, including variants of decision analysis, multicriteria decision making, group decision-making methods, and other attempts to support group decisions involving conflicting interests and significant uncertainty. To summarise, environmental decision making is extremely complex due to the complexity of the systems considered and the competing interests of multiple stakeholders. In order to improve the quality of decisions made, formal decision support tools, such as integrated models, optimisation algorithms and multicriteria decision analysis, are being used increasingly. In addition, the need to consider environmental, social and economic systems in an integrated fashion has also received increased attention. However, as decision support tools increase in complexity, the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process becomes more important so that decisions can be made with confidence or known certainty. Some of the important areas that need to be addressed in relation to the incorporation of uncertainty in environmental decision-making processes include:  the development of appropriate risk-based performance criteria that are understood and accepted by a range of disciplines; the development of methods for quantifying the uncertainty associated with human input; the development of approaches and strategies for increasing the computational efficiency of integrated models, optimisation methods and methods for estimating risk-based performance measures; and the enhancement or development of integrated framework that enable all sources of uncertainty to be incorporated in the environmental decision-making process.
