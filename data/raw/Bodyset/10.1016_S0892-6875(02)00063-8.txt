Extraction of nickel was studied at macro-level concentrations (∼0.5 M) from solutions containing sodium sulphate/chloride using the extractants D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272. Increase of sodium salt concentration in the feed solution (0–1.0 M) resulted in decrease in nickel extraction. This influence is more prominent with the extractant D2EHPA. At a given nickel: sodium salt ratio, variation in nickel/sodium salt concentration influenced the extraction. Temperature (in the range of 30–45 °C) and contact time (beyond one minute) had no effect on extraction. The loading capacity of 1.0 M D2EHPA, PC88A and Cyanex 272 (70% neutralised) was observed to be 17.7, 18.2, and 18.7

Sulphidic, oxidic nickel ores and various nickel bearing secondaries such as super alloy scrap, dust, spent catalyst, etc. are potential raw materials for nickel production. Some of these raw materials when processed through acidic leaching using sulphuric/hydrochloric or other acids generate leach liquors containing 20– In the present investigation, extraction of nickel was studied at macro-level concentration (∼0.5 M) from sulphate/chloride solutions using the extractants D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272. Influence of salt concentration, extractant concentration/extent of neutralisation, pH, temperature and nickel/sodium salt ratio on nickel extraction was studied. Loading capacity of 1.0 M extractants was determined. The extractants D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272 were used as received. Distilled kerosene was used as the diluent. The extractants were neutralised to the desired extent using NaOH. Solutions of other reagents and chemicals were prepared from reagent grade chemicals. Experiments were carried out at room temperature. Metal analysis was carried out volumetrically or by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The feed solution having The sodium salt concentration in the aqueous solution was varied between 0–1.0 M. Results of these experiments ( Exraction was carried out using 70% neutralised extractants of 0.5–1.0 M concentration. The results indicated increase in nickel extraction with increase in extractant concentration. The log D versus log [extractant] plots were linear. The slope values in both sulphate and chloride media ranged between 1.6 and 1.8 for the three extractants indicating that the extracted species is NiR Since nickel extraction was about 55±4% (sulphate system) and 64±4% (chloride system) with 70% neutralised extractants of 1.0 M concentration, the solvents were neutralised beyond 70% (to provide increased solvent availability for metal extraction) and used for extraction. With 90% neutralised D2EHPA, nickel extraction increased to ∼63% (sulphate system) and ∼74.5% (chloride system). With 80% neutralised PC 88A, nickel extraction increased to ∼66% (sulphate system) and ∼78.5% (chloride system). Further increase in neutralisation of PC 88A resulted in the formation of two immiscible layers during saponification. Similar was the observation when Cyanex 272 was neutralised beyond 70%. When nickel extraction was carried out from a solution of pH 4.55, the equilibrium pH values were 4.75, 6.15, 6.85 (sulphate medium) and 3.97, 4.83, 5.94 (chloride medium), respectively, with 1.0 M (70% neutralised) D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272. The extraction efficiencies ranged between 51–68%. To obtain higher equilibrium pH values, the initial pH of the aqueous feed solution was increased up to 6.0. However there was very little change in the equilibrium pH values and the extraction efficiency increased by 5–7% in the sulphate and 1–1.5% in the chloride systems when extraction was carried out from these (pH 6.0) solutions. All the above studies were carried out with feed solutions containing about 0.5 M nickel and 0.4 M sodium salt. However, when the raw material (catalyst/scrap/sludge, etc.) is processed for metal recovery, the leach solutions are likely to contain cobalt, nickel and other metals in varying concentrations. Depending upon the concentration of metals separated prior to nickel, through solvent extraction, the sodium salt concentration of the nickel bearing raffinate is likely to vary. To obtain information on nickel extraction behaviour at varying concentrations of both nickel and sodium salt, studies were carried out at 1:1 phase ratio using 70% neutralised extractants. For the extractant D2EHPA, nickel extraction decreased by 6.8%, 6.4% and 6.6%, respectively, at the Ni/Na The theoretical nickel loading capacity of 1.0 M (70% neutralised) extractant is Results of the tests, carried out (under optimum conditions) at the temperatures of 30, 35, 40 and 45 °C indicated no influence of temperature on nickel extraction. Tests on effect of contact time indicated that nickel extraction reached equilibrium within a maximum period of one minute. The above conclusions were obtained for all the three extractants in both sulphate and chloride media. Nickel extraction was studied from sodium sulphate/chloride-bearing solutions using the phosphoric acid based extractants, D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272. The extraction decreased with increase in Na The authors are thankful to Dr. S.C. Das, Head, Hydrometallurgy Department and Dr. Vibhuti N.
