Pruning residues can provide a significant amount of biomass despite being rarely used as a renewable sources to replace fossil fuels. Exploiting such residues entails creating a sustainable and cost-effective supply chain in which the harvesting and initial processing of the residues play a crucial role. The study is a detailed and accurate survey of the harvesting technologies available in Europe for harvest pruning. After defining the main harvest technologies and the distribution of manufacturers in Europe, the survey details the main groups of implements: shredders, chippers and balers. For each group, the most important configurations are discussed, together with the main characteristics of the machine. Some of the main innovations are detailed (modular machines, non-stop balers, densification of the biomass) which can improve the quality of the product and the economic sustainability of the chain.Residues of permanent crops in Europe are a substantial reservoir of renewable biomass for energy and industrial use. The 10.6 Mha currently covered by permanent crops generate 13 Tg (oven-dry basis) of pruning. However, the rational use of this biomass source is being hindered Pruning (branches and shoots of fruit trees) is considered a problem rather than an opportunity and, hence, it is not used or incorrectly disposed of Environmental concerns regarding the use of fossil fuel and their depletion have boosted a cultural change in the sustainable use of renewable sources. As a result, the formulation of more strict regulations regarding pruning in most European countries Equipment that facilitates the harvesting and processing of agricultural pruning is already available on the market and many manufacturers offer different models that are tailored to specific harvesting chains. The aim of the present work is to provide a thorough overview of the technologies available for harvest pruning, from basic equipment to the state of the art. The source of the biomass as well as the techniques employed during the supply chain affect the quality of woody biomass. Apart from aspects related to biomass properties (such as moisture, ash, foliage content, and chemical composition), comminution and storage have a strong influence on other important parameters such as the presence of contaminants (soil, stones), particle size and bulk density, which may impact on the quality of the biomass. Comminution is exploited for baling, where the benefit of a more stable and prolonged storage period is diminished by the cost of this extra step. Biomass losses and contamination are directly related to the regulation of the pick-up device. Low-lying pick up mechanisms help to reduce losses, but increase the inlet of soil particles, to the detriment of fuel quality Biomass losses can be also a consequence of the working width of the machine and the lack of suitable windrowing. As hypothesized by Acampora et al. The shape, size, number and type of chipping devices, and the machine settings can greatly alter the feedstock quality Beside the particle size, the comminution of pruning must take into account the morphology of the wood pieces. The most commonly-used shredders produce wood particles with de-fibered ends unlike the homogeneous pieces resulting from chipping. This difference has significant implications during storage because the unclean cut of the shredders can cause the biomass to be more prone to degradation and fermentation. All types of biological and chemical changes in wood fuels during storage and drying leads to changes in fuel properties. However, the use of a chipper may also lead to a lower chip quality. This has been observed in the wood energy chain where the wear of the knife alters the chip quality and the productivity of the machine The role of quality becomes more pronounced as the supply system varies in different countries and in different plant systems. An important goal of quality control is to reduce quality variations and as much as possible to obtain a homogeneous product The pruning stage produces branches, shoots and buds which are then left in the field. In several areas of Europe is the biggest pieces of wood pruning are used for firewood. Farmers usually obtain firewood pieces from thick branches, with a diameter larger than 50 mm Due to the lack of a well organized pruning biomass supply chain in Europe, there is no real market for pruning residues (<50 mm). Thus small branches and shoots that have been pruned and left on the ground are usually not collected, chipped and used for energy production (excluding rare cases), but usually are disposed of by farmers in two ways: they are removed from the orchard, and then piled and disposed of or piled and burned at the side of the field; they are mulched and left/incorporated on/into the soil. The branch removal phase is usually carried out by a tractor equipped with a fork or similar device which pushes the pruned branches down the rows until the edge of the field. Pruning can be also left on the soil after mulching. Hammer mulchers (also known as hammer mowers or simply mulchers) are usually used to comminute the dendromass into small pieces. These machines are mounted on the back of the tractor on a three-point hitch and are supplied with the power take-off (PTO) of the tractor. In rare cases, prunings with a small diameter can also be recovered for energy purposes using specific machines that chip, shred or bale the dendromass so that it can be transported, stored and used in specific boilers mainly for heat production. A more environmentally sustainable use of pruning is increasingly being proposed to replace open-air burning Harvest pruning generally requires one or two passes Some pruning harvesters can be equipped with two hydraulic swath brushes mounted on both sides of the pick-up roll in order to extend the machine's collecting capacity. In our personal experience, this last system is more suited to compact windrows that already exist, although its results are not very effective for all types of pruning. To sum up, the supply chain considered suitable for harvest pruning consists of windrowing which can be done either separately or then integrated with biomass processing. In this second step, the pruning is handled by shredders, chippers or balers. All the possible configurations are listed in Within the framework of the EuroPruning project Pruning shredders break the branches down into pieces using a horizontal shaft powered by the tractor's PTO and by mounting elements with blunt (hammers) or sharp (knives) blades. Shredding is a mature technology and the number of commercial machines is increasing ( Shredders are usually coupled to the PTO of the tractor and can be mounted both in front or at the rear (depending on the model). Usually, the majority of models are mounted at the rear of the tractor which passes over the pruning left in windrows on the soil. Thus, the tractor may require additional protection to prevent damage to the electrical or hydraulic systems located underneath the tractor body if voluminous windrows and thick branches are present. Some shredders are mounted at the rear of the tractor but entail the tractor being driven in reverse (e.g. Jordan RH25). Pruning shredders can be towed by a tractor ranging from 50 to 70 kW, but heavier industrial units applied to powerful farm tractors (150–200 kW) are being developed. The cost of the most common pruning shredder is relatively affordable (10,000–20,000 euros) and thus are commonly used by farmers and part-time contractors The main configurations adopted for pruning shredders can be summarized as (        Pruning shredders have been extensively tested on Mediterranean crops such as olive orchards and vineyards Despite the similar working principle, the quality of product in terms of particle size distribution is variable In the wood energy chain, the most common commercial machines are equipped with discs or drum chippers For pruning, residue chippers, in contrast to shredders, are relatively new option. A variety of numbers and shapes of knives are used by chippers to comminute the pruning. However, all the types of knives are vulnerable to all non-wood material, and consequently the cutting system itself can be damaged, for example, by dirt, stones and iron wires, thus negatively impacting on product quality, performance and the maintenance costs of the machine Chippers are produced as integrated systems or are built with bins (      Chippers have been extensively used in forestry and in the cultivation of wood species for energy There are few pruning chippers on the market that can pick up and chip the biomass and that have different working configurations ( The ONG PC50 model Pruning harvesters based on chipping systems produce more regular-sized chips that are similar to forest woodchips than those produced by shredders. The evolution of these technologies is therefore necessary to promote the agricultural pruning within the biomass market. New chipping models need to convince those that are accustomed to shredding technologies that they are reliable. Dendromass can also be collected into bales. Baling entails re-processing the bale by chipping, however it facilitates easier storage because, unlike chips, bales can be kept for months The bales produced from hay can vary in shape (quadrangular or round) and size. However, the rationale of this work was to provide an overview of the collection systems where each implement was included, without detailing the mechanical aspects of each machine. Therefore, the balers should be seen as a component (the main component) of a collection system irrespectively the type of bale. Nevertheless, information on the bale size is reported in Today, pruning balers are mainly used for vineyard pruning However, the harvesting of other orchard plantations has been documented The main configurations of the balers are (     The size of the bales can vary, as can their mass ( As previously mentioned, balers are essentially an adaptation of conventional straw balers, or are designed specifically for baling pruning residue, which lack the necessary uniform shape. The size (height and width) is an important requirement for the machines to be able to move along different crop layouts. Various commercial mini roto-balers for harvest pruning are available on the market. These have the same function as the standard forage balers but produce smaller bales (30 kg bales) and the characteristics of the branches to bale has to be controlled (thickness and length). Some balers producing round bales of standard dimensions (1200 mm × 1200 mm) have become available but could be improved by including a crushing system in the pick-up before going into the round baler chamber. A machine was developed by the Anderson Group as model WB-55 Large-sized bales are efficient in terms of pruning collection, but create more problems since comminution is required before use these at the plant Experiences in olive and peach pruning in some cases confirmed the problems related to the movement of machines in narrow spaces During the Europruning project, an innovative system to windrow, collect and compact branches from pruning was developed by PIMR ( For the balers, the maneuverability of the machine in fields with different plant distances, the harvesting speed, the loss of products are challenging for manufacturers and researchers. Bale collection has some advantages especially when prolonged storage and a higher biomass health are required. However, the entire chain (including logistics, transport and comminution at the plant) needs to be further optimized through the effective organization of bale collection. Pruning is an obligatory operation usually carried out manually, and aimed at improving the fruits' yield and quality. Mechanical pruning has been phased out, in order to integrate the tree architecture and the type of mechanization Multiple machinery builders have mechanical pre-pruners which could be adapted for an integrated collection of biomass. This is not necessarily a complicated issue, but more a question of conveying the pre-pruned branches effectively to a container (   Only one practical commercial solution exists which performs both pruning and pruning residue recovery in olive groves Chippers or shredders can be mounted on a truck fed by a mechanical crane or manually by operators, and work in a fixed position at the border of a field after the pruning has been collected together by a tractor with fork. Many firms produce stationary chippers and various types of machines are available on the market. The majority of these have been developed for forestry use. This type of equipment and pruning management are not analysed in this survey which focuses on mobile pruning harvesters. However, according to the evaluation of systems for harvesting biomass residues carried out by Velázquez-Martí et al. However, accumulating prunings and the subsequent comminuting should be considered as a good alternative to the mobile chippers or shredders when a new pruning supply chain is planned for development, and the space to store the pruning at the border of the fields is not a limiting factor. The machinery cited in the present review is already available on the market, however the business volume of pruning harvesters in Europe is a very small segment of the market for regular shredders, chippers and balers. The types of plantation where the pruning can be collected are extremely varied. This has generated a corresponding creative effort to optimize the equipment and the combination of implements to produce a high grade fuel. For example, the pruning characteristics (quantity, length, and diameter) or the shape of the field can mean that the performance of the harvest varies a good deal in terms of time, fuel consumption and quality of product obtained. Many machines are shredders equipped with a medium/small size hopper, or a big container. Some models have been developed to discharge the product into a big-bag hanging on the frame of the machine, or in a trailer that can be towed by a second rear tractor or beside the pruning harvesting machine. One implement performs the pruning and pruning collection in one step and is well suited to fully mechanized orchards. Some equipment has been developed for the forestry sector to process prunings with a large diameter. Of the types of pruning, vineyard pruning residues are the most common, however most vineyards offer difficult harvesting conditions which means that conventional equipment cannot be used to collect the prunings. As a consequence, some manufacturers have developed machines that work in specific planting patterns, which are sometimes very narrow Thus, apart from the innovations in the pick-up, integrated windrowing, chipping system and built-in bins, other aspects should be taken into consideration when selecting a system of pruning collection. Some regard the technical issues of the built-in components, and incorporate advanced techniques and unique innovations, such as the size and position of wheels (side vs under body), maneuverability on slopes, height control, pick-up roller design, conveying system for the pruning, discharge system, overload protection, and clogging prevention. On the other hand, there are other issues related the shape and type of field and type of pruning. These factors included the size for maneuvering between trees (width, height), length and maneuverability (for turning at the headland), type of pick-up (which influences the efficiency in pruning collection and maximum speed), the adaptability of the system to different sizes of branches, among others. In addition to issues related harvesting prunings and influence harvesting performance, the pruning stage itself represents the previous phase that is critical in starting an economically sustainable pruning supply chain for energy production. Some studies have observed an improvement in fruit quality, fruit production, and amount of woody biomass obtained by the combination of mechanical and manual pruning Where only manual pruning is applicable, pruning alignment (accumulation of the prunings in windrows) represents a cropping practice that is crucial to improving the performance of the pruning harvesting phase and consequently to reducing the harvesting costs. In fact, accumulating pruning residues in windrows increases the field stocking and consequently the field capacity of the harvesting machine chain, thus reducing the additional times required due to maneuvering the harvester in the field. Therefore, a better performance is possible where the prunings are accumulated in alternate rows In addition, where mechanical pruning is not applicable, accumulating the biomass directly in windrows during the manual pruning stage would make the subsequent mechanical windrowing unnecessary with a consequent reduction in the supply chain costs and the residue losses. Again, the manual alignment of the pruning would also improve the quality of the final comminuted product. In fact, when the prunings are pulled in swaths by mechanical windrowers (e.g. rotary rakes), the increased dust (soil particles) created during the process could contaminate the pruning more than with manual alignment with a consequent increase of the ash content in the final product. Innovations in pruning harvesters should mainly focus on improving machine performance and wood-fuel quality. Prunings harvested by shredding produce a low quality hog-fuel which can create problems during the biomass storage (high dry matter losses, low energy content, environmental emissions) with consequent problems during the thermochemical conversion, and possible clogging during the feeding to the boiler. Thus, designing machines that produce high-grade woodchips is key for the development of a sustainable and cost-effective supply chain for pruning. This can be achieved by introducing new cost-effective approaches such as: designing modular machines; using non-stop baling; increasing the energy content of the fuel. Modular pruning harvesting machines should be adaptable for use in different field conditions and logistical situations. Modularity should be provided by both the cutting system and the temporary storage of the chips. The main features of the cutting system (type and number of cutting tools, speed of the rotors, rate of feeding) should be adjustable in relation to the pruning characteristics (length, thickness, age, amount, type of wood) so as to obtain a chip size distribution that complies with customer requirements. The same machine should also enable the most suitable system to be selected (big-bag) for storing the biomass during harvesting. Modular machines for harvest pruning do not currently exist, but are becoming proposed Baling has advantages over chipping in terms of storage. On the other hand, it requires additional steps before being used in power plants. For instance, baling performance is affected by the time required to unload the bale in the field. For forage and straw balers, new prototypes have been designed that provide a non-stop round baling. The first models are about to be marketed by companies such as Vermeer ( One of the weak points of the supply chain is the transportation of the biomass to the power plant. Wood biomass from short rotation forestry is transported by large trucks which require specific loading equipment and have a high rental cost The first harvester combined with a pelletizer for the recovery of wheat residues was developed by Krone (Premos 5000). While performing the harvesting, the machine produces pellets (600–700 kg m Nazzareno Costruzioni Srl has developed a stationary truck with an on-board pellet plant that produces agripellets (400–500 kg h An interesting solution for increasing the level of energy content transported with chips could derive from compactors. On poplar and locust wood chips The collection phase has a pivotal role in ensuring the profitability of pruning recovery and use. One specific type of machinery or solution does not exist, and currently-used machines do no match all types of field conditions. The choice of the best technology should be made on a case-by-case basis because the economic viability of recovering orchard prunings depends on how the costs of the residue are managed as well as on how the benefits are redistributed between orchard owners, harvesting contractors and biomass users. However, harvesting is only one component upstream of the more complex chain of logistics, a process also involving transport, storage, handling and pretreatment. In logistics and supply chain management, optimization is a key issue, in order to reduce transport costs and lower carbon emissions generated by the machines. This entails analyzing factors such as the amount of pruning potentially available, the selection of the best harvesting method, the location of the energy plants, transport and pre-treatment, and a route optimization analysis. Traceability could also be added to this list, which is a key issue for the food sector, but still lacking in the biomass chain. Although just one aspect of the overall process, harvesting prunings plays a pivotal role in building a sustainable and profitable collateral production and hence it needs to be define correctly. Various successful examples of well-designed pruning supply chains for energy production are already available in Italy. For instance, Fiusis s. r.l. (Calimera, LE, Apulia) use olive prunings produced by nine municipalities around the 1 MWe cogeneration plant which produces electricity (which is then sold on to the national grid) and heat. Fiusis's well-established harvesting solution entails the use of three Facma harvesters (Comby model) for use on farms that have up to 400 olive trees Lungarotti Società Agricola a. r.l (Torgiano, PG, Umbria) is another interesting and successful example of an Italian company that integrates wine production with energy production by vineyard pruning. This company uses roundbalers that produce 1.1 m wide and 1 m diameter bales of vineyard pruning. The bales are shredded by a mixer wagon, commonly used as animal feed, which has a comparable cost to a small-medium chipper but has the capacity to manage big bales like a more expensive large-sized wood-chipper. The shredded biomass is burned and the steam produced is used for washing and sterilizing the bottling line, while the hot water is used to heat various areas of the winery (malolactic fermentation in barrique cellars, warehouse, offices). In this way the company is able to save 200 Mg per year of CO This is an easily replicable process in other wine-growing companies. In fact, the potential availability of annual residues obtained from vineyard pruning is more than one Tg per year of dry matter. Approximately 200–500 kW electric power plants could be powered from the recovery of these residues giving an annual output of 0.8 TWh, which could meet the electrical requirements of 200 four-person families. Unfortunately, the excessive fragmentation of winegrowing companies makes this goal difficult to reach, but already recovering half of the pruning would be reduce emissions and increase farm income.
