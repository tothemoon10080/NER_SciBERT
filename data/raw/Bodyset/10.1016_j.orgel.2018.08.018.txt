We investigate the charge carrier dynamics of inverted organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM and PTB7: PCBM – the two leading systems among the OSCs based on polymer-fullerene bulk-heterojunction – to elucidate the origin of their performance difference. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (photo-EIS) were employed to unravel the photo-physics that govern the cell operation of these two highly efficient bulk heterojunction OSCs. While photo-EIS indicates that the two systems under study exhibit similar behavior in terms of recombination, TAS results reveal that PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM systems not only have higher charge generation rate but also more efficient charge transfer than PTB7: PCBM systems, leading to the power conversion efficiency of PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM-based OSCs (9.16%) that is higher than that of PTB7: PCBM-based OSCs (6.44%).Solution processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) are widely regarded as a cost effective and green solution to our long standing energy demand because they offer good cost-efficiency balance, short energy payback time, and unique form-factor advantages [ Recently, Yan and his co-workers have reported new donor polymer poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3‴-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2’;5′,2’’;-5″,2‴-quaterthiophen-5,5‴-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD) [ In this work, we compare the charge carrier dynamics of PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM, a present state-of-the-art donor: acceptor system, with PTB7: PCBM, one of the well-studied donor: acceptor systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (photo-EIS) and optical simulation using custom MATLAB codes are employed to unravel the photo-physics that governs the cell operation of these two highly efficient bulk heterojunction OSCs in their inverted geometry. Inverted geometry devices with an architecture ITO/ZnO/PTB7: PCBM or PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM/MoO For the device fabrication, ITO coated glasses (Luminescence Technology corp. Taiwan, with a sheet resistance of 15 Ωsq The current density-voltage (  The reason for higher As can be seen in As the process of the charge generation and transfer is seriously deteriorating for higher thickness (270 nm) of PTB7: PCBM, photo-EIS studies has been carried out only for two samples i.e. for devices with PTB7: PCBM (100 nm) and PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM (270 nm) as photoactive layer. As can be seen in In order to calculate the order of recombination for both of the systems, their respective charge carrier lifetimes were plotted against the carrier densities, which has been estimated from C In order to better identify the origins of performance difference between PTB7: PCBM and PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM cells, we have carried out optical simulation using custom MATLAB codes incorporating the transfer matrix formalism [ It has been well known that the interfacial morphology and surface topography of photoactive layer can also play a crucial role in device performance. From atomic force microscopy (AFM) (See In conclusion, we have fabricated the PffBT4T-2OD: PCBM OSCs with PCE of 9.2% and systematically studied their charge carrier dynamics using transient absorption and Photo EIS measurements. The TA spectroscopy suggests that both charge-carrier generation and charge transfer are very efficient in this system when compared to PTB7: PCBM OSCs.
