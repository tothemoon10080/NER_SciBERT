Composite iron deposits containing non-conductivite Si particles and conductive Si-Fe alloy particles with an average size of 1Î¼m were prepared in circulating solution, the effects of particle conductivity on the co-deposition process of particles were investigated. The results show that high conductivity contributed to the co-deposition process of particles into the composite coatings, and in a mode of "cladding" for the co-deposition of conductive Si-Fe particles, while that for non-conductive Si particles was "embedding" mode. At the same time, with increasing the conductivity, the co-deposition process of particles was obviously deviate from the Guglielmi model. A possible mechanism on the forming process was discussed.
