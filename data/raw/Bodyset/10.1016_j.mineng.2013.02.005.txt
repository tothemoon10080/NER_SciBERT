Comminution ’12, the 8th in the series of international comminution symposia, was held at the Vineyard Hotel, Cape Town, from April 17th–20th, 2012. Over 70 papers were presented, from which 21 have been selected for publication in this special issue. The conference was attended by 253 delegates, representing 30 countries, a record turnout, and a record number of sponsors, 18 from all parts of the world. During the last century there was relatively little development in comminution machines and circuits, cone crushing being followed by ball milling, rod mills sometimes acting as tertiary crushers. Comminution was well known to be energy intensive and inefficient, but there was little that could be done about it. In the latter part of the century, however, there was a quiet revolution. Autogenous and semi-autogenous milling became more prominent, and then high-pressure grinding rolls began to play an ever increasing role, as did stirred mills, the latter allowing the exploitation of ultra-fine grained ores which had hitherto been impossible to economically treat. This revolution continues, so that comminution circuits today are very much different to those of the mid-20th century with their parallel lines of small ball mill-cyclones. People are still very much aware of the energy consumed in comminution, but are now prepared to really do something about it. It is particularly encouraging to see that industry is now interacting with academic researchers to develop new techniques, collaboration increasing in importance and developing as a result of networking at conferences such as this. Comminution has an exciting future, and we look forward to reports of new developments at A full report on Comminution ’12 can be found at:
