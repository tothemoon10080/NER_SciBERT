High demand of glass fibre reinforced thermoset composites has led to manufacturing and end of life waste. Mechanical recycling is currently a mature, rapid process in recycling such waste at an industrial scale. Unlike manufacturing processes, the effect of key process variables on recyclate quality is not well understood. In this study analysis of variance was used to establish the key mechanical granulator process variables that influence energy demand and recyclate quality. Two different granulator technologies were also compared. This information is vital in selecting conditions for running recycling processes and in assessing the potential market for the generated recyclate.
