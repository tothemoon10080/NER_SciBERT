Osteosynthesis of non-union of fractures of the clavicle were achieved using bone graft and the AO mini external fixator. The technique was used in nine patients, and no neurovascular or pleural complications occurred. The average time before the patient was considered for this method was 11 months. The external fixator was removed at an average of eight weeks, with solid union in all cases. The outcome was excellent and all patients returned to pre-injury level of normal activity. This method provides safe and relatively simple treatment for this difficult non-union.
