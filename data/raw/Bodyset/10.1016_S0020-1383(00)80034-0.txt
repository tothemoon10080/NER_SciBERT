Between 1980 and 1989, reports on 2,165 fractures of the distal part of the femur (1,051 women and 1,114 men) were collected by AO Documentation and are analyzed in the present paper. The number of fractures showed a bimodal pattern with a marked variation in the number of fractures in relation to gender and age. A larger prevalence of fractures was observed either in young men (about 20 years old, traffic or sport) and in old women (about 70, fall at home, osteoporosis).
