Lattice thermal conductivity (κ) of bulk materials usually increases under compression and decreases under tension, while there are still some unusual systems, exhibiting reduced κ when compressed. However, to date it has never been reported for a bulk material, whose κ is substantially enhanced under tensile strain. In this paper, we have studied thermal transport of three auxetic carbon crystals: cis-C, trans-C and hin-C for short, and their strain responses by performing first-principles calculations. It is intriguing to find that their κ are much lower than those of their allotropes, and further decrease abnormally under compression. More strikingly, κ of trans-C (cis-C) anomalously increases with tensile strain up to 7% (6%) with maximum κ of almost 7 (5) times larger than the unstrained value. The abnormal strain dependent κ are attributed to the dominant role of the enhancement of phonon lifetime under stretching, which can be further explained from the unique atomic structure of the main chain of polydiacetylene in trans-C and cis-C. The weakening of phonon anharmonicity is reflected by the enhancement of root mean-square displacement values. The reported giant augmentation of κ may inspire intensive research on auxetic carbon crystals as potential materials for emerging nanoelectronic devices.Mechanical strain The continuously emerging investigations on the mechanics, stabilities and thermal transport properties of unusual carbon materials from density function theory (DFT) calculations can effectively prove the DFT method's validity in modeling the characteristics of various carbon structures As for the synthesis of these polymer materials, Wegner first reported a class of monomers that can be polymerized in the solid state to produce large, nearly defect-free polymer crystals We performed DFT calculations in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation By only considering phonon-phonon scattering process, we calculated the intrinsic thermal conductivity by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) iteratively with the ShengBTE package In this work, it is fascinating to find that κ of all the three structures decreases under compression. More strikingly, here we report that κ of The dependence of the thermal conductivity of To explore the underlying mechanism behind the abnormal tension dependence of κ Next, to seek the dominant role in determining the abnormal trend of κ In the meantime, it is worth noting that there seems a paradox that the decreased average To deeply understand the anomalous tension effect for From the above analysis we know that the abnormal tension effect on the lattice κ It is well-known that thermal transport plays a crucial role in many applications, such as heat dissipation In conclusion, we systematically investigated the thermal transport properties of three auxetic carbon crystals and their tension response by solving the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation with interatomic force constants calculated from first-principles. The intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of unstrained We would also like to stress that, although there are a large number of papers in the literature addressing the thermal behavior of carbon-based materials (see for instance Simulations were performed with computing resources granted by the Jülich Aachen Research Alliance-High Performance Computing (JARA-HPC) from The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
