In this work, we determined the full set of thermodynamic properties for the ferric orthoarsenate, FeAsO4·0.75H2O. This phase could be expected in metallurgical waste forms from pressure oxidation of arsenopyrite-rich ores and its solubility is therefore of interest for the understanding of arsenic mobility in such waste forms. Using a combination of solubility experiments at low pH (<2) and relaxation calorimetry, we have determined log K

                     K−1, respectively. These data give ΔfGo(FeAsO4·0.75H2O)=−993.15±2.57kJmol−1 and ΔfHo(FeAsO4·0.75H2O)=−1140.38±2.59kJmol−1. The calculated enthalpy was checked by thermodynamic considerations of the system FeAsO4-H2O and found in a good agreement with the expected value. Heat capacity at temperatures higher than the ambient ones was fit by a Berman-Brown polynomial C

Ferric orthoarsenate is less soluble than scorodite (FeAsO4·2H2O) and could be thus an interesting alternative for the disposal of arsenical waste. Its use will be certainly hampered by the high temperature required for its synthesis (>200°C). One could, however, attempt to tweak the pressure oxidation technology such that the formation of ferric orthoarsenate would be enhanced, hence producing a waste form with relatively low arsenic solubility.At relatively high temperatures, roughly around 200 In this work, we have investigated thermodynamic properties and solubility of FeAsO For the synthesis of the sample, 0.4955 Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ From 10 to 25 Thermodynamic modeling of the aqueous solutions was performed with the software suite PHREEQC ( The pH values of the solutions were measured by SenTix® 41 and multimeter pH Heat capacity was measured by relaxation calorimetry using a commercial Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS, from Quantum Design, San Diego, California) at the University of Salzburg, Austria. With due care, accuracy can be within 1% for 5 Using powder X-ray diffraction, the sample was found phase pure. The XRD data were used for a full-profile refinement in the space group Heat capacity ( The differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC) data were fit with a Maier-Kelley polynomial In a series of solubility experiments, we focused especially on aqueous solutions with low to very low pH ( The samples 5 and 7–10 have Fe/As (molar) ratio greater than 0.85 ( The samples 5 and 7–10 yield the uncertainty of 0.33 log units as two standard deviations of the mean. We have also investigated the uncertainty of a single solubility measurement, not commonly considered in solubility experiments. A rigorous error estimate via the error propagation is exceedingly complicated as it involves differentiation of the mathematical apparatus used to derive the final value. The mathematical apparatus embedded in the program PHREEQC, however, is so complex that such analysis is deemed to be impossible. Instead, we have used the bootstrap analysis, a method based on random sampling with replacement. In short, the analytical data for the sample 9 were randomly resampled, meaning that the Fe and As concentrations in each sample were varied within the given analytical uncertainties. It was assumed that the analytical errors are distributed normally. Altogether 5000 samples were created and the log The final uncertainty was calculated by bootstrap analysis for all analytical data (for samples 5, 7–10), including their individual uncertainties. The final log Using auxiliary data for Δ Attempts to measure the enthalpy of formation via acid-solution calorimetry were unsuccessful. The dissolution of the ferric orthoarsenate in hydrochloric acid was so sluggish that no useable data could have been obtained. The enthalpy of formation can be calculated, however, from the known Gibbs free energy and entropy of formation, using the simple equation Δ From the enthalpy of formation, one can back-calculate the enthalpy of dissolution of the ferric orthoarsenate in the calorimetric solvent (5 The results for the FeAsO Our ongoing study was and is driven primarily by the question if there are alternative phases for the arsenic disposal with a better performance than the phases used nowadays. Here, we focus only on the solubility, fully realizing that the performance is not measured by solubility alone. Ease of precipitation and filtration, dewatering characteristics, and long-term stability, for example, are other factors to be considered. Thermodynamic properties, including solubility, of scorodite and other FeAsO The solubility of ferric orthoarsenate is lower than that of scorodite ( An obstacle for the long-term use of ferric orthoarsenate is its instability in neutral solutions. Ferric orthoarsenate, just like scorodite, may be a target of microbial attack (e.g., We thank three anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.
