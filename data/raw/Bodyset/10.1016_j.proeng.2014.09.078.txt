Potential applicability of X-ray fluorescence conveyor analyzer CON-X03 was demonstrated for the quantitative on-line measurement of P, S, Cl, K and Ca in several types of ground phosphate rock, phosphate fertilizers and intermediates at various stages of phosphate processing. In addition to the physical components required to perform on-line XRF measurements, the analyzer is equipped with special evacuated mini-chamber. Assessment of calibration quality for P, S, Cl, K and Ca was demonstrated on the basis of control samples and synthetic mixtures. The dynamic simulation of on-line measurements of ground N-P-K fertilizers continuous flow indicated a statistically acceptable correlation with laboratory chemical analyses (relative standard deviation for P is better than 2.0%, for S and K â€“ better than 10% relative). Application of on-line conveyor XRF analyzer to industrial processing generates real-time feedback of elemental composition and quality of phosphates moving on the conveyor thus enables to automate control of the production processes.
