In this work, the property of physically deposited thin WC films with respect to deposition parameters and conditions reported by previous researchers is being reviewed. The study provides deeper insight to the effect of deposition parameters as well as preliminary selection of parameters for optimization of the WC film preparation for improved tribological properties for industrial applications. Not much studies of WC thin films deposited though PVD methods have been reviewed hence the significance of this review. This brief review references a broad range of published work on WC thin films. The work focuses on the structural properties of the thin film and application emphasis is on wear, corrosion and hardness properties. The film microstructure, wear behavior and temperature effects are typically explained by the Thornton zone model.
