Dental pulp cells (DPCs) are capable of differentiating into odontoblasts that secrete reparative dentin after pulp injury. The molecular mechanisms governing reparative dentinogenesis are yet to be fully understood. Here we investigated the differential protein profile of human DPCs undergoing odontogenic induction for 7 days. Using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser adsorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, 23 protein spots related to the early odontogenic differentiation were identified. These proteins included cytoskeleton proteins, nuclear proteins, cell membrane-bound molecules, proteins involved in matrix synthesis, and metabolic enzymes. The expression of four identified proteins, which were heteronuclear ribonuclear proteins C, annexin VI, collagen type VI, and matrilin-2, was confirmed by Western blot and real-time real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. This study generated a proteome reference map during odontoblast-like differentiation of human DPCs, which will be valuable to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms in odontoblast-like differentiation.
