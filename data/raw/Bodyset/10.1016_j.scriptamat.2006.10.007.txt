The dissolution temperature of Nb(C,N) precipitates in a low-carbon microalloyed steel was quantitatively examined using electrical resistivity. The dissolution temperature of 0.02C–0.08Nb steel was about 1200°C with isochronal annealing for 10min and this was confirmed by transmission electron microscopic observation. In order to quantitatively investigate the precipitation kinetics of Nb(C, A 25 Electrical resistivity is one of the characteristic physical properties of materials and is dependent on temperature and on crystal defects, such as solute atoms, dislocations and impurities. The electrical resistivity of a material,  To confirm the validity of the electrical resistivity result, TEM observation of Nb(C, Thermo-Calc (database TCFE3) using the CALPHAD method  Considering the difference between measured and calculated dissolution temperatures of the present specimen, the experimental solution treatment conditions of other Nb steels, reported in the literature as shown at Consequently, in order to investigate the accurate precipitation kinetics of Nb(C, This research was performed as the POSCO project ‘Development of Computational Simulator to Predict Phase Transformations, Precipitation and Mechanical Properties of Microalloyed Steels’.
