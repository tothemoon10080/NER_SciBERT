                      to use a turning bands method. We also discuss the approximation accuracy.The interest in modeling stochastic processes over spheres with an explicit covariance function is reflected in work in areas as diverse as mathematical analysis, probability theory, spatial point processes, geostatistics and mathematical physics, and the reader is referred to, e.g., There is a wealth of simulation algorithms for Gaussian random fields on However, the natural metric on the sphere is the great circle distance, which describes an arc between any pair of points located over the spherical shell. Covariance functions depending on the great circle distance are called geodesically isotropic in Here, we present an alternative approach based on turning bands, which allows to construct realizations of random fields on spheres with covariance functions depending on the great circle distance. Additionally, the method allows for a reasonable trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy of the realization. In the case of random fields defined over the Euclidean space  Given a Gaussian process on the unit sphere of The second order properties of the Gaussian field obtained by continuation are then inherited from those of the original Gaussian field on the sphere. In particular, we show how to obtain its nonstationary spectral density; The turning bands method is extended to nonstationary processes of Then, the desired simulations are obtained by restricting the nonstationary turning bands method to the sphere. To our knowledge, our proposal represents the first attempt to adapt turning bands methods on the sphere. The outline of the paper is the following.
