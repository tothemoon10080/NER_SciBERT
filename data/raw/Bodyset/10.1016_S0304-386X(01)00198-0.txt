Cyanex 925, Cyanex 301 and their mixtures were used for extraction of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) from sulphuric acid solutions. It was found that the extraction efficiency depends on the extractant, the concentration of sulphuric acid and the diluent. The efficiency of extraction increases with an increase of sulphuric acid concentration in the aqueous feed. Cyanex 925 is better for extraction of arsenic(V), while Cyanex 301 and its mixture with Cyanex 925 are better for arsenic(III). Sulphuric acid is coextracted with these extractants.
                  Arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) can be stripped with water from loaded Cyanex 925 in the multistage process. In the first stage, the stripping of sulphuric acid is preferred. The stripping of arsenic species with water from loaded Cyanex 301 and its mixture is ineffective.Arsenic is an unwanted hazardous waste generated from the processing of a variety of ores including those of copper, gold, nickel, lead and zinc Arsenic(III) can exist in the form of two hypothetical weak acids: HAsO Several attempts have been made to eliminate this undesirable arsenic species from the electrolyte solution, including the conventional decopperization process, precipitation and solvent extraction Cyanex 301, Cyanex 925 and the mixture of these extractants were used as delivered by CYTEC Ind. without purification. Cyanex 301 contains bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)dithiophosphinic acid. Cyanex 925 contains five isomers of trioctylphosphine oxide with branched and normal alkyl chains Synthetic arsenic solutions in sulphuric acid were used. A sample of 1.32 g As Extraction of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) were carried out using equal volumes of both phases (20 mL each) at 50 °C under vigorous mixing (1000 min The extraction of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) was studied under different concentrations of sulphuric acid. The efficiency of the extraction of arsenic depends on sulphuric acid concentration in the initial aqueous solutions, as can be seen in Approximately, linear relationships are obtained when log The transfer of water to the organic phase was not measured but it was significantly depressed by the presence of toluene.  The extraction of As(III) with Cyanex 925 amounts to 42.8% and 8.0% for toluene and octane, respectively. In the case of As(V), removal with Cyanex 925 the extraction amounts to 60.6% and 48.0% for toluene and octane, respectively. Cyanex 925 and its mixture with Cyanex 301 also coextracts sulphuric acid. Cyanex 925 in toluene extracts 4.4–6.7% of sulphuric acid and its mixture with Cyanex 301 in toluene extracts 8.0–12.0%. The influence of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) in the feed on the sulphuric acid extraction with Cyanex 925 and its mixture with Cyanex 301 in toluene is relatively small, i.e., the coextraction of sulphuric acid is only slightly decreased in the presence of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V). Approximately linear relationships are obtained when the content of sulphuric acid in the organic phase is correlated with its equilibrium content in the aqueous phase About 30% and 40% arsenic(V) can be stripped from the loaded Cyanex 925 dissolved in octane and toluene, respectively. Thus, multistage stripping is needed to achieve a high recovery. However, only 2–3 stages are needed because the stripping in the second and third stage is more effective than in the first stage in which near 70% of sulphuric acid is also stripped. The neutralisation with an alkaline agent can not be carried out because a stable emulsion is then formed. Arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) cannot be removed from the loaded mixture of Cyanex 925 and Cyanex 301, and Cyanex 301 by stripping with water. In addition, the stripping of sulphuric acid from loaded Cyanex 301 and its mixture with Cyanex 925 is low and amounts to 7.5–20% indicating a strong interaction of sulphuric acid molecules with the molecules of extractant and arsenic species. The extraction of arsenic increases from feeds containing higher concentrations of sulphuric acid. Differences in extraction efficiency of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) with Cyanex 301 and Cyanex 925 are observed. Cyanex 301 and Cyanex 925 are always better extractants for arsenic(III) and arsenic(V), respectively. The diluent does not affect the efficiency of arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) extraction with Cyanex 301 and with the mixture of Cyanex 925 and Cyanex 301. Cyanex 925 is a better extractant for arsenic(V) and arsenic(III) when dissolved in toluene. Arsenic(III) and arsenic(V) can be stripped with water from the loaded Cyanex 925 but the stripping from the loaded Cyanex 301 and its mixture with Cyanex 925 is low.
