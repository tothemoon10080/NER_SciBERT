The cloud point extraction experiments of La(III) ions using the C13E10 as non-ionic surfactant were carried out. The experimental optimization was realized by the classical method when optimizing one experimental factor at the time. The results showed that the La(III) ions were extracted at 61.77% and stripped from the loaded coacervate phase at 90.26% in one-stage with the nitric acid solution of 10−1 M. The most influent experimental factors such as: initial concentration of feed phase (A), C13E10 concentration (B), quantity of sodium chloride salt (C) and pH of aqueous feed solution (D) were studied by the Taguchi’s DOE methodology using an orthogonal array L9 (3^4). Statistical study based on the ANOM and ANOVA analysis showed that the factor D constituted a noise and the levels optimum combination for the maximum extraction yield of La(III) was at: C0
                     =150ppm and [C13E10]=15% w/w without the add salt. These results were refined by using the Design-Expert 7 software where the predicted extraction yield of La(III) was in good agreement with that obtained experimentally (62.88% against of 61.77%), in which the standard deviation was of 1.81%.Lanthanum fits the group of light rare earth metals (LREMs) with elements such as Sc, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd where the group of heavy rare earth metals (HREMs) include the eight others elements ( The non-ionic surfactants were obtained by the addition of ethylene oxide to a variety of apolar moieties including alkyl chains (from alcohols, fatty acids or amides), alkyl benzenes, silicone derivatives or polyoxypropylene chains (lipophil part). The hydrophilic part of the surfactant molecule is the polyoxyethylene moieties ( The preliminary works on metal ions CPE were related to the nickel(II) and zinc(II) extraction by 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol in nonionic surfactant solution ( The aim of the present work is the statistical refinement of the experimental optimization study of the La(III) CPE using C The commercial non-ionic surfactant; C The weighing operations were made with an analytical balance, type OHAUS. pH measurements were taken with HANNA instruments; type 2210 The CPE experiments of La(III) were realized in test tubes. So, different quantities of C A solution of 100 Thus, Arsenazo(III) molecules react with La(III) ions to form the stable La(III)-Arsenazo(III) complexes where the wavelength characteristic of maximum absorption was of The experimental study of La(III) ions CPE using C C C: La(III) ions concentration in bulk aqueous phase, after extraction C The La(III) ions CPE by C The influence of initial pH of aqueous feed phase on the La(III) CPE by C A successful process of metal ions CPE was reached by maximizing the extraction yield and by minimizing the volume of coacervate phase ( In order to study the influence of ionic strength on La(III) extraction extent by C In addition, when increasing considerably the amount of salt, the CPT decreases due to a phenomenon comparable to the salting out caused by the electrolyte solvate, which weakens the hydrogen bonds between the molecule and the polar head of the surfactant. In fact, the sodium chloride salt change probably the continuous medium by direct action on the unit PEG (polyethylene glycol) which leads to decrease of CPT ( The study of influence of the initial concentration of feed phase on La(III) CPE by C Some previous work related to lanthanides extraction namely the lanthanum by different chemical techniques were presented in In the classical experimental study, the experiments are carried out by changing one factor at the time and keeping the other parameters constant. The study is advanced by examining the corresponding results, which involve both wasting material and time-consuming. Design of experiments (DOE) is a systematic, rigorous approach to engineering problem-solving that allows the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiments and determining the relationship (model equation) between factors affecting a process and the output of that process ( Taguchi’s DOE methodology is established by Gen’ichi Taguchi for industrial purposes that develops the quality of manufactured goods ( The important factors taken in the experimental optimization study of La(III) CPE by C In Taguchi parameter design approach, the desirable (signal) and undesirable (noise) values are examined for the characterization of output measures (responses). The term “signal” determines the extent of noise factors on the experiment output (will disclose the sensitiveness of the experiment output to the noise factors). The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio measures the process performance by studying the deviations of the output measures from the desired values ( n: Replicate number of each experiment E  Analysis of mean was used to determine the levels of different factors that give the optimal extraction yield of La(III) CPE (i.e., levels that led to the smallest observed deviation of the output from the target). In Taguchi’s methodology, the aim is to identify the factors levels to minimize the process sensitivity to variations in noise factors (i.e., factors that cannot be controlled when the process is performed industrially). Therefore, the process output can be maximized by selecting appropriate values of the controllable factors. This will be conducted by the ANOM of signal to noise ratios and the average extraction yields that are given by the Eqs.     The results of signal-to-noise ratios and the average extraction yields of La(III) using ANOM ( To contrary of factor “B”, the shape of segments of factor “C” are descending ( In the case of factor “D”, the shape of segments showed practically a linear evolution from level 1 to level 2 ( The shape of segments of factor “A” presents another aspect ( The Taguchi’s suggestions summary showed that the highest extraction yield of La(III) was obtained when the factors; A, B, C and D were taken at optimal levels of: 3, 3, 1 and 2 with their corresponding signals to noise ratios: 36.47, 36.84, 36.54 and 35.13, respectively. From Taguchi’s parameters setting, factor “B” and “C” are classified in the third group where the factor “A” is belongs to the first group. We noted there was no factor of the second group who affect the S/N ratios only. However, the initial concentration of La(III) can be utilized to reduce the variations in the process output. Then, C Analysis of variance is a statistical tool used to interpret the significance of experimental data, which gives the optimal performance of factors in the process basing on the determination of significant differences among them. In the context of L L and m is the number of levels of each factor and the experiments number carried from L Degree of freedom (DOF  Experimentally, factor “D” has increased linearly the extraction yield of La(III) to a value of 54.83% (pH In fact, ANOVA was recalculated without the factor “D”. The refinement of statistical calculation was carried out with Design-Expert 7 software (trial version, Stat-Ease, Minneapolis, MN, USA) where the results were given in To determine the optimum conditions of La(III) CPE by C The experimental optimization of lanthanum CPE by the C The authors thank the laboratory of Separation and Purification Technologies -
