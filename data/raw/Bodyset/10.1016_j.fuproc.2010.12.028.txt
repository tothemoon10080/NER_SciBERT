Carrier microencapsulation, CME, is a technique to form a thin layer of metal oxide or hydroxide on pyrite surface using a water soluble organic carrier combined with metal ions. The present study investigated the effect of CME using a tris-catecholato complex of Si4+, Si(cat)3
                     2− on pyrite-coal separation by dynamic bubble pick-up experiments and Hallimond tube flotation experiments using coal, pyrite, and a coal–pyrite mixture. The mineral samples were treated in 0–5molm−3 Si(cat)3
                     2− solutions at pH 4–9 at treatment times of 1–24h. Dynamic bubble pick-up experiments showed that CME treatment converted the pyrite surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic but did not affect coal's hydrophobic surface. The results of the Hallimond tube flotation experiments of a coal–pyrite mixture at pH 7–9 in the presence of kerosene as a collector showed that pyrite floatability was selectively suppressed after 1h CME treatment with 0.5mol−3 Si(cat)3
                     2− while both coal and pyrite were floated without the treatment. This indicates that CME treatment is effective in suppressing pyrite floatability in coal–pyrite flotation.Pyrite, FeS Dense media separation, cyclones, jigs, and froth flotation are some of the existing techniques for coal processing In froth flotation, air bubbles are introduced into a mineral suspension. Hydrophobic minerals attach to the air bubbles and are recovered as the froth product but hydrophilic minerals remain in the suspension and are discarded to the tailing pond as the tailing. Coal is hydrophobic and is separated from hydrophilic gangue minerals e.g., pyrite in the flotation. However, the natural hydrophobic property of pyrite makes coal–pyrite separation difficult as significant amounts of pyrite are recovered in the froth along with the coal The other problem associated with pyrite in coal is the formation of acid mine drainage or AMD in the tailing dam when pyrite is disposed as tailing from the flotation process. The disposed pyrite comes in contact with oxygen and water and is oxidized to produce sulfuric acid, which can dissolve toxic heavy metals from other minerals Relating to the above two problems (recovery of entrapped pyrite in the froth during flotation and AMD formation due to pyrite oxidation), many studies have been done in the past. To suppress pyrite floatability in flotation, the use of depressants such as sodium sulfide, potassium dichromate, potassium permanganate, ferrous/ferric sulfate, aluminum and ferric chlorides, and sodium cyanide The authors have proposed carrier microencapsulation (CME) as a new coating technique for pyrite. In CME, pyrite is immersed in aqueous solutions of an organic carrier (e.g., catechol) combined with a metal ion (e.g., Ti In this study, effect of CME treatment (using tris-catecholato complex of Si A specimen-grade pyrite (origin: Peru) was crushed and in a jaw crusher (Retsch BB51) and grounded in a ball mill, and sieved to obtain a 100–150 The raw coal (origin: Kushiro Coal Mine, Japan) was crushed to small pieces by a hammer and the impurities were removed by hand-picking.
