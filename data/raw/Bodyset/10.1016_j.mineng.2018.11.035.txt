The results showed that the shape coefficient of the completely broken product was stable at 0.82. During the crushing process, the mineral components with large dielectric constant migrated to −0.3 mm fine particle, and the

                      of muscovite was 1.86. The main factors that affected the breakage sequence were the dielectric properties. The results showed that a certain order existed for different mineral components during the fragmentation process:

                     . In addition, for higher dielectric constant, the breakage happened earlier. The fitted energy consumption model showed that, with the decrease in grain size, the efficiency of the energy utilization decreased.Crushing plays an important role in the process of mineral processing. It consumes a large amount of energy and has a decisive influence on the downstream processing ( The technology of high voltage pulse used for crushing and dissociation was discovered accidentally. In 1971, Andres used the high voltage pulse for the first time to perform a comparative dissociation test on apatite ( The recycling of concrete is widely used in Japan. However, concrete recycled by traditional ways can only be used as a roadbed material. In contrast, the material recycled by high voltage pulse crushing can meet the requirements of building materials ( In this work, high voltage pulse technology is used to break copper iron ore to separate specific mineral components under different operating conditions, and to break minerals in a particular sequence to realize stepwise mineral enrichment. When the selected sample crushing instrument works, the current is discharged into the reaction tank through an electrode. Crushing is a gradual process because of the influence of different mineral components that have different electrical properties. Later, the discharge channel occurred along the junction of different components, the minerals were broken along the grain boundaries, and hence, the selective crushing took place ( The selective fragmentation of minerals is influenced by the operating parameters. The electrical properties of different mineral components are different, and therefore, the degree of difficulty to dissociate them is different. In the crushing process under initial pulse, the biggest difference was the high content of crushing product. With the increase in pulse, the content of biggest difference electrical properties components in newly generated crushing product gradually decreased. Smaller the amount of dielectric constant, smaller was the difference among various components at low pulse dissociation. In addition, with the increase in pulse, the contents of crushing products gradually increased in Here, In addition, In the present work, copper ore samples were tested. The samples were taken from Fushun, Liaoning, PR of China. The particle size was controlled within the range of 25–40 mm. The reduction method was used for the preparation of XRF sample. And three samples were ground to −200 mesh for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) testing of minerals. The average grade of copper was 0.95%. The chemical composition of the mineral is presented in The X-ray diffraction In this study, SELFRAG LAB S2.1 was used for crushing. The physical drawings of the equipment and the schematic are shown in The sample was tested in a reactive tank, and the frequency was 2 Hz. The test was carried out under different voltages and pulse numbers. For every condition, the sample was changed for analysis. The voltage was varied through 100, 130 and 160 kV, whereas the number of pulses were varied through 40, 70, and 100. The distance between the plates was maintained to be 25 mm. The reactive tank did not have any screen. After crushing, the particle size distribution, morphological characteristics, and grade changes were analyzed through the techniques of sieving, BT2900 dynamic image particle analysis system, SEM and XRF. In this work, the percentage of material finer than 4 mm The relative change between the crushed products of different size fractions and the feed in the metal’s grade was used to represent the preferential crushing index, which can be calculated using Eq. When When Furthermore, larger the relative change in the metal’s grade, better is the selectivity for minerals. In order to explore the effects of different pulse stages on selective crushing of various components present in the mineral, the cumulative single pulse is used. The accumulation of single pulse is defined as the percentage of the component’s content added during a certain stage for a certain increase in the number of pulses. The accumulation efficiency is calculated using Eq. In order to further explore the crushing process, the difference between the mechanical crushing and electrical crushing was studied. The –non-gangue minerals crushed through electrical crushing were chosen for scanning electron microscope- Energy Dispersive Spectrum (SEM-EDS) analysis (The selected sample is not the quartz aggregate, after electrical crushing, due to the selective breakage of high voltage pulse, the quartz aggregate is hard to breakage, there exists the quartz aggregate in the crushed products). The results are shown in  In this experiment, the value of With the increase in pulse number and voltage, the contents of incompletely crushed product gradually decreased. Particularly, when the pulse number was changed from 40 to 70, the corresponding increase in the yield of fine-grained product was relatively higher. With the increase in voltage and pulse number, there still exists some coarse-grained products. Under the condition of 160 kV and 100 pulses, the yield of incompletely crushed products was 5.94%. The electrical crushing was based on the dielectric difference among the minerals, the fragmentation process was the gradual dissociation among various components. The coarse grain products having similar dielectric properties was hard to dissociate. Due to this reason, some quantity of coarse grain product was still observed after the crushing. The breaking of minerals under electrical crushing is mainly dependent on different dielectric properties of minerals. The distribution of The distribution of preferential crushing index It can be seen that chalcopyrite was enriched in −0.3 mm, and had the advantage of selective crushing. For −0.3 mm, the selective crushing index was higher than 1. With the increase in voltage, the selectivity of chalcopyrite also increased. For +0.3 mm, the value for The distribution of It can be seen that pyrite was enriched with −0.2 mm fraction, and had the advantage of selective crushing. The The distribution of selective crushing index It can be seen that the The components with higher permittivity were enriched with fine grains after the crushing, and the value of The distribution of chalcopyrite, pyrite and mica for −4 mm at different pulse numbers and voltages are shown in It can be seen from It can be seen from The increased voltage can accelerate the fragmentation and dissociation of mineral components. However, the order of crushing of minerals was still influenced by the nature of minerals. With the increase in voltage (at 70 pulses), the yield of pyrite was higher than that of the broken products. The breakage and dissociation of pyrite occurred earlier than that for 130 kV. Additionally, the yield of muscovite increased significantly, and the values of The sequence of breakage was as follows: chalcopyrite > pyrite > mica. The order of breakage was the same as the dielectric constant value of the mineral components. The main reason was that the metallic minerals were embedded in the gangue mineral, and the crushing dissociated the metal components from the gangue. In the crushing process, due to the greater difference in dielectric constant for metal and gangue minerals, the high voltage pulse is more easily attached to the boundary between metal and gangue minerals, and therefore, the mineral broke more easily. Due to this reason, it broke early as shown by the crushing sequence. As for high voltage pulses breakage, dielectric properties is one of the main factors that affect the breakage process. For this copper ore, the main components are quartz and anorthose, and the dielectric constant are 4.2–5.9 and 5.1–5.7, respectively. It is far less than that of chalcopyrite and pyrite, which is 81 and 33.7–81 respectively. In the breakage process for chalcopyrite and pyrite from this copper ore, it can be considered as a fragile mineral(‘fragile mineral’ means the minerals is more susceptible to HVP), while the dielectric properties is effectively for the breakage. In the breakage of anorthose and muscovite from the copper ore, it can be considered as a refractory mineral, and the dielectric properties is useless for the breakage. In mineral processing, the copper ore is used to acquire the chalcopyrite. In the process, this ore is fragile and the effective dielectric properties can considered ’high ‘. In the process of high-voltage pulse crushing, the degree of dissociation increased with the decrease in particle size. The final form of products crushed by high voltage pulse was the monomeric minerals ( From Under the condition of 100 and 130 kV voltages, the shape coefficient of the crushed products changed with the change in pulse number from 40 to 70, and then to 100. This was mainly due to the increasing pulse number increased the shape coefficient to a constant and increased the degree of dissociation. When the shape coefficient of −0.074 mm crushed products is approximately constant with pulse number, it can be considered dissociated completely. Under the voltage of 160 kV, the mineral shape coefficient remained stable, which was due to the reason that high voltage could induce higher energy and increased the degree of dissociation, and the −0.074 mm crushed products is approximately dissociated completely. The higher voltage and pulses can induce higher energy, increase the degree of dissociation, make the −0.074 mm crushed products approximate dissociated completely. Energy consumption is pivotal in the process of crushing. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the relationship between the energy consumption and size of the crushed products. In this section, the energy consumption is acquired from the panel of high voltage pulse equipment, which is the energy transferred to electrical breakdown process ( Polynomial fitting was performed for the experimental data of energy consumption and average particle size in The sum of the square of errors was 0.95, which indicated that the fitting results were satisfactory. With the decrease in crushing size, the energy consumption tended to increase gradually. Additionally, the increase in energy consumption gradually became larger. These results show that the energy utilization efficiency decreased with the decrease in particle size when high voltage pulse was used to reduce the particle size.  With the increase in voltage and pulse number, the fine-grained products gradually increased, whereas the coarse-grained products gradually decreased. Due to impact breakage mechanism, coarse fractions still existed after pulse-based electrical crushing. In addition, the metal content at the mineral surface increased as a result of the gangue breaking away from the minerals. The −0.074 mm products were liberated by addition of the pulse energy and the shape coefficient was stable at 0.82. Using crushing by high-voltage pulse, the mineral components with large dielectric constant broke into fine grains, which were enriched with fine grains having Under high voltage pulse crushing, the breaking sequence of the minerals was mainly influenced by the dielectric constant, and The relationship between the energy consumption of high voltage pulse and average particle size of the broken product was also studied. The energy consumption varied with the change in average particle size of the broken product. With the decrease in grain size, the energy consumption increased and the efficiency of the energy utilization decreased. The authors acknowledge the financial support by the
