Selective recovery of pure precious metals has always been a major challenge to researchers, with significant impact on the Canadian economy and that of Northern Ontario especially. Thus, mining companies are highly invested in the extraction and refining of these valuable elements. This research aims to exploit a nanotechnologically-designed adsorbent (denoted MP-HMS) to extract and separate rhodium from ultra-low concentration solutions. Adsorption tests were conducted on simulated solutions containing Rh ions and ubiquitous transition metals found in typical mine effluents (Cu, Ni and Zn). The affinity of the adsorbent towards Rh under varying concentrations and electrochemical reducing conditions was assessed. The materials showed distinctive binding selectivity towards rhodium under different reducing conditions and displayed rapid adsorption kinetics.
