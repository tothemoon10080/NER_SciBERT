Strongly degenerate parabolic convection–diffusion equations arise as governing equations in a number of applications such as traffic flow with driver reaction and anticipation distance and sedimentation of solid–liquid suspensions in mineral processing and wastewater treatment. In these applications several parameters that define the convective flux function and the degenerating diffusion coefficient are subject to stochastic variability. A method to evaluate the variability of the solution of the governing partial differential equation in response to that of the parameters is presented. To this end, a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion of the solution is approximated by its projection onto a finite-dimensional space of piecewise polynomial functions defined on a suitable discretization of the stochastic domain, according to the basic principle of the hybrid stochastic Galerkin (HSG) approach. This approach is combined with a finite volume (FV) method, resulting in a so-called FV–HSG method, to compute the sought deterministic coefficient functions of the truncated polynomial-chaos-based expansion of the solution. Since the stochastic parameter space is now spanned by piecewise polynomial functions, one may employ the numerical result to compute the reconstruction of the numerical solution for arbitrary values of the random variables. The expectation, the variance or other stochastic quantities of the solution (as functions of time and position) can also be computed from these coefficient functions. The method is illustrated by a number of numerical examples.This work is focused on numerical methods for the quantification of the stochastic variability of solutions Under the assumption of strong degeneracy, To put the present paper into the proper perspective, we mention that the applications motivating strongly degenerate parabolic equation With respect to uncertainty quantification for conservation laws and related partial differential equations in a general context, we mention that the straightforward Monte Carlo (MC) computations of sampling solutions produced under stochastic variation of the input data are easily implemented, but quantifying randomness via the MC approach can be computationally inefficient due to the slow convergence rate of stochastic approach, in particular in the case of high computational costs for each sample. However, the computational efficiency of MC can be significantly improved by multi-level Monte Carlo [ In this paper we focus on the hybrid stochastic Galerkin (HSG) discretization which belongs to the broad class of intrusive stochastic Galerkin (SG) methods. The application of the intrusive SG methods to the uncertainty quantification of PDEs goes back to the work by Ghanem and Spanos in the early 1990s [ As is mentioned above, the intrusive SG discretization was applied to the clarifier–thickener (CT) model with random feed in [ The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section In Section In Section For Problems A, B and C we always impose the initial condition The classical LWR traffic model [ Problem C describes the settling of a suspension of fine particles dispersed in a viscous fluid, where We assume that the parameters arising in We wish to assess the uncertainty in the solution of Problem A or B (for the traffic model) and of Problem C (for the sedimentation model) under the assumption that the stochastic variability of a number Let The main idea of the HSG method is the decomposition of the stochastic domain In order to apply the HSG approach to the final model we replace the unknown By using the orthogonality relation The central-upwind scheme was introduced in [ We conclude the analysis by a summary of the method of computational uncertainty quantification (UQ). The purpose of the method is to provide a tool to numerically investigate the influence of several random parameters within the coefficients of the governing PDE The usual quantities of interest in stochastic applications, namely the expectation and the variance, can be also computed from the coefficient functions In the numerical examples we apply the FV–HSG method presented in the previous section to different scenarios. We compute the numerical solutions for several maximal polynomial orders For the analysis of the accuracy of the stochastic discretization we compare the expectation and variance at time The reference solution in each case is the result of the MC approach with In Example 1, vehicular traffic on an infinite highway is modelled by the random perturbed diffusively corrected LWR traffic model on the interval  The interval The numerical approach of expectation and variance with the FV–HSG method shows the convergence for increasing We now simulate the vehicular traffic on a circular highway modelled by the diffusively corrected LWR traffic model. The circular highway is modelled by the interval  The numerical experiments show the convergence of the expectation and variance for increasing Examples 3 to 5 are related to the settling of a suspension forming compressible sediment. The sedimentation model will be used in two versions (Model 2 (Example 3) and Model 3 (Examples 4 and 5)). Model 2 is based on the assumptions stated in [  The numerical solution at For the analysis of accuracy of the stochastic discretization we compare the expectation and variance computed with FV–HSG with The comparison of the numerical approach of expectation and variance computed with FV–HSG with the reference solution indicates convergence for increasing The parameters of Model 3 (Examples 4 and 5) are chosen more closely to assumptions typical in wastewater treatment. In that application, and in our examples, In Examples 4 and 5 we investigate the short- and long-time influence of the magnitude of the random parameters controlled by For the discussion of the short-time behaviour of the numerical solution we apply the FV–HSG method to Examples 4 and 5 at In the next step we study the long-time behaviour of the numerical solution. For this purpose we apply the FV–HSG method to both Examples 4 and 5 at The numerical experiments have shown that the magnitude of the random perturbations of the diffusion threshold parameter In addition to the intrusive methods considered above there is also broad variety of non-intrusive methods that are widely used for uncertainty quantification. These non-intrusive methods are supposed to be more efficient for an increasing number of random sources since they usually suffer less on the course of dimensionality, where the strategy of selection of the sample points evaluated is crucial for the quality of the approach. In particular, this strategy, and also the values of the related weights for the Gaussian quadrature, which provides expectation and variance, is usually defined by assumptions on the distribution of the solution. Therefore, also the accuracy of the solution is strongly affected by the quality of the assumptions on its distribution, at least for low numbers of sample points. Another problem that should be discussed in the future is the treatment of the discontinuities, which can induce Gibbs phenomena. We take the stochastic collocation method by Babuška et al. [   In the presented numerical experiments the stochastic collocation shows an accurate approach of the expectation and variance and also convergence to the Monte Carlo solution with the increasing number of collocation points.  In this work we applied the FV–HSGmethod to several scenarios (motivated by traffic modelling, mineral processing and wastewater treatment) that are modelled by the non-linear parabolic strongly degenerate equation The short-time and long-time numerical experiments show the convergence of the expectation and variance computed with the FV–HSG method to the reference solution given by the MC approach for increasing polynomial order One of the important advantages of the HSG method (and also of other intrusive methods) is the possibility to reconstruct the quantities of interest during post-processing without having to consider them during the simulation, and also without the need to store all samples. The main limitation of the method is the rapidly increasing computational complexity for increasing number of random parameters Further improvements of the computational efficiency could be expected by using of load balancing tools particularly with regard to the different computational effort on different stochastic elements. Also the exploiting of the matrix vector structure is promising from the point of view of implementation for many core or GPU-based systems.
