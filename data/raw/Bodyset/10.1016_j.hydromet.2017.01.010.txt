Reactive magnesia (MgO) with a high purity and reactivity is used in several high-end applications. This study reports the feasibility of synthesizing high reactivity MgO from reject brine with the use of NH4OH. The molar amount of NH4OH was optimized at a NH4OH/Mg2+ molar ratio of 6 to provide maximum magnesium oxide yield and purity. This led to the synthesis of Mg(OH)2 with a purity of 93.5%, which was further calcined at 500°C for 2h to produce reactive MgO with a SSA of 78.8m2/g. This study shed light on the significant potential of reject brine in the recovery of Mg2+ and the synthesis of reactive MgO with a wide range of potential applications.Magnesium oxide (MgO) is produced in different grades and finds use in several applications ranging from the pharmaceutical to the refractory industries due to its superior stability and chemical resistance. A majority of MgO is produced via the calcination of magnesite (MgCO Unlike limestone which is abundant and available worldwide, large magnesite deposits are mainly located in China and North Korea ( The precipitation of Mg The precipitation of Mg Calcination of the resulting Mg(OH) The main difference between MgO obtained from the calcination of magnesite and synthetically from seawater/brine or any relevant solutions is the higher purity and reactivity of the latter ( Reject brine, which is of particular interest in this study, is a concentrated by-product with a high salt concentration obtained from treating brackish water or seawater in desalination plants ( Although there are many studies on the reaction of synthetic MgCl In this study, NH Unlike seawater or natural brine, reject brine contains suspended solids through the chemicals added to precipitate the colloidal particles in the seawater before running through ultra-filtration in the desalination process. After the collection of reject brine from the plant, it was filtrated through a 45 A pre-determined amount of NH Reject brine and NH The pH and temperature of the reaction were monitored by using a pH/thermometer (Mettler Toledo pH/Ion meter S220), which was calibrated before each experiment with a standard solution set at a pH of 4, 7 and 10.21, to reveal the kinetics of the chemical reactions between reject brine and NH Several techniques including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analyses were utilized to characterize the synthesized Mg(OH)  The formation of Mg(OH)  The Mg  The morphologies of the synthesized Mg(OH)    The Mg(OH)   Regardless of the different SSA comparisons, the SRM obtained in this study can be classified under “category I” referring to highly reactive MgO with an SSA of over 60 This study shed light on the significant potential of reject brine in the recovery of Mg The authors would like to acknowledge research scholarship from Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University.
