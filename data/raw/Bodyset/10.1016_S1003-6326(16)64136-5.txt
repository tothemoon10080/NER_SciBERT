Ni-Co coatings with various cobalt contents were electrodeposited from modified Watts bath. The effect of cobalt content on electrodeposition mechanism of the coatings was studied by electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy method (EIS). Surface morphology and crystallographic structure of the coatings were investigated by means of SEM and XRD. Mechanical properties of the coatings were determined using Vickers microhardness and tensile tests. It was found that with increasing the Co2+ ions in electroplating bath, the charge transfer resistance (R
                     ct) of Ni–Co film increased whereas the Warburg impedence decreased. This may be due to enhancement in coverage of cathode surface by Co(OH)2 and higher diffusion rate of metal ions towards cathode surface, respectively. Also, with increasing the cobalt content in the bath, cobalt content in the alloy coating increased anomalously and (111) texture consolidated gradually. With increasing the cobalt content up to 45% in alloy coating, the grain size decreased and consequently, hardness and strength of the alloy increased. Further enhancement of cobalt content up to 55% led to a little decrease in hardness and strength. The maximum ductility was observed for Ni–25%Co coating due to relatively small grain size and compact structure.
