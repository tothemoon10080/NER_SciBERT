An experimental investigation on the barreling of aluminium with various per cent additive of iron composites, namely, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% with different iron particle sizes, namely −53 +45μm, −75 +63μm and −106 +90μm under triaxial stress state condition has been studied in the present work. Sintered aluminium–iron composites with height to diameter ratio of 0.44 were prepared, sintered, furnace cooled and cold upset forged. A new empirical relationship for the determination of the barrel radius is proposed based on the circular radius of curvature and compared with the experimentally measured barrel radius.

A straight-line relationship was observed for the measured and the calculated radius of curvature of barrel and an exponential relationship was found between the stress ratio parameters and the relative density.initial diameter of the preform bulged diameter of the preform average contact diameter of the preform initial height of the preform height of the deformed preform initial preform density density of the preform after deformation theoretical density of fully dense material relative density (or) fractional theoretical density ( radius of curvature of the barrel calculated radius of curvature of the barrel measured radius of curvature of the barrel axial stress hoop stress radial stress effective stress mean or hydrostatic stress Poisson’s ratio axial strain hoop strain The forging of metal powder preforms for the production of powder metallurgy components having difficult shapes and curves is the latest and drastically growing technique in the metal working technology. The process of producing powder metallurgy components using powder metal forging is basically a combination of two conventional processes, namely powder metallurgy (P/M) and forging. The powder metallurgy components are being widely used for sophisticated industrial applications. The worldwide popularity of powder metallurgy lies in the ability of this technique to produce such complex shapes with exact dimensions at a very high rate production and low cost. Quite often, this technique is used for material systems that are hard to machine and difficult to cast due to detrimental solidification behaviour of material chosen. Green Deformation characteristics of sintered powder materials was investigated by Kuhn and Downey Malayappan and Narayanasamy During compression of a regular polygonal disc between a pair of flat dies, both bulging of sides in the plane section of the disc and barreling along its thickness take place. An upper bound solution constructed for determining the die pressures developed during compression of polygonal discs were calculated by taking into account the barreling aspects, which is, described elsewhere Junejaa The upsetting of relatively slender cylinders, with a diameter-to-height ratio of 0.5–1.0, is often encountered in hot forging and cold upsetting and is also one of the preferred methods of flow stress determination. Because of friction, barreling and even folding-over of the side surfaces occur but, for reasons of convenience, pressure-multiplying factors derived from theories based on homogeneous deformation are generally used not only for the predictive calculation of upsetting pressures, but also for correcting pressures for friction effects when determining the flow stress of materials. Schey et al. An experimental investigation on the barreling of a cylindrical specimen of aluminium–iron composite material with various per cent of iron powder and various iron particle sizes is made. A new relation for the barrel radius is proposed and verified with the measured radius value. Various stress ratio parameters were determined, plotted for the barrel radius and relative density and analyzed. A straight-line relationship is found between the theoretical and measured radius of the cold forged cylindrical specimen. An exponential relationship is found between the stress ratio parameters with the relative density and the barrel radius. The mathematical expressions used and proposed for the determination of various upsetting parameters under triaxial stress state condition are discussed below. According to Narayanasamy and Pandey The above Eq. According to Narayanasamy and Pandey According to Narayanasamy and Ponalagusamy The above Eq. The mean or the hydrostatic stress component can be determined as follows: Atomized aluminium and iron powders of the characterization stated in   The measured barrel radius is plotted against the new parameter according to the theoretically derived Eq.    Straight-line relationship is established between the fractional theoretical density ( Greater densification is found for the smaller iron particle sizes compared to the larger iron particle size. A straight-line relationship is found between the fractional theoretical density and the new geometrical shape factor. A straight-line relationship is established between the measured and the calculated barrel radius with slope 1.0. The relationship between the stress ratio parameter and the barrel radius following the empirical expression, The rate of change of barrel ratio with respect to the stress ratio parameter is very high for lower for smaller iron particle sizes of Al–Fe composite. A straight-line relationship is established between these two parameters with one or two different slopes for each per cent of iron content and iron particle sizes tested.
