Mesoporous nanocrystalline MgAl2O4 spinel powders with high surface area were prepared by the surfactant-assisted route using N-cetyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium bromide as surfactant. The synthesized powders were employed as a support for nickel catalysts in dry reforming for the production of synthesis gas. The obtained results showed that the synthesized powders have promise as support for nickel catalysts. The starting materials were Al(NO Supported nickel catalysts were prepared by impregnation of MgAl The surface areas (BET) and pore size distributions were determined by nitrogen adsorption at âˆ’196 Activity measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor made of a 7   The CH  In summary, mesoporous nanocrystalline magnesium aluminate spinel with high surface area prepared via a surfactant-assisted route shows promise as a support for nickel catalysts in dry reforming. The results showed that the addition of surfactant during the precipitation process has a positive effect in terms of obtaining a material with higher surface area. The catalyst containing 5
