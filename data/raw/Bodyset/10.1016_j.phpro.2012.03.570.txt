The removal of impurity elements from crude nickel by vacuum distillation was carried out at the temperature 1773K∼1973K and the pressure less than 10Pa using crude nickel(≥99.9%)as raw materials. A series of results of the impurity elements were obtained under the experimental conditions aforementioned.The experimental values βi andγi
                     o of the product were also calculted in this paper. The seperation of certain impurities from main element nickel was disscussed from the viewpoint of thermodynamics and alloy composition. Nickel (≥99.99%) was obtained and the purification and impurity removal from crude nickel by vacuum distillation method was feasible and determined. A China Patent on this new technology was also authorized. We consider that the vacuum distillation process of nickel can serve as a pretreatment step for the prepartion of highpurity nickel, and can relieve the following purification of the electrolyte, so that the whole process of preparation of the high-purity nickel is simplified, energy consumption and environmental pollution are reduced. Therefore, the vacuum distillation process is a green metallurgical method.
