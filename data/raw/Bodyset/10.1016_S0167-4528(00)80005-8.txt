A hydrocyclone treating an itabirite iron ore was sampled, characterized in detail using modern image analysis techniques and modeled. Some of the most interesting results from this investigation were: the itabirite studied is highly porous; this property may be advantageous in direct reduction applications; two types of porosity are present; one is macroscopic and the other microscopic; the micro-pores in this itabirite are interconnected. Porosity liberation in the size range studied is associated to the macro pores; the process of liberation in this itabirite is quick, probably aided by liberation by detachment; the regimen inside the hydrocyclone is closer to turbulent than it is to laminar regimen; the density of the slurry in the separation zone must be used instead of the density of the liquid.
                  It is anticipated that lateritic iron ores in general may present significant porosity, and this must be taken into consideration when evaluating image analysis results from this type of ores.
