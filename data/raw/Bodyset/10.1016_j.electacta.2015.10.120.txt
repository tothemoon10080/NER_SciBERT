A novel La-Y-PbO2 electrode was prepared by electrodeposition technique and the degradation mechanism for aspirin was explored. In contrast with the PbO2 electrode, La-PbO2 electrode and Y-PbO2 electrode, La-Y-PbO2 electrode displayed a more compact surface with a smaller grain size of crystal, accompanying with increased concentration of active oxygen species. The higher voltammetric charge quantity of La-Y-PbO2 electrode indicated its larger electrochemical active surface area and higher electrochemical activity. The La-Y-PbO2 electrode was demonstrated to have a superior electrochemical oxidation ability, which had a higher apparent rate constant, mass transport and mineralization current efficiency and lower energy consumption. The evolution of intermediates and the aspirin degradation mechanism were further discussed. Meanwhile, high reusability and safety were achieved by La-Y-PbO2 electrode when treating aspirin wastewater.Pharmaceutical wastewater containing toxic and recalcitrant organic compounds leads to severe environmental problems. The increasing emission of pharmaceutical wastewater can not be treated with satisfied results by the conventional biological treatment because the organic possess high resistance to microbial degradation or utilization, especially in the case of high concentration In recent years, electrochemical oxidation, which provides versatility, energy efficiency, environmental compatibility, cost effectiveness and amenable to automation, has reached a promising stage to effectively degrade toxic or biorefractory organic pollutants This paper focuses on whether the La-Y-PbO The details of the reagents, materials and produces for the preparation of the PbO The electrochemical oxidation experiments of aspirin were carried out by batch processes and the apparatus was mainly consisted of a DC power supply, a magnetic stirrer and a glass reactor. In combination with the working anodes with 14 During experiments, samples were drawn from the reactor at certain intervals and then analyzed for the concentration of aspirin, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The concentrations of aspirin were immediately determined by HPLC (Model 1200, Agilent Technologies, USA), equipped with an RP-C18 column (4.6 The overall reaction process of aspirin oxidation can be defined as: The mineralization current efficiency (MCE) was an evaluation of the electrocatalytic ability and was calculated as  SEM micrographs of PbO The XRD patterns of PbO XPS measurements of PbO The relative content (molar fraction) of different kinds of oxygen species can be evaluated by using the following equation The cyclic voltamograms of PbO Electrochemical active surface area means the active sites are accessible to electrolyte when electrochemical reaction occurs. The voltammetric charge quantity ( The outer charge quantity ( As a result, La-Y-PbO From an application angle, it is important to investigate the effect of initial aspirin concentration on account of the fact that the industrial wastewater usually involves different concentrations of pollutants. The COD removals on PbO The TOC removal efficiency was measured to examine the mineralization performance on the PbO The concentration of The energy consumption estimation is very useful to evaluate the application prospect of a technology. The electrical efficiency per log order (EE/O) is one of the best metrics to describe energy consumption. The definition of EE/O is the electrical energy (in kWh) required to reduce the concentration of a pollutant by one order of magnitude and it is calculated using the following equation  The accumulation of small molecule acid intermediates during the aspirin degradation process, relative to the amount of degraded aspirin, had been calculated as From The La-Y-PbO Thus, during the electrochemical oxidation process, the La-Y-PbO Meanwhile, the aspirin oxidation reaction was in competition with the side reaction of hydroxyl radicals, which would react with each other to form molecular oxygen to complete the electrolysis of the water molecules.
