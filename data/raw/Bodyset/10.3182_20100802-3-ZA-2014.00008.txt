Often the most difficult step in establishing a control system is the development of a suitable dynamic process model. As such a model is not available elsewhere, a first principle dynamic mathematical model was developed for a coal dense medium separation circuit. Each unit operation was modelled individually and then integrated together to form a complete nonlinear state space model for the circuit. This model was used to simulate the process and it was validated using real process data derived from a plant experiment.
