The mechanisms governing internal concentration polarization (ICP) were studied using well-controlled forward osmosis experiments. The relationship between osmotic pressure and water flux was observed across a range of solute concentrations and molecular weights. The effect of membrane orientation on ICP was also studied. Two regimes of ICP — dilutive and concentrative — were described and characterized, and their governing equations were tested. Resistances to solute diffusion within the membrane porous support layer were calculated under each regime and found to be consistent across a wide variety of experimental parameters.
