Abstract
                  The non-isothermal leaching kinetics of primary titanium-rich material by microwave heating was investigated, and the temperature-pressure curves of leaching system and microwave absorption characteristics of mixture solutions before and after leaching were measured. The research of non-isothermal kinetics was evaluated by the leaching rate of Fe and the total apparent velocity equation of the non-isothermal kinetics of leaching for primary titanium-rich material by microwave heating was obtained. It is shown from the temperature-pressure curves that the high temperature and high pressure of closed leaching system are favorable to the enhancement of the leaching rate of Fe. Microwave absorption characteristics of mixture solutions before and after leaching show that there are abrupt changes of microwave absorption characteristics for 15% HCl solution and the mixture solution after leaching by 20% HCl.
