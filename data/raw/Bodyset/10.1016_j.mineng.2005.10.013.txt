  I read with interest the article by Sen et al. in the September 2005 issue describing the gold recovery by coal–oil agglomerate flotation. The authors describe some parameters on a Turkish gold ore and synthetic samples, and reports some important findings in gold recovery. This letter supplies additional information and comments in the article. I see that this article with 29 references was produced from a master thesis in 2000. I have been closely following the related publications in this subject for a long time. It appears that insufficient literature survey was made in this article. The original citations are much earlier than their work and the primary authors should be recognized. For example, the article does not contain many publications (i.e., thesis, articles and patents) of various known researchers working in this area. In general, this paper did not provide many new insights into the gold recovery by a physicochemical process. More specifically, prior to this article, similar process on a Turkish gold ore was carried out for the recovery of small gold particles (   There is a large body of research on flotation and coal–oil-gold agglomeration process, contributed by many researchers whom deserve a great deal of respect. Our study has introduced a new approach to the coal–oil agglomeration and flotation process, emphasizing a use of We thank Dr. Akcil for his comments to our paper. Sincerely,
