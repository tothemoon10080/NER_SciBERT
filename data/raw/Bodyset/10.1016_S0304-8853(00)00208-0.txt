MR behavior is observed in the multilayer of FeN/Co/Cu/Co structure utilizing the difference of the coercive force of two ferromagnetic layers, FeN/Co and Co layer. The mixed phase of FeN layer, fabricated by using the reactive sputtering method, is α-Fe (BCC) and ε-Fe3N (HCP) when MR behavior is observed. A large MR ratio (%) of 3.2% at 25Oe is observed in the FeN(250Å)/Co(70Å)/Cu(25Å)/Co(70Å)/Cu(25Å)/Co(70Å)/FeN(250Å) multilayer film.The spin valve films In this work, we have studied the MR behavior in the multilayered pseudo-spin valve films of the FeN/Co/Cu/Co structure utilizing the difference of the coercive force of two ferromagnetic layers, FeN/Co and Co layers. Two types of mutilayer films, FeN/Co/Cu/Co and FeN/Co/Cu/Co/Cu/Co/FeN, were fabricated on the Si (1 TEM analysis reveals that the FeN layer forms the α-Fe (BCC) phase when the flow rate of N In conclusion, the MR behavior in the FeN/Co/Cu/Co/Cu/Co/FeN(double)-type multilayer film shows a sharp slope at 20 This work was supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) under Grant No. 981-0806-036-2.
