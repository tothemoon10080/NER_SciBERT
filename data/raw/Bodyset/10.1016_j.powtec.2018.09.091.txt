Microwave carbothermic reduction of zinc ferrite was studied based on self-reduction of briquettes composed of zinc ferrite and different reducing agents, including coke, coal and biochar, in a vertical microwave furnace from both thermodynamic and experimental perspectives. The thermodynamic analysis showed that zinc ferrite could be reduced using the carbonaceous materials in a temperature range of 910–1250 °C. The experimental results demonstrated that the reducing agents had distinct microwave absorption capabilities, confirmed by the comparisons of corresponding microwave penetration depths (Dp, in this study Dp,coke> > Dp,coal > Dp,biochar) and reflection losses (RL, in this study RLcoke> > RLcoal > RLbiochar) based on the microwave permittivity and permeability measurements. This finding was in agreement with their different roles in the reduction, which produced reduced briquettes and volatilized matters via a series of stepwise reactions. Compared with conventional reduction, it was also found that the presence of microwave led to a much higher reduction efficiency. The coke exhibited a much lower reduction efficiency than coal and biochar. This observation was more obvious in microwave-assisted reduction where the coal and biochar contributed to high iron metallization degree (97%) and reduction degree (above 99%) after reduction at 1050 °C for 15 min even with low fixed carbon contents. Further analysis of the phase composition and microstructure of the reduced briquettes obtained in microwave-assisted reduction showed that metallic iron particles were formed but aggregated in different morphologies, probably associated with the growth of the metallic particles adjacent to the residual carbonaceous reducing agents. Meanwhile, the analysis of the corresponding volatized matter revealed that it was mainly constituted by highly pure metallic zinc particles which presented a hexagonal structure. The results indicated that in comparison with coke, the other two carbonaceous materials, especially biochar, could serve as more efficient and environmentally friendly reducing agents for treatment of zinc ferrite and zinc-bearing materials by its combined usage with microwave external field.With the development of steelmaking industry, the crude steel production in China reached up to about 16.3 million tons in 2016 [ Up to now, several routes have been proposed for processing zinc ferrite with a primary aim to recover zinc. The traditional hydrometallurgical method is based on acidic leaching using H Unlike hydrometallurgical process, pyrometallurgical method has been widely used for treatment of zinc ferrite based on carbothermic reduction [ The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of carbonaceous reducing agents, including coke, coal, and biochar, on the microwave-assisted carbothermic reduction of zinc ferrite in composite briquettes based on both thermodynamic and experimental analyses. The reducing agents presented distinct effects on the reduction of the zinc ferrite by evaluating their electromagnetic parameters, reduction indexes and microstructures of the reduction products. Zinc ferrite of analytical grade (>99.5 wt%) was used in the experiment. Its XRD pattern and particle size distribution are shown in The thermodynamics of carbothermic reduction of zinc ferrite was studied using the software FactSage 7.0 (Thermfact/CRCT, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; GTT-Technologies, Herzogenrath, Germany). The phase diagram of ZnFe To explore the different roles of carbonaceous reducing agents in microwave reduction of zinc ferrite, the interactions between microwave and reducing agents were assessed prior to the reduction experiment based on the measurement of microwave permittivity (ε Zinc ferrite and reducing agents were pre-dried and then mixed with a specified molar ratio (n The efficiency of microwave reduction of zinc ferrite using different reducing agents was evaluated by determining the iron metallization ratio (η) and the reduction degree ( The chemical compositions of the reduced briquettes were examined using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF, PANalytical, Axio mAX, Netherlands). The phase compositions of reduced briquettes and volatilized matter were determined using an X-ray diffraction spectrometer under the following conditions of radiation: Cu Kα, tube current and voltage: 250 mA, 40 kV, scanning range: 10–80 The phase diagram of ZnFe As shown in The efficiency of carbothermic reduction of zinc ferrite by microwave heating is highly dependent on the microwave absorption capabilities of reducing agents [ The effect of reducing agents on the conventional and microwave-assisted reduction of zinc ferrite was investigated at temperature of 1050 °C for 15 min, as illustrated in The XRD patterns of reduced briquettes and volatilized matters obtained in microwave-assisted reduction using different reducing agents are presented in The microstructures of reduced briquettes obtained in microwave-assisted reduction and reducing agents are compared and shown in Unlike the strong influence of reducing agents on the microstructure of reduced briquettes, the analysis of the morphologies of volatilized matters obtained in microwave-assisted reduction showed no apparent effect of the reducing agents on the formation of metallic zinc particles. All the zinc particles were distributed randomly with a hexagonal structure. The typical microstructure of the volatilized zinc particles are shown in Based on the above results, a reaction model was proposed to unveil the process of self-reduction of composite briquettes of zinc ferrite and carbonaceous materials under microwave irradiation, as shown in This study evaluated the effects of reducing agents on microwave carbothermic reduction of zinc ferrite in composite briquettes based on both thermodynamic and experimental analyses. The thermodynamic analysis showed that zinc ferrite can be reduced using carbonaceous materials in the temperature range of 910–1250 °C with the C/ZnFe This work was partially supported by the
