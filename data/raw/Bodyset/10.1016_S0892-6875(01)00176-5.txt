Conventional wisdom in industry indicates that image analysis of particles in cross-section introduces stereological bias. Current stereological adjustment routines commonly consider only binary systems or have been developed using idealised, computer-generated particles. This work investigates the significance of stereological bias in a multiphase, natural ore and ascertains whether computer generated theoretical particles accurately represent natural textures.
                  Quantitative data, measured through serial sectioning of polished mounts and particle reconstruction are presented for a multiphase system. The study investigated particles from a hardrock titanium deposit that display relatively simple textural attributes and measurements were performed using QEM*SEM. A key finding is that the stereological bias appears to be small for this ore sample. The data suggest that, for multiphase natural ore systems, the stereological bias may not be such an important consideration.
