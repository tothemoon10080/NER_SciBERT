Supported nanocrystalline TiO2 with a diameter of 15–30nm was prepared from previously synthesized radial mesoporous silica (RMS) by a post-synthesis method. In addition, their adsorption-photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of methylene blue (MB) was determined. RMS was tailor-made with the main template of CTAB and the SiO2 precursor of TEOS through a facile self-assembly process. The structural, morphological and textural properties of the well-designed TiO2/RMS samples were characterized. The RMS structure was retained after loading TiO2, but its surface area and pore diameter decreased as a result of partial pore blocking. The removal activity of MB for TiO2/RMS was significantly higher than that of commercial TiO2 nanoparticles. The optimal TiO2 loading (20 wt%) on the support could achieve the complete removal of MB within 70min. The prepared TiO2/RMS particles can be easily separated and display good durability after six reaction cycles.Organic dyes in textile, printing, and other industrial effluents are major environmental contaminants. The estimated annual production of commercially available dyes is approximately 7 In the past decades, as a green technology, heterogeneous photocatalysis by semiconductor materials has attracted considerable attention due to its potential applications in decomposing recalcitrant organic pollutants including organic dyes in water To maximize the photocatalytic activity of TiO A photocatalytic process is a surface-orientated process, which requires adsorption of dyes onto the surface. Mesoporous materials are usually considered as an ideal class of excellent supports due to their large specific surface areas and uniform pore size distributions, which permit easy diffusion of large organic molecules toward internal active sites Compared with other mesoporous materials, the prepared fibrous structured silica nanospheres can help target molecules reach the active sites more easily because of their radial direct channels and large pore sizes The structural properties of RMS and surface properties of TiO In this work, we reported the synthesis of a series of hybrid photocatalyst TiO The materials and parent RMS preparation method were summarized in the Supplementary material. The TiO The morphology and size were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in The Brunauer–Emmett Teller (BET) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement are performed to examine the surface properties of the as-prepared RMS. The corresponding nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore size distribution curve of the sample are shown in The thermal stability of RMS was tested by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal gravity (DTG) ( The crystallinity and the phase purity of the samples were examined by XRD. The quantification results of TiO The textural properties of the synthesized In the N SEM and TEM micrographs of 20%TiO The image of TiO FT-IR is a useful technique for characterizing the framework of titanium species in RMS. To understand the roles of the support (i.e., beneficial or detrimental effects) during the photocatalytic degradation, comparative studies are carried out between 20%TiO As shown in To estimate the kinetic results of the MB removal process, an nth-order rate equation was employed These observations indicated that the higher surface area and adsorption capacity of the hybrid catalyst, compared to those of pure TiO The effect of TiO Because of the high specific area and pore volume, all To optimize the amount of catalyst required for effective MB degradation, catalyst amounts of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 In order to know the effect of substrate concentration on the removal activity, different concentrations of MB (5–50 A process for the MB removal process of TiO The durability of the as-prepared 20%TiO The mesoporous radial silica (RMS) matrices decorated by TiO This work was supported by the Supplementary data to this article can be found online at The following is the supplementary data to this article:
