The ordered intermetallic compounds of Al The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of chromium on the corrosion characteristics of the Al Three ingots of Al Potentiodynamic tests were conducted in the deaerated 3.5% NaCl solution at ambient laboratory temperature. Potentiodynamic tests were performed at a scan rate of 0.166 mV/s The potentiodynamic polarization curves of the three Al  The current density in the steady state decreases with an increase in Cr content and the values are 85, 55 and 35 A/cm  XPS analyses indicated that Al  Breakdown potential increased with increasing Cr content, indicating increased resistance to initiation of pitting corrosion. As the Cr content increased, the passive film did not undergo brittle fracture. The Ti enrichment inside the pit inhibited pit propagation. The Cr addition increased pitting resistance by enhancing the formation of Al-enriched passive film. The passive film developed on the Al The authors are grateful for the support provided by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation through the Center for Advanced Plasma Surface Technology at the Sungkyunkwan University.
