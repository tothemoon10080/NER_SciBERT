An innovative dry vibrating high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) method was developed for the purification of non-metallic ores, and the effect of key variables, i.e., magnetic induction, rotation speed of ring, vibrating amplitude and frequency of ring on the separation performance of a full-scale dry vibrating HGMS separator in purifying kaolin was investigated. The results of investigation indicate that the variables have significant influence on the performance of the separator; an increase in the magnetic induction and rotation speed of ring reduce the mass weight but increase the iron removal rate of nonmagnetic product, and the increase in the vibrating amplitude and frequency of ring cause a rise in the mass weight but a drop in the removal rate. While all the variables were kept optimum, a nonmagnetic product assaying 0.50% Fe2O3 with 84.56% mass weight and 42.08% iron removal rate was obtained from the material assaying 0.73% Fe2O3. It was concluded that this dry vibrating HGMS is effective in eliminating powder coagulations during its separation process and provides a prospective method for the purification of non-metallic ores.The interfusion of iron impurities has been a major problem in the utilization of non-metallic ores, such as kaolin, feldspar, quartz, etc. Such impurities seriously affect the brightness of clay products and subsequently reduce its commercial values. Gravity separation and flotation methods can be used for removing these iron impurities; however, magnetic separation presents the most commonly used method for the purification of non-metallic ores, for instance, for the deferrization of kaolin ( In practice, wet HGMS is conventionally applied for the purification of non-metallic ores, as it is undoubtedly more applicable to have the motion of fine magnetic particles under control than that in a dry HGMS process, thus a higher selectivity and separation efficiency is achievable in a wet HGMS separator. But, wet HGMS process has several demerits ( The most difficult in applying a dry HGMS process lies in the fact that the mechanical entrapment of nonmagnetic particles in the powder coagulations can not be effectively overcome; this, however, in most cases is the most important aspect of the selectivity problem preventing dry HGMS separation from applications ( An innovative dry vibrating HGMS method was developed for the purification of non-metallic ores; and in recent years, a SLon-1000 full-scale vibrating HGMS separator was designed and its operating dynamics was analyzed ( As shown in While the separator is being operated, a direct current flows through the energizing coils and a background magnetic field is built up in the separating zone. The separating ring with magnetic matrix positioned on the ring vibrating mechanism rotates around its horizontal axis in a vibrating manner. The material is evenly fed into the separating matrix in the separating zone, in a very thin layer through the feed distributor, which is installed under the vibrating feed mechanism. Magnetic particles are captured from the material onto the matrix elements, brought to the top of the ring where the magnetic field is negligible, and fall into the launder of magnetic product below to become magnetic product. Nonmagnetic particles, however, pass through the separating matrix and fall into the collecting box of nonmagnetic product, under the gravity and vibration. The main parameters of the separator are listed in This vibrating HGMS separator is an innovative magnetic separation technology designed on the SLon-1000 wet pulsating HGMS separator ( The coal-series kaolin material used for the present investigation was obtained from north Anhui province of China. The material contained 0.73% Fe The material was evenly fed into the separating matrix in the separating zone of the separator, at an optimized solids throughput around 20 After the separator reaches a steady-state separation process, a typical sample was collected from product streams for Fe Mass weight ( The effect of magnetic induction in the separating zone of the vibrating HGMS separator was first studied with the separator at a relatively low rotation speed of 0.8 The magnetic induction is the direct and most dominant force that controls the number of magnetically iron impurities going into the nonmagnetic product in a HGMS separator, thereby producing a significant effect on the performance of the separator ( The separation results of the dry vibrating HGMS separator applied to the kaolin material as a function of the rotation speed of ring is shown in The rotation speed of ring determines the retention time of a magnetic matrix in the separating zone of the separator in a rotation cycle of the ring, thus generating a significant effect on the separation performance of the separator. With the increase of rotation speed, the separating time of material within the magnetic matrix reduces, and large bulks of the material are unseparated and brought out of the separating zone to become magnetic product, as a result of its insufficiency in separating time; this results in the drastic deterioration in the mass weight and the increase in iron removal rate of nonmagnetic product, as shown in As can be seen from As mentioned above, an innovative feature of this dry vibrating HGMS process is the vibration of separating ring, during its rotation for continuous separation. Therefore, in this investigation, the effects of the key variables in the vibrating system, i.e., vibrating amplitude and frequency of ring, on the separation performance of the separator were studied, with separation results as shown in From As shown in It can be seen from With the mass weight and iron removal rate of nonmagnetic product taken into account, the choice of the highest vibrating frequency of 1450 The optimum performance of the SLon-1000 dry vibrating HGMS separator was compared with that of the SLon-1500 wet pulsating HGMS method applied for purifying the kaolin. The wet HGMS separator is also operated under the optimum conditions as labeled at the bottom of From The dry vibrating HGMS separator was also tested for the purification a fine quartz, with the optimum separation results as illustrated in It can be seen from the results and discussion above that: The dry vibrating HGMS method, which combines a vibration for separating ring that makes the ring vibrate during its rotation for continuous separation, and a vibration for feed that makes the material evenly pass through the separating matrix in a very thin layer, presents an innovative HGMS technology. The vibration of separating ring is effective in eliminating powder coagulations. It is crucially important that the intensity of vibration is appropriate so that the entrapped nonmagnetic particles in the coagulations can be vibrated out, while retaining the magnetic particles on the surface of matrix elements by magnetic attractions; the intensity may be optimized by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of vibration. Considering the fact that the dry HGMS process has an inferiority in magnetic selectivity to the wet one, due to its inherent sensitivity to form powder coagulations, this dry vibrating HGMS method is effective in purifying the kaolin material. It is therefore concluded that this dry vibrating HGMS is effective in eliminating powder coagulations and provides a prospective method for the purification of non-metallic ores.
