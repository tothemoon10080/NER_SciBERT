Tungsten and aluminum elemental powders with composition W–20wt.% Al were mechanical alloyed in high energy planetary ball mill. Structural and morphological changes of powder particles after different milling times were studied by X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscopy and microhardness measurements. Mechanical alloying of this system led to the formation of W–Al alloy as a result of formation of W/Al layered microstructure having faceted interface between layers. This alloy indicated high microhardness value of about 570Hv.Tungsten has a variety of industrial applications which stems from its unique properties. Tungsten alloys are used for kinetic energy penetrators, counter weights, radiation shields and electrical contacts Non-equilibrium processing of materials has attracted the attention of a number of scientists and engineers due to the possibility of producing better and improved materials compared to conventional methods There is a growing interest in the production of nanocrystalline and amorphous alloys because of their excellent physical and mechanical properties compared with coarse grained materials An advantage of MA over many other techniques is that it is a solid state technique and consequently problems associated with melting and solidification are bypassed MA is the technique used to manufacture composites with immiscible components such as W–Cu and W–Ag There have been little investigations in literature on the binary W–Al system. Oyang 99.9% pure W powder and 99.8% pure Al powder were mixed to give nominal composition of W–20  The broadening of the peaks during milling indicates a decrease in the crystallite size of powder particles and internal strain induced by lattice defects. As seen in It has been reported that Morphological evolution of powder particles after 2, 5, 20 and 60 After 5 As seen in  The nanocrystalline W–Al alloy was successfully synthesized by mechanical alloying of W–20
