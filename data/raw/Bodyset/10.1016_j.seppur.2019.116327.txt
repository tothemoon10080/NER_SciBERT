This study investigated the reactivity and mechanism of paraben oxidization by chlorine dioxide. Degradation kinetics of methylparaben (MeP) and propylparaben (PrP) followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and were studied in a pH range of 4.0–7.0 at 15 ± 1 °C. The kapp
                      values were 84.3 M−1·s−1 and 83.2 M−1·s−1 for MeP and PrP, respectively, when pH value was 5.0 and the temperature was 15 ± 1 °C. The rate constants depended on the solution pH, temperature, humic acid, and HCO3
                     – concentrations. At pH values of 4–5.0, kapp
                      increased slowly, while at a pH value of 7.0, kapp
                      increased rapidly. The reaction rate constants increased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, the reaction rate was inhibited by humic acid addition, while the reaction rate increased after addition of HCO3

Two main degradation products were identified by GC–MS and the reaction pathways were proposed.Parabens, the esters of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, offer several advantages including highly efficient activity against the growth and reproduction of bacteria over a wide pH range Among the oxidants, chlorine dioxide (ClO Recently, the removal of parabens by ozone, and their photodegradation with TiO This study (1) determined the kinetics for the reaction of ClO Methylparaben (MeP, 98%), propylparaben (PrP, 99%), Sodium chlorite (NaClO All experiments were performed in 250-mL batch reactors equipped with small stirring bars to ensure homogeneous reaction conditions at 15 ± 1 °C. The solutions were maintained at a pH of approximately 5.0 using 20 mM acetate buffer. In the kinetics experiment, both MeP and PrP (5 μM) degradation by ClO To investigate the effects of pH, temperature, humic acid, and HCO The paraben concentrations were determined using an Agilent 1200 series high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a UV detector at 254 nm. Parabens and their decomposition products were separated using an HC-C The major byproducts that formed during paraben degradation were analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS, PerkinElmer Clarus 680 + Clarus SQ 8T, USA). Each sample was prepared via the following process: 5 mL of the sample was withdrawn from the reactor and freeze-dried for 12 h. Then, the sample was re-dissolved with 1 mL DMF and filtered through 0.20 µm mixed cellulose ester membranes; a volume of 100 µL of the derivatization reagent BSTFA was added to replace the acidic hydrogen with non-polar trimethylsilyl groups. Finally, after 1 h of incubation at 70 °C, the derivatized sample was analyzed using GC–MS. Separation was accomplished using an HP-5Ms capillary column (Agilent, 30.0 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm). The GC oven temperature was set to 60.0 °C for 1 min, and then increased to 300 °C at 15 °C·min The concentration of the ClO In response to a large excess of ClO or with A number of studies indicated that pH values significantly influence the reaction of organic compounds and ClO As the solution pH increases, the oxidation reduction potential of ClO Solution temperature is an important parameter for the reaction between ClO The influences of different humic acid concentrations on the oxidation of MeP and PrP by ClO It has been reported that HCO According to previous reports,  The oxidation products of MeP and PrP during ClO Hydroxylation was found to be a significant reaction in the oxidation of parabens by ClO This study investigated the degradation kinetics of MeP and PrP by ClO Qianhui Mao: Conducting experiments, Data curation.
