Combines the geology features of Karst mine, the effect of Karst on stress wave propagation in rock, rock crushing and blasting crater formed were analyzed, Different forms of Hole-by-Hole detonation network was designed, Blasting network and blasting parameters were optimized, Hole-by-Hole detonation was tested in the field, Tests showed that hole-by-hole blasting technology is an advanced blasting technology to achieve detonating between two adjacent holes, In Karst mine hole-by-hole blasting technology enables make blasting vibration velocity decreased by 20%, Explosives consumption decreased by 11%, can effectively prevent misfire, greatly improving the level of safety in mines mining.
