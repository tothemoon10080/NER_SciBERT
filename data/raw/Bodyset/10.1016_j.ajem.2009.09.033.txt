Colles’ fracture is a distal radius injury, with dorsal tilt of the distal radial fracture fragment. Its typical treatment involves reduction and plaster cast immobilization to restore its anatomical position. Sometimes, reduction maneuver may be difficult with poor outcomes, requiring repeated reduction maneuvers or eventual surgical treatment. The author proposes a simple, easy, and reliable manual reduction technique.The Colles’ fracture The technique makes use of the thumb flap as well as the extended thumb of the operator's hand (left hand for the left wrist fracture and vice versa) to ensure accurate and not excessive flexion (no more than about 40°) along with ulnarization of the fractured distal radius, because a marked wrist flexion can cause median nerve compression The distal part of the radial metaphysis is one of the most commonly fractured bones, and it is strongly related to osteoporosis
