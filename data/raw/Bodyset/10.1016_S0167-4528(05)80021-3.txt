Recycling is an important factor in order to achieve a sustainable development our society.In Europe targets have been laid down by EU legislation for the recycling rate of end-of-lifevehicles to be achieved within the nearby future. These strict recycling targets are one of thedriving forces for more awareness on the importance of recycling in the product's life cycle aswell as for the optimisation of recycling systems. A solid technological framework is requiredto discuss and assess the performance of recycling systems, as well as to calculate recyclingrates in view of EU legislation.

                           ⊙ Literature survey has indicated that a fundamental technological framework is lacking.No theoretically founded and therefore consistent basis exists in order to describe recycling systems and its parameters and to determine the recycling rate of passengervehicles or any other product under consideration. The EU definition does not provideany insight into the various parameters playing a role in the achievement of the imposedrecycling targets, which is however essential to improve recycling systems and productdesign in order to fulfil these strict targets and therefore does not provide a solid basisto understand and assess recycling systems.
                        
                        
                           ⊙ The definition of the recycling rate of the car as used in the EU directive on end-of-life vehicles is critically reviewed. It is discussed that the recycling rate cannot berepresented by an average or single value as required by EU legislation and the ISOnorm, but is largely dependent on the dynamic and distributed nature and therefore thestandard deviations of the time-varying lifetime, weight and composition of the car. Adynamic systems model have been developed describing the behaviour of the resourcecycle and its dynamic and statistically distributed parameters over time and is used tomore precisely define the recycling rate and its parameters.
                        
                        
                           ⊙ The various simulations presented, using the dynamic system model, make clear thatthe weight and composition of the car at production and dismantling, as well as thematerials accumulating in the system, are determined by the different distributions andare highly dependent on changes in these. Hence the simulations show the effect of thedistributions for the lifetime, weight and composition on the definitions of the recyclingand recovery rate of the car as explored in this paper. Moreover, the simulations clearlyillustrate the difference in the recycling rates to be achieved, applying the differentdefinitions for the recycling and recovery rate as presented in this chapter. Althoughthis may be obvious, it emphasises the critical importance of an accurately definedrecycling rate and its time-dependent parameters used in EU legislation.
                        
                        
                           ⊙ Without the use of a dynamic knowledge based model, the complex recycling systemcannot be described properly and accurate enough to discuss the implications of EUrecycling policy and the achievement of EU recycling targets.
