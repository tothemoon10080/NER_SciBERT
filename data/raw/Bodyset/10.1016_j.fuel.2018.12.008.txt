Gas adsorption volume has long been recognized as an important parameter for coalbed methane (CBM) resource assessment as it determines the overall gas capacity of coal. As the industrial standard practice, Langmuir volume (VL
                     ) is used to describe the gas adsorption volume. Another important parameter, Langmuir pressure (PL
                     ), is typically overlooked because it does not directly relate to the resource estimation. However, PL
                      defines the slope of the adsorption isotherm and the ability of a well to attain the critical desorption pressure in a significant reservoir volume, which is critical to plan the initial water depletion rate for a CBM well. Qualitatively, both VL
                      and PL
                      are related to the fractal pore structure of coal, but the intrinsic relationships among fractal pore structure, VL
                     , and PL
                      are not well studied and quantified due to the complex pore structure of coal. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to measure the fractal dimensions of coal and their relationship to methane adsorption capacity. The thermodynamic model of the gas adsorption on heterogonous surfaces was revisited, and the theoretical models that correlate the fractal dimensions with the Langmuir constants were proposed. Applying the fractal theory, adsorption capacity (

                              L
                           
                        
                     ) is proportional to a power function of specific surface area and fractal dimension, and the slope of the regression line contains information on the molecular size of the adsorbed gas. We also found that 
                        
                           
                              P

                      is linearly correlated with sorption capacity, which is defined as a power function of total adsorption capacity (

                              L
                           
                        
                     ) and a heterogeneity factor (ν). This implies that PL
                      is not independent of VL, instead, a positive correlation between

                      and

                      has been noted elsewhere (e.g., Pashin [1]). In the Black Warrior Basin, Langmuir volume is positively related to coal rank (Pashin, 2010; Kim, 1977) [1,2], and Langmuir pressure is inversely related to coal rank. It was also found that

                      is negatively correlated with adsorption capacity and fractal dimension. A complex surface corresponds to a more energetic system, which results in an increase in the number of available adsorption sites and adsorption potential, which raises the value of

                      and reduces the value of

                     .Exploration of coalbed methane (CBM) in North America started with the early activities conducted by US Bureau of Mines experiments in Alabama and Pennsylvania. Then it came to prominence in the 1980s as the oil crisis shifted the interest to potential natural gas resources in coalbeds. The industry was officially born in 1980 in the Black Warrior Basin. As an unconventional gas resources, 90–98% of gas in coal is stored as adsorbed phase with the remaining as a free phase gas compressed within pore and cleat spaces Extensive research The sorption isotherm is commonly used to describe gas sorption capacity. Different adsorption models are developed to mathematically model the gas sorption isotherms of coals, including Langmuir, BET, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH), density functional theory (DFT) model, etc. In this work, low-pressure N Fresh coal blocks were collected from four different locations at three different coal mines in China as shown in According to the standard ISO 17246:2010 (Coal, Proximate analysis) Nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiment was conducted using the ASAP 2020 apparatus at Material Research Institute, Penn State University following the ISO 15901-3:2007 (Pore size distribution and porosity of solid materials by mercury porosimetry and gas adsorption, Part 3: Analysis of micropores by gas adsorption) Volumetric sorption experimental setup was employed to measure the sorption isotherms. Many previous studies have used volumetric methods to measure sorption isotherms The four coal samples are loaded into the sample cells, and placed under vacuum before gas is introduced to the sample cell. The volumetric method involves three steps of measurement, including the determination of cell volumes, sample volumes, and the amount of adsorbed gas In the above equation, gas compressibility factor ( Here, After determination of void volume, adsorptive gases like methane, nitrogen or carbon dioxide were injected, and the amount adsorbed at a given pressure was determined using the basic calculations described above. The experimental procedures were repeated as the previous two steps. Injection pressure was recorded as The original amount of gas in the system prior to opening the connection valve is a summation of the injection amount of gas from the pump section into the cell section and the amount of free gas presenting in the cell section prior the injection given as: The amount of free gas in the system at equilibrium pressure is determined by The cumulative amount of adsorption ( For the 1st injection, no gas is adsorbed on the coal sample and A Type I isotherm describes the sorption behavior of microporous solids where monolayer adsorption forms on the external surface of the adsorbent Langmuir constants ( Crickmore and Wojciechowski For a rough surface, the number of collisions would be expected because of multi-reflection as illustrated in At equilibrium, surface coverage ( Compared with Langmuir’s equation, the expression of Langmuir’s coefficient ( The value of Two interpretations of If a two-dimensional potential box is used to describe an adsorption site, then the adsorption rate constant ( Desorption rate constant ( The ratio of Both As explained in Crosdale et al. However, an accurate evaluation of the activation energy of adsorption is related to an energy distribution function ( Then the Langmuir constant ( The Langmuir’s volume  To separate the effect of temperature from pore structure on Langmuir pressure ( The term In this study, Eqs. (25)–(27) were applied to quantitatively investigate the relationship of Langmuir’s constants and pore characteristics. The value of The fractal dimension ( Eq. The mean maximum vitrinite reflectance for samples tested are 4.02% (#1) 0.89% (#2), 0.83% (#3) and 3.11% (#4), indicating they are anthracite (#1, #4) and high volatile A bituminous coals (#2, #3). Coal rank has an important effect on the pore structures. The previous study showed that there is a “hook” shape relationship between coal rank and porosity, and adsorption capacity is correlated positively with the coal rank The morphological parameters of pores, including mean pore diameter, specific surface area, and fractal dimensions, were obtained from the low pressure The log-log plots of The methane adsorption measurements were conducted to further investigate the effect of the fractal characteristics of coal surfaces on methane adsorption. Based on the fractal analysis, Langmuir’s parameters are important in CBM exploration, where On the other hand, the heterogeneity factor (ν) developed as the spreading coefficient of the distribution of the adsorption-desorption rate in the determination of   As derived in With sorption capacity replaced by pore structural parameters (Eq. In this paper, we investigate the CH The thermodynamic model of the gas adsorption on heterogonous surfaces was revisited, and theoretical models that correlate the fractal dimensions with the Langmuir variables were proposed. From fractal theory, adsorption capacity ( We also found that Based on this work, Langmuir variables are estimated by only pore structure information, which is very easy to obtain. However, the limitation of the current model is that it only considers physical structural heterogeneity and neglects the effect of surface geochemical properties and functional groups on adsorption energy. For a set of coal with distinct rank and composition, the current estimation of adsorption energy may not be accurate enough, and as a result, the linear trend in the plot of
