The microwave heating characteristics of the mixture with oxidized pellet and coal was studied, and the non-isothermal reduction dynamics is discussed. The results show that, the slow-heating stage of the temperature rising process can be segmented into two heating temperature curves approximately that have good linear relationship. They can be seen as temperature programming. In the first stage, between 827 and 1073 K, the reaction mechanism obeys diffusion controlled model. In the second stage, between 1093 and 1323 K, the reaction mechanism also obeys diffusion controlled model. The apparent activation energies are found to be 75.13 kJ/mol for the first stage and 53.17 kJ/mol for the second stage. That is lower than the apparent activation energy under conventional heating. The microstructure of the reduced pellets shows that microwave can improve the kinetics of the reduction. Microwave has anxo-action to the reaction obviously.
