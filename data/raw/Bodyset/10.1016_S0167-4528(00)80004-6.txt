This work's main objective is to present the techniques used for optimization of the process of industrial staining of raw agate geodes extracted from small operations in the Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil. This optimization is accomplished through the comparative control of hot and cold staining techniques, the analysis of the colors obtained in the staining process, and the recognition of the structures that compose the bands of the agate and their capacity to absorb the coloring solutions. The duration needed for the impregnation of the agate with the coloring agent used in the chemical treatment is directly related to the type of chemical solution and its temperature. The Spectrocolorimeter's results, according to the CIELab system, and the emphasis on the tonality and chromaticity of the samples are employed to analyze the colors obtained in the staining process. The analysis of the agate by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) points out the different types of microstructures that form the banding of this material, as well as the relationship of this banding with other minerals, mainly quartz in crystal and milky forms. This recognition of the banding characteristics is important, since it determines the capacity of the agate to absorb the coloring agent during the staining process.
