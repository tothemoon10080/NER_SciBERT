Guanidines and biguanides are strong bases which are convenient to use as catalysts due to their solubility in organic media; as their basicities are in the range of the common inorganic bases such as alkaline hydroxides and carbonates, they are suitable for a wide range of base- directed reactions such as Michael addition, esterification and transesterification. New syntheses of poly-N-alkylated biguanides have been devised from carbodiimides and recent examples of catalyses with soluble and immobilised guanidines and biguanides are given with emphasis on the transesterification of triglycerides from vegetable oils.Organic strong bases that are soluble in most common solvents are often selected preferentially to metallic oxides, hydroxides and carbonates; the most common ones are bicylic amidines such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene In order to increase the efficiency of the catalysts, stronger bases are required such as the highly A short review on the uses of soluble, polymeric and immobilised guanidines and biguanides is given and recent results on the preparation and properties of biguanides are presented. Henry and Michael–Henry addition of nitroalkanes to aldehydes, alicyclic ketones and α,β-unsaturated ketones were performed at r.t. with TMG Under similar conditions, the same authors performed the addition of diethylphosphite to aldehydes and ketones (a Pudovik-like reaction) and to Michael acceptors such as imines, acrylonitrile and α,β-unsaturated ketones Asymmetric esterification of benzoic acid with racemic (1-bromoethyl)benzene was performed with chiral cyclic guanidines as stoechiometric bases Similar chiral catalysts The amino acids were obtained with ee below 28% according to the reaction: Soluble polymeric guanidines or biguanides are obtained either by polycondensation reactions with simultaneous formation of the base function or by introducing the base to an already made polymer. For the purposes of physicochemical studies, a polyelectrolyte was prepared from polyallylamine by a guanylation reaction with A series of polymeric biguanides containing hexamethylene groups has been also prepared by polycondensation of hexamethylenediamine with dicyanamide ( It should be noted that this interesting polycondensation procedure could be used with These compounds are similar to “chlorhexidine” (polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride) a marketed antimicrobial drug for the skin. When carbodiimides are subjected to anionic polymerisation, the oligomers are formed with repeating type There is no example, until now, of uses of these polymers as a potent chiral catalysts. When used as soluble catalysts, guanidines must be eliminated from the reaction mixture as the same time of the reactants and side-products, thus, tethering the base molecule to an insoluble and porous carrier is a generally accepted approach. It is also expected that the catalyst can be reused several time; in fact, recycling experiments were hardly performed. The first example of grafting a guanidine to silica was described as soon as 1986 The catalyst was checked in the transesterification of methyl acetate to ethyl acetate Another approach was followed with micelle-templated silica of MCM-41 type; these mesoporous carriers were first grafted with the chlorosilane The catalytic properties were checked in the transesterification of ethyl propionate with Michael addition of ethyl cyanoacetate, diethylmalonate and 1,3-diones to acrolein, methylvinylketone and other enones proved the catalytic activity The aforementioned tricyclohexyl guanidine was alternatively constructed inside the pores of a zeolite: dicyclohexycarbodiimide was first impregnated in the porous material and reacted with cyclohexylamine; this gave a trapped base; a seive effect keeps the molecules inside the material. Both compounds were checked in the aldolisation of acetone with benzaldehyde; the reaction gives mainly the crotonisation product It should be stressed now that, from the historical point of view, such organic bases were first immobilised on organic polymers, not on silica: the well known bicyclic amidine DBU Several reaction were examined: the dehydrobromination of bromoalkanes, the esterification of benzoic acid with 1 -bromobutane and the macrolactonisation of ω-bromocarboxylic acids In the area hydrometallurgy, Cu Unfortunately, all these supported base catalysts were considered on the only aspect of the ease of separation from reaction mixture and not at all on the possible repeated uses of these expensive materials. So, more recently, guanidines were successfully introduced on polystyrene matrices by different approaches: These catalysts were found efficient in the transesterification of triglycerides of rapeseed and soyabean oils with methanol, as shown below For the transesterification of vegetable oils, even stronger bases were required such as biguanides So as to get the stronger possible basicity, these biguanides were prepared with the higher possible degree of For the purpose of recycling, some of these strong bases where immobilized on gel-type and macroporous polystyrene; by the way, the influence of the morphology on the reactivity was checked. A six carbon chain-spacer was also introduced between the main chain and the biguanide group. The synthesis of the polystyrene-supported biguanides was performed in the same way as for the soluble ones; the starting polymers were gel-type polystyrenes with chloromethyl or 6-bromohexyl groups according to Merrifield or Tundo respectively 1.1-From carbodiimides: the animated polymers (from haloalkylpolystyrenes and potassium phtalimide) were converted into urea with isocyanate and dehydrated to carbodiimides 1.2-From cyanoguanidines: animated polystyrenes were reacted to cyanoguanidines (from secondary amines and dicyanamides) to give type 1.3-From diazetidinium salts: The same animated polystyrenes as above were reacted with and excess of diazetidinium triflate (from methyltrifiate and diisopropylcarbodiimide) to get type Halogenoalkyl polystyrenes, gel-type, macroporous chloromethylpolystyrenes and Tundo-type, were used as These grafted strong bases were checked in their both soluble and immobilised form as catalysts for the transesterification of several vegetable oils such as linseed, rapeseed, sunflower and palm oil. When methanol is used, the reaction affords a mixture of the methyl esters, used as fuel for diesel engines The transesterification reactions were performed at 70°C with molar ratio of methanol/ester function/catalyst=2.3/1/0.02 and at atmospheric pressure; the rates were monitored by With the soluble catalysts, yields above 80% are obtained alter 10 min and 90% after 30 min reaction time; these biguanides are about thirty times more reactive than soluble guanidines The polystryrene-bounded biguanides were checked exactly in the same conditions and exhibited excellent catalytic properties ( These biguanide-supported catalysts are, by far, more reactive and more stable than the previously described guanidines Even more interestingly, the recycling of the same sample of polymer-bounded catalysts As far as we know, this is the first report on a polymer-supported catalyst which recycling has been performed so successfully; these properties are very promising for a lot of other base-catalysed reactions; some are under investigation.
