Aluminium tris(4-morpholinyl-8-hydroxyquinoline) has been synthesized and characterized. The photoluminescence measurements showed that the new derivative is blue shifted and has relative photoluminescence quantum yield two times higher compared to the pristine Al tris(8-hydroxyquinoline). Deferential scanning colorimetric studies revealed that the newly synthesized Alq3 derivative in this work is amorphous material with the highest transition glass temperature value among the reported amorphous Alq3 derivatives.Aluminium tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) is a widely used material in photovoltaic applications due to its excellent electronic and thermal properties. In organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), it has been used successfully as electron transporting layer and/or emitting layer Curioni and Andreoni In our previous efforts we have designed and prepared Alq On the other hand amorphous materials have received growing attention as materials for photovoltaic applications. Compared with crystalline materials, amorphous materials tend to form uniform, stable and transparent thin films during the OLED fabrication Solvent free amination is environmentally friendly synthesis which offers high yield in short reaction time Melting points and 4-Chloro-8-tosyloxyquinoline 4-Morpholinyl-8-hydroxyquinoline To detect the overall thermal properties of the new Alq 4-Morpholinyl-8-hydroxyquinoline Then ligand UVâ€“vis absorption spectrum of the new derivative The photophysical properties of the new Alq The DSC thermogram of the new Alq A new ligand, 4-morpholinyl-8-hydroxyquinoline, could be prepared in a high yield by the reaction of 4-chloro-8-tosyloxyquinoline and morpholine under solvent free condition. The attachment of the saturated cyclic morpholinyl group at C-4 in the newly synthesized Alq The author thanks Ms. Venla Manninen in Tampere University of Technology for the help with the PL measurements and the Department of Chemistry, University of Oulu for the NMR analysis.
