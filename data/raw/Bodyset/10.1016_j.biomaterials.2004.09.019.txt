In this study, new bredigite (Ca7MgSi4O16) ceramics were prepared by sintering sol–gel-derived bredigite powder compacts at 1350°C for 8h. The bending strength, fracture toughness and Young's modulus were about 156MPa, 1.57MPam1/2 and 43GPa, respectively. The in vitro bioactivity of the bredigite ceramics was evaluated by investigating the apatite-formation ability in simulated body fluid (SBF) and the effect of ionic products from bredigite dissolution on the mouse fibroblasts cell line L929. In addition, the in vitro biocompatibility of the bredigite ceramics was evaluated by osteoblasts adhesion and proliferation assay. The results showed that bredigite ceramics could induce HAp formation in SBF. The products from bredigite dissolution significantly promoted cell growth at a certain concentration range. Furthermore, osteoblasts adhered and spread well on bredigite ceramics, and osteoblasts proliferation on bredigite ceramics was obvious.Previous studies showed that bioglass, glass-ceramic and bioceramics containing CaO and SiO In this study, the bredigite ceramics were prepared by sintering bredigite powder compacts, and the mechanical properties, bioactivity and biocompatibility of bredigite ceramics were evaluated. Bredigite powders were prepared by sol–gel process using tetraethyl orthosilicate ((C The sintered ceramics were analyzed by XRD and SEM. Bending strength and Young's modulus were applied normally with a deflectometer (AG-5KNL, Shimadzu Co., Japan). The fracture toughness was evaluated by a material testing machine (Instron 5566, USA) through the single notched precrack bending (SNPB) method The ceramic discs polished by diamond paste were soaked in SBF (pH 7.25) at 37 The method was carried out with a dilution of bredigite extract in contact with L929 cells. The ratio of the bredigite weight and the medium volume was 200 The cell suspension was adjusted to a density of 1×10 Osteoblasts were isolated by sequential trypsin–collagenase digestion on calvaria of neonatal (<2 days old) Sprague–Dawley rats as described elsewhere Six experiments were performed. The results are shown as the arithmetic means±the standard deviation (±SD). Analysis of the results was carried out using Student's        Previous studies have shown that the bending strength, fracture toughness and Young's modulus of sintered HAp ceramics were 115–200 Bone-like apatite (Ap) plays an essential role in the formation, growth and maintenance of the tissue–biomaterial interface, and this Ap layer can be reproduced in vitro in SBF The ionic products from bredigite dissolution can stimulate cell growth at a certain concentration range. Previous studies showed that the Ca and Si ions from bioactive glass dissolution at a certain concentration range increased cells proliferation Furthermore, our results showed that osteoblasts adhered and spread well on the bredigite ceramics. In addition, the numbers of osteoblasts adhered on the ceramics proliferated with the increase of culture time, indicating good in vitro biocompatibility of bredigite ceramics. The new bredigite ceramics were prepared by sintering bredigite powder compacts. The bending strength and Young's modulus of bredigite ceramics were close to those of cortical bone, with an improved fracture toughness as compared to the sintered HAp. The bredigite ceramics could induce the formation of HAp layer on their surface by soaking them in SBF. Furthermore, the products from bredigite dissolution significantly promoted cells growth at a certain concentration range. Osteoblasts adhered and spread well on the surface of bredigite ceramics, and osteoblasts proliferation on bredigite ceramics was obvious with the increase of the culture time. Our results indicate that bredigite ceramics possess good in vitro bioactivity and biocompatibility, and may be used as bioactive bone repair materials. However, further in vivo studies need to be conducted to explore the applicability of these ceramics as implant materials.
