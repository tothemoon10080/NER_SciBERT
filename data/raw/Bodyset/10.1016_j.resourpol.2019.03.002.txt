Conventional underground mining methods rely on extracting a large amount of ore rock from its original place and moving it to surface. An innovative idea of in mine recovery (IMR) has been recently presented by Mining3 to minimise rock movements by recovering low grade ore deposit using in-situ leaching concept. In this paper, the added value of the hybridisation of IMR and a conventional mining method is evaluated through a strategic resource-constrained planning model. The proposed integer programming model simultaneously considers orebody characteristics, mining and leaching capacities, processing requirements and associated mining and processing costs. Results of solving the proposed model for a small-scale orebody, demonstrate that integrating IMR into a conventional mining operation can significantly improve the net present values of the project by recovering the low grade part of the orebody usually left as the waste rock in conventional mining methods.Underground mining methods have been used to extract deeper ore reserve for many years where surface mining techniques cannot be economically employed. The open pit mining method, as the most common surface mining method, is widely used to mine deposits located close to the surface in a cost-effective manner. However, as mineral grades decline and available deposits are deeper, the attention is going toward underground mining. In 2012, underground mining produced 26% of the world's copper output ( In all conventional underground mining methods, ore rock is removed from its original place and is transported to surface-located processing plant for further beneficiation. Operations of this nature require a large amount of operating cost to extract ore, loading and hauling to the surface. In addition, a high-capacity mineral processing plant should be established to enrich the run-of-mine ore. As mines go deeper and ore grades become lower, conventional mining methods become less profitable and in some cases uneconomic. Recently, Mining3 presented a novel idea of In Place Mining (IPM). The main idea of IPM is to minimise the rock movement by recovering the ore content in place ( Compared to the conventional methods, IMR has a lower operating and capital costs, as it requires less rock movements with less access developments. It should be noted that the metal recovery achievable by IMR is anticipated to be lower than the recovery by conventional methods. Depending on the copper mineral, particle size and the fluid lixiviant, the recovery can range from 11% to 95%, with typical values around 70% ( IMR is especially beneficial as a very low capital cost method if it is hybridised with a conventional mining method such that higher grade ore deposit is extracted by conventional mining method and the lower grade part is recovered by IMR. The advantages of such a hybrid method are the low capital cost of IMR, and recovering of those low grade parts of the mineral which cannot be economically extracted by conventional methods. In addition, when a mine is opened by conventional mining method, more details about the orebody characteristics are provided which decrease the risk of employing IMR. By creating opportunities for mining additional ore, the reserve is expanded and more of the resource can be extracted. IMR is a new concept and the planning and scheduling of this technique has not been studied yet. This study aims to propose a mathematical planning model for a hybrid conventional mining method and IMR. This strategic planning model can provide a robust evaluation of how integrating IMR can improve the net present value of the project and highlight topics for further consideration. As will be discussed later, a decision about employing IMR is not a simple function of a cost-revenue calculation. A generic mathematical model is required to simultaneously consider ore characteristics, mineral processing plant requirements and in-mine grade distribution in order to achieve the optimum decision. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published paper about the IMR planning and scheduling. Indeed, the contribution of this work is to present a novel planning model for a hybrid conventional method and IMR to verify that by employing IMR in conventional mining, additional value can be obtained. In particular, our primary goal is to integrate IMR with underground open stoping methods. The open stoping method is normally employed to extract steeply dipping massive and tabular deposits (normally the dip of ore deposit should be greater than 50° ( Relevant mine planning and optimisation work in the area of conventional open stoping mining are reviewed in two sections: determining stope boundary and optimising stope sequencing. Underground stope boundary optimisation is an attempt to find the area of the orebody to be mined during the life of the mine, such that an objective function (e.g., profit or ore recovery maximisation) is optimised. In particular, finding the optimum number of stopes within a given orebody, optimum locations of these stopes and the size of the stopes are of interest in an underground stope boundary optimisation. Normally the objective functions are to maximise profit or to achieve the maximum ore extraction. Geotechnical stability is the main consideration that must be satisfied. Subsequently,  As an early work to obtain the optimal open stoping production sequencing, It is important to be able to simultaneously optimise underground mine layout and production scheduling so  In an open stope underground mining (e.g., sublevel stoping, longhole stoping and vertical crater retreat) many stopes are designed to be mined in the entire life of the mine. Usually backfilling (filling a void stope after the extraction of the stope) is required to maintain a stable space to extract the other stopes. In this study, the new idea of IMR is hybridised with a conventional open stoping method. In the IMR method the stopes are not mined in a conventional way. Instead, stopes can be fragmented and the ore content is recovered using in-place leaching. Due to buking of the volume during fragmentation, a proportion of the stope (i.e., 15%) must be extracted first, in a similar way as an under-cut is required in conventional underground mining. The created space provides enough space for the bulked material in the main stope after blasting. Thus, backfilling is not required for IMR recovered stopes. Stopes are designed according to the orebody shape and characteristics, geo-mechanical characteristics of host rock, footwall and hanging wall, and mining equipment (drilling, loading and hauling). For the purpose of production scheduling, it is assumed that the stopes layout and design are given. This end can be performed using one of the algorithms proposed in the literature and explained earlier in this paper. The production scheduling horizon is the entire life of the mine. This problem is solved to find out the best mining method for each stope (i.e. conventional or IMR) and simultaneously the best period of mining for each stope. IMR comes with a lower operating and capital cost. Therefore, low grade stopes are tended to be mined by IMR, while high grade stopes are more appealing for conventional mining as it has a higher recovery. However, grade distribution of stopes, the physical location of stopes and mineral processing plants requirements also influence the type of mining method to be used. This is known as the dynamic cut-off grade in which no predefined cut-off grade is specified ( For the sake of consistency, mining in a traditional way, including drilling, blasting, loading, and hauling, is named conventional mining (CM) and the plant used to process run-of-mine ore is called processing plant. IMR refers to leaching in-place and as the case study of this work is a copper mine, the plant used to process run-of-mine pregnant solution from IMR is called SX-EW (Solvent Extraction-Electrowinning) plant. An integer programming model is developed to obtain the optimum mining plan including the best mining method and the extraction time for each stope. The following variables are decided for a designed mine with a set of       It should be noted that this model is applied to a mine which has been currently studied to be an economically feasible operation by a conventional method. Thus, IMR can become active if it can increase the mining NPV. Otherwise, The objective function of this model is to maximise net present value over the life of the mine, as stated in Equation           The first term of Equation The above objective function is maximised subject to several constraints explained below. The first constraint is the reserve constraint which enforces that each stope can be recovered at most once (Equation Reserve Ct Processing capacity constraint (Equation Processing capacity Ct: IMR SX-EW Ct:       Backfilling capacity constraints (Equation Backfilling capacity Ct:    Precedence constraint (Equation Precedence Ct: Several constraints are defined to control the logical relations between variables. Constraint (7) creates a relation between the extraction of a stope by IMR and the existence of SX-EX plant. According to constraint (8), if IMR starts at time t, then IMR should continue until the end of the scheduling horizon. Constraint (9) ensures that if a stope is mined from a given level, the opening cost of this level is taken into account. Constraints (10) and (11) point out that Relational Ct:   The proposed model was implemented on a small-scale case study. A mining block model has been generated based on a hydrothermal multi-element copper deposit. The block model consists of 15945 blocks with the size of 5*5*5. A simple floating stope optimisation algorithm ( As listed in The 3D plots of the block model and mineable stope model are shown in The developed mathematical model was solved for the case study. We assumed that the processing plant for conventional mining has been designed for the capacity range of 450–550 kt/period. In addition, there is a possibility to invest in a 900–1100 copper ton/period SX-EW plant for the processing of the pregnant solution pumped out from IMR. However, the SX-EW plant is subjected to the profitability of the IMR. The planning is accomplished for six time periods with the annual discount rate of 5%. Additionally, it is assumed that there is no ramp-up period for the processing plant. The developed model has been coded in ILOG CPLEX 12.8 on a PC Intel Core i7, 2.81 GHz, with 12 GB of RAM, running Windows 10, and solved for two scenarios. In the first scenario, IMR is allowed and in the second scenario, there is no IMR option. Results are summarised in As shown in The average grade of stopes, mined by CM or IMR are shown in  A 3D view of the sequence of the stope extraction is given in As discussed in the introduction section, ore grade is declining and at the same time extraction cost enhances due to increasing of orebodies depth. Therefore, IMR is an innovative and interesting approach which can be employed to recover low grade ore. However, some important considerations should be taken into account. Firstly, the orebody characteristics should allow for an efficient leaching to have a successful IMR operation. Although, lixiviants is able to flow between particles created by prior fragmentation of the ore rock, the style of mineralisation, i.e., exposure of ore grains, can dramatically affect the recovery and consequently the profitability of the IMR. Secondly, there is a cut-off recovery where integrating IMR does not yield profit for the recovery below this cut-off. The value of the project is very sensitive to the assumed metal recovery. For example, in the above case study, a recovery of 25% (instead of 30%) advises to not implement the IMR. With the same capacity and cost configuration, a recovery of 35% can increase the NPV of the project by about 70% compared to the recovery of 30%. Leaching recovery is largely depended on ore permeability, porosity, fragmentation distribution, size of the stope and mineralisation style. Experimental tests must be performed in advance to have a good estimation of the recovery value. A strong point of the developed formulation is that a recovery can be assumed for each individual stope. In addition, an advantage of hybrid CM/IMR is that by accessing the orebody it is possible to gain improved information though local sampling and in-situ tests. Moreover, the time taken to start recovering pregnant solution must be predicted to be seen in the planning model. Thirdly, the IMR capital and operating cost should be estimated precisely. The IMR capital cost including a SX-EW plant, development to access those stopes/levels where CM is not economic, and IMR operating cost should be considered simultaneously with orebody tonnage, grades and recovery, as we proposed in the mathematical model. For example, an IMR capital cost of $15 million in above case study recommends not to use IMR, while with this amount of capital cost and a recovery of 36% (6% more than the above case study), IMR can be economically employed. Finally, due to the higher recovery of the conventional processing plant (about 90% for copper) conventional mining becomes more appealing when commodity price is going up. Alternatively, the higher the grade of the orebody, the more conventional mining is favoured. Another advantage of a hybrid approach CM/IMR is the flexibility of this method to choose either CM or IMR by taking into account price, cost and ore characteristics. A real options analysis can be a good research direction to bring the price and ore variability into the above optimisation framework. In Mine Recovery (IMR) is an innovative idea for cheaper mining operations targeted low grade and deep orebodies. In IMR, underground stopes are prepared to be a leaching reactor by in-place fragmentation. Therefore, recovery is accomplished by in situ leaching and rock movement is minimised. A mathematical programming model was developed in this study to optimise the planning of the hybrid conventional mining and IMR. Implementation of the model on a small-scale case study demonstrates that the NPV of the project can significantly increase if a well-achieved IMR is employed. The proposed model comprehensively considers ore specification, stope design and cost elements. This study introduces several future research directions in different disciplines including studies on recovery of IMR; IMR stope design considerations; fragmentation analysis and detailed cost estimation of IMR.
