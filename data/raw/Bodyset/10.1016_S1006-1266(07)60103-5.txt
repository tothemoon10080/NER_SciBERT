The cyclonic static micro-bubble column flotation (FCSMC) is an effective separation device for fine particle treatment. The high mineralization rate and short flotation time of this equipment can be attributed to its unique cyclonic force field. It also has been observed that the presence of a cyclonic force field leads to a lower bottom separation size limit and a reduction of unselective entrainment. The collection zone of the column is considered to consist of two parts, a column separation zone and a cyclonic zone. Total recovery of the collection zone was developed. For our study, we analyzed the particle movement in the cyclonic zone. Particle residence time equations for the cyclonic zone were derived by force analysis. Results obtained in this study provide a theoretical foundation for the design and scale-up of the FCSMC.
