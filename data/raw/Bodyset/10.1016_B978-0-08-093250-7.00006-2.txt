In this chapter, a general assessment of nanofiltration modeling is presented. Transport phenomena across the membrane as well as partitioning mechanisms between the membrane and the external phases are described in detail. First, the more interesting methods, which had been applied to approach the solution of the membrane characterization problem, are reviewed. Second, the Donnan steric pore and dielectric exclusion model is introduced. It is the evolution of various versions developed in different steps by some authors and it can be recognized as the simpler and complete model developed at present to simulate the behavior of nanofiltration membranes. The extended Nernst–Planck equation, appropriately modified on account of hindered diffusion and convection inside narrow pores, is used to describe mass transfer across the membrane. Steric hindrance, solution nonideality, Donnan equilibrium, as well as dielectric exclusion are considered as the main partitioning mechanisms existing at the interfaces between the membrane and the external phases. The strengths and critical features of the model are discussed in detail; a general assessment of the membrane characterization procedures is also reported.feed/membrane interface, feed side feed/membrane interface, membrane side parameter defined in Equation parameter defined in Equation mole concentration (mol equivalent concentration (mol effective diffusive coefficient, defined in Equation hindered diffusivity inside the pore (m bulk diffusivity at infinite dilution (m elementary charge (=1.602×10 Faraday constant (=96 485) (C = electric current density (A mole solute flux (mol total volume flux (m Boltzmann constant (=1.381 parameter defined in Equation convective hindrance factor diffusive hindrance factor effective convective coefficient, defined in Equation effective convective coefficient, defined in Equation hydraulic membrane permeability (m permeability parameter defined in Equation number of ionic species Avogadro number (= 6.023 pressure (Pa) hindered Peclét number defined in Equation parameter defined in Equation parameter defined in Stokes radius (m) cavity radius defined in Equation average pore radius (average slit semi-thickness) (m) real rejection defined in Equation partial molar volume (m axial coordinate in the membrane (m) volume charge density (mol ionic valence parameter defined in activity coefficient effective membrane thickness, accounting for tortuosity and porosity (m) membrane/permeate interface, membrane side membrane/permeate interface, permeate side difference pressure difference across the membrane (Pa) effective pressure difference (Pa) excess energy due to dielectric exclusion excess energy due to Born partitioning defined in Equation excess energy due to image forces, defined in Equations Donnan potential vacuum permittivity (=8.854 dielectric constant membrane dielectric constant dielectric constant of the pore solution dielectric constant of the bulk solution water dynamic viscosity inside the pore (Pa·s water dynamic viscosity in the external bulk (Pa·s Debye length (m) = electrochemical potential (J osmotic pressure (Pa) steric partitioning coefficient, defined in dimensionless electrostatic potential electrostatic potential (V) at the feed/membrane interface cation anion asymptotic conditions ion or uncharged solute at the membrane/permeate interface The recent extensive developments of nanofiltration (NF) technology have shown evidence for the real application potentialities of this innovative pressure-driven membrane process used for the separation and the purification of liquid mixtures. The development of mathematical models describing transport mechanisms through the membrane is essential to predict and to optimize membrane performances, in the case of both simple systems and multicomponent systems containing electrolyte mixtures and neutral solutes. Polymeric or ceramic NF membranes typically show separation characteristics, which are intermediate between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis (RO). The most interesting feature of the process is the possibility to separate electrolyte solutions based on ion valence and to obtain a relatively complete retention of neutral substances such as complex sugars. In the case of neutral solutes, partitioning between feed and membrane is mainly related to size-exclusion effects, and molecular weight cutoff is generally sufficient to describe the separation efficiency of the membrane. In the case of electrolyte solutions, rejection properties of the membrane are remarkably affected by type and valence of the ionic species as well as by the type of membrane material and strongly depend on operative conditions such as pH and ionic strength values existing in the feed side With single symmetric salts, such as NaCl or KCl, salt rejection generally decreases as the concentration increases at constant pH values, whereas rejection goes through a minimum value as feed pH increases In the case of nonsymmetric electrolytes, on the contrary, physical–chemical interactions of the salt with the membrane can be relevant; trends are often reversed with respect to the NaCl-type behavior Conversely, electrochemical characterizations of the membrane material (e.g., electrokinetic measurements of streaming potential The question about the mathematical modeling of electrolytes and neutral solute transport through charged membranes is well known for about 40 years Atomic force microscope measurements indicate that, for most of NF membranes, pores do exist Original descriptions of ion transport in NF were based on phenomenological approaches derived from irreversible processes of thermodynamics Transport of uncharged solutes has been first described by continuum hydrodynamic models Nowadays, it is recognized that the separation mechanism of the process is remarkably related to the steric and electrostatic partitioning effects between the membrane and the external solutions. Most of the recently developed models accept a porous vision of the membrane and propose to describe mass transfer through the extended Nernst–Planck (ENP) equation. Some of them are the application of the space charge model (SCM), originally proposed by Gross and Osterle Because of its numerical complexity, SCM is used in simplified forms, which are versions of the fixed-charge model proposed by Teorell At present, the most widely used models derive from the SCM with the approximation that ion concentration and electric potential are radially homogeneous across the pore and that the fixed charge is uniformly distributed in the membrane volume In addition, NP equation is appropriately modified by some authors for taking into account of the hindered transport through narrow pores comparable with the molecular dimensions of the permeating species. All those models, however, assume Donnan equilibrium as the only electrostatic phenomenon involved in the ion partitioning at the interfaces between the membrane and the liquid phases. It was only after the 2000s that some authors began to extensively introduce the dielectric exclusion (DE) phenomenon as an additional electrostatic partitioning effect, which could explain the high rejection values measured for multivalent counterions, for which the only Donnan equilibrium would have erroneously predicted a more favorable partitioning inside the membranes. The mechanism of DE of ions from membranes was originally considered by Glueckauf Finally, all the models make use of several parameters to characterize the membrane: there are structural parameters, such as average pore radius, membrane thickness, tortuosity, and porosity; electrical parameters, such as the surface or volume membrane charge; and electrochemical parameters, such as the dielectric constants of the membrane and of the solutions inside/outside the pores. In addition, depending on the authors, all the parameters are considered as adjustable parameters or, alternatively, some of them can be obtained by independent measurements, such as tangential streaming potential, filtration potential, membrane potential, atomic force microscopy, and titration experiments. From a general viewpoint, the description of transport phenomena occurring in NF membranes is a problem characterized by manifold aspects, which are discussed in detail in the following sections. Although many papers are published on this topic every year, the problem to be solved is the development of a model which can be a reasonable compromise between very complex models (able to describe the variation of membrane properties as well as the mass transfer through the membrane, as a function of the position inside the membrane itself) and extremely simplified models (the phenomenological models), requiring few parameters to be calculated as a function of operative variables and of the solute type whenever any condition changes. In the following, the statement of the general physical problem is first defined and the more advanced models are considered that describe solute partitioning at the interfaces between the membrane and the external phases; solute transport across the membrane; and water or total flux across the membrane. A detailed discussion of the model potentialities in simulating NF membrane performances is provided, and a critical analysis of the numerical complexity of the mathematical problems encountered in the treatment of multicomponent systems as well as membrane parameters is presented. In this chapter, the phenomena involved in membrane characterization are presented, assuming the solute concentrations, existing at the feed/membrane interface, as known values. For the evaluation of mass transfer resistance in the external phases of the membrane, the typical techniques can be used such as the film theory model or any other specific application of it to NF modules with multicomponent solutions An NF membrane separates two aqueous liquid phases (the feed and the permeate) kept at different pressure values (Δ In order to characterize the membrane performances (solute rejection and total transmembrane flux), the solute flux as well as the water flux through the membrane must be calculated. With reference to a generic section of the membrane ( total transmembrane flux; solute transport across the membrane; and solute partitioning at the interfaces between the membrane and the external phases. The problem solution requires the knowledge of some parameters: structural parameters of the membrane (pore geometry, pore radii distribution, porosity, thickness, and tortuosity); electric parameters of the membrane (surface/volume membrane charge distribution); and electrochemical parameters (dielectric constants of the membrane material and of the solutions outside and inside the membrane pore). In the following sections, a synthesis of the work mentioned above is reported and the general features are discussed. The general model is termed as DSP&DE model, for historical reasons. Basically, it can be applied to polymeric as well as to ceramic membranes, although most of the results concern polymeric materials. Reference is made to the coordinate system shown in Experimental data obtained in NF of pure water, as well as of aqueous solutions containing electrolytes and/or neutral solutes The basic equation for the description of mass transfer of a generic specie across the membrane is the ENP equation. Under the approximation of no direct coupling between species fluxes (since dilute aqueous solutions are generally processed), the flux of each species, Equation Partitioning of the Steric exclusion and activity coefficients are the only partitioning effects existing in the case of neutral solutes. Steric exclusion accounts for the sieve effect, due to the intrinsic porosity of the membrane; it depends on the pore geometry and it is in the range between 0 (for solutes larger than the pore radius) and 1 (for point solutes) Activity coefficients of the ionic species can be expressed according to the Debye–Hückel theory or its developments, depending on the concentration range of the solutions processed. A collection of some relationships proposed by various authors to calculate ion activity coefficients is reported in Donnan equilibrium plays a relevant role in the case of charged membranes and it is effective in the partitioning of ions owing to the Donnan potential arising both at the feed/membrane and at the membrane/permeate interfaces; it always offers favorable partitioning for counterions and unfavorable partitioning for coions. DE arises as a consequence of the difference existing between the dielectric properties of the aqueous solution inside and outside the membrane pores and the dielectric properties of the membrane material. The main macroscopic effect is the presence of polarization charges induced by the ions of the aqueous solution on the boundary surface between the two dielectric media (the pore surface). In the DSP&DE model, as a simplification, all the partitioning effects related to the DE are collected in the partitioning coefficients at the feed/membrane as well as at the membrane/permeate interfaces. As shown in Equations The mechanism of DE of ions from membranes was originally considered by Glueckauf The primary effect is caused by the difference existing between the dielectric constant of an aqueous solution and the corresponding value of the polymeric matrix. Electrostatic interactions arise between the ions of the solutions and the polarization charges, induced by the ions themselves on the discontinuity surface located in the boundary between the two dielectric media. Since the dielectric constant of an aqueous solution is remarkably higher than the corresponding value of the polymeric matrix (ɛ The phenomenon has been widely studied and described with suitable approximations for NF membranes by Yaroshchuk For both geometries, the effect of the image forces is assumed to be located at the pore mouth: all the partitioning effects related to the DE are collected in the distribution coefficients at the feed/membrane as well as at the membrane/permeate interface, assuming the separation effect of the polarization charges along the membrane pores as negligible. The secondary effect is due to the variations of the solvent dielectric properties inside the membrane pores with respect to the external bulk values, which are caused by an alteration of the solvent structure when it is confined in small narrow pores Basic equations of the DSP&DE model are summarized in The ENP equation (Equation In view of the porous nature of the membrane, the Hagen–Poiseuille flow type (Equations Under the hypothesis of constant volumetric charge density across the membrane, the derivative of Equation It can be observed that The general DSP&DE model is a set of first-order differential equations which can be solved to calculate total volume flux as well as the flux and the concentration profile of each species across the membrane, once the membrane parameters and the pore geometry are known. The electric potential profile through the membrane is also calculated straightforwardly, besides the Donnan potentials at the membrane/external solutions interfaces. The great interest in this model is related to its easy extension to dilute multicomponent solutions. By supposing as known data, the operative variables related to the feed conditions (concentration All the model parameters can be assumed as constant values (some of them are strictly connected with water properties), with the exception of the volume membrane charge In general, although some parameters might be estimated as reasonable values, such as ɛ In the case of uncharged solutes, Equation Apparently, the solute rejection depends on the pore geometry and on In the case of a single strong electrolyte, Equation The validity of Equations Integration of Equation The DSP&DE model, as presented in The strong point is related to its applicability to dilute multicomponent solutions, making use of the same model parameters used for/calculated from single-salt solutions ( The weak points are mainly related to the presence of numerical problems of convergence as the number of ionic species increases; complex and tedious statistical analyses for the calculation of some model parameters, which require extensive experimentation; and a high level of uncertainty in the estimation of those model parameters which are interdependent of each other. The latter points are remarkably critical. The partitioning contributions appearing in Equations In the past 10 years, the DSP&DE model has been used with different levels of approximation, which have represented the various steps of development of the general model. First, Bowen and coworkers Second, Hagmeyer and Gimbel Finally, using the steric, electric, and dielectric exclusion (SEDE) model, Szymczyk and Fievet All those models differ in the description of the partitioning mechanisms, whereas the mass transfer through the membrane is described by the extended Nernst–Planck equation in all cases. All the models were good in the prediction of membrane performances, in their field of validity, with the model parameters adjusted through a fitting procedure performed with the same equations of the corresponding models. Some noteworthy results are reported in  The same idea, about the extension of single-salt data to multicomponent mixtures, is at the basis of the results reported in The relevance of DE partitioning has also been shown as evidence by Szymczyk and Fievet It is therefore evident that it is difficult to indicate which model correctly describes ion partitioning in the membrane: in our opinion, a reasonable test can be represented by the ability of the model (1) to predict separation performances in operative conditions different from those for which the adjustable parameters were calculated and (2) to predict a behavior of adjustable parameters with operative conditions which is very close to that obtained for the same parameters by experimental techniques different from NF experiments. Basically, all the versions of the DSP&DE model fulfill the requirement of the above-mentioned point (1), as suggested by the results reported in From a general viewpoint, the question is not related to the quality of the DSP&DE model, rather to the knowledge level about the correct mechanism of membrane charge formation. DSP&DE model is essentially a partitioning and transport model in which the membrane charge is a parameter. As a partitioning-transport model it is quite satisfactory; however, it requires a good relationship which expresses how the membrane charge depends on the operative variables. Some authors Apparently, the problem is still open: there is no univocal answer. The studies reported in References Finally, the DSP&DE model has been used as a predictive tool That behavior strongly depends on the membrane charge value. An interesting investigation about the analysis of the role of each transport mechanism across the membrane was performed by Bowen and Mohammad In order to simplify the solution procedures of the general DSP&DE model (the set of first-order differential equations – Three types of simplifications were introduced, aimed to obtain analytical relationships for rejection of single salts, or, alternatively, to switch the mathematical problem to the solution of a set of algebraic equations. A first simplified version was introduced in Reference 14. Under the hypothesis of complete co-ion exclusion, in the case of a single symmetric salt, Equations Advantages in the ion rejection calculation could be achieved also in the case in which linear behaviors for the concentration profiles as well as/or for the electric potential profile might be assumed, as it can be observed in Equation Bandini and Vezzani The integral version represented by Equation Bowen Contemporary to the development of the various DSP&DE model versions, many procedures have been proposed for the calculation of the membrane parameters. The best procedure would be the independent determination of each parameter, basing on different sets of experimental data. Unfortunately, as discussed in the previous sections, this is not fuit> Key points of the parameter-calculation procedure are the following: Calculate hydraulic membrane permeability (    Calculation must be performed by using rejection data as a function of total volume flux. The use of relationships derived from the application of the Hagen–Poiseuille flow hypothesis must be careful, since it could lead to an underestimation of the membrane thickness by 5–10 times Furthermore, in the case in which a wrong δ value is used to simulate the membrane rejection in association with a wrong membrane charge, a wrong prediction might be performed also of asymptotic conditions, as it clearly occurred in References In conclusion, we can observe that we are facing the same indetermination problem previously discussed: since the same value of asymptotic rejection can be simulated by accounting for different contributions of image forces and Born partitioning, that is by different values of the couples ( Finally, the results reported in  In References Bowen and Welfoot In NF membranes, in view of the narrow pores, the surface charge is the most important membrane characteristic in the determination of salt rejection. Several experiments of different nature, as well as many models, demonstrate the presence of a charge located at the membrane/liquid interface, which is strictly dependent on salt type, salt concentration, and on pH. Conversely, all the authors basically agree with the interpretation of the phenomena determining the membrane charge: mechanisms, such as acid/base dissociation and ionic adsorption, can be recognized as the main mechanisms determining the membrane-charge formation. Empirical models, such as Freundlich or Langmuir isotherms, have been proposed to relate the membrane charge with the equivalent concentration However, the question is not yet well defined about how the data obtained for single salts might be used for the extension of the models to multicomponent mixtures. By now, the mixing rules which have shown better results are those proposed by Bowen and Mukhtar The study of transport phenomena in NF or loose RO membranes covers the period of the past 40 years. Although many models have been developed so far, in the past decade, scientific production has been devoted to the improvement of the partitioning-transport model, originally introduced by Bowen The general model, termed DSP&DE model, has been assessed in this chapter and a detailed discussion has been carried out about advantages and disadvantages of this tool. The most interesting strong points are related to the wide generality of the model and to the easy extension to multicomponent mixtures. Some questions are still open, such as the independent calculation of electric and dielectric parameters (membrane charge and dielectric constant inside the pore), as well as the correct determination of the mechanisms involved in the membrane-charge formation in the case of multicomponent ion mixtures.
