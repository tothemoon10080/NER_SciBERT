There is a great variety of classification systems with considerable controversies.
               In this chapter an overview is provided on different classification systems, all of which are based on radiographs. Thirteen different (sub)classification systems are found in literature based on (1) fracture location, (2) fracture plane orientation, and (3) fracture stability/displacement.
               Looking at citations numbers, the Herbert classification was most popular, followed by the Russe and Mayo classifications. Based on the controversy and limited reliability of current classification systems, suggested research areas for an updated classification include three-dimensional fracture pattern etiology and fracture fragment mobility assessed by dynamic imaging.
