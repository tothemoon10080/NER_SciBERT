In presence of difficult conditions in coal mining roadways, an adequate stabilization of the excavation boundary is required to ensure a safe progress of the construction. The stabilization of the roadways can be improved by fully grouted rock bolt, offering properties optimal to the purpose and versatility in use. Investigations of load transfer between the bolt and grout indicate that the bolt profile shape and spacing play an important role in improving the shear strength between the bolt and the surrounding strata. This study proposes a new analytical solution for calculation displacement and shear stress in a fully encapsulated rock bolt in jointed rocks. The main characteristics of the analytical solution consider the bolt profile and jump plane under pull test conditions. The performance of the proposed analytical solution, for three types of different bolt profile configurations, is validated by ANSYS software. The results show there is a good agreement between analytical and numerical methods. Studies indicate that the rate of displacement and shear stress from the bolt to the rock exponentially decayed. This exponential reduction in displacement and shear stress are dependent on the bolt characteristics such as: rib height, rib spacing, rib width and grout thickness, material and joint properties.
