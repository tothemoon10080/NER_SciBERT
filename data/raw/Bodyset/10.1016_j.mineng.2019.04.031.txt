During the Bayer process for alumina production, the molecular formula of the bauxite residue is approximately equivalent to Na2O·Al2O3·1.7SiO2·nH2O. This means that 1 kg of SiO2 in bauxite will produce 1 kg of Al2O3 and 0.608 kg of Na2O in bauxite residue. Thus, the extraction efficiency of alumina is low when processing low-grade bauxite. In addition, it is difficult to utilize bauxite tailings with solid alkali in the structure. In this study, low-grade bauxite was treated using a calcification–carbonization process. A new type of residue (C-C residue) with a different structure from that of traditional bauxite residue was obtained. A cement clinker was prepared with C-C residue as the main ingredient at a dosage of 50%. The experimental results show the alumina extraction efficiency reached 75.82% when processing low-grade bauxite of A/S 3.06 using the calcification–carbonization process. This is higher than the 61.44% of the Bayer process. The main phases of C-C residue [CaCO3, amorphous Ca(4−2x)SixO4, and undecomposed Ca3Al2(SiO4)(OH)4] convert into Ca2SiO4, Ca3SiO5, and Ca2FexAl(2−x)O5 after calcination. The calcification–carbonization process combined with cement production helped low-grade bauxite achieve highly efficient and clean alumina production, which is conducive to the sustainable development of alumina industry.With the rapid development of the aluminum industry, the world’s metallurgical alumina output reached 118 million metric tons in 2017 ( According to the literature ( ( ( The alumina digestion rate of the Bayer process depends on the A/S value of the original bauxite and bauxite residue ( To ensure the sustainable development of the alumina industry, in addition to the exploration and rational exploitation of bauxite resources, additional new methods of low-grade bauxite treatment should be studied and developed to improve the alumina yield ( In this research of the processing of low-grade bauxite, diasporic bauxite from a Henan alumina plant (China) was used as received. The mineralogical phases, determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, are shown in Based on the transformation theory of the calcification–carbonization process ( The ratio of ore and mother liquid was calculated using Eq.        0.608—molar mass ratio of Na After calcification, a solid product was obtained through filtration, the calcified product, which was used for the subsequent carbonization transformation. During the carbonization process, distilled water was added according to the liquid–solid ratio (5:1). The autoclave was sealed, and CO To better our understanding of the C-C residue characteristics and the phase transformation during the calcination process, a low-temperature roasting test was conducted before preparing the cement clinker. During the experiment, the C-C residue was dried in an electro-thermostatic blast oven (DHG-914385-III, CIMO, China) at 100 °C for 1 d then placed in an alumina crucible and roasted in a chamber electric furnace (SX2-5-12, Great Wall, China). The calcination temperatures were 300, 500, 700, 900, and 1200 °C. The heating rate was 10 °C/min and the holding time was 30 min. After roasting, the calcined material was cooled in the air and then analyzed. The clinker was prepared using C-C residue and pure material reagents according to The XRD patterns of the raw bauxite and transformation products were acquired using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with a Cu Kα radiation source. The pattern data were collected in a 2θ range from 10° to 90°. The resultant patterns were analyzed using the X’ Pert Highscore Plus software and compared to the patterns in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards’ International Centre for Diffraction Data (JCPDS-ICDD) database to identify the crystalline phases. The Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Mg, and Ti contents in the bauxite were quantitatively measured using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry using a ZSXPrimus II XRF spectrometer (Rigaku, Japan). Then, the measured metals were converted into corresponding oxides. The elemental S content was measured using a SC-144DR infrared absorption carbon-sulfur analyzer (LECO, USA). The loss on ignition (LOI) was determined by repeatedly heating at 1000 °C in a muffle furnace until constant weights were achieved. An ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM; SU-8010, Hitachi, Japan) combined with an energy dispersive spectrum was used to analyze the micromorphology and elemental distribution of the calcined clinker. Comparison of the results presented in The chemical compositions of the transformation slags listed in Combined with analysis of the XRD patterns and chemical compositions of the transformation products, the C-C residue obtained using the calcification–carbonization method is composed of calcium carbonate, unreacted hydrogarnet and the amorphous calcium silicate. The Na The C-C residue is produced by a hydrometallurgical process, while the burning of cement clinker is a pyrogenic process. The analysis of the phase transformation of C-C residue during low-temperature roasting is actually a study of the transition from a wet process to a pyrogenic process. According to the literature ( The calcining temperature is an important factor that determines clinker mineral formation (    The calcification–carbonization process has great advantages in addressing low-grade bauxite, increasing the recovery efficiency of alumina by 14% compared to that of the Bayer process. Moreover, the Na The mineral transformation in treating low-grade bauxite using the calcification–carbonization process, and the preparation of cement clinker using the obtained C-C residue, was studied.
