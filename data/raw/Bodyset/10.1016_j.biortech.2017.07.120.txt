In this study, the mass transfer, rheological behavior and fractal dimension of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) granules in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors at various temperatures (8.5–34.5°C) and upflow velocities (0.06, 0.18mh−1) were investigated. The results demonstrated that a lower temperature increased the external mass transfer coefficient and apparent viscosity and impaired the performance of anammox granules. The external mass transfer coefficient was decreased, but efficient nitrogen removal of up to 96% was achieved under high upflow velocity, which also decreased the apparent viscosity. Furthermore, a fractal dimension of up to 2.93 achieved at low temperature was higher than the previously reported values for mesophilic anammox granules. A higher upflow velocity was associated with the lower fractal dimension. Because of the disturbance in granule flaking, the effectiveness factor was less suitable than the external mass transfer coefficient for characterization of mass transfer resistance.Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a novel biological wastewater treatment process in which the oxidation of ammonium to dinitrogen uses nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions ( The advantages of microbial granules applied in biological wastewater treatment have been widely recognized ( Mass transfer resistance depends on factors including the bulk substrate concentration, the degree of turbulence in the fluid (liquid UFV), granule morphology (the spatial association of microbes in the granules), granule size, and the Rheology can describe the formation of objects under the influence of stress and quantify flow behaviors in the wastewater treatment process ( However, so far little information is available in the literature focusing on the mass transfer characteristics, rheological behavior and fractal dimension of anammox granules under the stress of various temperature and high UFV. Therefore, this study aimed to (a) investigate the effects of ambient temperature and UFV on the performance of anammox granules, (b) use the effectiveness factor and external mass transfer coefficient to describe the characteristics of mass transfer, and (c) evaluate the influences of UFV and temperature on the anammox granules rheological and fractal properties to improve understanding of the features of anammox granules and to provide useful information to guide the operation of anammox bioreactors. The experimental work was conducted in three identical lab-scale UASB reactors (working volume of 1.65 Three UASB reactors were inoculated with 1.1 In this study, the UASB reactors were fed with synthetic wastewater containing 210 The temperature in R The granular sludge required for the batch test was taken from the UASB reactors at pseudo-steady-state conditions. To achieve granule disintegration with no cell destruction, three beakers were placed in a vortex mixer for 7 The SAA of the granules was determined by measuring the substrate consumed by the anammox sludge in closed serum vials according to the methodology described by The fractal dimension of the granules does not need to be an integer because it is a measure of the ability to occupy space, which was estimated on the basis of the method described by To investigate the effects of temperature and UFV on the rheological behavior of anammox granules, the apparent viscosity was measured. The sludge samples randomly collected from the reactors were concentrated by centrifugation at 3000 The influence of mass transfer on the overall operation process was presented as the effectiveness factor, According to Moreover, substrate transportation from the bulk solution to the surface of the granules (external mass transfer) is affected by a concentration gradient across the diffusive boundary layer (DBL). The mass flux across the DBL is proportional to the constant being the external mass transfer coefficient for the substrate ( The The calculation of  The operation of R The stoichiometric ratios of the nitrite consumption to ammonium removal ( As shown in The order of SAA of granules in the reactors was as follows: R The total EPS content of the anammox sludge sampled from R The total mass transfer resistance of the granules is indicated by the ratio of the SAA of disintegrated versus intact granules ( The values for R The disintegrated granules were more susceptible than the intact granules to the external disturbance, such as low temperature and high UFV. In addition, the low temperature or high UFV may cause the granules to disintegrate in the operation process, thereby resulting in a portion of exhausted SAA of small granules ( The effectiveness factor was unsuitable for characterization of mass transfer resistance because of the disturbance of granule flaking. From the perspective of  According to the values of Rheology can be used to characterize the non-Newtonian properties of the sludge suspension and provide a scientific basis for the assessment of fluid behaviors in the actual process. As shown in The linear slope between the settling velocity and the size of the seeding sludge was 0.14, which was greater than that predicted by Stokes’ law for a rigid pellet without voids of 0.04. Anammox granules are permeable and porous ( Nevertheless, although each reactor in this study presented external mass transfer resistance, the NRE of 96 For the anammox bioreactor at ambient temperature, instability of its performance was its primary drawback despite the large The authors wish to thank the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
