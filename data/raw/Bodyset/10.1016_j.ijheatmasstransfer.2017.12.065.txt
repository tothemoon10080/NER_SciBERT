In geotechnical engineering applications, the modeling of artificial ground freezing is primarily aimed at predicting the extent of frozen zone around the cooling sources. This modeling could be more or less complex not only according to the material’s texture and the hydro-geological context but also to the salt concentration of the saturating fluid.
                  Through a thermodynamically consistent framework, a fully coupled heat and mass transfer formulation considering the salinity effect was derived. This formulation was intended to capture the most relevant phenomena of ground freezing encountered in geotechnical applications. Particular attention was given to the phase change problem where appropriate simplifying assumptions were made in order to make the proposed methodology easier to apply in field applications. The proposed approach was validated by means of freezing-thawing laboratory tests, carried out on specimens initially fully saturated with sodium chloride solutions at various concentrations. Good agreement was obtained between the measured and predicted results.partial specific volume of water in the phase partial specific free energy of water in the phase partial specific enthalpy of water in the phase partial specific entropy of water in the phase dynamic viscosity of the phase mass rate of ice formation (kg m thermal conductivity of the phase chemical potential of water in the phase specific volume of the phase volumetric heat capacity (J m apparent density of the phase density of the phase diffusivity tensor associated to the diffusion of salt in the phase permeability tensor associated to the filtration of the phase thermal conductivity tensor (W m velocity of the phase conductive heat flux vector (W m diffusion velocity of salt (m s filtration velocity of the phase salt concentration in the phase heat capacity at constant pressure of the phase salt concentration at saturation (kg kg diffusivity coefficient of the salt in the phase specific free energy of the phase specific enthalpy of the phase latent heat of phase change on the coexistence curve (J kg porosity (–) volume fraction of the phase pressure of the phase coexistence pressure at the thermodynamic equilibrium between capillary pressure (Pa) specific entropy of the phase liquid saturation degree (–) temperature (K) coexistence temperature at the thermodynamic equilibrium between ice liquid solid skeleton salt water difference between water partial specific quantities ( The artificial ground freezing technique is used for waterproofing and strengthening soils and soft rocks by decreasing their permeability and increasing their mechanical properties The effect of the salt concentration on the properties of the bulk liquid is not limited to the freezing point depression phenomenon. It also impacts all the thermodynamic properties of both the aqueous solution (density, heat capacity In chemical engineering, a tremendous effort has been made to provide accurate and complete models for aqueous solutions; see for instance the work of Archer and Carter The main objective of this paper is to present a modeling approach that deals adequately with the salinity effect and includes the major relevant issues within a thermodynamically consistent framework. The thermodynamics of phase change is directly derived from the liquid and ice Gibbs energies, and the simplifications required to produce the final model and what they involve are rigorously justified. The paper is divided into two parts: the modeling formalism (Section  The theory of porous media is an efficient tool for investigating ground freezing processes. With the assumption of local thermal equilibrium (single temperature With these considerations in mind, the macroscopic balance and constitutive equations are derived in Sections The macroscopic balance equations developed hereafter have been obtained by applying the volume averaging method to the pore scale balance equations, as can be found in The movement of each phase Similarly, to describe the movement of each component Because the solid skeleton phase Furthermore, since the liquid phase With those notations and definitions in mind, if no chemical reaction takes place, the mass balance of the phases Concerning the mass balance equation of the salt s, it can be written in terms of The right hand side of this equation has the following physical interpretation: for a system with a homogeneous concentration ( Only the mechanical equilibrium at the interface It is noteworthy that experimental determination of By assuming the thermal equilibrium between phases ( The unknowns of the problem are scalar or vector functions of space and time The mass density and the heat capacity of the solid phase In order to build thermodynamically compatible relations, the best way of proceeding is to consider, for a given phase, its thermodynamic potential from which can be derived, by appropriate partial derivatives, all of the remaining state functions. With a thermodynamic state characterized by the independent variables The operator which associates As the interactions between the two phases involve, on the one hand, the difference In order to express the secondary unknowns { In the first expression, Concerning the term The liquid and ice phases can coexist regardless of their pressures First, in the absence of capillarity ( The reference state being arbitrary, it can be chosen as an equilibrium state of the system, such as Since the integration limits are independent of In the presence of capillarity ( Moreover, knowing that The equations formulated above are all what is required to the resolution of the fully coupled thermo-hydraulic problem. Unfortunately, the mathematical expressions of the thermodynamic potentials Consequently, to ensure consistency between the thermodynamic potentials of the two phases, and therefore remove the indeterminacy caused by the arbitrary constants, it is sufficient that It is worth pointing out that, although the law for liquid water is calibrated only for temperatures above the melting curve, it is a common practice in thermodynamics to extrapolate such a law to temperatures below this curve Let us start the simplification process. In order to take full advantage of these simplifications, let us now assume that the specific volumes On the other hand, the variation of Following the same approach adopted to simplify As shown in If we assume that the specific volumes are also independent of the temperature, thus To derive the simplified Eqs. In order to validate the model under freeze-thaw conditions, an experimental program was carried out and the testing procedure was investigated numerically. A brief summary of the laboratory experiments is given in the next section, before presenting the numerical simulations and the comparison between experimental results and model predictions in Sections A series of laboratory tests were conducted on porous limestone cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 100 mm. For each specimen, the test consists of applying a freeze-thaw cycle in an environmental chamber and measuring the temperature at two points of the specimen: inside (point Two thermal loading paths were considered. In the first, the specimen was subjected to multi-stage temperature variations, whereas in the second one the temperature was applied by imposing fixed rates during the freezing and the thawing periods. A typical example of such loadings is illustrated in As will be shown in the illustrations of the next section, the measured temperatures at the surface and inside the specimen are rather different, especially during the period where the phase change occurs. The temperature distribution inside the specimen cannot therefore be considered homogeneous. Hence, to better interpret the experimental results, the tested specimen was analyzed as a structure subjected to boundary conditions. Assuming the isotropy of the thermal conductivity tensor ( To complete the mathematical formulation of the problem, the system The quantities needed in Eqs. The material constants All numerical simulations were carried out using the software COMSOL and its nonlinear coefficient form PDE interface. Since the simulated specimen and loads were symmetric with respect to the specimen axis, only a quarter of the specimen was simulated using a uniform mesh with approximately 1000 eight-node quadrilateral elements. To demonstrate the model capability to reproduce the major characteristics of the macroscopic behavior of the tested specimens, the results of four of the performed tests are presented in this section. They correspond to four distinct salt concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.17 and 0.25) and concern the temperature as a function of time of the two points   In this work, we formulated a thermodynamically consistent framework for the ground freezing process, taking into account the salinity of the saturating fluid. This was accomplished through a macroscopic approach where the phase-change fronts are not modeled explicitly, but represented in terms of the liquid saturation degree which is assumed to be given by the same empirical function as in the case where the salinity of the saturating fluid is neglected. On the other hand, based on the thermodynamic equilibrium between liquid and ice phases, two relationships as explicit functions of both temperature and salt concentration were derived; namely the capillary pressure and the latent heat of phase change. The former relationship was involved in the empirical function expressing the liquid saturation degree, whereas the latter was directly used in the heat balance equation. The developed approach was then applied to the modeling of laboratory freezing-thawing tests and the model capabilities were evaluated through a comparison with the experimental results. Although the ability of the model to capture the main relevant phenomena associated to the salinity effect is rather satisfactory, several further investigations are required to complete the proposed modeling approach and to increase the reliability in its predictive capacity. Two of the most important ones concern: (1) the validity of the relationship between the liquid saturation degree, temperature and salt concentration for different types of porous media, especially those with fine-textured materials, and (2) the coupling with the mechanical problem in order to extend this modeling to the ground deformations. The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.
