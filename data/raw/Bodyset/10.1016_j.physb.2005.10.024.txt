We present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the field and temperature and time dependence of the magnetic response of a powder of nanoscale magnetite particles. The data are analyzed within the framework of the Preisach formalism, and numerical simulations of the field-cooled moment, the zero field-cooled moment, the thermoremanent moment and the isothermal remanent moment, based on two extreme physical scenarios, are compared.The representation of magnetic materials as superpositions of elementary bistable subsystems was first introduced into the literature by F. Preisach The measurements were performed on a powder of nanodimensional magnetite particles, with an average particle diameter of 5   One of the most challenging problems confronting any Preisach reconstruction of the spectrum of intrinsic metastable state characteristic fields Once While the preceding analysis of the magnetite system is certainly convincing, it is possible to construct an alternative solution, which is equally compelling in terms of its ability to replicate the measured response, but which is based on an entirely different physical scenario. The choice of the barrier growth scenario over the thermal fluctuation scenario thus rests entirely on the validity of the viscosity analysis and, in particular, on reconciling the highly nonlinear variation of the thermal fluctuation field
