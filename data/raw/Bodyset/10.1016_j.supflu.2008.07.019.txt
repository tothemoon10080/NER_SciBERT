The solubility behaviour of a polyoxyalkylene block co-polymer surfactant, known as poloxamer F-127, in liquid ethanol/CO2 solvent mixtures at P
                     =10MPa and T
                     =298K, has been determined. Such a polymer presents a solubility in ethanol/CO2 mixtures that is one or two orders of magnitude larger than in both pure liquids. This synergistic behaviour of ethanol and liquid CO2 to solubilize the poloxamer F-127 has permitted the obtaining of solid particles of the poloxamer suspended in ethanol by depressurising its solutions in liquid ethanol/CO2 mixtures, since the polymer is almost insoluble in the resulting ethanol. This precipitation procedure yields microparticulate solids of the poloxamer with mean particle sizes between 1 and 20μm. The effects of various operational parameters, like the initial polymer concentration and the CO2 content in the solution, on the resulting mean particle sizes and particle size distribution has been also studied.Poloxamers are water soluble triblock copolymers with a general composition abbreviated as [(EO) Solid poloxamers, either pure or as a component of a given formulation, require its processing in the form of particles at some stage in their production and/or in the final fabrication of solid formulations. In general, poloxamers are characterized by a low melting point (20–60 During the past two decades, different high-pressure precipitation methods using compressed CO Ethanol (purity >99, 9%) was purchased from Romil Chemicals (Cambridge, UK) and used without further purification. Poloxamer F-127 was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (Barcelona, Spain), as poloxamer Pluronic Solubility of poloxamer F127 in pure ethanol at 298 Precipitation experiments were comprised of three steps, similarly to the methodological steps of the DELOS process  The solubility of poloxamer F-127 in pure liquid CO The solubility behaviour of the poloxamer was studied by means of a high-pressure phase analyzer using the methodology described in the previous section. As can be ascertained form Precipitation experiments of the poloxamer F-127 were performed in such a way from ethanol/CO In experiments E2, E4, and E5, the effect of the amount of CO The experiment E4 was performed again but recovering the resulting particles by an on-line filtration process step. For this experiment (E4F), a concentric filter F2 was placed after the depressurization valve, V4. Poloxamer F-127 shows a synergistic solubility behaviour in liquid ethanol/CO This work was supported by the “Plan Nacional de Investigación Científica y Desarrollo e Innovación Tecnológica”, Iniciativa Ingenio 2010, Programa
