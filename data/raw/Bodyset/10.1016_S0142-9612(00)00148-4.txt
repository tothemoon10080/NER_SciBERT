Various research groups around the world are actively investigating cardiovascular prostheses of biological origin. This review article discusses the need for such bioprosthetics and the potential role for natural tissues in cardiovascular applications such as cardiac valves and vascular grafts. Upon implantation, unmodified natural materials are subject to chemical and enzymatic degradation, seriously decreasing the life of the prosthesis. Therefore, methods such as glutaraldehyde and polyepoxide crosslinking treatments and dye-mediated photooxidation have been developed to stabilize the tissue while attempting to maintain its natural mechanical properties. Also, residual cellular components in a bioprosthetic material have been associated with undesired effects, such as calcification and immunological recognition, and thus have been the motivation for various decellularization processes. The effects of these stabilization and decellularization treatments on mechanical, biological and chemical properties of treated tissues have been investigated, specifically with regard to calcification, immunogenicity, and cytotoxicity concerns. Despite significant advances in the area of cardiovascular prostheses, there has yet to be developed a completely biocompatible, long-lasting implant. However, with the recent advent of tissue engineering, the possibility of applying selective cell seeding to naturally derived bioprosthetics moves us closer to a living tissue replacement.For more than 40 years, materials to replace malfunctioning or diseased cardiovascular tissues have been under investigation. Artificial prostheses were introduced into cardiovascular surgery in 1952 when Hufnagel implanted the first artificial heart valve, and in the same year, Voorhees introduced the first artificial vascular graft. Subsequent reconstructive procedures have been developed with the intent of increasing implant biocompatibility, including the transfer of healthy tissue from one site or individual to another and the use of living tissue prosthetics fabricated through tissue engineering. However, despite significant advances in implant technology, clinical experience has revealed the developmental challenges of prosthetics in the cardiovascular system. As reviewed below, the current therapies for cardiovascular diseases are not perfect, and the development of improved prosthetics and living cell-based devices is actively underway. Over 175, 000 prosthetic cardiac valves are implanted annually In addition to the large number of cardiac valves required every year, over 600,000 vascular grafts are implanted annually to replace damaged blood vessels The use of xenograft and allograft tissue as part of bioprosthetic vascular devices such as heart valves and vascular grafts has long been the focus of research The most commonly accepted crosslinking reagent is glutaraldehyde, a five-carbon bifunctional aldehyde, whose use has dominated since its introduction into biomedicine in the late 1960s Glutaraldehyde's success as a fixative and sterilant is in part due to its mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic character, which allows the molecule to rapidly penetrate both aqueous media and cell membranes Glutaraldehyde-treated tissue exhibits altered mechanical properties compared to untreated tissue To modulate the mechanical properties of glutaraldehyde-treated porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardium, several studies have investigated the utility of stress and pressure during the fixation process Other approaches have been used in an attempt to improve the mechanical properties of glutaraldehyde-fixed tissues. For example, altering the solvent dielectric constant during fixation of pericardium and aortic tissue alters collagen conformation and subsequently affects the extent of crosslinking and the resulting mechanical properties of the tissue Host endothelial cells do not typically grow onto bioprosthetic tissues when implanted into patients, and the cytotoxic effects of glutaraldehyde treatment presumably contribute to this lack of endothelialization. Solutions of glutaraldehyde contain not only its linear monomer but also dihydrated forms of monomeric glutaraldehyde, monomeric and polymeric hemiacetals, and aldol condensation products such as polymeric aldehydes Many approaches are under investigation as a means to detoxify or neutralize the toxic effects of glutaraldehyde on processed tissues. Alternate storage solutions such as hydroxy-benzoate, rather than the typical glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde storage solutions, in addition to extensive bioprosthetic rinsing, have partially reduced the cytotoxic effects Calcification is the formation of calcium-containing mineral deposits, which results in cusp or vessel stiffness, loss of pliability, and blockage of the valve or vessel opening ( Many approaches are being investigated in an effort to minimize calcification of glutaraldehyde-treated tissues. It has been hypothesized that positive charge modification of tissues will prevent the infiltration of Ca More recently, investigators have demonstrated that ethanol pretreatment of aortic-wall tissue and bioprosthetic aortic-valve cusps prior to glutaraldehyde-crosslinking significantly, but not completely, inhibits calcification Although these various treatments seem to retard calcification of glutaraldehyde-treated tissues, some evidence suggests that in most cases the mineralization process is not completely inhibited Glutaraldehyde-treated human umbilical vein grafts have been used with some success for lower limb revascularization The use of natural tissue, derived either from a human donor or from an animal source, requires that the tissue be treated to minimize immunogenicity of the graft and to stabilize the tissue against rapid enzymatic and chemical degradation in the body. Glutaraldehyde crosslinking accomplishes these goals for the most part, but its use in preserving tissues has also been associated with several problems, including altered mechanical properties and early mechanical failure, calcification, cytotoxicity, and incomplete suppression of immunological recognition Many new approaches are being explored to reduce or eliminate the undesired side-effects of glutaraldehyde treatment of tissues, including methods to neutralize or extract glutaraldehyde products from the treated tissue, as already described, and the use of alternative, non-aldehyde crosslinking and preservation procedures. In addition, methods are being explored to produce completely acellular-tissue matrices by specifically removing cells and cell fragments, which are believed to promote calcification and to give rise to a residual immunological response. The subsequent stabilization of these acellular tissues with glutaraldehyde or other crosslinking techniques may prove essential for certain applications. However, because the fundamental mechanisms underlying cytotoxicity, calcification, and immunological recognition are not completely understood, the development of new approaches to create the ideal natural biomaterial is an even larger challenge. There is considerable interest in identifying and investigating alternative tissue treatments that preserve natural tissue but do not result in the deleterious side effects typically associated with glutaraldehyde treatment. Several of these alternative crosslinking and fixation approaches include the use of carbodiimides such as cyanimide Poly(glycidyl ether) (i.e., polyepoxy) compounds have been investigated extensively as crosslinking agents for porcine and pericardium cardiac valves Polyepoxy compounds differ from glutaraldehyde in their mechanism of crosslink formation: glutaraldehyde reacts only with the Polyepoxy treatment of cardiovascular tissue represents an effort to overcome some of the drawbacks that are typically encountered with glutaraldehyde, but it is not clear whether, or to what extent, these problems are addressed. For example, in terms of mechanical properties, polyepoxy-treated vessels and valves have typically been softer, more flexible, and have shown better retention of natural residual strains compared to glutaraldehyde-treated tissues Polyepoxide-treated vascular grafts have shown increased antithrombogenicity and improved patency compared to other vascular graft materials Introduced as an effective fixative alternative to glutaraldehyde, polyepoxy treatment of cardiovascular tissues seems to offer the advantages of reduced calcification, and improved resistance to thrombosis and aneurysm. However, the mechanical and cytotoxicity effects of this treatment have not been fully elucidated. Dye-mediated photooxidation is an alternative tissue preservation method that requires no harsh chemical fixatives such as glutaraldehyde More recent studies have shown that dye-mediated photooxidation can be used to stabilize intact collagen-based tissues such as bovine or sheep pericardium Photooxidized pericardium and vascular grafts have supported endothelial cell growth in vitro ( In addition to alternative treatments that preserve (i.e., crosslink) natural tissue, methods are being explored to produce completely acellular tissue matrices by specifically removing cellular components that are believed to promote calcification and to give rise to a residual immunological response. These decellularization techniques include chemical, enzymatic and mechanical means of removing cellular components, leaving a material composed essentially of extracellular matrix components. For the most part, these acellular tissues retain natural mechanical properties and promote remodeling of the prosthesis by neovascularization and recellularization by the host. Ultimately, the creation of actual living tissue replacements for cardiovascular applications would solve many of the existing problems associated with cardiac heart valve replacements and vascular prostheses. During typical processing and crosslinking treatment of tissue, cells are ruptured, but the cellular debris is largely retained. Various cell extraction methods (e.g., detergent treatments, enzymatic digestion, sonication) have been pursued as a means to create completely acellular tissues for use as biomaterial implants, since residual cellular components and lipids within processed tissue may promote undesired effects such as calcification Cell extraction procedures, such as detergent treatments, often remove proteoglycans, which also appear to play a significant role in calcification In addition to its role in calcification, the presence of cellular debris (e.g., lipids) and soluble proteins (e.g., proteoglycans) in treated biological tissue contributes to an immunological response by the host toward the implanted bioprosthesis. For instance, glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardial tissue elicits both a cytotoxic T cell and a humoral response when implanted in rats It is also important to keep in mind that even after the removal of cells and cell debris, the intact ECM of the acellular tissue itself may elicit an immune response The immune response for xenografts appears to be even more pronounced. For example, a series of studies have shown that decellularized arterial xenografts dilate, whereas decellularized arterial isografts and allografts do not The mechanical properties of uncrosslinked, cell-extracted tissues are remarkably similar to those of fresh tissue. Acellular pericardial matrix prepared using a four-step detergent extraction and enzymatic digestion process displayed similar mechanical properties to fresh tissue, except for slightly increased stress relaxation To address the particular concerns with small-diameter vascular prostheses, investigators have developed sequential detergent extraction techniques Along similar lines, LifeCell Corporation (The Woodlands, TX) is also working to develop an acellular vascular graft using detergent treatment combined with freeze drying ( Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a unique acellular matrix derived from porcine small intestine ( The primary advantage to SIS grafts is their ability to promote site-specific tissue remodeling and regeneration by the host. Upon implantation, rapid neovascularization and the infiltration and spatial organization of host cells are presumably promoted by the natural complexity of the ECM structure and composition SIS autografts, allografts and xenografts have high patency rates when implanted in canine aorta, carotid and femoral arteries, and superior vena cava locations As a biomaterial composed primarily of acellular collagen, SIS has been shown to promote host tissue remodeling in a variety of tissue applications, including vascular grafts, and therefore is a promising candidate for cardiovascular applications. However, as demonstrated by inconsistent patency results between microvessels and other larger diameter vessels, the thrombogenic response of SIS is not completely understood. The field of tissue engineering has evolved rapidly over the last decade, and many parallel research efforts are underway to create a vast array of living tissue replacements for therapeutic applications Although natural materials on their own possess properties that are desirable for biomedical applications, cell seeding of these materials and their use in tissue engineering applications will likely enhance long-term function. In other words, a material or bioprosthesis that is repopulated with the patient's cells, either naturally in vivo or by cell seeding in vitro, has the potential to develop into a living tissue that can adapt and respond to changes in the body. In particular, a vascular graft will almost certainly produce better results in the clinic if it is lined with an endothelium to prevent thrombosis and therefore increase graft patency Several recent studies have focused on cellularizing naturally derived biomaterials with endothelial cells and fibroblasts in an effort to create living vascular tissues In addition to these matrices’ ability to support cell growth, it may be important that natural biomaterials be remodeled by the body to incorporate the prosthesis as living tissue. Highly crosslinked matrices are more stable to degradation, and therefore are less likely to be remodeled as part of tissue morphogenesis. However, modification of the crosslinking process to produce a lower crosslinking rate can produce “growable” materials that are easily infiltrated with cells, degraded, and remodeled as part of the wound healing response Many attempts have been made to produce long-lasting, biocompatible cardiovascular implants. To overcome the mechanical and biological limitations of synthetic implants, various researchers have begun to focus on the development of a naturally derived biomaterial for the fabrication of heart valve replacements and vascular grafts. In order for materials to be transplanted to a patient from a donor, especially an animal donor, the tissue must be modified to increase resistance to degradation and to decrease immunogenicity, while maintaining natural mechanical properties. Some of these approaches for tissue modification are summarized in Glutaraldehyde is the first and most prevalent fixative of naturally derived biomaterials. This crosslinking reagent is effective for stabilizing tissue and has proven a comparable alternative to autologous saphenous vein in vascular grafting applications. However, this treatment causes altered mechanical properties, increased calcification, and cytotoxicity. As alternatives to glutaraldehyde treatment, other methods to chemically modify natural tissue include crosslinking with polyepoxy compounds and dye-mediated photooxidation. These methods show improved resistance to calcification while providing stabilization against in vivo degradation. While dye-mediated photooxidation has been shown to be noncytotoxic, nonimmunogenic and to retain natural mechanical properties, the cytotoxicity and mechanical properties have not been fully elucidated for polyepoxide compounds. Cells are ruptured during typical chemical and thermal processing of natural materials, but residues such as phospholipids and proteoglycans remain, presumably causing increased calcification and antigenicity. Therefore, various cell extraction techniques are used to create decellularized tissues, including chemical, enzymatic and mechanical methods of removing cellular components, and leave a material comprised primarily of extracellular matrix components. Surprisingly, these acellular tissues retain natural mechanical properties and, in some cases, promote remodeling of the prosthesis by neovascularization and recellularization by the host. Although the antigenic response to acellular xenograft tissue is pronounced in comparison to allogeneic material, considerable effort is currently focused on treating readily available animal-derived tissues. Ultimately, the creation of living tissue replacements for cardiovascular applications would solve many of the existing problems associated with cardiac heart valve replacements and vascular prostheses. Although the use of synthetic materials in tissue engineering applications is being actively pursued and shows great promise, naturally derived biomaterials may offer advantages in such applications. Naturally derived biomaterials are composed primarily of ECM components, which offer a biological foundation suitable for cell attachment and growth. Furthermore, these natural materials may provide improved mechanical and shape compatibility compared to synthetic scaffolds. Thus, natural biomaterials, when repopulated with autologous or genetically engineered cells, can serve as the ideal template for the design of living implants for specific applications such as long-lasting prostheses, growable grafts, or cell-based drug-delivery devices.
