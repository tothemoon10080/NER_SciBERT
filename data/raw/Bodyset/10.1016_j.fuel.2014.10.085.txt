A new mechanistic model for vertical spindle mills (VSM) has been developed by Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland. Unlike the previous work in the literature, which treats the VSM as a “black box”, the present work incorporates two sets of variables in the model: (1) the coal specific property, and (2) the machine specific variables. The VSM model is presented in two parts/papers. The first part presents the sub-models for comminution and classification in the VSM. The second part describes the integration of the sub-models to simulate industrial scale E-Mill, MPS and CKP mills. The sub-models include mill power prediction, size specific energy calculation, size dependent breakage function, product size distribution estimation, elutriation classification and gas cyclone classification. The coal breakage property was measured with a JKFBC grinding device and modelled using a size-dependent breakage function. The machine specific variables include mill geometry, air classifier geometry, coal feed rate, primary air flow rate, air temperature, air pressure, grinding table rotational speed, mill spider hydraulic load and mill power draw. These variables are incorporated in the comminution and classification functions based on physical principles.In order to react effectively with oxygen from the air in a gas stream in coal power stations, typically the coal particle size needs to be at least 70% finer than 75 A VSM typically incorporates a grinding unit and an air classifier in a confined mill shell, operated under elevated pressure and elevated temperature. Modelling a grinding facility is an effective approach for process optimisation. The literature shows that many attempts have been made in the past to model coal size reduction, such as Broadbent and Callcott Sato et al. Sligar In recent years an extensive site campaign in Australian and Chinese power stations was conducted by teams from the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) at the University of Queensland and the China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT), using a new sampling technique to collect both mill internal and external samples for case studies In the 1980s, the JKMRC developed the JKSimMet comminution simulation package for the minerals industry. This software platform enables models of processing equipment to be integrated with the material properties at various points in a circuit in order to simulate, predict and optimise the performance of different comminution and classification circuits. The JKSimMet package is widely used in the minerals industry The vertical spindle mill is named after its drive shaft orientation. A schematic of an E-mill VSM is shown in Both the ball-race and roller-race designs are arranged so that primary air enters the pulveriser through jets arranged circumferentially outside the grinding table, and where the ground coal is pushed radially outward into the primary air flow, which entrains the coal. Both pulverisers have two stages of classification in which oversize coal returns onto the grinding table and the final pulverised fuel will meet the required product size (70% The first stage of classification is a simple elutriator which effects a crude classification of large coal fragments which have a terminal velocity exceeding the upward air velocity at this point in the device. The second stage of classification is a true gas cyclone which operates with inlet vanes and relies on the swirl to further classify the coal. Thus in operation a VSM consists of three basic functions: comminution, elutriator classification and gas cyclone classification. The comminution modelling focused on the development of sub-models for the breakage in the VSM. The algorithm structure for modelling comminution is presented in modelling of mill power draw; modelling of mill specific energy; and modelling of particle breakage. The mill power draw, Torque is calculated as Experiments were conducted using a Fine-particle Breakage Characteriser (JKFBC) equipped with a precision torque meter on the mill drive shaft to record the torque during testing As the filling level increases, torque increases rapidly, and then reaches a level where the torque slowly increases as the filling further increases. This torque level is determined by the particle size, with coarser coal particles associated with higher torque. For coarse coal particles (>6.7 In the laboratory JKFBC milling tests, the force The survey data exhibit a scattered trend of mill power with The model described by Eq. A similar model form was employed for the MPS and CKP mills, with the three model parameters calibrated with plant survey data respectively. The E-mill and MPS mills were both modelled assuming that breakage varied with particle size, a trend observed in the survey data. Considering the specific energy Leading to A simple expression was proposed as follows The The coal breakage characteristics used in the VSM comminution modelling algorithm represent two main inputs: Measured in-situ coal strength parameters, that describe the grinding resistance to specific energy as would be measured in the JKMRC Drop Weight Test Appearance function for coal breakage, which has been shown to be applicable at both very low and high specific energies. The grinding table breakage process uses a model developed at the JKMRC, which describes the breakage index         Shi and Kojovic Note that the unit of averaged particle size The JKMRC has shown that the The commonly published classification models As shown in There are two partition functions: (1) the first describes the classification behaviour of the elutriator, (2) the second describes the classification behaviour of the gas cyclone. A bypass function was introduced in the second partition function because the survey data collected for the B&W E10 pulverisers indicated that a proportion of the coal feed into the gas cyclone was simply rejected and returned to the grinding table without classification Classification in the elutriator was modelled using a Rosin–Rammler efficiency curve based on the survey data for an E10 pulveriser at an Australian power station Eq. A simple study of the B&W 10E10 elutriator using Computational Fluid Dynamics ( The terminal velocity of coal particles using the average velocity across this annulus implies a particle size which is reasonably close to the fitted Eq. Data for the molecular viscosity of air ( Svarovsky Sproull’s gas cyclone model is based on parallels between cyclone collection and collection in an electrostatic precipitator. It calculates a partition function for the cyclone as: The size exponent n normally takes a value 2. The particle diameter The gas cyclone uses a vane inlet arrangement and the effective inlet diameter By combining Eqs. The bypass As Part 1 of Modelling of vertical spindle mills, this paper describes the assumptions and approach used in the development of the sub-models for comminution and classification. The sub-models include the mill power prediction, size specific energy calculation, size-dependent breakage function, product size distribution estimation, elutriation classification and gas cyclone classification. Compared with other published modelling attempts treating the VSM as a “black box”, the present work incorporates the coal specific breakage properties and machine specific variables in the sub-models. The coal breakage properties were measured with a JKFBC grinding device and modelled using a size-dependent breakage function incorporating a breakage degree index ( The vertical spindle mill modelling work was conducted as a part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate program (APP) funded by the Australian Government Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. The B&W E10 VSM survey data were collected by Dr Can Özer and the JKMRC team in the ACARP C15079 Project, and the survey data of MPS mill and CKP mill were collected by the APP Project collaborative research team from the China University of Mining and Technology led by Prof. Yaqun He.
