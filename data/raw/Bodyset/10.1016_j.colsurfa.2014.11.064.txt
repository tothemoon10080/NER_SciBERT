The structure and interaction parameters of micelles in solutions of anionic surfactant sodium oleate (SO) in deuterated water were studied by small-angle neutron scattering. The effect of addition of polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), on micelle solutions was investigated. The dependences of the micelle aggregation number, degree of ionization, axial ratio, average size, charge, inverse screening length, surface potential on the surfactant concentration with and without PEG in the solutions were obtained and analyzed. A change in the power-law type behaviour of the aggregation number on the SO concentration was observed at 2wt.% of PEG in the surfactant/polymer mixtures. The screening effect with respect to the micelle interaction took place on addition of a large amount of PEG (about 10wt.% in the mixture). The obtained results are particularly important for understanding the structure reorganization effect on addition of biocompatible PEG to water-based magnetic fluids stabilized by SO.Mixed polymer–surfactant systems are of current interest for both academic and industrial research. This is because the interactions of such molecules often produce cooperative effects on the physicochemical properties and alter rheological properties and stability of colloidal systems. Thus, it was shown Sodium oleate (SO), CH Here, we are concerned with the interaction of PEG with SO micelles in water under the conditions characteristic for the previously studied magnetic fluids Sodium oleate (c.p., Merck) was dissolved in SANS experiments were performed at the SANS-1 diffractometer at the steady-state reactor of the former GKSS Research Centre (at present, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht), Geesthacht, Germany. The differential cross-section per sample volume (hereafter referred to as scattered intensity) was obtained as a function of the scattering vector module, The obtained experimental SANS curves for the SO micelle solutions without and with addition of PEG are compared in Assuming that micelles are monodisperse spheres, the scattered intensity can be written in the standard form as: Here, The resulting model fits are shown as solid lines in For the neat SO solutions one can see that the micelle axial ratio grows with the surfactant concentration within the interval of 1.5–2.68 thus naturally showing a transition towards elongated (rod-like) particles. This is accompanied by an increase in the mean micelle size from In the case of the addition of the polymer to the micelle solutions one can see that the aggregation number of the micelles significantly decreases; at the same time, other micelle parameters are varied in different ways depending on the PEG concentration. The analysis of the changes in the micelle parameters as a function of the SO concentration without and with PEG is given in The decrease in the micelle aggregation number value as well as the change in the power law dependence of the aggregation number versus surfactant concentration are clearly seen in The most pronounced effect of the presence of PEG on the SO micelles is observed for the micelle aggregation number, which significantly decreases with the addition of PEG as compared to the neat SO solutions and does not change much with the growth of the PEG concentration ( The effective decrease in the micelle-micelle distance (as it follows from the shift of the interaction maximum towards larger The obtained results are consistent with the analysis of the interaction of PEG with SO-coated magnetite nanoparticles in water-based magnetic fluids To summarize, the SO micelle structure and interaction parameters were obtained as a function of the surfactant concentration in solution without and with addition of PEG by analyzing SANS curves. It was demonstrated that the neat SO aqueous solutions (D The work was carried out with partial support of the
