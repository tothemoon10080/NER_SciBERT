Based on chemical equilibrium calculation method in multi-phase, multi-component system, the effects of ilmenite component (TiO2, Fe2O3, FeO) and AIR (anthracite to ilmenite ratio) on element distribution of titanium slag smelted by DC arc furnace were studied. The calculated results agree well with the experimental results. With increasing amount of TiO2 and FeO in ilmenite, the amount of C as trace element and for TiO2 and FeO reduction increases, the total mass fraction of TiO2 and Ti2O3 in slag increases, while the mass fraction of FeO in slag decreases. However, the effect of Fe2O3 content in ilmenite on the slag composition is opposite. With increasing of TiO2 in ilmenite from 42% to 50%, the mass fraction of TiO2 in slag increases by 7.9%. However, with increasing of Fe2O3 in ilmenite from 12% to 20%, the mass fraction of FeO in slag increases by 8.94%. Moreover, with increasing of AIR from 120 to 134 kg·t−1, the mass fraction of TiO2 in slag increases from 83.8 % to 91.77%, FeO mass fraction decreases from 14.7% to 6.25%. The order of effect of other components on the total TiO2 in slag is displayed as: SiO2>MgO>Al2O3>CaO. Ilmenite component and AIR can be controlled to achieve selective reduction of oxides in the melt. Study on allocation behavior of elements during titanium slag smelting reduction process can help to control the process, improve the slag grade.
