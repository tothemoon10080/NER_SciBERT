In this paper, a novel crushing pretreatment: the inhibitory effect for micro-fine particles of China copper ore was investigated based on high voltage pulse. The ore structural weakening performance, inhibitory effect, size-reduction energy intervals, energy efficiency were determined. The results show that the main size-reduction energy interval is affected by voltage, and the interval is 3–4kWh/t at 150kV. The pretreatment effect of HVP was improved with an increase in energy consumption, and the maximum grinding index was 1.28at 90kV and 4kWh/t. The content of −74

                      product is 72.91% for pretreated ore compared with 57.16% for untreated ores. The inhibitory effect can be reflected on the contents of micro-fine particles. The ratio of −45

                      product decreases from 71.29% to 53.52% for untreated and treated ores and the inhibitory index is 0.24. The inhibitory effect for micro-fine particles can be effectively achieved by electrical pretreatment.With the development of science and technology, there are worldwide demands for more and more minerals and mineral consumption is gradually increasing. This leads to the problem of decreasing grade of raw ore. To dissociate useful minerals from low-grade ores, minerals need to be finely ground, which consumes a lot of energy and causes the minerals to be over ground [ High-voltage pulses have been used to break rocks since the 1960 More than 90 High-voltage pulse pretreatment has gradually attracted attention for the purpose of avoiding excessive energy consumption. Shi et al. studied the pre-concentration and pre-weakening of minerals using high-voltage pulse, and the results showed that high-voltage pulse pre-concentration raises the grade of minerals and rejects the low grade of tailings [ In present study, the pre-weakening effect of electrical breakage was studied. And results showed that grinding effect can be effectively realized [ Copper ore was collected from Fu Shun, Liao Ning province, China. Before HVP (high voltage pulse) pretreatment, the materials were crushed into a size of 25–40 For copper ore pretreatment tests, SELFRAG LAB S 2.1 was chosen. The main parts of this are the pulse energy provider, pulse generator, reactor tank, and control panel. The common adjustable parameters are the electrode gap, voltage, pulse number, and frequency. The electrode gap range is 20–40 A combination of electrical and mechanical crushing methods were used to conduct the experiment. First, copper ore was electrical pretreated under various conditions, and then the pretreated ores were grinded using mechanical method. The inhibitory action is revealed in terms of the micro-fine products. The experimental flow chart is shown in For the pretreatment effect, tests were carried out in deionized water. The water was changed after each test to ensure the accuracy of test. The voltage was controlled to investigate the effects of energy on pretreatment. During the experiment, the voltage was set at 90 After electrical pretreatment, the treated and untreated copper ore were crushed into −15 mm using a jaw crusher. The pretreatment effect was then investigated using a VM3 vibration grinding instrument. Also, the untreated ores were crushed under equal mechanical conditions using the VM3. The change of fineness was calculated. The grinding conditions were adjusted by time. In this part, the time was 10  The grinding index [     A higher The inhibitory index was used to evaluate the inhibitory action of electrical breakage. The equation is as follows:  Q Q A higher The unit energy grinding effect is used to characterize the energy utilization efficiency of the high-voltage electrical pulse pretreatment. The equation is as follows:     A high The inhibitory principle model is shown in For pretreated particle, the sample is easier to be grinded for the size reduction, and the size reduction rate is higher than untreated particles. The product size distribution is more uniform than untreated particles, and the micro-fine particles are easier to control. For untreated particle, the sample are hard to be grinded into fine particles, the grinding degree for all particles are uneven and the micro-fine particles are easier appearing. The +4 mm mechanically crushed and HVP-treated products were analyzed using SEM. The morphologies are shown in The The morphological characteristics of high-voltage pulse crushed and mechanically crushed products are different. This is mainly because of the different principles of the two crushing modes. For mechanical fragmentation, external force was used to destroy minerals, whereas for HVP fragmentation, discharge channels were formed inside minerals, and these produce tension to break minerals with high temperature. Some mineral components peel off of the surface of the particles because of the tension, and this results in cracks and holes in the minerals. Also, The overall structure is looser after electrical pretreatment. Pretreated copper ore was screened into three size fractions, -4 mm, 4–10 mm, and +10 mm. The size distribution at 90 kV and 1, 2, 3, 4 kWh/t is shown in The average size reduction energy intervals under various conditions are shown in Cracks occur in ores when the HVP pretreatment is used [ Copper ore was grinded using a mechanical method for 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 The −74 The values of the grinding index Energy consumption is an important factor that affects the development of the mining industry and is a key indicator for the application of new technologies. The energy consumption of mechanical crushing was about 20 In mineral processing, the subsequent process after grinding is greatly affected by the fine size distribution. It is significant to evaluate the inhibitory effect by investigating the size distribution after grinding. The grinding products of the untreated ore and pretreated ore at 4 kWh/t of the at 90 kV were further screened. They were screened into size fractions of-45, 45–74, 74–100, and +100 Similar size characterizations with grinding time are shown in The high voltage pulse pretreatment inhibitory effect can effectively reduce the micro-fine particle contents of mechanical grinding while the contents of proper size fraction can be guaranteed. The inhibitory index is 0.24 and −74 The mineral structure can be weakened by electrical pretreatment. After electrical pretreatment, large number of holes are observed and the mineral surface microstructure is changed. This reduces the mineral hardness, improves the grindability and contributes to inhibitory effect. The breakage performance decreases with an increase in voltage at equal energy, the lower voltage is enough to break ores and the performance is better than higher voltage. The size-reduction energy interval is greatly affected by voltage, and the interval range increased from 1 to 3 The pulse energy has a significant effect on the pretreatment effect. At 4
