In the present work, the chemical bath deposition (CBD) of ZnO nanorods was studied. The effects of pertinent factors – seed layer thickness, temperature, initial Zn concentration and Polyethylenimine (PEI) level – were indentified in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The uniformity (order), growth orientation and the length and diameter (aspect ratio) of ZnO nanorods were considered as the criteria for achieving the favorable conditions of the synthesis process. The size characteristics, texture and uniformity of the ZnO nanorods were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was also employed for the phase characterization of the obtained ZnO nanorods.Zinc oxide (ZnO), as a pivotal technological compound with a wide band-gap (3.37 Regarding the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO (the polar surfaces terminated in Zn Various fabrication techniques, including electron beam evaporation Electrodeposition The most conventional strategy for the CBD of ZnO nanorods/nanowires is the use of pretreated substrates. The pretreatments on substrates include thermal deposition The chemical bath deposition (CBD) involves the nucleation and growth steps based on the formation of a solid phase from a solution. During this two-step process many parameters can affect the structure and morphology of the products. The pertinent factors identified in previous research as significantly influencing the properties of the ZnO nanorods/nanowires produced in CBD process include seed layer The aim of the present work is to assess the effects of pertinent factors – i.e. seed layer thickness, temperature, initial Zn concentration and polyethylenimine (PEI) level – in a CBD process of ZnO nanorods synthesis. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) were employed for characterization of the uniformity and order as well as the growth orientation of ZnO nanorods. Moreover, the diameters and length (aspect ratio) of the ZnO nanorods were quantified using ImageJ software. The ZnO seed layers with different thicknesses were deposited on the glass substrate using sputtering. The sputtering was conducted at ambient temperature using ZnO (99.999% purity) target in presence of argon gas (99.999% purity) at a radio frequency (RF) of 13.56 Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO In a typical synthesis, 50 Morphological features of the synthesized nanostructures were studied using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, HITACHI S-4160). Image analysis was carried out on the micrographs by counting (areal density) and by the use of ImageJ software to collate rod length and diameter data In a typical CBD of ZnO nanorod, in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine, the growth rate and the morphology of the obtained products can be controlled by variation of the seed layer thickness, temperature, concentration of Zn ions and PEI concentration. HMTA in the growth step of ZnO nanorods acts as a pH buffering agent through the slow release of OH Zn ions resulted, from zinc nitrate dissociation in the aqueous medium, react with NH Regarding the buffering role of HMTA, which provides a gradual supply of NH It is worthy of note that Zn hydroxide complexes, in the form of [Zn(OH) It means that there is an interrelationship between reactions In order to evaluate the effect of seed layer thickness, three substrates covered with different thicknesses of ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by the use of RF sputtering technique as described in As can be seen in In The results of SEM images analysis, presented in To sum up, based on the above evidences and discussion, 50 Three sets of experiments were conducted at three different temperatures (80, 85 and 90 According to the SEM images illustrated in As it can be observed in Another important point regarding the negative effect of higher temperature (90 After obtaining the best possible values for the seed layer thickness, 50  The most important point which should be mentioned is the critical role of PEI. According to the SEM image analysis results presented in The highest aspect ratio (30) is attainable when the Zn ion concentration and PEI level are 0.025 PEI is a polymer with repeating unit composed of the amine group and a two-carbon aliphatic CH The SEM images presented in Based on the results presented in X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of ZnO nanorods are depicted in Close observation of the pattern shows that the peak with highest intensity appears at 2 Another criterion for identification of preferred orientation of ZnO nanorod is the texture coefficient (TC) which can be estimated as In the present work the effects of seed layer thickness, growth temperature, initial Zn concentration and PEI level were assessed for chemical bath deposition of ZnO nanorods. It was found that the favorable conditions for achieving ordered vertical ZnO nanorods with the highest density was obtained at a seed layer thickness of 50 The maximum length of ZnO nanorods was achieved at 85 Based on the obtained results, the uniform and aligned ZnO nanorods were attained at an initial Zn concentration of 0.025 According to XRD study, the presence of pure and highly oriented ZnO nanorods alongside
