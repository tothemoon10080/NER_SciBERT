Graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTGr) reinforced Ti6Al4V (Ti64) matrix composites prepared via the powder metallurgy route were synthesized by spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. 1, 2 and 3wt% MWCNTGr were dispersed in the Ti64 matrices by adapted high energy ball milling (HEBMA). Composite powder mixtures were sintered in vacuum at constant applied pressure, heating rate and isothermal holding time of 50MPa, 100°C/min and 5min respectively. The sintering temperature was varied between 850 and 1000°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the as-received MWCNTs, MWCNTGr, admixed composite powders and the bulk sintered composites. MWCNTGr evolution during graphitization treatment, dispersion in Ti64 matrix and in the sintered composites was analyzed using the characteristic Raman peak intensity ratio (ID/IG). The relative density of the sintered MWCNTGr/Ti64 composites was enhanced with increased sintering temperature, but deteriorated with increased wt% MWCNTGr in the metal matrix. Vickers microhardness of the consolidated composites improved with increasing sintering temperature and weight fractions of MWCNTGr over that of the unreinforced matrix alloy. The formation of crystalline TiC interfacial product during composite powder processing and consolidation is also discussed.Aluminium (Al) and magnesium (Mg) lightmetals have been extensively studied as structural materials for aerospace applications, although they lack the strength and rigidity attainable with iron and steel Recently, titanium (Ti) and its alloys have been explored in the aerospace industry for weight savings (to replace steel and Al primarily), space limitation (as Al alloys replacement), high operating temperature (Al, steel and Ni-based alloys replacement), corrosion resistance (to replace low alloy steels and Al) and composite compatibility (replace Al alloys) Among these reinforcement materials, the development of high performance, smart TMCs for diverse engineering applications have been modified with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as reinforcement in recent years. CNTs are attractive from the point of view of their superior mechanical, thermal and electrical properties, high aspect ratios and low densities The processing challenges reported in previous studies are (i) achieving and maintaining the homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in the metal matrix, (ii) damage to CNTs during processing resulting in interfacial reactions with the matrix and (iii) weak bonding with the matrix Although a few reports are available in literature on the reinforcement of Ti matrix with MWCNTs, none of these studies has to date reported on the reinforcement of Ti64 with MWCNTs, to the best of our knowledge. In addition, Weston et al. The starting powder materials used for this study were MWCNTs (Cheap Tubes Inc., USA, with outside diameter (OD) Thereafter, the Retsch PM 400 MA, Germany, high energy ball mill (HEBM), was adapted for the mixing and dispersion of 1, 2 and 3 The starting powders and the admixed MWCNT The admixed MWCNT Graphite foils were placed between the powder and the graphite die to prevent powder welding and ensure uniform current flow within it. Composite powders were sintered in successive runs at constant heating rate, applied pressure and holding time of 100 Microhardness measurements were carried out on sectioned as-polished sintered sample surfaces at room temperature under a load of 500 gf and dwell time of 15  The SEM micrograph of MWCNT The MWCNT  Despite the fact that the MWCNT The X-ray diffraction patterns of MWCNT  The results of the analyses on the structural changes and crystalline phase evolution in the sintered unreinforced Ti64 and MWCNT It was noticed that TiC only began to form in the composite with 1 The XRD patterns of the composites containing 1 and 2 The secondary electron images (SEI) of unreinforced Ti64 and MWCNT With the addition of MWCNT Raman spectroscopy has been a universally accepted tool for characterizing the evolution of the sp The Raman spectra of the as-received Ti64 powder ( It is a generally accepted opinion that the structural integrity of MWCNTs is measured by the I The D and G bands (  The I The densification patterns in the sintered composites and the unreinforced matrix alloy are shown in The densification pattern in the sintered composites displayed a progressive reduction in the relative densities of the composites as the weight fractions of the reinforcement increased in the composites. This progressive reduction in the relative densities with increased MWCNT At 850 The variation of hardness in the sintered MWCNT The fracture surfaces of unreinforced Ti64 and MWCNT Graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotube reinforced Ti64 composites were successfully synthesized by spark plasma sintering.
