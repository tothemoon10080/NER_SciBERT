The 8th IFAC International Symposium on Advanced Control of Chemical Processes was held on July 10–13, 2012 in Singapore. ADCHEM is the triennial meeting of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) that brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss recent developments in the control of chemical, biochemical, and related process systems. Theory and applications were covered within the broad areas of batch process modeling and control, model-based control, process and control monitoring, modeling and identification, optimization and scheduling, and process applications. ADCHEM 2012 was sponsored by the IFAC Technical Committee on Chemical Process Control and co-sponsored by the IFAC Technical Committees on Non-linear Control Systems, Biosystems and Bioprocesses, and Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety of Technical Processes. The meeting was organized in the same tradition as the previous ADCHEM symposia in Toulouse (1991), Kyoto (1994), Banff (1997), Pisa (2000), Hong Kong (2003), Gramado (2006) and Istanbul (2009). 176 participants from 28 countries attended ADCHEM 2012, with nearly 10% from industry. The final program had 3 plenaries, 12 keynotes, 106 oral presentations, and 28 poster presentations. All submissions were peer reviewed, with about 60% of the regular submissions accepted for oral presentation. Each day was opened by a Plenary Lecture, followed by two keynote lectures, and then three sessions in parallel. The afternoons had two additional keynote lectures followed by three sessions in parallel, and the Wednesday and Thursday technical programs ended with poster sessions. Wednesday's plenary talk by Frank Allgöwer of the University of Stuttgart considered the design of optimal decentralized control in which the structure of the controller is incorporated into the optimization. Thursday's plenary talk by Jay Hyung Lee of KAIST considered the role that control engineering can be play in the optimization of energy supply chains. Friday's plenary talk by Jose Tabora of Bristol-Myers Squibb described the application of data-driven modeling and control methods to batch processes in the pharmaceutical industry. More than half of the keynote presentations were selected from the submissions to the symposium based on reviews, with the full list of topics including the advanced control of industrial polymerization reactors, wastewater treatment, chromatographic separations, exothermic chemical reactors, particulate dynamics in rotating drums, integrated microchemical systems, ore mineral processing, and solar energy systems. The keynote talks spanned the spectrum of systems and control technologies including optimization, control, scheduling, state estimation, and fault diagnosis. ADCHEM 2012 was held in the city-state of Singapore, which is a melting pot of Asian cultures reflected in its architecture, people, and food. Many participants spent some extra days in Singapore enjoying its many attractions that include a Botanical Gardens with over 10,000 species of plants and trees and an amazing array of tropical orchids, a Night Safari with over 120 species of animals, Jurong Bird Park which houses over 600 species, the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, the Southern Ridges nature trail, Mount Faber which offers panoramic views of nearby islands, and the Sentosa Island Resort with its golf courses and a Universal Studios theme park. The Chair of the International Program Committees (IPC) of the symposium (Richard D. Braatz) was invited by the Editor of the Journal of Process Control, Professor Wolfgang Marquardt, to organize a special issue of the journal devoted to ADCHEM 2012. For high quality papers identified by the IPC Chair based on the review ratings and input from the Area Chairs, the authors were invited to extend the conference papers to produce full-length papers that then went through rigorous peer review under the standard editorial process of the The papers in this special issue provide a reasonable coverage of the topics covers in the symposium, which can be roughly organized in seven areas:        ADCHEM 2012 was made possible by the investment of time by many volunteers, which include the IPC Co-Chair from Industry (Alexander Horch), the Area Chairs (Zoltan K. Nagy, Rolf Findeisen, S. Joe Qin, Sunwon Park, Yaman Arkun, and Martin Guay), the National Organizing Committee Co-Chairs (Vinay Kariwala and Lakshminarayanan Samavedham), and all members of the International Programming and National Organizing Committees. We thank the volunteers for their time and look forward to the next ADCHEM.
