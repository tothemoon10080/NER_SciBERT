In order to study the stability of stope and the subsidence of ground surface during the mining process in southern district of Si Jiaying iron mine, one section of mining panel was selected to conduct the physical and mechanics model test. Distributed optical fiber based on BOTDR was used to monitor the strain distribution of the model. It indicated that the BOTDR-based distributed detection technique for the model was quite effective. Test results show that the model is stable on the whole, the movement of stope roof and ground surface is less and the strain variation in the pillar is stable, therefore, Bench open stoping and subsequent backfilling mining is feasible. It showed obvious advantages for BOTDR such as distributed mode, high precision, layout easily, strong anti-interference, and it was a potential technique for strain test of simulation experiment.
