The behaviour of cationic lactoferrin-stabilized and anionic β-lactoglobulin (β-lg)-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions (20.0% (w/w) soy oil, 1.0% (w/w) protein) in the presence of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) containing physiological concentrations of pancreatin (0.0–10.0 mg mL−1) and/or bile salts (0.0–25.0 mg mL−1) at 37 °C, pH 7.5 and inorganic salts (39 mm K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl and 30 mm CaCl2) was investigated. Both emulsions showed a significant degree of coalescence and fatty acid release on mixing with SIF. Appreciably negative ζ-potential values (≥−50 mV) for both types of emulsion droplet at the highest pancreatin/bile salts concentration could be attributed to displacement of and/or binding to the interfacial proteins by bile salts, together with interfacial proteolysis by pancreatin, which enhanced the potential for lipase to act on the hydrophobic lipid core, thus generating free fatty acids and possibly mono- and/or diglycerides at the droplet surface.Lipids play a significant role in determining the consumer perception of the texture and taste (flavour, aroma and mouthfeel) profiles of many processed foods such as spreads, milk-based beverages, imitation creams, salad dressings, soups and confectionary products. Being present in either bulk form or emulsified form, lipids provide a concentrated source of energy, provide a potential supply of essential fatty acids and act as carriers of fat-soluble vitamins, carotenoids and phytosterols ( Generally, emulsified lipid droplets undergo a series of physical and biochemical processes on consumption and digestion. During these processes, the droplets are exposed to different gastrointestinal pHs, inorganic salts (Na The majority of lipid digestion (70–90%) occurs in the upper part of the intestine ( Hence, in this study, we aimed to gain further insight into the effects of the addition of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) at pH 7.5, containing various concentrations of pancreatin and bile salts of physiological relevance, on the physicochemical and microstructural characteristics of milk-protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. We attempted to focus on the difference in initial charge of the emulsion droplets (cationic lactoferrin and anionic β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) as the interfacial layer at neutral pH respectively) to compare the behaviours of the droplets in the in vitro duodenal model. The significant physicochemical changes that might occur during oral and gastric processing of these emulsions were deliberately ignored in this present study. The aim of this study is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of interactions between the interfacial protein layer surrounding the intact lipid core and pancreatic secretions. Bovine β-lg (L3908, containing ∼90.0% β-lg as stated by the supplier) purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA, was used directly without any further purification. Lactoferrin (1.1% moisture and 99.0% protein, of which 95.8% was lactoferrin as stated by the supplier) was gifted by Tatua Co-operative Dairy Company Limited, Morrinsville, New Zealand. Dried un-fractionated bovine bile (B3883) and porcine pancreatin (P1750; 4×USP) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company. As mentioned by the supplier, the bile salts contained a mixture of ∼10–20% glycocholic acid, ∼5–10% glycodeoxycholic acid, 30–40% taurocholic acid and ∼5–10% taurodeoxycholic acid accounting for ∼60% cholic acid by mass of the total bile salts. Refined, bleached and deodorized soy oil was obtained from Davis Trading Company, Palmerston North, New Zealand. All other analytical grade chemicals were obtained from either Sigma Aldrich Chemical Company or BDH Chemicals (BDH Ltd, Poole, UK) unless otherwise specified. Milli-Q water (water purified by treatment with a Milli-Q apparatus, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) was used for making the solutions throughout the study. Simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) (pH 7.5, 39 m The in vitro duodenal or simulated upper intestinal model consisted of a conical flask (250 mL) containing SIF with added pancreatin and/or bile salts maintained at 37 °C, with continuous agitation at ∼95 rev min Protein stock solution (1.0%, w/w) was prepared by dispersing exact quantities of β-lg or lactoferrin in Milli-Q water and stirring for 2 h at 20 °C for complete solubility. Sodium azide (0.02%, w/w) was added to prevent microbial growth. The pH values of the stock solutions were adjusted to 7.0 using 1 Digestion experiments in the in vitro duodenal model (as described in Section Static laser light scattering employing a Malvern MasterSizer MSE (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) was used to determine the change in droplet size distribution. The average diameters, The rate of coalescence of emulsion droplets largely follows first-order kinetics ( The relative proportion of emulsion droplets can then be obtained from the following derived equation: Kinetic plots of ln ( The amount of free fatty acid released from the emulsion after treatment with SIF was determined using a titration method ( The microstructures of the samples were determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Approximately 1.0 mL of the emulsion–SIF mixture was stained with 1.0% (w/v) Nile Blue (fluorescent dye), placed on a concave confocal microscope slide (Sail; Sailing Medical-Lab Industries Company Ltd, Suzhou, China), covered with a cover slip and finally observed with a 100× magnification lens in a confocal microscope (Leica DM6000 B, Heidelberg, Germany) using an Ar/Kr laser with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Emulsion–SIF mixture samples were diluted to approximately 0.005% (w/w) droplet concentration using SIF buffer solution (without added pancreatin or bile salts) and the The change in the interfacial composition of the emulsions after treatment with SIF for 2 h was determined by examining the unadsorbed β-lg or lactoferrin (present in the continuous phase) obtained by centrifuging the emulsion–SIF mixtures for 40 min at 45,000 × Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance using Minitab 15.1.0 software (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). Significant difference was declared at  As shown in The Further examination of the β-lg-stabilized emulsions by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( In the case of the lactoferrin-stabilized emulsions, the It is worth noting that, in the absence of bile salts and the presence of pancreatin (both low and high concentrations), although the system was rather monodisperse as described earlier, the droplets observed by confocal microscopy in both emulsions seemed to be more spherical and totally different in appearance from the original emulsion (emulsion without any SIF treatment) ( As observed in It was interesting to note that, in the absence of pancreatin (0 mg mL In contrast, the lactoferrin-stabilized emulsions showed a marked increase in Generally, protein-stabilized emulsions are stable to coalescence as the protein molecules adsorb at the droplet surfaces forming a dense viscoelastic interfacial layer ( As shown in In the case of an increasing concentration of pancreatin at a fixed concentration of bile salts (20 mg mL When the two types of emulsion were compared, the rate constant was greater for the lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion than for the β-lg-stabilized emulsion at the same concentration of added pancreatin or added bile salts, which clearly showed the greater sensitivity of lactoferrin-stabilized emulsions to coalescence under the simulated intestinal conditions. To gain further knowledge about the coalescence observed in both the lactoferrin-stabilized emulsions and the β-lg-stabilized emulsions as influenced by pancreatin/bile salts mixtures, the release of free fatty acids from the emulsified lipids due to pancreatic lipase activity was monitored (  SDS-PAGE on β-lg-stabilized emulsion and the lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion mixed with SIF showed that β-lg and lactoferrin proteins were rapidly hydrolysed by the trypsin-chymotrypsin fractions of the pancreatin (data not shown). This simulated duodenal model study provided valuable insights into the mechanism of interactions of food emulsions with pancreatic secretions. Lactoferrin- and β-lg-stabilized emulsions behave differently in the in vitro digestion model. To gain further understanding about the interactions of the protein-stabilized interface in human gastrointestinal systems, individual lipase and protease components should be studied in isolation. Lab-scale separation and purification method of lipolytic fractions of pancreatin has to be adopted as even the most purified commercial lipase enzymes contain residual proteolytic activities ( A New Zealand International Doctoral Research Scholarship (Ministry of Education, New Zealand) and a Massey University Doctoral Scholarship financially supported Anwesha Sarkar for her PhD studies.
