Dear Sir, Re. Palmar plate fixation of AO type C2 fracture of distal radius using a locking compression plate. A biomechanical study in a cadaveric model. 28B (3): 263â€“266. I agree with the first and third comment made by Mr Hart and colleagues. The design of the study had taken into consideration the shortage of specimens available and, since we would use the same specimens for further plating and testing, we did not test them to failure. It would have been better if we could have used one fresh specimen for each test. However, we would stand by the use of cadaveric specimen as the stability of distal radial fractures relies considerably on soft tissue integrity. Therefore, the use of artificial bone would not be appropriate. Regarding the fracture model, we are aware of the other commonly used model with comminution only on dorsal aspect. However, among the patients treated in our centre, we often encountered high-energy fractures with comminution of both dorsal and palmar aspects. We feel that future studies should include two different cuts on different specimens to simulate different fracture patterns.
