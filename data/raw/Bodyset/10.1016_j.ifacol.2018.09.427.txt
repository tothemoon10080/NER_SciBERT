Pyrometallurgical copper processing plants are facing scenarios of increasing complexity with stringent environmental regulations, high energy cost and complex copper concentrates. In order to reduce the uncertainties in their operations it is necessary to have analytical measurements of the main raw materials and products. This work provides a survey of the current situation and identifies possible technologies to address the current lack of this type of measurements. In addition, the main challenges to be overcome in order to successfully implement new measurement technology are also identified.
