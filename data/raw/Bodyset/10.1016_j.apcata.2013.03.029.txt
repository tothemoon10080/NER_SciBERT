The aim of this work is to improve some of the less desirable properties of bio-oil via the catalytic fast pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse using a novel supported molybdenum carbide (20wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3) catalyst. Proximate and elemental analysis of the bagasse were carried out to determine the moisture, ash, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen content. The ground pellets were classified in sieves to a size range of 0.25–1mm and were pyrolysed in a 300gh−1 fluidised bed reactor at 500°C. Mo2C/Al2O3 replaced the sand in the fluidised bed reactor in different proportions (0wt.%, 12wt.%, 25wt.% and 50wt.%) to investigate the effect of this catalyst on the pyrolysis products. Bio-oil yield results showed that ground sugarcane bagasse pellets gave high organic yields in the bio-oil of 60.5wt.% on dry feed with a total liquid yield of 73.1wt.% on dry feed without catalyst. Increasing the catalyst proportions in the fluidised bed reduced bio-oil yields, significantly reduced sugars (as α-levoglucosan) concentration and increased furanics and phenolics concentration in the bio-oil. It was observed that the higher the concentration of the 20wt.% Mo2C/Al2O3 catalyst in the fluidised bed the lower the viscosity of the bio-oil.Fast pyrolysis liquid or bio-oil has some unattractive properties for direct use in heat and power applications which means that it usually requires upgrading before it can be used. The upgrading usually improves properties such as a heating value, oxygen content, water content, viscosity and pH. A variety of processes have been developed to address these concerns and the work reported here uses a novel catalyst to improve some of the physical properties to make bio-oil more amenable for use in direct heat and power. Sugarcane bagasse is available as a fibrous waste product in large quantities from the sugar recovery process. In Brazil, 140 Fast pyrolysis is a direct thermal decomposition process The high oxygen content makes bio-oil oleophobic i.e. immiscible with hydrocarbons. There are a wide range of bio-oil upgrading techniques currently under research and development including hydrotreating of bio-oil and catalytic cracking of pyrolysis vapours over zeolites The stability of molybdenum carbide and its resistance to rapid deactivation or alteration has not yet been investigated because molybdenum carbide oxidises when exposed to the atmosphere. Re-carburisation would be required before replacing the catalyst into the fast pyrolysis fluidised bed reactor. Also, catalyst and sand particles are of the same size range so separation would be difficult once they were recovered from the reactor. For this reason, in order to assess catalyst stability, upgraded liquid samples would need to be to regularly collected and analysed throughout each experiment. However, this was not possible using the existing rig set up. An indirect way of assessing the catalyst stability would be to analyse the gas composition at regular interval times. If the catalyst deactivates during the pyrolysis the composition of the gas coming out of the system tends to be the same as that obtained for thermal pyrolysis. This change in gas composition was observed recently by Wan et al. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the influence and viability of replacing different proportions of the fast pyrolysis fluidised bed sand with 0 Sugarcane bagasse was collected from storage piles at a mill site in Brazil in August 2010 and pellets were made to homogenise the bagasse after grinding which also results in higher feeding rates due to the higher density. To make these pellets, bagasse was dried in a flash drier at approximately 280 The pelletised biomass needs to be ground and sieved to a particle size range of 0.25–1 The 20 In the second step, the 28.24 Transition metal carbides are pyrophoric. If the sample was removed from the reactor after the carburization procedure without any treatment it would ignite completely oxidising the carbidic phase. For this reason, a third step was applied in order to have the final product ready for use and to allow its transportation and loading into the fluidised bed reactor. This step consisted in flooding the quartz reactor with i-octane by flowing the hydrocarbon into the reactor. After completely filling the reactor, the mixture catalyst and i-octane was stored in a bottle. This procedure allows the storage of the sample for prolonged periods without carbide oxidation. Prior to fast pyrolysis experiments, appropriate amounts of the Mo It was essential to determine the bulk density of catalysts in a fluidised bed reactor to ensure correct fluidisation of the bed material and ensure that sand and catalysts were retained in the reactor and the char was entrained out of the reactor. The bulk density of the biomass, char, catalyst and sand were determined experimentally using a 500 Proximate and elemental analyses were carried out to determine the moisture, volatiles, char, ash and fixed carbon content of the feed material. The carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen content were also determined to calculate the high heating value (HHV) of the feedstock. Ash content analysis of samples was carried out using the “Standard Test Method for Ash in Biomass” (ASTM E1755). It was repeated three times to ensure accuracy and averages were taken. Samples were dried in an oven before carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and nitrogen (N) content analysis was carried out in duplicate using a Carlo-Erba 1108 elemental analyser by an external company (Medac Ltd.), and averages of these values were also used. Elemental analysis of the bio-oil produced by fast pyrolysis was also carried out by Medac in their Carlo-Erba 1108 elemental analyser. Equation Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to show how samples might behave under slow pyrolysis conditions. This technique is not representative of a fast pyrolysis system as it has slower heating rates, longer hot vapour residence times and the flow regime is completely different from that of a fluidised bed. However, TGA is valuable as the volatile content of a sample can be used as an estimation of the yields of liquids and gases produced during pyrolysis. TGA can also be used to show the thermal degradation properties of a sample. Total combustion of the sample allows for the alternative determination of the ash content. TGA uses only 4–5 Stage 1: TGA pyrolysis was used with nitrogen to produce char up to a maximum temperature of 500 Stage 2: slow combustion of char (from stage 1) to produce ash. TGA Combustion with air up to a maximum temperature of 575  The quantification of solids in the bio-oil is important as the presence of solids are reported to lead to ageing of bio-oil, sedimentation, filter blockage, catalyst blockage and engine injector blockage The water content of bio-oil has a complex effect on viscosity and stability. Increased water lowers HHV, density, stability and can also affect catalysts. However, water increases pH A Sartorius PB-11 pH metre was used to measure the pH of bio-oil samples. pH buffers supplied by Sartorius were used to calibrate the metre to pH 2, 4 and 7. Bio-oil elemental analysis was carried out by Medac Ltd. in their Carlo-Erba 1108 elemental analyser as detailed in Section A Brookfield (Viscometer model DV-II+pro) rotational type viscometer was used to measure the viscosity of bio-oil at 40 Gel permeation chromatography was used to determine the molecular weight distribution of compounds in bio-oil and this technique allows the measurement of the homogeneity of the bio-oil. A PL-GPC 50 from Polymer Laboratories, UK, with a refractive index (RI) detector was used. It has a PLgel 3 The chemical composition of the bio-oil was analysed using a combined Varian 450-GC Gas chromatograph and Varian 220-MS Mass Spectrometer. The capillary column used was a Varian VF-5        For miscibility with diesel, bio-oil needs to be deoxygenated. Catalytic pyrolysis is expected to increase the water formed during dehydration reactions, but the more favourable hydrocarbons produced are likely to phase separate from water. These hydrocarbons could be easily deoxygenated employing conventional catalysts (or even molybdenum carbide) using normal hydrotreating conditions (i.e., elevated hydrogen partial pressures) once the water has phase separated. However, the organic liquid produced in this work is miscible with the aqueous liquid and therefore indirectly increases the overall oxygen content of the bio-oil with increasing catalyst concentration. Although Oasmaa and Czernik suggest that phase separation of the bio-oil is likely to occur when the water content is greater than 30 Increasing concentration of molybdenum carbide has shown a reduction in bio-oil viscosity from 2780 Polydispersity index (PDI) is a measure of molecular homogeneity and indicates the distribution of molecular weights. PDI is always greater than 1 and higher PDI values indicate a lower molecular homogeneity  A very important point concerning the bio-oil upgrading is catalyst stability as several works in the literature show that in general there is catalysis deactivation. As stated in the introduction, with the experimental rig set up employed in this work it would be impossible to collect samples of the bio-oil at a regular times in order to check if its composition was changing due to catalyst deactivation. Therefore, the data presented for bio-oil characterisation is for the product collected over the total reaction time and at first cannot be used to infer about catalyst activity or stability. However, if the catalyst was quite active in the beginning of the experiment and deactivated with processing time one would expect that not only the bio-oil composition would change with time, but also the gas composition.  It is noteworthy that the production of CO and CO Bio-oil upgrading with the addition of Mo These improved bio-oil properties are important if liquid bio-oil is to be further upgraded because its lower viscosity facilitates the flow in a hydrotreater operated in trickle-bed regime. In the conditions used in fast pyrolysis and with the absence of hydrogen and pressure, Mo More efficient liquid collection such as the quench collection systems collect a whole bio-oil which is more representative of fast pyrolysis bio-oil. If molybdenum carbide is used in a fast pyrolysis unit with a quench collection system, it is expected that the pH of the whole bio-oil will be less acidic.
