In this paper the microstructural and mechanical properties of a hot rolled Cr–W–V steel were studied. The 4.5Cr–2W–0.25V–0.1C steel was austenitized at 1000°C for 30min and then tempered at 600 and 700°C for 1h. The physical metallurgy of this steel was studied by optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes and X-ray and electron diffraction patterns. The results showed that four types of carbide were precipitated as MC, M3C, M7C3 and M23C6 along prior austenite grains and lath boundaries and within martensitic matrix. The average sizes of the M7C3 and M23C6 carbides in the specimens tempered at 600°C were about 100 and 180nm, and in specimens tempered at 700°C were about 110 and 210nm, respectively. When the tempering temperature was increased, weight percent of extracted precipitates and the formation rate of the stable carbides such as M23C6 and dissolution rate of the metastable carbides such as M3C and M7C3 were also increased. The results of hot tension tests showed the strength and elongation of tempered specimens were decreased when the test temperature was increased. The strength decrease was slow at range of 200–500°C but sharp at test temperature of 600°C. The results suggested tempering at 700°C has better tensile properties at operating temperature (500–600°C) when compared to tempering at 600°C.Cr–W–V steels are the new candidates for first walls and breeder blanket structural materials in power plants and high temperature applications Several studies have been concluded on metallurgical properties of Cr–W–V steels This paper presents the metallurgical properties (microstructural and mechanical behavior) of 4.5Cr–2W–0.25V steel in the normalized condition and after tempering treatments performed at 600 and 700 The chemical composition of the hot rolled Cr–W–V steel used in this study is given in   The type of different carbides was characterized using X-ray and electron diffraction analyses.

A little amount of fine spherical precipitates ( The effect of tempering temperature on the carbide precipitation was also studied using the XRD results. The relative amounts of each carbide were estimated using its intensity ratio to that of MC  Electron diffraction patterns were also used for the size distribution analysis of the carbide precipitates.

Four types of the carbides were detected by XRD and TEM.

The decrease in strength was slow at range of 200–500 The results suggested tempering at 700
