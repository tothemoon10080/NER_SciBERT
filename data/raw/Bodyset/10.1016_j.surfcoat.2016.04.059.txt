This work shows the effect that presents NaOH in combination with several additives of the amino group on the formation of manganese phosphate coatings on steel. These combinations of additives does not modify the structure of the coating (hureaulite) but can affect the stages of corrosion, degradation and crystalline reorganization of the cyclic phosphating mechanism. These amino additives behave as cathodic corrosion inhibitors and are auxiliary agents in the acid leaching of manganese from the prismatic crystals of hureaulite which accelerates the crystalline reorganization stage and thus modifies the frequency of the cycles of growth and reduction of the prismatic crystals. Some of the additives act as chelating agents, retaining the Mn2+ and affecting the kinetics of precipitation and dissolution of manganese rich hureaulite crystals, but increasing the sites of nucleation and growth of the crystals (crystal density). The formation of the phosphate coating follows the cyclic phosphating mechanism for all the baths. The effects on crystal size (S(t)) of the equilibrium conditions in the bulk of the bath (S0), corrosion (C(t)) and degradation (D(t)) stages in each cycle can be resumed through the equation: S(t)=S0
                     +C(t) sin[D(t)].The phosphating of steel requires the control of bath parameters: concentration of reactants, temperature, pH, etc. In general, the steel phosphating process performed at an established concentration of reactants and temperature requires a certain pH value that allows the precipitation of prismatic crystals of hureaulite (Mn based system).The synthetic phosphating solutions exhibit a low “natural” pH (pH The ammonium (NH In a previous work Degradation is one of the main stages during phosphating which, as long as there are prismatic crystals in the coating, it is present all the time that the steel is immersed in the phosphating bath and is characterized by several processes which are related to the formation of differential aeration cells The aim of this work is to show the effect that present the combination of NaOH with alkalizing reagents of the amino group, such as NH Manganese phosphating was performed on a quenched and tempered high strength steel with the following chemical composition (wt.%, Square samples of 1.5 Phosphating solutions were prepared with analytical grade reagents and deionized water. The reagents were: manganese dioxide (99.9 The composition of the phosphating bath was as follows: 7.95 Thermodynamic analysis is a powerful tool to elucidate chemical and electrochemical reactions that take place in phosphating systems or in any hydrometallurgical system. Therefore, predominance diagrams The phosphating process was thermodynamically studied considering that Mn and Fe (from the corrosion of steel) participate simultaneously in the process. For the thermodynamic analysis of the phosphating system, HSC and Medusa programs were used. Both programs contain extensive databases of equilibrium constants, which where complemented with the Gibbs free energy data obtained from the work of La Iglesia The morphology of the coatings was characterized by scanning electron microscopy using a Phillips model XL30-ESEM instrument. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the coatings were obtained by the powder method on a Bruker model D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. A three electrode cell was used to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the steel in each bath. A saturated calomel electrode was used as reference, and a graphite bar as counter electrode. The sample was polarized ± The phosphate coatings formed under the conditions described in The coatings exhibit two definite morphologies: a) prismatic crystals (outer layer) of manganese rich hureaulite and b) film (inner layer) of iron rich hureaulite. The prismatic crystals exhibit a great content of manganese phosphate and a small portion of iron phosphate. The prismatic crystals exhibit several defects such incomplete outer layers, degraded appearance in their surface, disintegration, exfoliation and mainly pits, which can have a range of sizes. Initially the crystals grow on the surface of the steel coated by a thin layer of phosphates. At 5 The presence of the Fe-rich inner layer is first detected at 10 Right after the formation of the Fe-rich inner layer has occurred, the coating is covered with a layer of small size crystals, this layer is compact, therefore; the inner layer can only be observed in small regions, free of crystals. Iron rich regions surrounding the prismatic crystals, similar to the platforms, are detected at longer times of immersion. The presence of sludge in the bath is detected almost from the beginning of the process. The formation of iron rich globular sludge takes place on the surface of the prismatic crystals of Mn-rich hureaulite. Microstructural and chemical characterization of these features by SEM and EDXS techniques are reported in reference As indicated in The microstructural evolution of the coatings obtained with bath 1 is illustrated in As can be seen in The microstructural evolution of the coatings obtained with bath 2 is illustrated in The width of the pores present in the inner layer is noticeable bigger than the observed in bath 1. This effect can be also seen as an inclined edge or batter surrounding the pores (of gray color in the SEM-BSE images) this appearance coincides with a reported description of the pores of the inner layer The crystal density of the coatings is high when is compared with the coating formed with other baths adjusted with hydroxide solutions (baths 1,A, B). As can be seen in The microstructural evolution of the coating obtained with bath 3 is illustrated in The width of the pores present in the inner layer is noticeable bigger than the observed in bath 1, but not as much as with bath 2. This effect can be seen also as an inclined edge or batter surrounding the pores (of gray color in the SEM-BSE images) this appearance coincides with a reported description of the pores of the inner layer The crystal density is high when is compared with other coatings formed with baths adjusted with hydroxide solutions (A, B) The presence of iron rich areas surrounding the crystals is more noticeable than the observed in the coatings formed with baths 1 and 2, and the previously reported baths adjusted with hydroxide solutions As can be seen in The X-ray diffraction patterns of the This result indicates that the different alkalizing additives employed in the phosphating baths do not modify the structure of the coating formed (  The Pourbaix diagram illustrated in Among the additives employed in this study only the mono-ethanolamine (MEA) has an effect on the Pourbaix diagram of the phosphating system. It is known that MEA is present at low pH (< All the coatings formed with the several studied phosphating solutions follow the cyclic mechanism previously proposed Since the different alkalizing additives employed in the phosphating baths do not modify the structure of the coating formed ( The effect of the alkalizing additives on the corrosion of the substrate was shown in a previous paper This result suggests that the changes observed in the coating at long times of phosphating (> Therefore, it is important to deepen the discussion in the effect of the alkalizing additives on the degradation process during the formation of the phosphate coating, particularly during the leaching of the hureaulite crystals. As was discussed previously the degradation process of the coating involves the acid leaching of manganese from the hureaulite due to the acidification produced by the formation of differential aeration cells inside the pits observed in the prismatic crystals ( It is known that the use of ammonium hydroxide improves the leaching of copper, silver and gold We propose that the additives of the amino group present in the phosphating bath accelerate the leaching of manganese from the prismatic crystals, which increase the number of crystalline reorganization stages as can be appreciated through the several cycles of growth and reduction during time of phosphating i.e. the frequency of the cycles ( Also at this concentration ( It is noteworthy that the refining effect in bath 3 is bigger than in bath 1, this result suggests that NH The thermodynamic analysis ( Thus the presence of this chelating agent (MEA) could accelerate the leaching of Mn Several chelating agents such as EDTA, NTA and DPTA are used as special additives in phosphating baths to increase the coating weight Although MEA, as an additive for phosphating improves the crystalline density of the coating and, at certain times, produces coatings with great uniformity of the crystal size, it should be constantly replenished to the bath because it is degraded to ammonium and organic acids by the presence of oxygen in the solution In a previous work Based upon these observations the next relationships are proposed for the size of the crystals along time (S(t)): We propose that each cycle of growth and reduction of the prismatic crystals can be represented through the sine function: The size of the crystals is proportional to the corrosion (C(t)) of the substrate during phosphating: The degradation (D(t)) of the coating affects the frequency of the cycles of growth and reduction, this can be appreciated when D(t) becomes the argument of the sine function: Thus the corrosion of the substrate during phosphating and degradation of the coating along time of immersion can be related to the prismatic crystal size through: It is also observed ( The experimental data obtained for the crystal size along time can be used to obtain the values of S From the results obtained in this research we propose that S(t), C(t) and D(t) can be considered as non-continuous. The combination of alkalizing agents (NaOH The degradation of the coating is favored by additives that allow the leaching of manganese from the prismatic crystals. The additives of the amino group such as NH The coatings formed with the combination of NaOH and the additives of the amino group have a crystal density bigger than, for example, that observed when the pH of the phosphating bath is adjusted only with NaOH solution or concentrated NH The NH The effect of thermodynamic equilibrium, corrosion, degradation on the phosphating can be resumed through the relationship: S(t) The authors are grateful to M.
