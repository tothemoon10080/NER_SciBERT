The kinetics of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans growth was studied using series piezoelectric quartz crystal (SPQC). Cupric ion accelerates the growth of T.ferrooxidans, copper promoting the protein enzyme of T.ferrooxidans, rusticyanin, to form over the range of cupric ion concentration studied. The reaction order of cupric ion in accelerating the bacterial growth is 0.067. The apparent reaction activation energy of the bacterial growth decreases from 25.56 kJ/mol to 18.32 kJ/mol with the addition of 10 mg/l Cu(II) to the bacterial growth solution of pH 2.0 at initial inoculum of 10%.
