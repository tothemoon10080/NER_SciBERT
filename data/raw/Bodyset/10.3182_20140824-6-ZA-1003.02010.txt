The paper proposes a novel performance audit report for a SAG Mill Circuit. The audit report is demonstrated on a validated run-of-mine ore grinding circuit model, which the authors have captured in a simulator, using Simulink. The elements of the report combine established statistics and views with specific mill control context. A representative case study demonstrates the construction and interpretation of the audit report, so as to gain insight into the circuit performance over a historical data episode.
