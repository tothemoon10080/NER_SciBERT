The influence of selective additive l-phenylalanine on the nucleation control and growth of l-glutamic acid polymorphs from aqueous solution was studied. The effect of the selective additive l-phenylalanine on the control of the cross nucleation of polymorphs in the aqueous solution was investigated by slow evaporation method of crystallization. The effect of different additive concentrations on the solubility, pH and induction period of nucleation of the polymorphs was also investigated at room temperature. Nucleation control of the polymorphs was successfully carried out and single crystals of metastable Î±-polymorph were grown. Structural confirmation of the grown polymorph was carried out by powder x-ray diffraction study.
