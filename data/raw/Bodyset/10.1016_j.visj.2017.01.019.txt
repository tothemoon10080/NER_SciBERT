A 64-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with pain in his right hip and pelvis two days after a fall of 4.5 feet from his attic steps. He fell onto his right side. The pain had not improved at home. Patient reported increasing pain with ambulation in the area of the right hip. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a comminuted displaced fracture of the right iliac bone. There were no other notable injuries. After an ED consultation with the Orthopedic Service, the patient was discharged home with instructions for weight bearing with a walker and with outpatient Orthopedic follow up. Duverney fractures are a generally stable type of pelvic fracture, comprised of an isolated iliac wing fracture, most commonly resulting from a direct trauma. [French Surgeon, Dr. Joseph Guichard Duverney, 1648â€“1730].
