The exploitation of minerals from fields of exploitation can be treated as a separate investment project. Three stages of such a project should be considered during the decision-making process, the preparation of a field for exploitation, the acquisition of raw materials and the liquidation of the field following mining activities. During the implementation of these various stages, the evaluation of the economic efficiency of static and dynamic methods are taken into account in each of the stages. An essential element is also the evaluation of risks connected with the investment, this is a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of achieving specific objectives. The bases for the correct calculation of economic efficiency include: proper input data, including economic and technological aspects. This article highlights the necessity of an economic evaluation concerning the exploitation of fields during operational periods due to their recognition in higher categories and the ever changing mining and economic conditions. Such changes are analysed with economic efficiency of exploitation systems. The initial value of the project takes into consideration the time value of money proposed as a criterion of economic evaluation. Income and expenditure, which correspond to the liquidity of the company, are assumed as a basis for calculation. Net present value is presented as a sum of values regarding preparation period, exploitation and field liquidation.The order of exploiting and classifying mineral resources (i.e. recognising whether they are industrial or nonindustrial) are described in the field development project (Article, 2001). During the operational period, i.e. during the period of deposit exploitation, natural conditions may change (e.g. through more precise diagnosis of deposits) and mining conditions (i.e. due to a change in exploitation orders), and economic circumstances, resulting from fluctuations in prices and costs. As a result, the exploitation of every field during the operational period should be preceded by an economic evaluation. Field exploitation may be treated as a separate investment project which would to a large extent involve assets. Under this assumption, obtaining raw materials from a field can be analysed in a variety of exploitation systems, selecting the option which is most preferred. If there are no limits of mining and relevant data is available, some variables characterizing the field can be sometimes optimized, in particular, the size and the layer intended for exploitation. Net present value (NPV) was proposed for the economic evaluation of field exploitation in the form of updated values from the period of preparing for the exploitation, operating at full capacity, and the liquidation period. NPV is proposed because the time factor (time value of money) must be taken into account during the evaluation of the calculation of cash inflow and expenditure (and not income and expenses) and used to correspond to the company's financial liquidity. Economic efficiency regarding the exploitation of a field can be described by the formula (Wanielista 1995; Butra 2001) where:     Net present value from the period of the preparation of the field can be described by the formula wherein where:      For mining projects which exploit raw materials, a sub-account for the intermediate product or raw materials can be used for the calculation of cash inflow and expenditure, and for rolling costs in relation to the final products. A selling formula is used in the first case, usually negotiated on an external or internal market. A general selling formula for minerals, of which the value does not depend on the contained useful raw materials, can be approximately derived from the profits equation where or where:       γ  If the value of minerals depends on the contained useful raw materials, the approximate value of the minerals can be calculated from the formula where: α – content of useful ingredients in the mineral, %; ε – total yield of useful ingredient in the final process;   Given the above, cash inflow during the preparation of the field for exploitation are determined by the formula where:  Expenditure during the preparation of the field for exploitation in the where:         The discount rate can be represented by the formula where:    Net present value from the period of the exploitation of a field can be described by the formula where where:     The period of the field exploitation is represented by the formula where:   Total exploitation resources may be calculated by the formula where wherein where:       Correlation between exploitation resources and industrial resources of the field are represented by the formula where By substituting where and where:      Cash inflow from exploitation in the wherein where:     Expenditure in the period of the field exploitation in the where:    Net present value from the period of the field liquidation can be calculated by the formula wherein where:    Cash inflow in the wherein where:     Cash inflow from the liquidation of fixed assets concerning assets (e.g. machines), which will be sold or are intended to be used further. Expenditure in the where:     Below you will find an example of an economic evaluation for exploiting a field of copper ore, industrial resources Q = 1 200 000 Mg and ore mineralization α = 3.51% Cu.

At the beginning of the first year, fixed assets worth 10·10 The annual cost of depreciation was 10·10 At the end of the second year of the field preparation, fixed assets were installed ( b) income calculation (29):   c) expenditure calculation (31):  + (500 – 300)10  + (500 – 300)10 d) annual cash balances calculation (28):   e) calculation of an initial net value of the field liquidation (27):    The extraction of minerals from the exploitation field can be treated as an investment project and a standard method can be applied for its evaluation. In the field exploitation, as in many other projects, there are three periods: 1) preparing for the exploitation, especially gallery and chamber works, 2) actual exploitation and 3) field liquidation. In this way, the level of extraction of minerals is differentiated, pointing out its absence in the period of preparation and liquidation. The initial period is typically characterized by high levels of investment expenditure, and the period of liquidation is associated with large expenditures, but also with low cash inflow due to the withdrawal of equipment to other fields. Net present value was proposed for the economic evaluation of the exploitation of the fields, which is treated as the sum of the updated values of the three periods. This allows using the inflows and outflows, having a close relationship with the liquidity of companies and taking into account the time value of money. While evaluating the project exploitation field, it is recommended to limit the bill to the mining processes using conventional mineral prices, based on the price of the final product. This simplification is justified in the projects connected with raw materials because non-mining processes have a negligible impact on the operating efficiency of the field. Exploitation projects are analysed in many different exploitation systems, and if the relationship between the variables characterizing the field allow, its dimensions or the parameters of the layer intended for exploitation can be optimized.
