Various treated forms of dead Pleurotus mutilus biomass, chitin and chitosan were used for the removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The biomass was found to be as efficient as chitin and maximum yield was obtained at pH around 6. The yield was increased significantly with respect to the free matter when treatments with 0.2% glutaraldehyde or 5% NaOH were perfomed, 23, 42 and 30mg/g of dry matter respectively being obtained after 60min equilibrium time. In multi-component solutions containing Cd(II) and Zn(II) the binding capacity toward Cu(II) was reduced.Even at low concentrations, aqueous metallic species are very toxic ( A residual biomass of nonliving basidiomycetes Metal uptake by biosorbents is often controlled by the change in chemical composition of the heterogeneous system and is therefore strongly affected by the solution pH. Consistent results were obtained in this work with In fact, tentative assignments of the biomass spectra ( Cu(II) saturation experiments on the three adsorbents, obtained within 2 Copper(II) removal by
