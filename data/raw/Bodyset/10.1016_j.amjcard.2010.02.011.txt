We used virtual histology and intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) to evaluate the relation between aortic knob calcium (AKC) and plaque components in diabetic patients. The presence of AKC was assessed by posteroanterior view of chest x-ray or fluoroscopy at the time of coronary angiography. A total of 137 de novo coronary culprit lesions in 137 consecutive diabetic patients were studied and coronary plaque components were analyzed using VH-IVUS according to the presence (n = 45) or absence (n = 92) of AKC. Patients with AKC were significantly older (68 ± 8 vs 62 ± 9 years, p <0.001) and had significantly higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (1.97 ± 1.33 vs 0.48 ± 1.35 mg/dl, p = 0.005) compared to patients without AKC. Absolute and percent necrotic core (NC) volumes (30 ± 26 vs 20 ± 19 mm3, p = 0.003; 23.4 ± 10.3% vs 17.4 ± 8.9%, p = 0.005, respectively) and absolute and percent dense calcium (DC) volumes (17 ± 12 vs 11 ± 12 mm3, p = 0.010; 13.3 ± 7.3% vs 9.6 ± 7.9%, p = 0.011, respectively) were significantly greater in lesions with AKC compared to those without AKC. Multivariable analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.233, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.121 to 1.355, p <0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.871, 95% CI 1.090 to 2.943, p = 0.007), absolute DC volume (OR 1.020, 95% CI 1.050 to 1.178, p = 0.003), and absolute NC volume (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.057 to 1.199, p <0.001) were independent predictors of AKC. In conclusion, diabetic patients with AKC were older, had greater NC- and DC-containing plaques, and higher inflammatory status compared to diabetic patients without AKC.The aortic knob is a radiographic structure that is formed by the foreshortened aortic arch and a portion of the descending aorta. Previously 1 study reported that aortic calcium occurs 6 to 10 times more often than that of the coronary artery. This study was a retrospective, single-center study. The presence of AKC was assessed by posteroanterior view of chest x-ray or fluoroscopy at the time of coronary angiography ( Peripheral blood samples were obtained before coronary angiography using direct venipuncture. Blood samples were centrifuged, and serum was removed and stored at −70°C until the assay could be performed. Absolute creatine kinase-MB levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (Dade Behring, Inc., Miami, Florida). Cardiac-specific troponin I levels were measured by a paramagnetic particle, chemiluminescent immunoenzymatic assay (Beckman, Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, California). Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured by standard enzymatic methods. High-sensitivity (hs) CRP was analyzed turbidimetrically with sheep antibodies against human CRP; this has been validated against the Dade-Behring method. Coronary angiogram was analyzed with a validated quantitative coronary angiographic system (Phillips H5000 or Allura DCI program, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). All preintervention gray-scale and VH–IVUS examinations were performed after intracoronary administration of nitroglycerin 200 μg. A 20-MHz, 2.9-Fr IVUS imaging catheter (Eagle Eye, Volcano Corp., Rancho Cordova, California) was advanced >10 mm beyond the lesion, and automated pullback was performed to a point >10 mm proximal to the lesion at a speed of 0.5 mm/s. Quantitative volumetric gray-scale and VH-IVUS analyses were performed across the entire lesion segment, and cross-sectional analysis was performed at minimum lumen sites and largest necrotic core (NC) sites. Conventional quantitative volumetric gray-scale IVUS analysis was performed according to the American College of Cardiology Clinical Expert Consensus Document on Standards for Acquisition, Measurement and Reporting of Intravascular Ultrasound Studies. SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois) was used for all analyses. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± 1 SD; comparisons were conducted by Student's Baseline characteristics are presented in Angiographic findings are presented in Gray-scale IVUS findings are listed in At minimum lumen sites, absolute and percent NC and DC areas were significantly greater in lesions with AKC compared to those without AKC; in contrast, percent fibrofatty area was significantly smaller in lesions with AKC compared to those without AKC ( The following variables were tested to determine independent predictors of AKC (variables with p <0.1 in univariable analysis): age, family history of coronary artery disease, troponin I, creatinine, hs-CRP, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plaque burden at minimum lumen site, and absolute NC and absolute DC volumes. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.233, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.121 to 1.355, p <0.001), hs-CRP (OR 1.871, 95% CI 1.090 to 2.943, p = 0.007), absolute DC volume (OR 1.020, 95% CI 1.050 to 1.178, p = 0.003), and absolute NC volume (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.057 to 1.199, p <0.001) were independent predictors of AKC. The present VH-IVUS study demonstrated that (1) diabetic patients with AKC were significantly older and had higher hs-CRP, (2) NC and DC components in coronary lesions were significantly greater in patients with AKC compared to those without AKC, and (3) age, hs-CRP, absolute DC volume, and absolute NC volume were independent predictors of AKC. Morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients are markedly higher compared to nondiabetic patients. The present study showed that, in addition to diabetes mellitus, the process of aging was associated with AKC. As a part of the aging process, coronary arteries are prone to medial calcification and endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, hs-CRP was an independent predictor of AKC. Previous studies have demonstrated that CRP is strongly associated with atherosclerosis measured at various sites in the arterial tree, There are several limitations to be mentioned. First, the present study is a retrospective single-center study. Second, IVUS and VH-IVUS imaging were performed at the discretion of individual operators, leading to potential selection bias. Third, heavily calcified plaques may induce an artifact regarding the codification of plaques by VH-IVUS, resulting in an increase in NC content. Diabetic patients with AKC had greater NC- and DC-containing plaques and higher hs-CRP levels compared to diabetic patients without AKC. The results of the present study suggest that diabetic patients with AKC have a greater probability of vulnerable plaque and higher inflammatory status, which can lead to acute coronary events compared to diabetic patients without AKC.
