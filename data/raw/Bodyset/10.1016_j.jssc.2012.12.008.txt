Surfaces with micrometer and nanometer sized hierarchical structures were fabricated by an one-step in situ additive controlled CaCO3 mineralization method. After chemical modification, the surfaces with various morphologies showed superhydrophobicity in different states, which could be easily adjusted by the initial supersaturation of the mineralization solution (concentration of calcium ion and poly(glutamic acid)). Generally, the “lotus state” surface which was covered by a thick layer of tetrahedron-shaped CaCO3 particles to exhibit a contact angle (CA) of 157±1° and a very low contact angle hysteresis (CAH) (roll-off angle=1°) was produced under high supersaturation. On the other hands, the petal-like surface with flower-shaped calcite spherulites was obtained in a relative low supersaturation, which showed both high CA (156±2°) and CAH (180°) in a “Cassie impregnating wetting state”.It is well known that a surface with a water contact angle (CA) near or higher than 150 It is common knowledge that many biominerals, such as diatoms, sea shells and bones of animals are natural made organic/inorganic hybrids with hierarchical structures and excellent mechanical properties In biominerals, matrix proteins typically contain 30–40% of aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues, which can interact with calcium ions and is considered to play a key role in biomineralization process. Thus, poly(aspartic acid) or poly(glutamic acid) was usually taken as organic additives in vitro CaCO Calcium chloride, Four procedures were employed to pre-treat the glass substrates before use, respectively. (1) The glass plate was washed with ethanol and then by The mineralization of CaCO A gold layer was coated on the surface of the mineralized glass plate by plasma sputtering (10 The polymorph of CaCO The in situ growth of CaCO  It is well known that the eventual morphology of the crystal relates to the degree of supersaturation of the mineralization solution, which can be regulated by ionic strength, pH value, temperature, organic additive and so on. The crystal growth of CaCO The mineralization process was intensively affected by the concentration of PGlu It was demonstrated in our case that a surface with hierarchical micro- and nanostructures (which was one of the prerequisites for the fabrication of hydrophobic surface) would be easily prepared in one step The CaCO The roll-off angle (named as ROA) is another important character of superhydrophobicity and intensively depends on the surface topology and surface energy of substrate It was obviously that the CaCO As mentioned above, superhydrophobic state was defined according to the surface topology and the contact between the water droplet and the surface of substrate After a large quantity of flower-like calcite spherulites grew on glass substrate, the surface with a CA of 156±2° was recognized as superhydrophobicity. Actually, the topology of this surface was quite similar with that of red rose petal, i.e., the 10 At last but not least, the surface with a thick layer of tetrahedron-shaped CaCO To fabricate superhydrophobic surface, a facile and low-energy-cost method This work was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
