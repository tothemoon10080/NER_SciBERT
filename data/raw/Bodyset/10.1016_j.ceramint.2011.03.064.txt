In this article, in order to obtain tetragonal nanocrystalline BaTiO3, structural investigations of mechanically activated BaTiO3 powder have been performed. A mercury porosimetry analysis and scanning electron microscopy method have been applied for determination of the specific pore volume, porosity and microstructure morphology of the samples. The lattice vibration spectra of nonactivated and activated powders, their phase composition, lattice microstrains and the mean size of coherently diffracting domains were examined by Raman spectroscopy and the X-ray powder diffraction method. The average crystal structure of obtained nanocrystalline powders, estimated from X-ray diffraction data, gave evidence of retained, but slightly sustained tetragonality of powders, even for particles as small as ∼30nm. Raman spectroscopy also gave clear evidence for local tetragonal symmetries, in particular through the presence of a band at ∼307cm−1.It is well known that advances in microelectronics and communication industries have led to substantial miniaturization of many electronic devices such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC), while the performance requirements have increased In order to produce nanocrystalline powders and improve the final properties of electroceramics, in recent years, among the other methods, high energy mechanical activation has been employed As the starting material, a high purity commercial BaTiO The influence of mechanical activation on the change of the specimen's bulk density, specific pore volume and total porosity, have been performed using the mercury porosimetry analysis. Bulk density ( The microstructure morphology of nonactivated and activated samples has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (JEOL-JSM-T20). X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the initial and activated powders were obtained in Bragg-Brentano geometry, on a Philips PW-1010 powder diffractometer, using Ni-filtered Cu K Room temperature Raman spectra of the initial and activated samples were obtained in the spectral range from 200 to 1000 In general, during mechanical activation the introduction of mechanical energy may cause numerous processes such as a refinement in crystallite size, creation and movement of structural defects, activation of phonons, amorphisation of the crystalline phase, phase transformations, order–disorder transitions and chemical reactions Our investigations showed that mechanical activation caused a significant decrease of specific pore volume ( The results obtained from mercury porosimetry analysis are in accordance with the results obtained by SEM ( Our X-ray analysis indicated that mechanical activation, in spite of powder particle diminution, did not change the tetragonal structure of the initial powder into the cubic one ( Since significant peak broadening, which is characteristic for the formation of amorphous domains, did not occurred in our diffraction patterns, we have concluded that in our case the activation time required for amorphization has not been reached, that is mechanical activation of BaTiO According to our previous investigations, the formation of uncompensated stress during mechanical activation can influence the tetragonal distortion, thus leading to modification of the phase transition temperature and electrical properties of the sintered material The results of the X-ray analysis are in accordance with those obtained by Raman spectroscopy measurements. Raman spectroscopy has been employed to determine the lattice vibrational spectra of nc-BaTiO In our investigations, four Raman peaks have been recorded and assigned to more than one phonon mode of tetragonal BaTiO Our measurements show that as the applied activation time increases, the Raman modes become broader and gradually lose their intensity ( In this article, the results of structural investigations of BaTiO The financial support from the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia through Project No. 172057 is acknowledged.
