Centrifugal high gradient magnetic separation (CHGMS) concentrates fine weakly magnetic minerals at a high selectivity, which was achieved through a magnetic matrix dynamically rotating in a magnetic field. In this work, the highly selectivity capture mechanisms of magnetic wires rotating in uniform and alternating magnetic fields were comparatively described, including their magnetic field distributions and the magnetic forces required for the capture of the wires to magnetic particles. The capture mechanism was experimentally verified with a primary ilmenite concentrate assaying 13.04% TiO2, which was produced from pulsating HGMS process. It was found that the dynamically rotating wire was able to achieve significantly improved capture selectivity, in comparison with the static (quasi-static) one; for instance, when the rotation speed of the 3.0 mm wire was increased from 15 (quasi-static) to 120 rpm (dynamic) in the uniform magnetic field, the grade of captured ilmenite particles was significantly improved from 15.98% to 23.86% TiO2. In addition, the capture characteristics of rotating wire was related to the build-up pattern of centrifugal high gradient magnetic field; for instance, when the 3.0 mm wire rotated at 120 rpm and 40 mm radius, the wire in the alternating magnetic field produced a magnetic product with a high TiO2 grade of 29.86% at the expense of slightly reduced capture mass weight, and this grade was significantly superior to that (23.72% TiO2) produced from the uniform magnetic field. The conclusions from this investigation would provide valuable foundations for the development and application of CHGMS method.High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) is achieved through a magnetic matrix, which generates a magnetic field gradient in the vicinity of magnetic wires in the background magnetic field of a HGMS separator, and consequently produces a sufficiently powerful magnetic force to capture the magnetic fines from flowing fluid ( Such a limitation in the applications of the separators listed above was mainly attributed to the capture characteristics of a static matrix used in these separators ( The use of a dynamic matrix in the HGMS process provides a means to meet these requirements. It has been reported by Although the rotation of matrix, as a newly established dynamic model, achieved a high capture selectivity, much less is known about its capture characteristics. This, however, has been one of the critical issues in the development of CHGMS separators. In this work, the capture characteristics of cylindrical magnetic wires rotating in uniform and alternating magnetic fields were comparatively described and experimentally investigated, using a magnetic capture set-up and the cyclic pilot-scale CenMag100 CHGMS separator, for the capture of fine ilmenite. The magnetic capture set-up ( In the uniform magnetic field, an average magnetic induction of 0.4 T is generated. But in the alternating magnetic field, the direction of magnetic induction is closely related to its position, as illustrated in Consider that the magnetic field distribution will not be affected by the rotating wire in the fields. When the wire rotates in the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic lines accumulate in the wire in the direction of magnetic induction, forming two attractive regions on the wire surface, where the magnetic induction is significantly increased as shown in A primary ilmenite concentrate was used for the magnetic capture investigation. The material is smaller than 100 µm and 76.83% by mass weight is smaller than 74 µm; and, the main non-magnetic components in the material are SiO It is particularly noted that the concentrate was typically collected from the pulsating HGMS process, which was used to rough the ilmenite tailings from Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company of Sichuan province in China. Single magnetic wires were used in the magnetic capture set-up and in the CHGMS separator, to allow for the direct observations to the capture characteristics of the wires, and for the precise mass measurement of magnetic particles captured onto the wires. It is particularly noted that in the CHGMS separator, magnetic wires was inserted in the rotating matrix at a sufficiently large spacing to avoid the magnetic coupling effect between the wires, so that the magnetic capture of the wires to ilmenite particles was achievable, as we can see in For the magnetic capture in uniform magnetic field, the magnetic wires were fixed in the set-up through a converter, as shown in For the capture process in alternating magnetic field, the matrix inserted with magnetic wires was fixed in the CHGMS separator through converter and connector. As shown in The main operating parameters of the capture set-up and the separator were listed in In this section, the magnetic capture of a cylindrical wire rotating in the uniform magnetic field was firstly described. From In addition, when the wire rotates in the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic force acting onto the magnetic particles is generally in the induction direction. But, the friction force, hydrodynamic drag and centrifugal force alternate with the rotation of wire, which further contributes to the tumbling and sliding of magnetic particles on the wire surface. This tumbling and sliding effect produces a relaxing effect on the particles, facilitating the release of non-magnetic particles from the magnetic deposits captured on the wire surface, as shown in However, when the magnetic wire rotates in the alternating magnetic field, the magnetic particles reciprocates on the wire surface, and they tumble on the surface at a much higher frequency than that in the uniform magnetic field, as the direction of magnetic induction alternates as shown in In the uniform and alternating magnetic fields, we suppose a weakly magnetic particle of The centrifugal force acting onto the particle in the radial direction is: The hydrodynamic drag When In this investigation, the roundabout velocity of slurry over the rotating wire was firstly simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics, and then the relative velocity between the wire and slurry was determined, with results shown in It can be seen from However, the friction force acting onto the particle depends on the form of magnetic field, and in the uniform field it is written as according to In the alternating field as shown in In the uniform magnetic field, the particle will be captured onto the wire if only the following relationship is met ( And in the alternating field, it is ( In the uniform magnetic field, the magnetic particles will be mostly captured on the upper ( In the alternating magnetic field, the position angle We combine Eqs. And in the alternating magnetic field, they are: It is clear from Eqs. From the above comparative discussions, the capture characteristics of a magnetic wire to magnetic particles in the CHGMS process significantly depends on the build-up pattern of centrifugal high gradient magnetic field, and consequently the pattern significantly determines the CHGMS performance as recently reported by Under the operating parameters shown in The most important discovery of this investigation lies in the fact that the dynamic wire achieved the significantly improved capture selectivity (grade of magnetic product), at a reduced capture capacity. For instance, when the rotation speed of 3.0 mm wire was increased from 15 rpm (quasi-static) to 120 rpm (dynamic), the TiO These capture characteristics discussed above were confirmed by the accumulation photos of ilmenite particles onto 6.0 mm diameter wire, as shown in In the theoretical discussions section, it was concluded that the wire rotating in the alternating magnetic field would produce different capture characteristics from those rotating in the uniform magnetic field. Therefore, the capture characteristics of 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm diameter wires rotating in the alternating magnetic field were comparatively investigated, at 40 mm (0.35 T magnetic induction) and 43 mm (0.4 T magnetic induction) radiuses, respectively, as shown in From Meanwhile, it was found that the wires rotating at 43 mm radius have produced smaller mass weights for magnetic product, with slightly higher TiO As we have discussed in the theoretical section, the higher capture selectivity of the alternating magnetic field was resulted from the higher-frequent tumbling of magnetic particles on the surface of rotating wire. However, we have also noticed that the alternating magnetic field has produced slightly smaller mass weights for magnetic product, than those in the uniform magnetic field as shown in It becomes apparent that the dynamic capture pattern from the rotating magnetic wire, both in the uniform and alternating magnetic fields, is capable of producing a much higher capture selectivity, than that from the static pattern, which were early reported (  The rotating dynamic wire achieves significantly superior capture selectivity to that of static one, and the rotation speed of wire in magnetic field dominates the capture characteristics. In the present investigation, the 3.0 mm diameter wire rotating at 43 mm radius and 120 rpm speed in the uniform magnetic field produced a magnetic product assaying 23.86% TiO The build-up pattern of centrifugal high gradient magnetic field has a significant effect on the capture characteristics of rotating wires, and consequently on the CHGMS performance. In this investigation, the wire rotating in the alternating magnetic field produced higher grade magnetic products than those in the uniform magnetic field, at the expense of reduced capture mass weight, and its capture characteristics was more sensitive to the rotation speed of wires. It is shown that the separation performance of the innovative CHGMS method could be significantly improved by optimizing the build-up pattern of centrifugal high gradient magnetic field, and the conclusions from this investigation would provide valuable insights for the development and application of CHGMS method.
