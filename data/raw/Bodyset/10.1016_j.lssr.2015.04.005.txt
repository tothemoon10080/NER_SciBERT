The study describes the process of organic waste mineralization in an H2O2 aqueous medium activated by alternating current, which is intended to enhance the cycling rates in closed life support systems (CLSS) for space missions. The focus of this study is the relationship between the energy consumption and duration of the process and oxidation level of organic wastes on the one hand and the frequency and waveform of the electric current activating H2O2 decomposition, on the other. Energy consumption and duration of the complete waste mineralization process have been reduced by about 17–18%. A physical model of the process and the applicability of the results for both space and terrestrial purposes have been discussed.Closed life support systems for long-duration space missions are being constructed in many countries ( Over the past 15 years, researchers of the Institute of Biophysics SB RAS have made substantial progress toward a solution of this problem. One of the major achievements has been the development of an efficient physicochemical method of liquid-phase oxidation of human wastes and inedible plant biomass (wet combustion) ( However, the process of organic waste oxidation in the reactor of the physicochemical system has not been properly optimized yet. Among other things, this process may be considerably influenced by the frequency and waveform ( In this study, we used the method of “wet combustion” of organic wastes in the H Approaches used to determine the optimal frequency and waveform of the current activating H At 35 Hz, the gas release rate was twice higher than at 50 Hz; when the sinusoidal current waveform was replaced by the meander current, the gas release rate increased by about 10%. Based on these data, in this study, we estimated the effects of electric current parameters in four modes: 1) at 50 Hz sinusoidal current; 2) at 50 Hz meander current; 3) at 35 Hz sinusoidal current; and 4) at 35 Hz meander current. Comparison of mineralization processes at different parameters of the activating current was done in a laboratory reactor that contained 1.25 L of the solution (2.2 L total volume), with the voltage of a preset frequency and waveform supplied from the system consisting of a G3-112 9 generator (Russia) and a DiGi 1050 amplifier (China). The use of the frequency optimization method was described in more detail in Reaction rate was controlled by varying the voltage supplied to the electrodes. The process occurred in three phases: 1) initiation by high voltage (80 V) to speed up the reaction rate; 2) sustaining the process at a voltage reduced to 50 V, to avoid uncontrollable foaming, which could cause a reactor breach; and 3) a voltage increase to 80 V to accelerate the decomposition of H The amount of H Oxidation of organic waste in H In all experiments, we used identical amounts of H Energy consumption by the complete process of activation was calculated by using the formula Two series of experiments were carried out to study the effects of electric current parameters on the process of human waste mineralization: 1) waste mineralization in 24 h after the waste was mixed with H The accuracy of COD measurement was within the range of 10%; the difference in energy consumption and duration of the process between replicates was no more than 7%; the theoretical initial COD of the wastes was 20.1 g/L; the volume of the wastes mixed with H The values of COD of the solutions were suitable for growing plants ( As can be seen from the data in The accuracy of COD measurement was within the range of 10%; the difference in energy consumption and duration of the process between replicates was no more than 7%; the volume of the wastes mixed with H  As can be seen from To find an explanation of the frequency dependence of the process rate, let us consider its physical model. Specific energy The energy necessary for one molecule to be broken apart can be calculated by using the following formula:  The frequency corresponding to this energy can be calculated from the formula  Hence, During the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with the alternating electric current, we revealed the only obvious frequency, 35 Hz, that corresponded to the highest rate of H The question arises: What is the origin of the frequencies causing this conversion in the system? One of the possible explanations is that any periodic function is modeled by the Fourier series expansion. The set of frequencies of the Fourier series have different weighting factors: some frequencies may be actually absent (with factors equal to 0), while other frequencies may have peaks where the factors may show resonance behavior. This may be an explanation of our case, with the frequency of 35 Hz. The search for the higher resonance frequencies of the Fourier series that would correspond to that conversion may be the subject of a future study. In principle, by applying the current of a certain frequency to H  Although no time and energy saving is achieved under optimal parameters when the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and wastes is kept over long time, long-term storage of wastes in a CLSS may be inadvisable. Firstly, organic waste and H Wet combustion of organic waste in hydrogen peroxide occurs via chain reactions of oxidation of organic compounds by OH• groups. Based on the mechanism of chain reactions ( In the full cycle of waste oxidation, no differences are observed between the effects of different waveforms of the electric current, but the effectiveness of the process tends to increase when the meander current is used. The reason for this may be that under the meander current, periodic changes in the direction of the current occur sharply and the amplitude remains unchanged, while under the sinusoidal current, this change occurs smoothly, with the amplitude of the current regularly increasing and decreasing. Thus, under the meander current, the H The efficiency of H The experiments showed that in a small volume ( The study was supported by the grant of the
