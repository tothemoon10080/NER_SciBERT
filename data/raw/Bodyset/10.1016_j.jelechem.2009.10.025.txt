The anodic oxidation of a real carwash wastewater has been comparatively studied using lead dioxide (PbO2) and boron-doped diamond (BDD) anodes in an electrolytic flow cell. The influence of several operating parameters such as current (from 1A to 3A), liquid flow rate (from 100 to 300dm3
                     h−1) and temperature (25°C and 40°C) on the performance of both systems with a stainless steel cathode has been studied and the energy consumption has been also evaluated. Surfactants concentration and COD have been monitored during the treatment. Galvanostatic electrolyses always lead to complete COD removal due to the high amounts of effective hydroxyl radicals generated from water oxidation at each anode and the COD removal rate increases with rising applied current and liquid flow rate, while it as almost unaffected by temperature. The performance of the BDD anode is always better than that of PbO2, requiring shorter electrolysis time to reach overall mineralization, thus leading to remarkably higher current efficiency and lower specific energy consumption, that was 375kWhm−3 and 770kWhm−3 for BDD and PbO2, respectively.The continuous population growth and the increased agriculture and industrial activities rise the demand for water and motivate to look for alternative water sources, such as the reuse of purified wastewater. Car washing services are among the activities that consume large capacities of fresh water and could have benefits from wastewater recycling. In fact, average water consumption per car wash installation is 400 The composition of the wastewater generated from washing vehicles is complex since it may contain detergents used in the washing process, high levels of oils, grease, gasoline residues, metals, organic matter and particles such as dust, carbon and salt, and therefore its treatment is difficult Membrane processes were also proposed for the treatment of carwash wastewaters In this context electrochemical methods can be a promising alternative to traditional processes for the treatment of carwash wastewaters. So far, many papers reported that electrochemical treatment has been applied successfully for the complete oxidation of various organic pollutants, including surfactants, oils, grease, gasoline residues The wastewater was collected from the top of the settling tank in an automatic carwash installation situated in Genoa (Italy). In order to remove the suspended solids that influence the electrochemical process, the effluent was subjected to a filtration pre-treatment using a 230-mesh screen. The characteristics of the wastewater, after the filtration, are presented in Bulk electrochemical oxidations in batch under steady conditions were conducted using an undivided electrolytic flow cell under galvanostatic conditions. The carwash wastewater was stored in a thermostated glass reservoir of 0.4 The deposit of lead dioxide was made by electrochemical oxidation of an aqueous 0.1 The boron-doped diamond (BDD) thin-film electrode was supplied by CSEM (Centre Swiss d’Electronique et de Microtechnique, Neuchatel, Switzerland). It was synthesized by the hot filament chemical vapour deposition technique (HF-CVD) on single-crystal During the experiments, samples were drawn in the bulk of the reservoir at different times and analysed. The mineralization of the carwash wastewater was followed by the decay of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and the concentration of surfactants, measured spectrophotometrically using a Dr. Lange LASA50 system. The current efficiency (C.E., in %) at a given time The specific energy consumption ( The concentration of lead ion in the wastewater during the electrochemical degradation was measured using a Varian AA 240 FS Atomic Absorption Spectrometer. In order to find the best condition for the anodic treatment of the carwash wastewater, assays with PbO Results clearly indicate that the highest COD removal rate is achieved at 3A because of there is a greater charge passing into the cell that favors the electrogeneration of more hydroxyl radicals, according to Eq. For a recirculation rate of 300 In The effect of the flow-rate during oxidation with PbO The treatment of the carwash wastewater was also carried out at 25 and 40 It was observed (data not shown) that changes in temperature have only a slightly influence on oxidation rate, since the COD removal after 10 In fact, electrolysis with PbO The main drawback of PbO The influence of the current density on the COD during the electrochemical oxidation of the carwash wastewater at BDD anode is shown in The influence of the flow-rate on the oxidation using the BDD anode was studied in the range 100–300 The effect of temperature was also studied using the BDD anode and, as in the case of PbO Comparison of the trend of COD and surfactant concentration obtained during the treatment of the carwash wastewater with BDD and PbO For large application, it is also very important to estimate the treatment costs, and thus The experimental results indicated that real carwash wastewaters can be treated in an electrolytic flow cell with a PbO Moreover, even using BDD anode in the optimum tested conditions, the energy consumption was too high for practical applications of electrochemical oxidation as the only treatment process of carwash wastewaters. However, the good removal efficiency suggests the possibility of using electrochemical oxidation as refining technology in an integrated process consisting in an electrochemical coagulation followed by the electrochemical oxidation with BDD anode.
