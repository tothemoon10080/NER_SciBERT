The aim of this research was to apply Box–Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM) for grinding modeling of some copper sulphide ores. In the present work, the effects of some key grinding parameters such as ball size (20–40mm), grinding time (10–30min), solids content (65–80%), and also ore work index (12–15.4kWh/t) on the grinding of some copper sulphide ore were investigated. Product 80% passing size (d80) was defined as process response.
                  Grinding experiments were designed and executed by a laboratory ball mill. These experiments were conducted on two feed sizes (480 and 1000μm). Predicted values of response obtained using model equation were in good agreement with the experimental values (R2 values were 0.997 and 0.996 for d80 of 480 and 1000μm feed sizes respectively).
                  The effect of parameters was explained as bellow:

                           There was no effect of feed size on the order of effective parameters but increasing feed size had effect on the interaction of variables.The d80 of product was decreased with increasing solids content from 65 to 71%. The relation between work index and also ball size with d80 were linear over the studied range. The effect of ball size and also grinding time on d80 was more at lower values of solids content compared to higher values of solids content at studied levels.

There was no effect of feed size on the order of effective parameters but increasing feed size had effect on the interaction of variables. Ball mills are usually the largest energy consumers within a mineral concentrator. Therefore, an efficient use has a great impact on performance and cost implications. Comminution is responsible for 50% of total mineral processing cost. In today's global markets suffering from the world crisis, mining groups are trying to optimize mill performances by mainly reducing production costs. Successful grinding with ball mills depends on the selection of suitable operating conditions. Therefore, it is important to determine the operating parameters at which the response reaches its optimum. The optimum could be either a maximum or a minimum of a function of the design parameters In the literature, there are many studies on the operating parameters affecting the grinding performance of ball mills The solids content of the pulp is a very important factor in wet grinding systems due to its direct influence on he ground product size. The fine particles present/produced during grinding cause high pulp viscosity and reduce the grinding performance. The pulp density of the feed should be as high as possible, consistent with ease of flow through the mill. It is essential that the balls are coated with a layer of ore; too dilute a pulp increases metal-to-metal contact, leading to increased steel consumption and reduced efficiency. Ball mills should operate between 65 and 80% solids by weight, depending on the ore The general practice for determining the important process parameters for grinding is by varying one parameter and keeping the others at a constant level. This is the one-variable-at-a-time technique. The major disadvantage of this technique is that it does not include interactive effects among the variables and, eventually, it does not depict the complete effects of various parameters on the process It is essential that experimental design methodology is a very economical way for extracting the maximum amount of complex information, a significant experimental time saving factor and moreover, it saves the material used for analyses and personal costs as well Recently different methods of DOE have been specifically applied for modeling of process parameters in mineral processing systems The main purpose of grinding is treating the particles for extraction process by reducing their size. Reduction ratio is a determining factor in mill efficiency evaluation, which can show how efficiently the energy is consumed. A higher reduction ratio can signal a more efficient milling in progress. The 80% passing size (D80) of product has been considered for the response of different grinding processes Therefore, the main objective of this research was first to establish a functional relationship between three grinding variables (ball size, grinding time and solids content) and ore work index with the grinding response (d80 of product), using a statistical technique. Box–Behnken design was used to determine significant factors that affect the grinding of some copper sulphide ores and to develop quadratic mathematical model for the optimization of the process. The second purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of increasing feed size on the grinding modeling process of some copper sulphide ores. RSM is a collection of statistical and mathematical methods that are useful for the modeling and analyzing engineering problems. In this technique, the main objective is to optimize the response surface that is influenced by various process parameters. RSM also quantifies the relationship between the controllable input parameters and the obtained response surfaces The design procedure for RSM is as follows Performing a series of experiments for adequate and reliable measurement of the response of interest. Developing a mathematical model of the second-order response surface with the best fit. Determining the optimal set of experimental parameters that produce a maximum or minimum value of response. Representing the direct and interactive effects of process parameters through two and three-dimensional (3-D) plots. If all variables are assumed to be measurable, the response surface can be expressed as follows: The goal is to optimize the response variable ( Box–Behnken factorial design was chosen to find out the relationship between the response function (d80) and four variables (ball size, grinding time, solids content and ore work index) on copper sulphide ore grinding. These variables were changed during the tests with respect to the Box–Behnken experimental design, whereas the other operational parameters of grinding were kept constant (feed amount, ball charge, mill speed). Usually a second-order model (Eq. For this study, materials (copper sulphide ore) were sampled from the feed in Sungun copper concentrator plant. Three different samples with different hardness were selected for the experiments. The ore was crushed in a laboratory scale jaw crusher and roll crusher successively. The d80 of ore reached to 480 As a base for this study, standard Bond grindability tests were initially done and Bond work index (Wi) values were calculated for samples from the Eq. Mineralogical composition of the ore samples were also analyzed using XRD and the results were presented in Batch grinding tests were carried out using a 25.8 The maximum ball size for plant ball mill calculated from Bond formula (Eq. To apply an average size of 30 The amount of feed was set at 1175 These experiments were conducted for the same 3 sample with providing d80 of 1000 Using the Box–Behnken experimental design method, 29 sets of tests with appropriate combinations of ball diameter ( The results inserted to DX8 software and a quadratic model among several models were chosen and fitted to the results. From the experimental parameters in Model equation for f80 of 480 Model equation for f80 of 1000 In these models, all variables are in coded values and The correlation between the observed and predicted results using above mentioned models were shown in The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the model 1 were shown in The results of ANOVA for the model 2 were shown in The main effects of variables on response for two feed sizes were presented in As it can be seen from As it was indicated, the relation between ball size and d80 was completely linear over the studied range. The d80 of product was decreased with decreasing ball size, which reflects an increasing effect of surface area. The effect of grinding time on d80 at lower values was more compared to that of higher values of grinding time at studied levels. At lower values of time the particles was more coarser compared to higher values of grinding time. It is indicated that the effect of time on d80 at lower values was high. A very small effect of solids content on d80 was observed at values of 65–72.5%. The d80 of product was decreased with increasing solids content from 65 to 71%, but d80 was considerably increased with increasing solids content at values more than 71%. Also, the relation between work index and d80 was linear over the studied range. It was obvious that the d80 of product was decreased with decreasing Wi of ore. In order to gain a better understanding of the interaction effects of these grinding variables on d80, the predicted models were illustrated in The interaction effects of ball size and solids content on d80 of product were shown in The combined effect of grinding time and solids content was shown in Therefore, the middle values of solids content resulted effective grinding of particles. The abrasion of balls was increased at lower values of solids content. Also, the detachment of particles among the balls was decreased at higher values of solids content so the grinding of particles was decreased. There is no interaction between grinding time and solids content at 1000  There is no effect of feed size on the order of effective parameters but increasing feed size had effect on the interaction of variables. For the feed size of 480 The order of interaction parameters for 480 The interaction parameters for f80 of 1000 Also, the interaction between grinding time and solids content was not seen at 1000 This study demonstrates that the RSM can be successfully used for the determination of ball mill parameters on grinding of some copper sulphide ores. Also, it is an economical way of obtaining the maximum amount of information in a short period of time and with the fewest number of experiments. The main objective of this research was first to establish a functional relationship between three grinding variables (ball size, grinding time and solids content) and ore work index with the grinding response (d80 of product), using a statistical technique. Box–Behnken design was used to determine significant factors that affect the grinding of some copper sulphide ores. The second purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of increasing feed size on the grinding modeling of some copper sulphide ores. Grinding experiments were designed and executed by a laboratory ball mill and the DX8 software was used to analyze the results of the experiments. These experiments were conducted on 2 feed sizes (480 and 1000 Predicted values of response obtained using model equation were in good agreement with the experimental values (R According to DX8 software, it was concluded that the effects of the studied parameters follow the order: grinding time ( The effect of parameters was explained as below: The effect of grinding time on d80 at lower values was higher compared to that of higher values of grinding time at studied levels. The d80 of product was decreased with increasing solids content from 65 to 71%, but d80 was considerably increased with increasing solids content at values more than 71%. The d80 of product was decreased with decreasing ball size, which reflects an increasing effect of surface area. The relation between work index and also ball size with d80 were linear over the studied range. The effect of ball size on d80 was higher at lower values of solids content compared to higher levels of solids content at studied levels. Grinding time is more effective on d80 at lower values of solids content. The maximum effects of ball size and also grinding time on d80 were obtained at middle values of solids content (almost 70%). It was obvious that d80 was decreased with increasing grinding time and decreasing work index, but the effect of grinding time on d80 was higher at lower values of work index rather than higher values. There was no effect of feed size on the order of effective parameters but increasing feed size had effect on the interaction of variables. For feed size of 480 Results suggested that Box–Behnken design and RSM could be efficiently applied for modeling of ball milling system of some copper sulphide ores.
