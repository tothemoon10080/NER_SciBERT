               Proximal humerus fractures that interrupt the blood supply to the humeral head are currently considered an indication for shoulder replacement. The use of hemiarthroplasty is logical in this situation, but analysis of its functional results and complications has made it possible to identify several pejorative factors, and this has resulted in reconsidering the indications for hemiarthroplasty. Rigorous assessment of the patient health status and of the type of fracture is necessary before rejecting conservative treatment or internal fixation. The results of hemiarthroplasty are mostly determined by adhesion to technical requirements, the main goal of which is to achieve a stable and anatomical re-fixation of the tuberosities, in order to restore a normal shoulder function. Adjustment of the prosthesis height and retroversion, reduction and fixation of the tuberosities and appropriate postoperative management are critical steps in the procedure. Recent development in the design of prostheses specifically intended for fracture treatment should improve the results. The reverse prosthesis has been suggested as an alternative for fractures in the elderly. Whatever the design of the prosthesis, shoulder hemiarthroplasty for fractures is a demanding procedure and it will have a durable impact on shoulder function.
