In many industrial liquid filtration applications filter media can be subjected to a severe abrasive loading that can limit their operating lifetime, and therefore result in increased plant downtime and reduced process efficiency. Madison Filter Ltd, UK, has developed a solution to such abrasion problems. Tuf-Texâ„¢ is a patented treatment that can be applied to standard textile based filter media to increase abrasion resistance. Professor Richard Lydon, Richard Allan & Joseph Johnson discuss the treatment technology and present both laboratory and field performance data.
