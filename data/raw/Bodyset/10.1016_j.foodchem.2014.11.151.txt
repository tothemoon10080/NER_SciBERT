Black mulberry fruit is processed to juice at significant scale in Turkey. The effect of industrial-scale juice production on black mulberry antioxidants was evaluated using samples collected from the main steps of processing; including the selection of fruits, washing, mechanical milling, mashing, cold pressing, pasteurization, and filling-packing. Two major anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside), two phenolic acids (3- and caffeoylquinic acid) and 3 flavonols (rutin, quercetin-3-glucoside, and quercetin-malonyl-glucoside) were identified using LC–QTOF–MS and were quantified using HPLC. Approximately, 60–70% of the fruit anthocyanins were retained in the final juice, which also contained high levels of caffeoylquinic acids, relative to the fruit. Mashing and pressing were the steps which were effective for the recovery of fruit polyphenolics into the juice fraction. Moreover, an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model, applied to determine the effect of processing on the bioavailability of mulberry antioxidants, indicated a higher anthocyanin bioavailability for the fruit matrix than for the juice matrix.Epidemiological and experimental studies revealed a positive correlation between the consumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a reduced risk of certain chronic diseases. This could partly be attributed to the presence of antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds, in such a diet ( Black mulberry ( Mulberry ( A relevant issue for fruit processing is how much of a nutrient is recovered during processing. An even more important parameter is the effect of processing on bioavailability in different matrices. Bioactive compounds must be bioavailable (i.e. effectively absorbed from the gut into the circulation and be delivered to the appropriate location within the body) in order to achieve any health beneficial effects ( In the study represented here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of industrial-scale juice production on black mulberry antioxidants. For this purpose, samples were collected from each step of juice processing and these were subjected to spectrophotomeric, HPLC-based, and LC–QTOF–MS-based quantitative and qualitative analyses in order to monitor the changes in total antioxidant levels, as well as in individual phenolics. Moreover, we applied an Black mulberries were processed into juice in a fruit juice factory (Elite Naturel, Ankara, Turkey) in 2012, according to the flow sheet represented in Moisture content of the samples was determined according to the ‘‘Turkish Standard 1129-ISO 1026 method” ( The sample extracts, which were used in spectrophotometric assays, were prepared in triplicate, as described previously by For the analysis of individual phenolics by targeted HPLC and untargeted LC–QTOF–MS based measurements, 0.4 The total phenolic (TPC) content of extracts was determined by Folin–Ciocalteau method modified from The total flavonoid content (TFC) was determined according to the method detailed by The monomeric anthocyanin (TMA) content was determined according to the pH differential method ( The total antioxidant capacities (TAC) of the sample extracts were evaluated using four The targeted quantification of black mulberry phenolics was performed according to the method described by Identification of black mulberry phenolics was performed by an LC–PDA–QTOF–MS system, using the same chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions as described before by For the determination of the free soluble polyphenols in black mulberry fruit and juice samples, which might be potentially available for uptake under GI digestion conditions, an All analyses were performed with three technical and three biological replicates. Data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software (version 11.5, SPSS Inc.) for the analysis of variance (ANOVA), based on The moisture contents of the black mulberry juice processing samples ranged from 67.4% to 88.4%. Processing of the fresh fruit into the final juice resulted in a significant increase (approximately 21%) in moisture content ( The results obtained for the spectrophotometric measurements were calculated and compared on a dry-weight basis. The concentrations of total phenolics (TPC) and total flavonoids (TFC) significantly decreased by 24.9% and 40.7% following the milling process as compared to the fresh black mulberries, respectively ( Throughout juice processing, the changes in total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and polymeric color (PC) were evaluated. While the milling step did not change the TMA level found in the black mulberry fruit ( The increases/decreases observed in TMA levels following the different steps of juice processing coincided with corresponding decreases/increases in percent PC. The percent PC decreased by 22.6% – from 33.6% in fresh fruit to 26.0% in final pasteurized juice – during juice processing. This could be the result of the removal of the polymeric anthocyanins with the press cake waste (58.5% polymeric color) ( The four different assays used for measuring the TAC indicated similar changes for the applied steps during juice processing ( To identify the major black mulberry phenolics, LC-MS analysis was performed on the methanolic extracts of the fruit and the juice samples. Two anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (peak #1, [M+H] A targeted HPLC method was subsequently used to quantify these compounds in 3 representative samples of juice processing, including the fresh fruit, the final (pasteurized) juice, and the press cake waste ( To determine the effect of In this current study, the effects of juice processing steps from an industrial-scale black mulberry juice production, on black mulberry polyphenols were evaluated using a range of spectrophotometric methods, HPLC-PDA and LC–QTOF–MS analyses and an Throughout juice processing, the milling step was determined to lead to considerable losses (25–50% loss, on dry weight basis) in TPC, TFC, and TAC (except for ABTS assay) ( The subsequent mashing and pressing steps resulted in significant increases in TPC (36% increase), TFC (14% increase), TMA (188% increase) ( The final pasteurization step applied to the initial (pressed) juice sample did not change the levels of TPC or TFC significantly ( As a result, the concentrations determined for the TPC, TFC, TMA, and TAC were all significantly higher in the final pasteurized black mulberry juice sample as compared to the starting raw fruit material ( The analysis of individual black mulberry phenolics, using LC–MS and HPLC, indicated the anthocyanin metabolites, including cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, as being the major flavonoid group in black mulberry fruit. However, the recovery of these compounds during juice processing was lower (approximately 65%) as compared to the recovery of flavonols (>85%) (except for quercetin-3-rutinoside) and phenolic esters (>400%) ( Results obtained for HPLC quantification of individual black mulberry anthocyanins showed a decrease in anthocyanins from fruit to juice ( Another finding was that the final black mulberry juice had substantially higher levels of phenolic acids (approximately 4-fold higher) compared to the raw fruit ( The major finding observed from the The evaluation of the effects of individual processing steps during black mulberry juice processing revealed that the anthocyanins were the major antioxidants in raw fruit, whereas phenolic acids and anthocyanins constituted the major phenolics in the processed juice. Mashing and pressing were the most efficient steps that provided more than 50% of fruit polyphenols to be recovered in the juice fraction. During The evaluation of the effects of individiual processing steps during black mulberry juice processing revealed that the anthocyanins were the major antioxidants in raw fruit, whereas the phenolic acids with anthocyanins constituted the major phenolics in processed juice. Mashing and pressing were the most efficient steps that provided more than 50% of fruit polyphenols to be recovered into the juice fraction.
