It is now a widely accepted fact that oxidized graphene surfaces are populated, to a greater or lesser extent, with epoxide groups. And yet the origin of these groups has heretofore been mysterious. We report the results of a computational (DFT) analysis of this issue carried out by combining the theoretical and experimental knowledge of three seemingly unrelated fundamental processes: (i) formation of pentagon–heptagon pairs (or Thrower–Stone–Wales defects); (ii) surface diffusion of oxygen atoms on the basal plane; and (iii) graphene unzipping by oxygen insertion. We provide thermodynamic and kinetic evidence for the hypothesis that a key intermediate step in the stabilization of free adjacent zigzag sites – before they reconstruct to form an armchair site or become quinone surface functionalities upon dissociative O2 chemisorption – is the formation of an epoxide group in the basal plane. The presence of epoxide groups on the graphene surface is therefore a result of spillover of edge oxygen (e.g., nondissociatively adsorbed O2 on carbene-type sites), mechanistically reminiscent of the extensively investigated migration of carbon in the conversion of phenyl carbene to bicycloheptatriene.The objective of this report is to offer a resolution to a long-standing fundamental paradox regarding the crucial influence of ubiquitous oxygen on the structure and properties of sp The practical implications of this key mechanistic issue range from the structure and properties of graphite (graphene) oxide The postulate that can account for such wide-ranging experimental facts is based on, and indeed brings together, three seemingly unrelated fundamental processes: (a) the formation of Thrower–Stone–Wales (TSW) defects Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level – widely acknowledged to represent a judicious compromise between physical reality and computational expediency and as implemented in the commercially available Gaussian 03 software The self-consistent-field (SCF) energies of singlet/triplet transitions (Δ Analysis of the prototypical graphene edge reconstruction process shown in A mechanism similar to such carbon migration is feasible for oxygen migration as well. In fact, both have their roots in classical organic chemistry. The former is analogous to the formation of bicyclo[4.1.0.]heptatriene The presence of ether-type oxygen in graphene-based carbon materials is not as ubiquitous as that shown in It is important to point out that triplets As expected and as shown in A detailed analysis of the transition states associated with these thermodynamically feasible and experimentally supported mechanistic steps will be reported separately. Suffice it to anticipate that the activation energy for the transition from graphene Epoxide groups are formed on the basal plane as a consequence of migration (‘spillover’) of atomic oxygen from graphene edges. In particular, adjacent carbene-type sites on a zigzag edge, rather than reconstructing to an armchair-site-containing heptagon (akin to a Thrower–Stone–Wales-type defect), are susceptible to nondissociative adsorption of O Financial support for this study was provided by Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
