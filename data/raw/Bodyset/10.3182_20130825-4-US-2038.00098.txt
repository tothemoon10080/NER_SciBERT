The granulation of nickel sulphide alloys results in formation of the ultrafine structure because of their reactivity is increased in the hydrometallurgical processing. The phase composition and phase size of nickel sulphide alloys granulated was studied by X-ray and optical microscopy methods. It is shown the high cooling rate leads to the crystallization of non-equilibrium phase and dispersion of a metal component. The parameters of the electrochemical oxidation of nickel sulfide granular alloys in sulfuric acid solution were estimated. The initial potentials of phase components oxidation of nickel sulfide alloys granulated were defined. The rate of electrochemical oxidation of nickel sulfide alloys granulated is higher than that at slow-rate cooling.
