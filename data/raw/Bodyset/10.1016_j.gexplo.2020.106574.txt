Analysis of stream sediment geochemical data has undergone a series of developments during last decades. As a matter of fact, many factors can potentially influence the chemical composition of these sediments and the existing techniques are not able to fully explain compositional variations occurring along with their transport. By applying some recently developed equations, this paper takes into account the topographical relief and the morphological surface areas of outcropping lithological units to both estimate local geochemical background values and delineate promising zones in terms of mineral exploration. Specifically, through the combination of a three-dimensional sample catchment analysis with dilution correction equation, the process of delineating catchment basins featured by economically relevant Cu occurrences has been improved. The effectiveness of the technique has been evaluated through the application of the prediction-area plot obtaining better results than applying the two-dimensional approach.Stream sediment prospecting remains one of the most effective geochemical methods for mineral exploration ( Since the projected areas of two lithological units may be the same, although their actual outcropped surfaces are different, in SCBA equations, the potential discrepancies between actual and projected areas could directly affect the reliability of SCBA in delineating geochemical anomalies. In light of the above consideration, aiming at a better estimation of geochemical background values and anomalies, in a way, The present study aims at rectifying all the above reported shortcomings by introducing the True Sample Catchment Basins (TSCB) approach to determine the elemental background values on the base of the actual morphological areas occupied by lithologies upstream the outlet points across the catchments. Additionally, the dilution correction of residual values has been calculated by means of the modified equations proposed by The study area ( The elevation of the study area ranges between about 1150 and 3030 m a.s.l. and a detailed description of its geological setting can be found in For the purposes of the present study, a total number of 490 stream sediment samples, as a subset of a geochemical exploration survey completed in the Varzaghan area by Geological Survey of Iran in 2007, was used. Selected samples cover an area of 1170 km For each sampling site, the representative sample was obtained by mixing 4 aliquots collected in four different times during a year (one specimen per season). The average weight of each aliquot was about 1 kg. Following sieving, the <80 mesh (180 μm) fraction of the sample was collected and, subsequently, pulverized to a 200 mesh size (75 μm). The final weight of the composite sample was reduced to 30 g by an 8 folds quartering. To determine the amount of Cu in sample, about 1 g of each sample was dissolved in 15.0 mL of Aqua Regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid 1:3 By performing univariate statistical analysis, Cu distribution resulted to be highly skewed (asymmetrical) with a pronounced peak toward the lowest part of the range ( Stream sediment geochemical data can be representative of both upstream lithological units and anomalous sources ( In fact, SCBA takes into account the area upstream of a sediment sample location, which is capable to affect the chemical composition of the sample itself ( If Since the multiple regression is sensitive to the small area sizes of lithological units and needs a sampling scheme with a high spatial density ( The geochemical signals originated by mineral deposits are diluted through mixing with sediments originated from not-enriched terrains. To enhance these geochemical signals, the estimated background values, depending on the nature of upstream lithologies, should be subtracted from the geochemical concentrations measured at basin outlet to obtain the residual values ( The term ( By considering the fact that not all sediments originated from upstream lithological units are delivered to the outlet, In literature, the values of In this research, the values of Physiographic features of catchment basins can be used in the modeling of geochemical changes to discriminate anomalous basins ( In Eqs.  In SCBA each single catchment basin is limited upstream by the location of a stream sediment sample considered as the outlet of the next catchment. As a consequence, in this approach, the catchment basin area of each sample does not extend to its natural boundaries, except for the uppermost sample for which there is no above sample but the watershed limit ( In this paper, introducing the True Sample Catchment Basins (TSCB) approach, we propose the extension of each catchment basin as much as possible (compatibly with the geomorphological characteristics of the study area), not considering samples located upstream as a limitation ( Specifically, the TSCBs correspond with the extension of their natural boundaries and their areas were estimated by using a digital elevation model (DEM); the proportional areas of geological units ( After correction of the residual values for dilution, geochemical anomalies were identified by using fractal analysis. This approach was applied because geochemical data have a fractal nature and if multiple populations exist in a dataset they can be discriminated on the basis of their changes in fractal dimensions ( Different fractal models have been applied successfully to analyze the spatial distribution of geochemical data for anomaly delineation purposes (e.g., In this paper, the concentration-area (C-A) technique ( The C-A plots, generated by means of a least-squares regression, for Cu dilution corrected residuals ( To compare the effectiveness of the classification of maps produced for dilution correction residuals ( According to the principle that an effective anomaly delineation technique should outline reduced anomalous areas (without missing known Cu occurrences), we compared the cumulative areas of anomalous catchment basins with the overall area of the study domain finding out that, for decreasing values of n (0, −0.25, −0.5), the areas occupied by anomalous intervals tend to decrease and even more if for the same To take into account both the prediction rate and the area occupied by each interval settled up by C-A plot the graphic technique known as Prediction-Area (P-A) plot ( To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the classification of maps produced for dilution correction residuals ( Aiming at enhancing the performance of both TSCB and dilution correction of residuals to better delineate geochemical anomalies through the use of stream sediments a three-dimensional approach has been introduced with success. In fact, the use of the real morphological surface (3D) in the equations which normally use areas of projected surfaces (2D) allowed to delineate more effectively the anomalous catchment basins with known copper occurrences in the study area. The effectiveness of the changes made to the original 2D approach was also confirmed by the increased values of ND obtained for the TSCB 3D analysis of stream sediment data and by the reduction of the areas covered by the more anomalous intervals of the dilution corrected residuals. It is our conviction that the above achievements brought to an improved delineation of mineralization-related geochemical anomalies. As a matter of fact, the TSCB 3D can be considered as reliable tool to be used in areas with a very complex morphological surface where a big difference in terms of exposed areas can be registered if projected surfaces are incorporated, instead, in the equations for the dilution corrections of geochemical residuals.
