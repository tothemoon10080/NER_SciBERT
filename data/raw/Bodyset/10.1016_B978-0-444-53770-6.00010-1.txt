Since publication of the 4th edition of Physical Metallurgy, there have been many breakthroughs in the characterization and analysis of microstructure, and probably none more important than the rapid evolution of three-dimensional (3D) materials analyses. This chapter provides an overview of microstructure in metallic materials that captures many of these new developments, with emphasis on microstructures developed during solid-state evolution. Including all microstructural forms and elements of microstructure is well beyond the scope of a single chapter; the focus here is thus on some representative examples centered about the characterization, description, and classification of 3D solid-state metallic microstructures.Introduction 3D Microstructure and Microstructural Analyses Specific Classes of Microstructures and Microstructural Evolution Concluding Remarks Acknowledgments References GS gratefully acknowledges IT and other support from The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (TMS) for this effort; WTR acknowledges support from the U.S. Department of Energy. This chapter builds upon the excellent overview on “Microstructure” in Since publication of that 4th edition of Including all microstructural forms and elements of microstructure in metallic materials is well beyond the scope of a single chapter; the focus here is thus on providing an overview and some representative examples centered about the characterization, description, and classification of 3D solid-state metallic microstructures. The reader is referred to any number of excellent texts that describe in detail lower dimensionality elements of microstructure in metals, such as point defects (“zero-dimensional”) ( Gleiter suggested that “the microstructure of crystalline materials has been defined by the type, structure, number, shape and topological arrangement of phases and/or lattice defects which are in most cases not part of the thermodynamic equilibrium structure” ( Because of the importance and rapid growth of accurate 3D characterization and quantification techniques to understand real (not just idealized) microstructures in three dimensions ( As alluded to above, the past 15 years have seen rapid growth in the development of 3D techniques for the characterization, visualization, quantification, and modeling of 3D microstructures in materials ( Because of the importance of accurate 3D characterization and quantification in understanding and controlling (through processing) microstructures in three dimensions, an overview of the methodologies for characterizing and quantifying microstructures in 3D is provided here. This will specifically provide a foundation with examples for understanding the elements and classification of metallic microstructures discussed in Section Traditional 2D metallographic and microscopy techniques analyze single planes of observation (or very thin sections) in metallic materials, and often use quantitative stereological procedures to estimate parameters that describe 3D features of the microstructure. These techniques are especially valuable for measuring Typical 2D characterization methods include (but are not limited to) optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of a plane of polish, the more conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques that provide a projected image through a foil of material approximately 100 nm or less in thickness, and X-ray mapping techniques that are mostly limited to the surface of a material (e.g. Laue diffraction, low-energy electron diffraction, energy dispersive-based X-ray mapping). There are a number of excellent reference books on stereological methods for extracting 3D microstructural information from 2D data ( The degree of accuracy of any 3D microstructure analysis from 2D data is always limited by the size of the 2D data set and the complexity of the microstructural features being analyzed. For example, measurement of average particle size or volume fraction from 2D observations of a uniformly distributed array of spherical particles in a material can provide a reasonable estimate of the “averaged” 3D microstructural parameters. On the other hand, determining the size and shape A number of characterization techniques are now available to determine the morphology, topology, crystallography, and/or interconnectivity of metallic microstructures in three dimensions. These techniques apply over the wide range of length scales represented schematically in The remainder of this section provides an overview of the capabilities and utility of techniques for reconstructing microstructures in 3D and shows some representative examples of 3D microstructures that have been imaged, characterized, and quantified. Somewhat more depth will be provided on one methodology—serial sectioning by mechanical polishing—with which the authors have had significant experience. X-ray tomography is a well-known methodology for characterizing materials in three dimensions. Historically, it has been well suited to studying materials with large differences in absorption (which often correlates with density) between the microstructural features and the matrix within which they lie. For example, there have been many X-ray tomographic studies of voids within a metal matrix ( A second type of X-ray technique for determining 3D microstructures that is differentiated from X-ray tomography is X-ray diffraction microscopy ( Since these X-ray techniques are nondestructive, they also can be employed in combination with in situ furnaces or strain stages, or used in conjunction with ex situ techniques in which the specimen is taken back and forth between the furnace or strain device and the X-ray tomography (or X-ray diffraction microscopy) system ( 3D analyses of metallic materials by femtosecond laser sectioning is in its nascent stages, and this technique is especially suited for reconstructing large volumes of material (∼mm A thorough discussion on this topic can be found in a recent review of “3D Microstructure Representation” ( Beginning in the early 1990s, advances in computerized 3D reconstruction, image processing, and visualization algorithms and software enabled high-fidelity computer-generated reconstructions and advanced quantitative 3D analyses from serial sections of metallic microstructures. In particular, in 1994 a significant step forward was made by two sets of independent researchers ( The key steps in serial sectioning by mechanical techniques include material removal, etching (if required), imaging, placing fiducial marks, alignment of the images, optimizing the number of serial sections required, and “segmentation” of the images ( The most common method for mechanically removing material in metals and alloys is mechanical polishing, either by manual/semiautomated methods ( Various techniques have been employed for imaging the individual sections (sometimes in combination), depending on the microstructural feature(s) to be reconstructed in 3D. These include light/optical microscopy ( Some examples of 3D metallic microstructures reconstructed by serial sectioning in conjunction with mechanical polishing material removal techniques are provided in The most direct way to ensure that the images in the serial sectioning stack are properly aligned is by embedding fiducial marks that are retained from one section to the next. The two most common types of fiducial marking techniques are (1) repeated application of microhardness indents, which must be replaced often because they are polished away during the sectioning procedure ( Determining the number of sections required, and the depth between sections, is important for optimizing the time-intensive sectioning process, while at the same time guaranteeing the required amount of fidelity to properly reconstruct the features of interest ( Once the series of raw 2D images in the stack are obtained, in almost all cases image-processing techniques must be employed to clearly delineate the features to be reconstructed in 3D. This is typically referred to as “image segmentation” and often involves segmenting each 2D image into specific regions of interest (e.g. for the identification of individual grains separated by grain boundaries), but can also be applied to the entire 3D volume in certain cases. There are many algorithms and techniques that are being developed and applied to image segmentation, and this is a very active area of 3D materials analysis ( Another successful mechanical sectioning technique that has been employed to study metallic microstructures is micro milling. Serial sectioning also can be accomplished by employing the ion beam in FIB instruments to remove material between sections ( Electron tomography employing a TEM enables observation of 3D microstructures at a high spatial resolution (in the nanometer range), but it restricts the 3D observations to small volumes of material Although electron tomography has been used on biological specimens for more than 50 years ( Two common imaging strategies used for electron tomography of metallic microstructures are high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode, also known as Z-contrast imaging, and energy-filtered imaging in the TEM mode using electron energy loss spectrometry. Both approaches eliminate or greatly reduce contrast changes arising from diffraction as the sample is tilted. 3D APT ( None of the 3D characterization methods described in Section In addition to the great advances in the reconstruction, visualization, and quantitative analysis of experimental microstructures in three dimensions over the past 15 years, there has been a surge in 3D predictive modeling of microstructural evolution in which real, experimentally determined 3D microstructures are used as input for the initial conditions of the models, and/or for direct comparisons between the predicted and the experimentally determined 3D microstructures at various stages of evolution. This type of experimentally based modeling has been referred to as both “image-based” modeling ( The most common types of image-based modeling of microstructural evolution are centered about response to externally applied thermal ( Experimentally based 3D reconstructions of metallic microstructures are specifically used as input to, and/or for direct comparisons with, phase-field simulations of the evolution of such microstructures under applied thermal exposure ( Real 3D microstructures that have been imaged, characterized, and analyzed by some of the methods described in Sections In Section How is microstructure described? A first step in microstructural analysis involves selecting a method for describing the nonuniform features in the material. These features may be associated with a physical The types of microstructural descriptors that are used to describe an individual microstructural feature include composition, crystal structure, orientation/misorientation, and local properties of a given domain. These descriptors, along with some relevant parameters used to evaluate them, are summarized in Specific types of metallic microstructures within different microstructural categories associated with the formation and evolution of solid-state microstructures in metals and alloys are now considered, with an emphasis on microstructures that have been characterized and analyzed in three dimensions. It is useful to keep in mind that microstructures are often associated with specific transformations, but transformations do not produce unique microstructures; multiple paths can produce a particular type of microstructure. The internal microstructure in single-phase solid-state metals and alloys consists of grain networks composed of space-filling polyhedra, and such grain structures have been studied in considerable detail ( Coarsening of the grains in single-phase materials, more commonly called grain growth, has been a topic of considerable interest because of the strong dependence of mechanical properties on grain size. There have been many in-depth investigations of grain growth centered about both theoretical treatments and experimental studies ( The overall driving force for grain growth is the reduction in interfacial energy, and the local grain boundary curvatures and grain topologies (i.e. number of grain faces) dictate the local velocity and direction of movement of a given grain boundary. The general form for the relationship between the average perpendicular velocity of grain boundaries ( The topology of the grains is also directly related to the migration of grain boundaries, and in this regard This relationship is known as the von Neumann–Mullins law ( MacPherson and Srolovitz subsequently reported a more generalized 3D relationship between the rate of growth (or shrinkage) of the grains and their topology ( Most of the theories of grain growth (whether based on 2D or 3D grain ensembles) have been tested by comparisons with 2D data because in the past it has been difficult to obtain 3D experimental data from statistically significant samplings of grains. Advances in 3D characterization techniques described in Section Precipitate coarsening in multiphase materials, also known as Ostwald ripening, is similar to grain growth; in that the overall driving force is the reduction in interfacial energy. But in this case, in addition to the local curvature, the composition gradient and relevant diffusivities affect the local velocity of a given particle boundary during grain coarsening. The reader is referred to several review articles ( The most detailed and direct 3D observations have been in investigations by Voorhees et al. who used a serial sectioning and 3D reconstruction technique involving mechanical micro milling ( Although there have been a limited number of direct 3D observations of coarsened microstructures, further development of such experimental data is expected because it provides statistically relevant data sets of particle shape and size distributions as well as interconnectivity information critical for direct comparison with modern theories of Ostwald ripening. Martensitic transformations are considered in much more detail in many articles on the subject ( Martensitic structures in steels (i.e. ferrous martensites) have been the most widely studied, and there is a plethora of information available on the crystallography, morphology, and formation mechanism of such martensites. In ferrous martensites, the classic picture is one in which low-carbon martensite is highly dislocated and has a “lath” structure, while higher carbon martensite is typically termed “plate” martensite and is often highly twinned ( The morphology of shape memory martensite is related to the shape change associated with the structural transformation, how this strain is accommodated, the presence of plastic strain in the parent phase, and any applied stresses or elastic constraints during transformation. Martensite in shape memory alloys is reversible, and the interface separating the martensite phase from its parent phase is highly mobile. These factors lead to a variety of morphologies ranging from bulk single crystals (when a parent single crystal is transformed through the migration of a single interface) to multiple variants of laths and plates arranged in irregular patterns or highly organized periodic arrays. To date, characteristics of these martensite microstructures have been inferred from 2D data or projected information from TEM thin foils. In principle, the 3D morphology of shape memory martensite can be determined using the techniques described in Section The 3D morphology of precipitates has been assessed using multiple techniques. For comparison, In another example of 3D analyses of precipitate microstructures formed during aging, precipitate morphologies in peak-aged Al 2024 were determined with HAADF STEM tomography ( Steels (Fe–C-based alloys) represent the classic eutectoid decomposition alloy system, are ubiquitous in their engineering application throughout society, and have been studied in detail by metallurgists for more than 100 years ( The high temperature parent phase in steels is austenite and has a fcc crystal structure. In Fe–C alloys and/or plain carbon steels, upon relatively slow to intermediate cooling rates (or appropriate isothermal heat treatment conditions) the austenite decomposes to product phases of ferrite and the carbide phase, cementite. Ferrite possesses a body-centered cubic crystal structure, while cementite has a complex orhthorhombic crystal structure. In more highly alloyed steels containing elements such as Some of the most in-depth studies of 3D microstructures have been performed on proeutectoid cementite in high-carbon steels ( Full 3D reconstruction and analysis of more than 200 Widmanstatten (or elongated) proeutectoid cementite precipitates in a high-carbon Fe–C–Mn alloy have shown that although from 2D observations of single planes of polish the majority of these crystals appeared to be This indicates that the OR of such precipitates, which is presumably dictated at the nucleation stage, sets the conditions for the evolution of the 3D morphology during growth, into either the lath shape or the plate shape. Intergranular proeutectoid cementite precipitates that are predominantly confined to the austenite grain boundaries (i.e. they do not grow appreciably into the austenite matrix grains) have been shown to possess a unique 3D shape, which is not readily observable by 2D observations ( Although the most complete set of 3D observations of proeutectoid precipitates has been made for cementite in high-carbon steels ( Dube’s seminal system of morphological classification of proeutectoid ferrite ( “Degenerate ferrite” is a term coined to describe ferrite that has a mottled or degenerate appearance when observed by light microscopy, and this form of ferrite is observed in only certain alloys and temperature regimes ( Grain boundary nucleated ferrite has been studied in 3D by serial sectioning in an Fe-0.12 wt pct C-3.28 wt pct Ni alloy, revealing actual 3D morphologies that differ in various ways from the simplified versions depicted in Dube’s 2D classification system ( It is emphasized that the features discussed here are based on 3D investigations in a limited number of alloy systems. There is thus a great need for further 3D study in many more alloys and temperature ranges, in both steels and nonferrous metallic alloy systems. Lamellar microstructures develop from the formation of (usually) two phases arranged as a collection of alternating parallel plates. The morphology typically arises when one or more phases transform to two compositionally distinct product phases with the same average composition. The composition of the individual product phases complement each other in the sense that one is solute rich while the During growth of lamellar structures, the individual plates in a collection of lamella lengthen, and each plate consumes the chemical specie rejected by the adjacent phase. The close proximity of the alternating lamella reduces the distance over which solute is redistributed as the lamellar microstructure develops, and in this sense, the product phases of lamellar microstructures assist each other and grow in a cooperative fashion. The lamellar microstructure produced by eutectoid reactions is known as pearlite ( Pearlite forms as the product of eutectoid decomposition of a high-temperature parent phase into two low-temperature phases. In steels the high-temperature phase is austenite, and it transforms to alternating lamellae/plates of ferrite plus carbide (typically cementite)—see Thus, in steels, a colony of pearlite originates from a single crystal of cementite and a single crystal of ferrite. The lamellar morphology arises from branching of at least one of the phases during growth such that an entire pearlite colony consists of essentially two crystals (one for each phase). The spacing of the lamella is dependent on the temperature and alloy system, and finer spacings often lead to increased strength of this microconstituent. The growth kinetics depend upon the path for solute redistribution (i.e. volume diffusion and/or interphase boundary diffusion) and the lamellar spacing. It has also been Although these lamellar microstructures can closely resemble pearlite, the transformation mechanisms and number of phases involved differ. Rather than formation of two product phases by eutectoid decomposition (as in the case of pearlite), the cellular reaction involves the cooperative growth of crystals of one new precipitate phase and the solute-depleted matrix phase into a more supersaturated matrix. The cellular product often consumes a metastable precipitate phase that has high strain energy because of coherency. The reaction generally initiates at relatively mobile high-angle grain boundaries and produces discrete “cells” or “colonies” of the lamellar microstructure. Solute redistribution takes place along the advancing cell boundary, which in this case is also the original grain boundary at which the cellular reaction initiated ( Bainite is a term that was coined more than 50 years ago to refer to non-lamellar products of eutectoid decomposition observed in steels ( In steels, the two eutectoid phases comprising bainite are ferrite as the majority phase and some type of carbide (cementite, or some alloy carbide) as the minority phase. During early observations in steels, bainite was recognized to take on two different forms—either upper bainite or lower bainite, formed at higher and lower temperatures (both below the eutectoid temperature), respectively. Examples of these two types of bainite are presented in On the generalized definition of bainite (particularly espoused from the diffusionist viewpoint ( Although the majority of observations of these various forms of bainite have been in steels, these microstructures have been reported in other metallic systems as well, including Ti-based ( The understanding of spinodal decomposition microstructures has developed in a way somewhat different from those of other transformation products. Theoretical treatments of spinodal decomposition consider the time evolution of concentration fluctuations that have a small spatial wavelength and small concentration amplitude ( Internal microstructure controls the properties of metallic alloys, and these properties can be optimized by manipulation of the microstructure through thermomechanical processing ( Quantitative characterization of microstructure is particularly important in a relatively new thrust area in materials development and engineering referred to as Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) ( Considering the aforementioned importance of microstructure and accurate microstructural characterization in materials design, this review has provided an overview of the methodology and utility of a number of techniques for quantitatively analyzing metallic microstructures in three dimensions, as well as some specific examples of 3D microstructural data (such as morphology, spatial distribution of phases, and crystallography) in some specific classes of microstructures in metals and alloys.
