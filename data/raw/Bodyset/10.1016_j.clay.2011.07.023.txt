In this research work, ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by direct thermal decomposition method with Zn4(SO4)(OH)6·0.5 H2O as a precursor. The precursor was calcinated in air for 1h at 825°C. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), infrared spectrum (IR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD, EDS, and IR results indicated that the ZnO nanoparticles were pure. The average crystallite and particle size of the ZnO nanoparticles were estimated to be 87nm and 92nm by XRD and TEM, respectively. The SEM and TEM images showed that the ZnO nanoparticles were of spherical shape. The simplicity of the present method suggests its potential application at industrial scale as a cheap and convenient way to produce pure ZnO nanoparticles from low concentration ZnSO4 solutions.ZnO nanoparticles have been paid attention for their unique properties, such as optical transparency, electric conductivity, piezoelectricity and near-UV emission ( Na   In this study, it was shown that, ZnO nanoparticles can be produced by direct thermal decomposition method using Zn
