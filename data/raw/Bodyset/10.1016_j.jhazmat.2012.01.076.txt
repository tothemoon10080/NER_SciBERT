Cyanide tailing is a kind of solid waste produced in the process of gold extraction from gold ore. In this paper, recovery of iron from cyanide tailings was studied with reduction roasting–water leaching process followed by magnetic separation. After analysis of chemical composition and crystalline phase, the effects of different parameters on recovery of iron were chiefly introduced. Systematic studies indicate that the high recovery rate and grade of magnetic concentrate of iron can be achieved under the following conditions: weight ratios of cyanide tailings/activated carbon/sodium carbonate/sodium sulfate, 100:10:3:10; temperature, 50°C; time, 60min at the reduction roasting stage; the liquid to solid ratio is 15:1 (ml/g), leaching at 60°C for 5min and stirring speed at 20 r/min at water-leaching; exciting current is 2A at magnetic separation. The iron grade of magnetic concentrate was 59.11% and the recovery ratio was 75.12%. The mineralography of cyanide tailings, roasted product, water-leached sample, magnetic concentrate and magnetic tailings were studied by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) technique. The microstructures of above products except magnetic tailings were also analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) to help understand the mechanism.With the increasing demand both in China and abroad, Chinese gold industry has developed rapidly. The total production of gold in China added up to 340.88 Although total iron content in cyanide tailings is relatively high, its recovery has not been practiced due to high content of impurities oxides such as SiO In our group, the comprehensive utilization of cyanide tailings is the focus of our research. Based on the above descriptions of different ways of utilization of cyanide tailings, the grade of magnetic concentrate and the recovery rate of iron are lower, because of the massive existence of impurities minerals, so our innovative idea is combining the improving of the grade of magnetic concentrate with the reducing of the content of Si and Al together. In this study, recovery of iron from cyanide tailings with reduction roasting–water leaching followed by magnetic separation is investigated. The combination points are roasting, by which it can reduce hematite to magnetite, and water leaching, by which soluble substances can solve in the solution, then insoluble and nonmagnetic substances can enter into the magnetic tailings after magnetic separation. Process parameters that affect the recovery of iron are tested and optimized. The way of reduction roasting–water leaching followed by magnetic separation is demonstrated to be effective to recover iron from cyanide tailings for the first time. After the water leaching process, the nonmagnetic substances are used to recover another valuable metal of gold, and then the nonmagnetic residues can also be used to make building materials for creating more economic benefit, such as baking-free brick and cement which will be introduced in the later work. Cyanide tailings used in the study were the residual slags after extracting gold from gold-bearing ores using conventional cyanidation or roasting–cyanidation process. The main chemical composition is given in The total iron content was approximately 27.69%, but its content of SiO In order to eliminate the negative effect of carbon on iron recovery experiment, commercial analysis grade activated carbon was used as a reducing agent. The raw material was screened to the required particle size (≤74 In our experiments, all experimental data were the averages of duplicate determinations. The relative errors of the data were about 3%. Activated carbon can be used as the reductant, the reduction reaction of activated carbon was regarded as the combination of indirect reduction reaction (carbon monoxide was used as reductant) and Boudol reaction. The chemical reactions are as follows: When the equilibrium partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO The main chemical reactions occurred during the leaching process: In the water leaching process, K–Mg–Al–SiO The effect of roasting temperature on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 60 It can be seen from The effect of mass fraction of activated carbon on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:3, 750 It can be seen from The effect of roasting time on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 750 The results in The effect of ratio of sodium carbonate to cyanide tailings on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10, 750 As shown in When the amount of sodium carbonate continues to increase, another reaction can occur as follows: It means that when the amount of sodium carbonate continues to increase, more and more Na The effect of leaching time on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 750 It can be seen from The effect of leaching temperature on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 750 The results in The effect of liquid-to-solid ratio on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium sulfate and sodium carbonate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 750 It indicates that when the liquid-to-solid ratio is smaller, pulp viscosity is high, and solution is easy to reach saturation in leaching interface, preventing the leaching reactions of bounding materials. When the liquid-to-solid ratio keeps increasing, mass transfer speed is improved correspondingly and the solution materials in the liquid-to-solid interface keep speeding outside, the reactions go with the best speed. But when the liquid-to-solid ratio goes on increasing, the concentration of untreated and residual sodium carbonate in solution drops which is detrimental to the dissolution of the impurities. So, considering the grade of magnetic concentrate and recovery rate of iron, simultaneously, the optimum liquid-to-solid ratio is chosen to be 15:1. The effect of exciting current on extraction of iron was investigated under the following conditions: cyanide tailings, activated carbon, sodium carbonate and sodium sulfate at a mixing ratio of 100:10:10:3, 750 It can be seen from The roasted product prepared in optimized conditions as following: roasting temperature of 750 From  As shown in As shown in the energy spectrum ( Taking the water-leached samples for analysis, the optimum experimental conditions were as follows: the leaching temperature of 60 From  Compared the EDS patterns of roasted samples ( The magnetic concentrate was separated from water leached samples under optimized process parameters. Its XRD pattern was shown in From The SEM image of magnetic concentrate and its energy spectrum of some areas under the optimum conditions were shown in From Taking the magnetic tailings for analysis, its XRD pattern was shown in The weight percentage of main elements in original slag, roasted sample and leached sample from EDX are shown in  Major chemical compositions of cyanide tailings were Fe Activated carbon ratio, roasted temperature, roasted time, additive ratio, leaching temperature, leaching time, liquid-to-solid ratio and exciting current are the main factors which affect the iron recovery. The grade of magnetic concentrate of 65.11% Fe and iron recovery rate of 75.12% occur under the following conditions: ratio of activated carbon: cyanide tailing: sodium carbonate: sodium sulfate as 100:10:10:3, roasting at 750
