By using the digital electric drying oven and microwave drying system, experiment select different microwave power and different hot air temperature for oil shale drying. The results indicated that: microwave drying is faster than hot air drying by an order of magnitude; microwave drying of oil shale is obviously classified into three phases: warming-up, constant rate and falling-rate periods. Drying took place mainly in constant rate and falling-rate periods. Through the analysis of experimental data processing, we can see that microwave drying is not suitable for Page's model, while hot air drying using Page model is fitting.
