In this study, the effect of partial replacement of ZnO by Al2O3 on the crystallization behaviour and bending strength of a Li2O–ZnO–SiO2 glass-ceramic was investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mechanical property. The crystallization sequence of the glasses was determined by XRD analysis of the samples subjected to isothermal and nonisothermal heat treatments. All compositions showed volume crystallization with rather fine microstructures. The maximum bending strength was obtained for composition containing 4 wt.% Al2O3, above which a marked decrease was determined. The changes in phase assemblage and microstructures depended on the alumina content and applied heat treatments; these were correlated to the strength of the glass-ceramics.Glass-ceramics derived from the Li The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of Al The effects of alumina substitutions were examined by preparing glasses containing 0, 4, 6, 8, and 11 wt.% Al Homogeneous, transparent glasses were obtained from all compositions studied without showing any tendency to uncontrolled devitrification on cooling in the preheated molds. Refining of the melts needed higher temperatures and longer times as the alumina content increased. This behaviour can be attributed to the increase of the melt viscosity with increasing alumina content. For a composition containing 11 wt.% Al DTA results of the nucleated glasses are given in Crystallization sequence of the alumina free composition, A0, is quite simple, and consists of two steps; precipitation of a lithium zincsilicate phase in the early stage of crystallization with a composition close to Li Volume crystallization with rather fine microstructures was observed for all compositions studied. Examples of the SEM micrographs are given in The bending strengths of the annealed glasses and their glass-ceramics are given in With the partial replacement of ZnO by Al
