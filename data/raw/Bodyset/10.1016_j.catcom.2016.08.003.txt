A novel MnOx-CeO2 catalyst with shell-in-shell microsphere structure was successfully prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method for the first time. The obtained catalyst was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, N2 adsorption and desorption, XPS, H2-TPR and NH3-TPD in detail, and its catalytic activity was investigated by selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3. The results showed that the MnOx-CeO2 microsphere catalyst presented high catalytic activity at low temperatures (lower than 210°C), which was much superior to the counterpart MnOx-CeO2 catalyst without shell-in-shell microsphere structure prepared by co-precipitation method.Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with NH Among various low-temperature catalysts, MnO MnO For comparison, a counterpart MnO SEM images were obtained by FEI Quanta 250 equipment. TEM and HR-TEM were carried out on JEM-2100 HT. The XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. N The activity measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor of 8 As shown in The crystal phases of the two catalysts were investigated by XRD. As displayed in Both of the N  It is well known that the redox property of catalyst plays a crucial role in the catalytic cycle of SCR de-NO  The catalytic activity of MnO A novel MnO This work was sponsored by the
