The as-cast and as-extruded Mg–9Li, Mg–9Li–0.3Ce alloys were respectively prepared through a simple alloying process and hot extrusion. The microstructures of these alloys were investigated by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The results indicate that Ce addition produces a strong grain refining effect in Mg–9Li alloy. The grain size of the as-extruded alloy reduces abruptly from 88.2 μm to 10.5 μm when the addition of Ce is 0.36%. Mg12Ce is verified and exists inside the grains or at the grain boundaries, thus possibly pins up grain boundaries and restrains the grain growth.
