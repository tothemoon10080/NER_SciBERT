Approximately half of all vertebral fractures involve the thoracolumbar spine (TLS), and the incidence of TLS fractures in level 1 trauma patients is up to 5%.
               CT is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating TLS trauma patients. Isolated unstable TLS ligamentous injuries in the absence of fractures on CT appears to be extremely rare. MR is usually indicated in the cases of painful patients with a normal CT, to detect occult medullar bone fracture, or patients with unexplained neuroliogical findings.
               Three mechanisms of injury are identified: compression (axial loading), responsible for wedge and burst fractures; flexion-extension, responsible for vertebral body fracture with posterior structures distraction (e.g. “Chance” fracture); rotation, responsible for severe comminution with frequent spinal cord compromise.Imaging strategy Anatomy TL spine instability Columns concept Radiologic features of instability Classification Compression fractures (Magerl type A) Impaction fractures of the vertebral body (A1) Split fractures (A2) Burst fractures (A3) Distraction with anterior and posterior element injuries (Magerl type B) Hyperextension injuries: anterior disruption (type B3) Rotation/shear injuries (Magerl type C) Transverse process fractures Pitfalls Scheuermann deformities Vascular tracts References Approximately half of all vertebral fractures involve the thoracolumbar spine (TLS), and the incidence of TLS fractures in level 1 trauma patients is up to 5% CT is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating TLS trauma patients, its superiority over radiographs for the depiction of spine trauma is undiscussed MR is indicated in the cases of painful patients with a normal CT, to detect occult medullar bone fractures [ Isolated unstable TLS ligamentous injuries in the absence of fractures appears to be extremely rare Neurologic injury to the spinal cord can occur in 19% to 50% in patients with TLS fractures, and any neurological symptom unexplained by CT findings must lead to perform a MR examination [ Adjacent vertebrae articulate at the level of three joints ( Vertebral bodies are joined by a symphysis (cartilaginous joint), the intervertebral fibrocartilaginous disc Superior and inferior articular processes from adjacent vertebrae have facets that articulate through a synovial joint, reinforced by a fibrous capsule. Several ligaments strengthening stability anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments (ALL, PLL): they run along vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs ligamentum flavum (LF): between the laminae of adjacent vertebrae Interspinous ligament (ISL): between the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae Supraspinous ligament (SSL): between the tips of adjacent spinous processes FC, LF, ISL and SSL form together the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC), a primary stabilizer of the TLS The TLS is less mobile and intrinsically more stable than the cervical spine The TLS can be divided into three anatomicofunctional columns ( anterior (static, supports most of compression load) ALL anterior 2/3 of vertebral body anterior 2/3 of the intervertebral disc middle (protecting spinal cord) posterior 1/3 of vertebral body including the posterior wall posterior 1/3 of the intervertebral disc PLL posterior (dynamic, allows most of rotation and flexion) pedicles articular processes and facet joints spinous processes PLC Instability is thought to occur if two continuous columns are disrupted or unable to function [ Several independent radiographic signs are considered as indicative of vertebral instability ( vertebral translation: implies severe disco-ligamentous injury comminuted posterior vertebral body wall: implies burst injury increased interlaminar space: implies injury to the PLC increased facet joints space: imply injury to the PLC structures enlarged vertebral canal: implies sagittal injury to the entire vertebra Several classifications of TLS fracture exist, the most commonly used being TLICS (ThoracoLumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score) Magerl classification AO classification The Magerl classification is probably the most convenient one from a radiologic point of view. It defines three main fractures types, based on the vector force (compression, distraction, rotation) responsible for the injury mechanism A: vertebral body compression injury A1: impaction (wedge) fractures A2: split fractures A3: burst B: anterior and posterior element injury with distraction (flexion-extension mechanism) B1: predominantly transligamentous flexion-distraction injury B2: predominantly osseous flexion-distraction injury B3: anterior disruption through the disc (extension injuries) C: anterior and posterior element injury with rotation C1: rotation-compression injury C2: rotation-distraction injury C3: rotational shear injury Compression fractures involve predominantly the vertebral body (VB) ( In contrast, a horizontal fracture line within the posterior structures is indicative of a distractive injury (type B injuries). PLC is by definition intact in compression fractures, but it can be torn in severe instable burst fractures. The fingerprints of compression fractures are loss of VB height horizontal fracture line within VB (impaction or wedge fractures) vertical fracture line extending in both VB and lamina/spinous process (burst) They are the most frequent TLS fractures and are stable injuries [ A horizontal fracture line through the VB is almost always seen in A1 fractures ( In some patients, the fracture line can extend into the VB posterior wall ( Trabecular bone impaction without cortical disruption or shape changes are possible. Such injuries being invisible on radiographs or CT are called occult fractures and require MR or bone scan to be detected ( A2 fractures are uncommmon. The fracture line is vertical in the coronal plane (split coronal fractures) separating an anterior bony fragment ( Adjacent discs are frequently injured, and discal fragments can be driven within fracture gap Burst fractures are comminutive vertebral fractures with a potential expulsion of a bone fragment within the spinal canal The main features of burst factures are ( comminution with multiple bony fragments ( vertical fracture line through both VB and posterior arch ( sagittal cleavage, with an increase of interpedicular distance (the difference between two contiguous levels should never exceed 2 mm) ( failure of the posterior wall retropulsed bony fragment within spinal canal with neurological compromise ( Besides comminution, burst fractures are considered “stable” or “unstable” depending on whether or not the posterior arch is intact or compromised Commonly accepted signs of instability in burst fractures are PLC disruption interspinous and interlaminar widening intracanalar bony fragment height loss of VB of more than 50% facet fractures or dislocations Even if MR is the imaging modality of choice to explore PLC, it is not routinely indicated for the evaluation of burst fractures, as it doesn’t influence management (surgical osteosynthesis) ( The keypoint in distraction injuries (B) is the presence of a posterior injury that could be either ligamentous (B1) or osseous (B2) ( Therefore, a precautious inspection of all posterior structures is mandatory in the imaging evaluation of any vertebral body fracture ( Findings indicative of distraction are [ horizontal fracture line within posterior structures (lamina, spinous process) ( increase in interspinous distance: indicates PLC injury ( increase in posterior VB height ( The usual mechanism is a forced torso flexion, with a differential motion of the upper body part relative to the lower part [ In the ligamentous type of distraction injuries (B1), ligaments tearing begins at the supraspinous ligament and progresses anteriorly to eventually involve the PLL and the posterior portion of the IVD ( In the osseous type (B2), a horizontal fracture line runs postero-anteriorly from the spinous process to the VB posterior wall (“Chance” fracture) ( Then, patterns of VB injuries depend on the location of the fulcrum of the bending mechanism relative to the vertebrae Mixed bone/soft tissue lesions can be seen with both spinous process fractures and PLC injuries ( This type of injury occurs almost exclusively in patients with previous spinal ankylosis (diffuse idiopathic ankylosis or spondylarthropathies) with an eightfold fracture risk In hyperextension injuries, the disruption starts anteriorly, through the disk ( The fracture line can be very subtle, and sometimes only appears as a focal interruption of anterior ossification ( Extension injuries must, therefore, be suspected in [ ankylosed spine focal anterior disk widening/focal lordosis focal interruption of anterior ossification Rotation fractures are the most severe traumatic lesions of the TLS. They result from various amount of compression/shearing/distraction forces ( Such fractures occur primarily of the thoracolumbar junction, due to the difference of mobility between the relatively fixed thoracic spine and the more mobile lumbar spine The mechanism is generally a sudden blow on the upper and lateral thoracic area, with a spine compression and a torso twist The grinding force generates dislocation, shearing and rotation of both VB and posterior structures (facets, laminas, spinous process, transverse process), with fragment separation greater than in burst fractures ( At the thoracic level, shearing injuries can be suspected on chest radiographs, as the traumatic posterior hemothorax deviates by the normal mediastinal lines ( Findings indicative of rotational injuries are ( three columns involvement severe vertebral body comminution vertebral rotation/translation facets fracture and dislocations transverse process and ribs fractures: not seen in burst fractures Shearing fractures are at high risk of dural injuries with cerebrospinal fluid leakage ( Fractures of the lumbar processes are not by themselves clinically significant injuries and do not need specific management But, they are indirect indicators of more severe abdominal damages such as liver, spleen or mesenteric blunt trauma ( Possible mechanisms are: avulsion of the psoas muscle (lateral flexion-extension) avulsion of iliolumbar ligament (lateral compression of the bony pelvis) shear forces in pelvis trauma, mostly at L5 levels (“Malgaigne” fracture) ( Scheuermann’s disease is characterized by an abnormal growth of the vertebral cartilage endplate, possibly from excessive mechanical stress The normal enchondral ossification of the vertebra fails, so that endplates and apophysis (secondary ossification centers) show abnormal ossification and fusion to vertebral body (primary ossification center) Radiological findings of Scheuermann deformities are ( vertebral body wedging: predominantly at the level of the thoracolumbar junction endplate irregularities endplate concavities central disk herniation (“Schmorl’s hernia”) A wedged vertebra in the context of diffuse endplate abnormalities must raise the suspicion of Scheuermann disease. The wedging of vertebra related to Scheuermann involves both superior and inferior endplates, while only one endplate is usually compromised in compression fractures Intraosseous vessels radiate from the center to the periphery. They can be mistaken for fracture lines; the diagnosis clues are the typical symmetric distribution, cortical continuity, and confluence toward the vertebral sinus (
