Cyanide has been the universal reagent for gold leaching on counts of higher stability, lower cost and better understood chemistry. However, its high toxicity and slow leaching kinetics have called for research into alternative leaching reagents, of which thiosulfate and thiourea appear to be promising. Unlike the cyanide system, interaction of thiourea and thiosulfate systems with carbonaceous matter (CM) has not received much research attention. As non-cyanide reagents become important alternatives for gold leaching, it is imperative to assess the degree of gold adsorption (preg-robbing) in these systems and find ways of reducing this effect.
                  This paper presents the results of a study on reduction in gold uptake by CM in cyanide and non-cyanide systems due to fungal-treatment. Comparison is made between cyanide and non-cyanide systems on the bases of changes in gold adsorption by surrogate CM and CM in refractory gold ores. The results indicate that gold adsorption by as-received surrogates is in the order of cyanide>thiourea>thiosulfate, whereas after fungal-transformation, reduction in gold adsorption is more pronounced in cyanide than in thiourea and thiosulfate solutions. The decrease in gold adsorption on the CM is about 70–97% in cyanide, 60–92% in thiourea and 50–91% in thiosulfate. In general, the results exhibit a potential technique for reducing preg-robbing in the processing of carbonaceous gold ores with cyanide, thiourea and thiosulfate solutions.Cyanide has remained the preferred complexing agent in the leaching of gold for over a century though many other complexing agents exist. The major reasons for the acceptance of cyanide over the other lixiviants include higher chemical stability, lower cost and better understood chemistry ( In spite of the good attributes, the high toxicity of cyanide, the need for faster leaching kinetics and an environmentally friendly recovery process for gold ores, have necessitated research into alternative leaching reagents. These complexes include thiourea, thiosulfate, iodine, bromine and thiocyanate ( The dissimilarities in complexing reagents present significant differences in their interactions with carbon. Gold thiourea is cationic with a + Loss of gold due to preg-robbing is a major setback in the cyanide system, and for many years, researchers have had great interest in finding ways to mitigate the problem ( The application of the fungus, Coal (anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite) samples with particle size less than 850 Gold in the samples was determined by conventional fire assaying while carbon and sulfur were determined by the volumetric combustion technique using the LECO Sulfur titrator SC-4444DR. Before determining the sulfide sulfur, sulfate sulfur and elemental sulfur were removed as outlined by Gold-cyanide solution of concentration 50 Triplicate samples of biomodified, control and as-received coals of various weights (0.1 Petrographic evaluation and thermal maturity analysis on the organic carbon in the gold concentrate was conducted using Zeiss Universal research microscope. Gold concentrate originally ground to 80% passing — 75 The gold adsorption behavior of anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite coals from cyanide, thiourea and thiosulfate solutions before and after a one-week biotransformation by Several theories have been proposed for gold cyanide adsorption but currently there seems to be a consensus that adsorption of aurocyanide ion (Au(CN) It can be seen from Comparing the gold complexes, it is clear that there was very low adsorption from thiosulfate solution on all the coals, and this trend is in agreement with what is reported in literature. Gold thiosulfate complex, Au(S  The comparison of gold adsorption on anthracite from cyanide, thiourea and thiosulfate solutions is presented in Having established the effect of fungal biotransformation of the surrogate carbonaceous materials on the adsorption of the gold complexes, flotation concentrate (FC), and FC biooxidized with iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria (BFC) were also tested to ascertain the extent to which their preg-robbing abilities change following fungal-transformation. These results are presented in Within the boundaries established by the error bars, the levels of gold adsorption for the as-received FC and BFC from each of the complexing solutions were about the same. The above statement is also true for adsorption after fungal treatment. This observation is based on the fact that the organic carbon contents of the two samples, FC and BFC were similar at 3.6% and 3.7% respectively ( Photomicrographs of the gold concentrates in Though the CM was characterized to have anthracite grade maturity, it is clear from both In contrast to the cyanide system, extensive research in gold adsorption by carbonaceous matter within the thiourea and thiosulfate systems is yet to be realized. This study is therefore important as it reports for the first time, the extent of reduction in gold up-take in these systems as a result of biotransformation of carbonaceous matter by the fungus,  Though adsorption on as-received carbon is highest in cyanide solution, it can be seen in Another possibility for the relatively smaller reduction in gold adsorption after fungal-treatment in the case of thiourea, as compared to cyanide, might be due to the ability of thiourea to interact with oxygen groups, which increased after fungal-treatment ( This paper reports, for the first time, on preg-robbing of gold thiourea and gold thiosulfate complexes by different grades of carbonaceous matter (CM), and the extent of reduction in preg-robbing in these systems as a result of biotransformation of CM by the fungus, The authors are grateful to the Golden Star Prestea-Bogoso Resources (GSPBR), Ghana, for providing the gold ores, and Prof. Ming Tien of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, in the Pennsylvania State University for the fungal spores of
