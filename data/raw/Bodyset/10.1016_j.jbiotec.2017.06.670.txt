In this work, we synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) for encapsulation of chemotherapeutics and investigated their cytotoxic effects on cancer and normal cells. Dox (Doxorubicin) and/or Epo loaded PLGA NPs were prepared using a modified w/o/o double emulsion phase separation method. The synthesized NPs were characterized with respect to particle size, zeta potential, particle morphology, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The presence of Dox and/or Epo within NPs was proven by these material characterization analyses, revealing that Dox and/or Epo could be successfully loaded into the nanoparticles. The effects of the synthesized NPs on cytotoxicity, apoptosis, apoptotic pathways, and drug resistance were also investigated on
