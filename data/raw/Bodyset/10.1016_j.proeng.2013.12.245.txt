In Present work, the properties of Al2O3 powder was studied through incorporation of MgO Nano powder along with ZnO Nano powder and followed by sintering at various temperatures. Previously ZnO and MgO were introduced with Al2O3 separately to improve physical and mechanical properties like densification, micro hardness, fracture toughness etc. In current project, 0.25wt% and 0.50wt% MgO was added with β- Al2O3 matrix along with constant 0.1wt% ZnO and sintered those samples at 14500°C, 15000°C, 15500°C respectively. Properties like densification, micro hardness, and wear rate of all these sintered products were measured and discussed where the best composition found was 0.1% ZnO-0.25%MgO-99.65% Al2O3 sintered at 15000°C. Change in properties was observed due to faster densification rate and pinning effect provided by the doping particles.
