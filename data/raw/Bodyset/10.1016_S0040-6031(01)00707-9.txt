The coordination numbers in the Molecular Interaction Volume Model (MIVM) can be calculated from common physical quantities for pure metals. A significant advantage of the model lies in its ability to predict thermodynamic properties of solutes in Pb-based dilute solutions using only binary infinite dilute activity coefficients, and the predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data for Pb-based dilute solutions. This shows that the model is reliable, convenient and economic.The thermodynamic properties of multicomponent liquid alloys are important for understanding process metallurgy and the metal alloying. A great deal of binary data has so far been compiled in monographs such as Hultgren et al. The interaction parameter formalism first proposed by Wagner The MIVM was obtained in the physical sense of liquid molecular movements in that liquid molecules are not like gas molecules which are in continuous irregular motion and not like solid ones which are vibrating constantly at one site but are migrating non-randomly from one cell to another. The molar excess Gibbs energy Extending It is necessary to determine the coordination numbers of liquid metals by applying MIVM to liquid alloys. For the liquid metal, the coordination can be defined as For a binary mixture The activities of solutes in the Pb-based dilute solutions Zn–Bi–Pb, Zn–Cd–Pb and Zn–Sb–Pb at 823 When Considering first-order effects only, the Wagner formulae for ternary dilute solutions can be defined as Allowing the Pb-based dilute solutions Zn–Bi–Pb, Zn–Cd–Pb and Zn–Sb–Pb to be a 1-2-3 system, the activity coefficient of the component 1 of the systems can be written from The coordination numbers in the Molecular Interaction Volume Model can be calculated from common physical quantities of pure metals. A significant advantage of the model lies in its ability to predict the thermodynamic properties of ternary dilute solutions using only the binary infinite dilute activity coefficients, and the predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data of ternary dilute solutions, which show that the model is reliable, convenient and economic.
