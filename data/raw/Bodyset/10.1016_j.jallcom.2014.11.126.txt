The objective of using three different (planetary, horizontal attritor, and shaker) ball mills in the synthesis of AA 7075–ZrO2 metal matrix composite is to assess their effectiveness in dispersing ZrO2 nanosized particles through the matrix in each individual milling process. The results show that in the case of the planetary ball mill, a full dispersion of the ZrO2 through the matrix can be achieved because an excess of the process control agent promotes the fracture of particles instead of welding, leading to the breakdown of ZrO2 agglomerates and achieving a complete dispersion of the reinforcement. In the case of the Simoloyer mill, the results showed that there was not a fine dispersion of the ZrO2 particles, because some ZrO2 clusters were of micrometer size, showing that the welding is the major process in this mill. On the other hand, the shaker mill (Spex) produced the best results, because full dispersion of the ZrO2 particles took place in a homogeneous way in half the time taken by the other mills tested, because it is the most energetic milling process of all.Aluminum matrix composites have the advantage of mixing two different natural materials with opposite properties, which in interesting cases results in materials with low specific weight and a high strength relation obtained by means of different technological processes such as mechanical milling (MM) There are several types of mills in which MM can take place. Amongst the more commonly used are the planetary, horizontal attritor, and shaker mills. The planetary ball mill performs planet-like movement of the vials containing the milling media and the sample; in this way, the translation and rotational movement accelerates the grinding balls, producing impacts of the balls and themselves, and the balls and the walls of the vial, and the sample held trapped between the milling media in every collision event Various reports on the calculation of the energy of the mills have been made with the aim of estimating the impact stress energy distribution, frequency impact, energy transfer, grinding balls’ motion, and enhanced operation modes like direction and rotational speed. By comparison of simulation and experimental observations of the three mills, the process which develops a higher energy by means of the impact power is found to be the Spex shaker mill, followed by the Simoloyer horizontal attritor mill, and finally the Pulverisette planetary mill Previous studies have used ZrO The initial matrix powders were obtained from a bar of commercial AA 7075-T6. The bar was annealed during 48 The composite was produced by blending the AA 7075 with ZrO The morphology of the powders was characterized via electron microscopy in a Phillips XL-30 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) operated at 20 The obtained morphology of the composite material milled by the planetary mill is shown in the SEM micrograph in The results obtained by the Simoloyer mill in mode A(zirconia grinding balls in a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10:1) are somewhat discouraging. On the other hand, with milling mode B (steel grinding balls in a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 20:1), the results are quite different, since a better reinforcement dispersion was obtained, as depicted in The Spexshaker ball mill is probably the most effective mill for dispersion effects.  The behavioral characteristics of the ceramic reinforcement in each milling process have been presented. There are some large differences in the microstructure of the aluminum matrix particles, such as the particle size, particles agglomeration, and final morphology. These obtained characteristics can be an indirect guide to the determination of the optimum parameters for achieving a full dispersion of the ceramic particles, which is advisable for obtaining acceptable mechanical properties. The evaluation of the energy level for each process was done by taking the crystallite size as a reference, since the higher the strain imposed on the material during the process, the smaller the average crystallite size Among the three mills used, the Spex shaker mill was the most effective in dispersing the ZrO In As can be seen, the average crystallite size obtained by the planetary ball mill is higher than that obtained by the Simoloyer mill in mode A. Despite the lower strain imposed on the powders, the dispersion of the ceramic particles was more homogeneous in the planetary ball mill, and hence a better dispersion of the reinforcement was carried out in the former because the dominant process was fracture; that is, due to the usage of an excess of PCA, powder fracture dominated instead of the cold welding process in the planetary mill. Between the two modes of the Simoloyer mill, much better dispersion was obtained in mode B than in mode A, due to the fact that mode B was a more energetic process due to the higher ball-to-powder weight ratio and denser grinding media (steel instead of zirconia balls). As expected, a lower average crystallite size was obtained in mode B. In comparison, a larger crystallite size was obtained by the planetary ball in mode B, and consequently the strain imposed by the Simoloyer mill in mode B was higher than that imposed by the planetary ball mill in the same time, but the dispersion was more homogeneous in the planetary ball mill despite the energy of the process. Therefore, a good parameter to take into account in terms of ZrO It is apparent from the results presented earlier that the control of the milling conditions is important since a homogeneous microstructure can be obtained even without a high-energy ball mill, as in the case of the planetary ball mill, where fracture is mainly promoted instead of welding, insomuch as the PCA covers the surface of the metal matrix and no fresh surface will be available to make direct contact between metal particles Another interesting feature shown in Three ball mills were tested in order to study the behavior and the interaction between the AA 7075 metal matrix particles and ZrO The Simoloyer mill mode A process represented the most difficult method of achieving a fine dispersion of ZrO The Simoloyer mill mode B presented better qualities in terms of ZrO The planetary ball mill showed a better grade of dispersion compared with both modes of the Simoloyer mill, despite being the least energetic process of all. This situation was due to the higher quantity of PCA (methanol) used. In this way, the fracture predominance during the process set suitable conditions for obtaining a higher grade of dispersion. The Spex shaker mill had the most energetic process and consistently produced the greatest dispersion of all mills tested. This bring to the composite the best grade of reinforcement dispersion and the highest strain on the matrix particles, with the disadvantage that only a few grams can be processed by this mill. Finally, for all mills tested, the average crystallite size were found to be at nanometer level, indicating a significant microstructural refinement by MM. The present research was supported by
