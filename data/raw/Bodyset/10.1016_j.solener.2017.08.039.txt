The relative potential of liquid multivalent metal oxides for the storage of thermal energy as sensible, latent and/or thermochemical storage energy in a liquid chemical looping thermal enerrgy storage (LCL-TES) is reported. This LCL-TES cycle comprises a reduction reactor, an oxidation reactor, two reservoirs for storing the hot and cold medium and a heat recovery unit. The materials were assessed on the basis of their melting temperature, Gibbs free energy, reaction temperature and thermal storage capacity. Ellingham diagrams were used to identify regimes with a potential for application in a LCL-TES, while phase diagrams were used to identify processes which combine sensible, latent and thermochemical heat storage. Based on these criteria, the oxide of CuO/Cu2O was found to have the greatest thermodynamic potential for use in a LCL-TES system with a total enthalpy of 404.67kJ/mol for thermal storage. However, the high temperature of ∼1200°C and corrosive nature of molten copper and its oxides will make this cycle challenging to implement. Lead, on the other hand has a lower total enthalpy of 250.09kJ/mol, but is molten at lower temperatures.Concentrated solar thermal (CST) power has received great attention due to its compatibility with thermal energy storage, which enables management of the variability of solar radiation at relatively low cost ( The three main types of thermal energy storage (TES) are sensible, latent and thermochemical heat storage ( Another method to store energy is via latent TES which stores the energy within the phase change of a material. A number of materials have been proposed previously for latent TES, such as NaCl ( Thermochemical energy storage is being investigated because it offers an energy density of up to fifteen times higher than sensible heat storage and six times higher than latent heat storage for several types of materials ( Several metals and metal oxides have been considered for the application in thermochemical energy storage. The oxide of BaO Liquid chemical looping thermal energy storage (LCL-TES) system is a newly proposed technology based on the use of liquid metal oxides at a high temperature for both thermal energy storage and as For the reasons outlined above, the objective of the present investigation is to compare the thermodynamic feasibility of alternative metal oxides for the application in a LCL-TES system for power generation using a gas turbine combined cycle, which requires the hot gas to be delivered at a high temperature and pressure. The LCL-TES system can alternatively be used to supply required heat to a high temperature process such as mineral processing application. In so doing, it is recognized that the thermodynamic potential does not necessarily imply technical or economic feasibility, but is rather a necessary pre-requisite to the further work that would be required to develop and implement such a process. More specifically, the aim of this work is to compare the performance of different metal oxides in a LCL-TES system based on their melting temperature, Gibbs free energy, reaction temperature, phase diagram, and vapour pressure.  The reduced metal oxide is then conveyed to the hot storage tank (stream 2), before being transferred to the oxidation reactor as a liquid (stream 3) to generate hot vitiated air. A bubble reactor is a plausible configuration of oxidation reactor, since it can be designed to achieve high rates of both heat and mass transfer ( As shown in In this work the materials with a potential for application in a LCL-TES system at an operating temperature of up to 1400 The Gibbs free energy of the chemical reactions in a LCL-TES system is required to be negative for Red-Ox reaction to be spontaneous ( The value of ΔG was calculated here with HSC chemistry software ( The vapour pressure of the metal oxides at high temperatures was also assessed because the effect of volatility of the metal oxides on the lifetimes of components such as valves and turbine blades. This was also calculated using the HSC chemistry database ( Phase diagrams of the selected metal oxides were used to identify the potential of the materials for sensible, latent and thermochemical heat storage. This revealed the temperature and partial pressure at which a change in material state occurs, together with the mole fraction of oxygen. The enthalpies of sensible, latent and thermochemical heat were calculated with Eqs. The chemical energy density of metal oxides can be calculated by Eq. It is worth mentioning that the extent of oxidation can be controlled by changing the partial pressure of the oxygen in system. Decreasing the partial pressure of oxygen increases the extent of conversion of the chemical reaction The melting temperature of twenty-two metals and their oxides is presented in The Ellingham diagram of the selected metal oxides is shown in        The thermodynamic potential of different multivalent metal oxides for application in a LCL-TES system was assessed based on their melting temperature, Ellingham diagram, reaction temperature, vapour pressure and, phase stability diagram. The oxides of Pb, Ba, Sb, Cu and Mn were found to exhibit the potential for application in a LCL-TES system based on their melting temperature at the operating temperature of the system. However, the Ellingham diagram of these materials revealed that the values of ΔG are positive for the reactions of PbO/Pb, MnO Notwithstanding the strong thermochemical energy storage potential for copper in a LCL-TES system, it should be noted that there exist significant technical challenges that need to be overcome to enable the proposed system to become available at a commercial scale, given the requirement to reduce the metal oxides at a temperature well above the maximum temperature of high temperature steels. It is also anticipated that the technical challenges associated with the Pb oxides are less than these for Cu oxides because the reduction occurs at a temperature below 1000 The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of ARENA through the
