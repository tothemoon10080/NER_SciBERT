TiO2 surface fluorination is known to produce an enhancement of the photocatalytic oxidation rate of some organic compounds such as phenol, acid orange, azo dye Acid Red 1 and benzoic acid, while leads to a clear decrease of the photooxidation quantum yield of other compounds like formic acid, and dichloroacetate. Here we show that these differences in behaviour cannot be explained in the framework of the classical “Langmuir–Hinshelwood” (L–H) kinetic model, although they are compatible with the predictions of the alternative, recently developed “Direct–Indirect”(D–I) model [19]. For weak electronic interaction of the TiO2 surface with dissolved substrate species, as it is for instance the case for phenol, the D–I model predicts that photooxidation takes place mainly via an interfacial, indirect transfer (IT) mechanism involving inelastic trapping of valence band free holes by terminal, twofold coordinated oxygen ions, and further adiabatic transfer to dissolved substrate species. On the basis of open-circuit voltage measurements, the origin of the photooxidation quantum yield increase observed in these cases when the TiO2 surface becomes fluorinated is attributed to the partial substitution of water molecules adsorbed on terminal Ti sites by fluoride ions, leading to: (1) an interfacial decrease of the electron-hole recombination rate as the surface concentration of recombination centres associated with terminal Ti sites diminishes; (2) an increase of the IT rate of surface trapped holes to reduced dissolved species, because of the upward shift experimented by the semiconductor energy levels with respect to filled electrolyte energy levels. In contrast, for strong electronic interaction of substrate species with the naked TiO2 surface, as it is for instance the case of formate ions at low enough pH, photooxidation mainly take place via an interfacial, direct transfer (DT) mechanism, involving inelastic trapping of valence band free holes by specifically adsorbed substrate species. The photooxidation quantum yield decrease observed in this case is explained to be due to a diminution of the density of TiO2 surface sites active for adsorption of formate ions.

TiO Because of the strong specific adsorption in the presence of water, the photooxidation of formic acid (formate ions) on naked TiO An important parameter defining the concentration of CB electrons and, therefore, affecting electron-hole recombination kinetics, is the semiconductor flatband potential, Since the Helmholtz layer at the TiO As pointed out previously As schematized in If we compare the time-dependent open-circuit voltage results of In order to correctly interpret these experimental results, it must be taken into account, according to the scheme of In order to study the influence of TiO In agreement with a previous analysis of the photooxidation quantum yield for IT, which excluded the participation of bandgap surface states associated to Ti ions in interfacial reactions (see for instance Eq.

Since dissolved FA species, mainly present as formate anions at pH 3.5, strongly interact with the TiO On the other hand, it has been reported that the rate of FA photooxidation decreases by about a 16% when TiO In the absence of specific adsorption, as was shown to be the case for phenol in Section On the other hand, it has been reported that the rate of phenol photooxidation increases up to about a factor of 3 when TiO According to Eq.  The analysis of open-circuit potential transients and impedance measurements at the TiO According to the D–I kinetic model, the consequence of these effects on the photooxidation kinetics of substrate species can be resumed as follows: under surface fluorination the specific adsorption of dissolved substrates species on terminal Ti atoms becomes inhibited and a diminution of the photooxidation rate is produced when the DT mechanism prevails on the IT mechanism, as experimentally observed for formic acid The photocatalytic mechanism of phenol degradation, invoking the increasing participation of free OH This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC) through project CTQ2006-06286/BQU.
