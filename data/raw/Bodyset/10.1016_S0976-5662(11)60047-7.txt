Floating knee injury is described as the simultaneous ipsilateral disruption of skeletal integrity above and below the knee. It is usually associated with high-energy impact and often a part of polytrauma. Management of associated life-threatening injuries should take precedence over the orthopedic injury. The soft tissue trauma to the limb is significant and it is prudent to be wary. Despite a high complication rate, early skeletal stabilization and timely postoperative rehabilitation offer the best chance of a favorable outcome.
