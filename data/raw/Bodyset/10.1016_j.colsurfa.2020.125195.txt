This paper reports the effect of the molecular weight of polyacrylic acid (PAA) on the flocculation of sub-micron titanium dioxide particles. The average molecular weight (MW) of the three studied PAAs were 140,000, 512,000 and 1,483,000 g/mol, respectively. The flocculation process was studied by several techniques including focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM), photometric dispersion analyses (PDA), settling tests in graduated cylinders. The adsorption density of the PAAs on the titanium dioxide surface was measured by an elemental analyzer, and the floc structure was studied by scanning electron microscope and fractal dimension analysis using an optical microscope. The results showed that the flocs formed with the high MW PAA had larger sizes than the flocs generated with medium MW PAA. However, the medium MW PAA resulted in better flocculation performance, with faster settling rate and clearer supernatant. This observation was in contrast to the general perception in the literature that high MW polymer flocculants have better flocculation performance. The porosity of the flocs generated by the high MW PAA was larger than flocs by the medium MW PAA, leading to lower density flocs. This was found to be the main reason for the slow settling rate of the high MW PAA despite the larger floc size. Finally, despite the different settling rates, the PAAs with different MWs all showed their optimum flocculation performance at about 3.3 % of a monolayer coverage on the TiO2 surfaces.Polymer flocculants are widely used in solid-liquid separation of various industrial suspensions such as concentrates and tailings in mineral processing [ The structure of flocs plays a significant role in solid-liquid separation in suspension. According to the Stokes’ law, the settling velocity is proportional to the product of the particle density and the square of the particle size. When the floc size increases but floc density decreases, or the floc size decreases and the flocs density increases, it is difficult to qualitatively predict the settling velocity [ Floc structures can be described by fractal dimensions [ Accurate prediction of three-dimensional fractal dimension D In this work, we have studied the settling behavior of a particulate slurry treated by polymer flocculants of different MWs in order to investigate the correlation between sedimentation and floc structure induced by flocculants of different MW. Titanium dioxide was selected as a model solid due to its stability and ready availability in the sub-micron particle size range. Polyacrylic acids (PAA) with different vendor-specified MW of 100,000 g/mol, 450,000 g/mol, and 1,250,000 g/mol, respectively, were used as flocculants. The flocculation rate, floc structure, floc size and settling rate were determined by a photometric dispersion analyzer (PDA), optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM), a focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) particle/floc size analyzer, and sedimentation tests in graduated cylinders. The results showed that although flocs generated by the high MW PAA had larger floc size than those generated by low and medium MW PAA, the medium MW PAA had the best flocculation performance, with faster settling rate and clearer supernatant. The observed results were explained by fractal dimension of the formed flocs, which provides insights to the floc structures. Analytical grade polyacrylic acid (PAA) with vendor-specified molecular weights of 100,000, 450,000, and 1,250,000 g/mol were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. They were dissolved in deionized water to make 1 g/L stock solutions, and their pH were adjusted to 3 using 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. Titanium dioxide (TiO The MW averages and polydispersity (PDI) of the different MW PAAs were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (1260 Infinity Multi-Detector GPC/SEC System, Agilent Technologies, USA) with two columns (2 Agilent PL Aquagel-OH MIXED-H, designed for anionic polymers) connected in series. Polyethylene oxide standards from Agilent Technologies were used to calibrate the system. Deionized water containing 0.2 M NaNO The radius of gyration (R Dynamic light scattering was used to determine the particle size of the TiO Quantachrome instrument (Autosorb iQ and ASiQwin, USA) was used to measure the specific surface area of the TiO The zeta potentials of TiO In this set of experiments, 10 g TiO The total carbon contents of the collected PAA-treated TiO A photometric dispersion analyzer (PDA 2000, Rank Brothers, England) was used to monitor the flocculation of the TiO A focused beam reflectance measurement particle size analyzer (FBRM, Mettler-Toledo, USA) was used to monitor the flocculation performance of TiO After the FBRM measurement, the sediments were collected, freeze-dried, and subjected to image analysis by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Bruker MLA 250, USA) at 15 kV voltage. The settling rate of the TiO Images of the flocs were acquired by an optical microscope (ZEISS, Axiovert 200 M, USA) equipped with a high resolution CCD camera. A pipette was used to sample flocculated slurry to deposit to a sample cell under the microscope for image analysis. For each sample, 50 flocs were selected for image analysis. The images of the flocs were captured by the camera and were analyzed by the image analysis software (Image J, USA). In this work, the long axis of the fitted ellipse was taken as the characteristic length and considered as the floc size. The two-dimensional fractal dimension was calculated by regression analysis of the logarithm of the projected area versus the logarithm of the long axis of the fitted ellipse as suggested by Eq.         Section     The optical images of the flocs were used to calculate the D Settling rate of the flocs and turbidity of supernatant are important parameters to evaluate the flocculation effectiveness. Generally, polymers with high MW perform better as flocculants due to their ability to bridge many particles and form lager size flocs [ The flocculation of a sub-micron TiO The results also showed that the chemisorption of PAAs on TiO The implication of the observations from this study is that, despite the more likely tendency to cause bridging flocculation, polymer flocculants with high molecular weights may not necessarily be better flocculants. They tend to form flocs with larger sizes but with a more porous structure and lower fractal dimension, and thus may not have a faster settling rate or desirable solid-liquid separation behavior. The high molecular weight polymers are typically more difficult and more expensive to make and their solutions are more difficult to prepare. In practical applications, polymer flocculants with intermediate molecular weights may produce technically and economically optimum results.
