In this technical note, the adsorption of the gold–thiosulfate complex ion ([Au(S2O3)2]3−) on cupric ferrocyanide (CuFC)-impregnated activated carbon in aqueous solutions was investigated to identify a better adsorbent for the gold thiosulfate process. This study was performed using cupric ferrocyanide (CuFC)-impregnated activated carbon (AC-CuFC) and an artificial, aqueous solution of [Au(S2O3)2]3−. Variation in major factors was investigated for the determination of the appropriate dosages of cupric salts, potassium ferrocyanide, impregnation time and roasting temperature to obtain a high recovery of gold from simulated thiosulfate leach solutions. The experimental results have shown that [Au(S2O3)2]3− strongly adsorbs onto the AC-CuFC and the adsorption capacity of [Au(S2O3)2]3− on the AC-CuFC in aqueous solution increased with increasing temperature, leading to a gold adsorption capacity for AC-CuFC of 1.474kg/t at a gold concentration of 100mg/L at 30°C. It was determined that the adsorption followed the Freundlich isotherm well, and a pseudo-second order kinetic model is suitable for the adsorption kinetic. That finding indicates that the gold adsorption is multimolecular chemical adsorption. EDX and FTIR suggested that the adsorption process consisted of two steps: first, [Au(S2O3)2]3− diffused to the surface of AC-CuFC, and ion-exchange reaction for Au and Cu happened, then Au(I) was likely reduced to native gold by carbon or [Fe(CN)6]4−.The thiosulfate system has been widely accepted by researchers around the world as a potential alternative lixiviant for the leaching and recovery of gold due to mounting environmental concerns and unresolved practical difficulties in using cyanide to extract gold from copper–gold, refractory, or carbonaceous ores in the last three decades ( Generally, the thiosulfate leaching conditions reported in the literature are severe, with high reagent consumption ( Cementation (metal displacement) and resins can be used to recovery gold from the thiosulfate solutions. Cementation with zinc or copper has also been studied, but this method suffers from high metal consumption or possibly passivation by metal sulfide formation on the metal cement surface ( Early research also confirmed that activated carbon (in its pristine form) does not adsorb the gold thiosulfate complex, possibly due to the high anionic charge of the thiosulfate complex and the bulkiness of the thiosulfate ions compared to gold cyanide. Nevertheless, research on the adsorption of gold onto activated carbon from thiosulfate–ammoniacal solutions never stopped ( The preparation and application of copper hexacyanoferrate(II) for the removal of radioactive cesium from solutions by sorption or precipitation have been studied over the past 50 The cupric ferrocyanide-impregnated activated carbon used in this work (AC-CuFC) was prepared in our laboratory.
