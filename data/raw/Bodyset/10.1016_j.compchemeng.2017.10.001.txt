New economic and environmental challenges have recently led to a growing interest in modern mathematical optimization and modeling techniques in order to improve the froth flotation performance. An important issue is that most of corresponding mathematical optimization models are non-convex and involve multiple criteria; hence, conventional convex optimization methods cannot guarantee finding global (Pareto) optimal solutions. We propose a deterministic biobjective mathematical programming framework, combined with experimental design and regression analysis, to optimizing flotation performance and determining the optimal operating conditions that meet specific needs. The framework aims at maximizing concentrate grade and recovery and is based on some well-known and advanced approaches including an epsilon-constraint method, DC programming, an exact penalty method, and the special global search strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we present a case study for the rougher flotation process of copper-molybdenum ores performed at the Erdenet Mining Corporation Mineral Processing Plant (Mongolia).a DC objective function a function of DC inequality constraints the optimal value of an optimization problem  a finite approximation of the level set the first objective function (represents copper concentrate grade) the second objective function (represents copper recovery) the objective function of a penalized problem bounding parameters of the parameters of Lagrange multiplier exact penalty parameter parameter for varying the level surface objective function value point's parameter from level surface approximation accuracy of the local search accuracy of the solution to linearized problem partially linearized objective function partially linearized function of inequality constraints constraint index set a convex set non-convex feasible set the optimal solution set of an optimization problem an approximation to the Pareto optimal set Froth flotation is one of the most important and widespread concentration methods, which is based on exploiting the difference in surface properties of valuable minerals and gangue, also referred to as wettability ( Numerous efforts have been made to study flotation chemistry and physical aspects of the flotation process, the influence of particle size, the optimal design of flotation circuits and process control systems (e.g. see In the recent years, mineral processing has attracted particular attention of various research communities on account of the emergence of new advanced production and control technologies. Moreover, it is also a natural area of applications of modern mathematical modeling and optimization techniques. The industry in turn takes a keener interest in such new technologies due to the new economic and environmental challenges as well as the issue of the depletion of high-grade deposits. Optimization models and techniques naturally arise when dealing with the problem of optimal flotation circuit design. According to The second group of approaches assumes using so-called superstructures of configuration alternatives for the circuit design that are modeled with discrete and continuous decision variables. Discrete variables are used to model yes/no decisions as well as a number of flotation stages and flotation cells in a bank, stream splits, flotation circuit arrangements, etc., while continuous variables characterize alternative steady state design/control specifications for the individual flotation cells ( At last there are genetic algorithms and metaheuristic-based approaches to the optimization of flotation circuit design and performance. In Other studies address evolutionary algorithms combined with careful experimental design techniques and regression analysis to optimize a flotation process and to determine its best performances. For example, Note that the main disadvantage of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is its inability to guarantee Pareto optimality of the solutions found. It is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others ( In this paper we propose a solid deterministic mathematical programming approach to optimizing the metallurgical performance and determining the best operating conditions of the rougher flotation process. As was mentioned, most of modern approaches to the optimization of flotation circuit design and performance rely on commercial solvers and evolutionary algorithms that either converge too slowly or cannot guarantee global optimality, especially when the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. Furthermore, real problems involve multiple objective functions to be optimized simultaneously and, as far as we know, almost all solution methods developed are metaheuristics or assume aggregating multiple objectives into a single one that often do not provide a good approximation to the Pareto optimal set. Our methodology is based on several advanced modern mathematical programming and multiobjetive optimization techniques including DC programming and the special global search strategy ( Let us consider the following general DC programming problem We suppose that the feasible set of the problem The general optimization problem On the other hand, many real industrial optimization problems require finding a global optimal solution with respect to more than one objective function that can often be conflicting (e.g. see We develop a framework for finding an approximation to the Pareto optimal set of the problem In the literature one can find papers exploiting similar ideas of the global and local search and/or the global optimality conditions, but exactly the same type of non-convex problems and the global search algorithm are not considered. For example, ( In the next paragraphs we describe our methodology for the general bi-objective DC program In this section we describe the main components and a general scheme of our approach that consists in solving a bi-objective non-convex optimization problem with DC objective functions and box constraints. We carefully describe all components of the proposed approach and design its implementation for a particular problem of determining the best operating conditions of the rougher flotation process. The problem ( Since we are not able to numerically find an exact representation of the Pareto optimal set, we focus on generating an approximation to it, namely a so-called There are various exact and heuristic methods of finding Pareto optimal solutions to multiobjective problems, most of which can be classified as a posteriori and a priori ones. A priori methods usually aim at finding the most preferred solution according to the preferences of the decision maker known before the optimization process. On the other hand, a posteriori methods search for the whole Pareto optimal set or its representative subset in order to help the decision maker choose one preferred solution ( For our framework we adapt one of the best-known a posteriori approaches – the In the In the general case, any exact global optimal solution to the subproblems ( Let With these notations, we apply the following version of the  The set In the next paragraphs we describe our approach to finding a global optimal solution to the non-convex Let us consider the problem ( Assume that a feasible starting point As was proposed in Thus, if one of the inequalities Note that In the next paragraph we show how to escape from critical points provided by the local search method and how to develop a global search algorithm based on the global optimality conditions. First, in order to accumulate all of the “basic non-convexities” of the As well-known ( Furthermore, according to ( It can be seen that the objective function Observe that for any point Now, similarly to the global optimality conditions for DC minimization problems (  If for a pair ( Hence, the global optimality conditions The issue is to find out whether such a set of parameters (   Moreover, on each level The global search strategy consists of two main components: local search, which provides an approximately critical point procedure of escaping from critical points, which is based on the global optimality conditions. Let The Global Search Scheme for the problem ( Global Search Scheme for the To sum up, our approach to finding an approximation to the Pareto optimal set of the bi-objective non-convex optimization problem In this section we carry out a case study to both maximize the metallurgical performance (concentrate grade and recovery) and determine the best operating conditions (e.g. reagent dosages) of the rougher flotation process at the Erdenet Mining Corporation Mineral Processing Plant (Erdenet, Mongolia). Erdenet Mining Corporation is a joint Russian-Mongolian enterprise founded (together with the city of Erdenet) in 1974 and aimed at the commercial exploitation of Asia's largest porphyry copper-molybdenum deposit: Erdenetiyn-Ovoo (“the treasure mountain”). Now the corporation is one of the biggest mining and mineral processing companies in Asia that produces over 530 thousand tons of copper concentrate and about 4.5 thousand tons of molybdenum concentrate by processing 26 million tons of raw ore per year. In order to model the rougher flotation process of the copper-molybdenum ore, an orthogonal central composite design (for more details see (        Note that even though we study a particular flotation process specific to Erdenetiyn-Ovoo copper-molybdenum ores, their total copper grade (including primary and oxidized one) may vary within an interval. So the range of the copper grades in the feed were also chosen as independent variables to be studied. Exploring in total 5000 normalized tests providing the responses, the effects of the independent variables were analyzed with multiple regression, fitting the two following empirical equations Note that the matrices Hence, the corresponding quadratic functions Now our goal is to determine the operating conditions leading to the maximization of the copper concentrate grade and recovery subject to the following technological constraints: Thus, we consider the following bi-objective DC programming problem with the convex feasible set: In order to apply our methodology to the bi-objective DC programming problem It is known that any quadratic matrix may be transformed into a symmetric matrix Let us also introduce the matrices Γ In the same way, one can get Hence, the matrix In order to solve a series of More precisely, let us consider the problem Applying the local search procedure to the problem Then, in order to construct the procedure of escaping from critical points provided by the local search method, we consider the following auxiliary penalized problem Thus, to implement Step 4 of the global search scheme, we have to solve the following linearized (at the point One of the principal step of the global search scheme is the issue of constructing an approximation of a level surface of the convex function Note that when Finally, in our computational experiments we have tested 11 starting points for the global search algorithm (see Our optimization framework is implemented as a program using Visual C++ 2010 programming language. The computational tests were run on a PC with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790k CPU @ 4.00 The quality of an approximation to the Pareto optimal set provided by the developed framework is mostly dependent on the step size of the grid in which the parameter Recall that the developed framework belongs to the class of multiobjective optimization methods with a posteriori articulation of preferences. Thus, it aims at the generation of a good representative approximation to the Pareto optimal set, letting the decision maker (engineering manager) see the whole picture and choose the best trade-off (operating conditions). Before starting our bi-objective approach, we found the ideal Our approach starts from The developed framework applied to the bi-objective non-convex optimization problem One can also see that the Pareto frontiers take an “s-shaped” form, since the set of Pareto optimal outcomes is not convex. First of all, we carry out a computational comparison of our bi-objective DC programming approach with several commercial solvers embedded into the Let us note that the developed bi-objective DC programming approach and the BARON solver embedded into the Now let us compare the results obtained by our bi-objective DC programming approach with those ones provided by the weighted sum method, which is one of the most famous and popular mathematical programming-based approaches to solving applied industrial multi-objective optimization problems ( We transform the applied bi-objective problem It can be seen that all the solution to the single-objective problem found by MINOS and CONOPT are dominated (worse) by the points provided by our bi-objective global search: The weighted sum method associated with MINOS and CONOPT discovered only 4 and 3 distinct, dominated points respectively. On the other hand, for all the weights Now let us reveal some interconnections between the optimal operating conditions and corresponding concentrate grade and recovery. In particular, for the 118 approximate Pareto optimal solutions, One can observe a correlation between the two values such that an increase in the total amount of oxidized ore in the feed involves decreasing the overall recovery rate, i.e. the maximum recovery is achieved in the presence of the lowest possible oxidized copper content. Thus, the increase of the value of the parameter In Finally, in This work was motivated by the problem of improving efficiency and quality of the froth flotation process used in the mineral processing industry. For many years, the flotation process has been controlled empirically by human operators whose decisions may lead to poor performance and the decrease of the concentrate production profitability. In some cases an increase of even several percent in recovery and/or concentrate grade may have a significant economic effect and convert previously subeconomic mineral concentrations into valuable ores. In this paper we developed a novel solid mathematical programming-based framework for solving an applied bi-objective industrial problem aimed at improving the performance and efficiency of flotation process. As far as we know, this is one of the first attempts at using deterministic global and multi-objective optimization techniques to improve such an industrial process. This is an innovative contribution as most of the related optimization problems are usually non-convex and, thus, challenging for traditional optimization methods. Note that we applied our approach to a bi-objective non-convex quadratic problem, but it can easily be adapted to any bi-objective problems with non-convex (DC) objective functions. For example, some economic performance indices involving economies of scale can be considered. From the practical point of view, the proposed framework is quite a flexible tool which can quickly provide operators with a large set of equally good options to achieve the best performance according to specific requirements. The application of the developed framework to a specific case study – the optimization and determination of the best operating conditions of rougher copper flotation performed at the Erdenet Mining Corporation Mineral Processing Plant (Mongolia) – demonstrated its efficiency and versatility appreciated by the corporation's engineering managers.
