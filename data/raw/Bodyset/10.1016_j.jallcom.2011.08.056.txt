An approach is used to improve the remanent polarization of BiFeO3 thin films, where the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film with (111) orientation was grown on the SrRuO3/SrTiO3(111) substrate by rf sputtering. A higher dielectric constant and a lower dielectric loss are demonstrated for the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film as compared with those of pure BiFeO3 thin film. The introduction of Zn deteriorates the magnetic properties of BFO thin films. A giant polarization value of 2P

                     ∼268.5μC/cm2 is induced for the BiFe0.96Zn0.04O3 thin film as confirmed by PUND, owing to the (111) orientation, the introduction of Zn, and a low leakage current density.BiFeO Several different measurements have been conducted for improving the ferroelectric properties of BFO thin films by reducing the leakage current density at room temperature, such as the employment of a single crystal substrate In the present work, we hope to further improve the ferroelectric properties of bismuth ferrite thin films by combining the site engineering, the single crystal substrate, and the orientation modification, where the BiFe BiFe The phases of thin films were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (DX-1000, Dangdong, PR China). Magnetic properties of thin films were measured by using the superconducting quantum interference device. Their ferroelectric behavior was studied by the Radiant precise workstation (RT2000 Tester, USA). An HP 4294 analyzer was used to characterize the dielectric behavior. The leakage current was measured by using a Keithley meter (Keithley 6430, Cleveland, OH).
