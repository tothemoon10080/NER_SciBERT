 The liberation of building rubble by comminution produces a predominantly mineral mixture with a density distribution of ρ The separation processes currently employed in the recycling of building materials [ Wet and dry separation have different advantages and disadvantages, Schubert [ An upward flow or single-stage cross-flow separators commonly employed for dry separation in an air flow separate the material feed according to the respective settling velocities of the different components. The separation behaviour is influenced decisively by the particle size, particle shape and particle density of the components to be separated. An air classifier can separate the material according to one of these parameters providing the influence of the other two variables is minimised. The separation of totally or partially liberated aggregate particles in the size range from d = 2 − 16 mm therefore presents a challenge to the separation sharpness and the efficiency of the equipment. As the models of counter-current separations drawn up so far [ Balancing now the particle flow in a zigzag channel by means of the Fokker-Planck-Equation for convective and turbulent diffusive transport as well as taking into account the turbulent particle flow-around pattern in one overflow z This fractional grade function For a symmetrical separation with the same number of stages in the lightweight and heavy particle flow (z Hence, the secant slope of the separation function can be characterised by an elegant analytical formulation of the overall separation sharpness for T Separation in the turbulent particle flow pattern can only be achieved with appropriate separation sharpness if the separator has a comparably high number of separation stages and if a sufficiently high ratio between the lightweight and heavy material volume flow rates Because of this fact, the multistage separation model should be generalised for a wide range of process goals and flow pattern concerning the characteristic particle settling velocity, see For the separation of minerals, a test rig, consisting of a zigzag channel with improved design compared to predecessors and a cross sectional area of 173×200 mm As part of preliminary studies, the separation model in For the purpose of comparison, the corresponding model curves with fitted, i.e. effective, stage numbers z  Tests on the separation of concrete-brick mixtures were carried out. It can be seen that the separation results demonstrate considerable scattering in comparison with classification according to From a comparison of the separation experiments with narrowly fractionated concrete-brick mixtures d = 8 − 10 mm ( On this basis, the layout for the separation of a lightweight fraction, here rubber granulate ρ To assess the efficiency of the separation of liberated aggregate particles of concrete rubble fragments, the separation functions were determined and compared with a theoretical model of multistage turbulent cross-flow separation.
