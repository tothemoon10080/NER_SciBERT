Haver & Boecker has added to its existing range of particle size analysis equipment with the launch of the new Haver CPA dynamic image analyser. This machine can measure dry and individual, non-agglomerating particles in bulk materials within the range of 40 Î¼m to 400 mm simply by photographing them and analysing them on a computer. The new device is intended as an electronic replacement for test sieves and, in this case, has been combined with a fully automatic scale, with a gross weighing range from 1 g to 15 000 g for added flexibility.
