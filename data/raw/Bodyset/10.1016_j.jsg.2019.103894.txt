Boom Clay is a soft, slightly overconsolidated, uncemented claystone considered as potential host material for a radioactive waste repository in Belgium. We studied the evolution of microfabrics in samples which were shortened to 20% bulk strain in consolidated-undrained (CU) triaxial experiments at effective confining pressures of 0.375, 0.750 and 1.5 MPa, respectively.
                  Results show a geomechanical behavior in agreement with previous studies, with total strain partly localized in shear zones and partly diffuse outside the shear zones. The diffuse strain is accommodated by pore compaction without any discernible microstructural changes compared to the starting material. In the shear zones, pore collapse reduces SEM-visible porosity and further deformation mechanisms within the shear zones are particulate flow (grain boundary sliding), particle rotation and the formation of microcracks. There is no evidence for comminution of quartz and feldspar grains. Strain localization on macro- and mesoscale is governed by viscosity contrasts between harder clasts (e.g. quartz and feldspar) embedded in a soft, porous, phyllosilicate-rich matrix.
                  Our microstructures are comparable to those observed in Boom Clay deformed naturally and in the excavation damaged zone of the underground research facility. This suggests that our results are representative of Boom Clay's geomechanical behavior at the microscale.Geomechanically, Boom Clay is a phyllosilicate-rich geomaterial transitional between soils and rocks ( Imaging grain-scale deformation microstructures (at sub-micrometre scale) in clay-rich geomaterials is challenging because such materials are difficult to prepare with conventional methods without intensive damage to microfabrics. Microstructural studies are nevertheless required to fully understand the bulk rheology of these materials ( The Boom Clay Formation constitutes of a plastic, uncemented, detrital claystone ( Understanding deformation of Boom Clay is of special interest because of its application to geotechnical problems such as foundations ( Natural deformation of Boom Clay has been studied in outcrops ( Based on microstructural observations and using critical state mechanics, discontinuities are interpreted to have formed consecutively during compaction and consolidation related to burial and the subsequent uplift of the formation: ductile shear bands are interpreted to have formed first before or close after the onset of uplift, followed by hybrid fractures generated during uplift before tensile fractures formed close to the surface ( Deformation experiments, both consolidated-drained (CD) and consolidated-undrained (CU), on Boom Clay samples show (i) variations in main rheological and petrophysical properties ( Microstructures developed during experimental deformation of Boom Clay are well-developed slickensides ( Microstructural analyses using BIB-SEM have not been applied to study experimentally deformed Boom Clay yet. Therefore, this study aims to give a first detailed look at microstructures before and after experimental deformation of Boom Clay in CU tests imaged by BIB-SEM. This will substantially contribute to understand deformation mechanisms and strain localization of this material. Furthermore, this contribution aims to compare the microstructures presented here with the ones observed in Boom Clay deformed naturally and artificially during excavation of the URF at Mol-Dessel ( Finally, results of this investigation on Boom Clay, an uncemented clay, are compared with results obtained by studying the geomechanical behaviour of Callovo-Oxfordian Clay, a diagenically cemented mudrock, using a similar methodological approach ( The Boom Clay core material used in this study originates from the ON-Mol-1 borehole drilled in spring 1997 ( Cylindrical samples (diameter: 40 mm; height: 80 mm) were cut dry with the long axis perpendicular to bedding with a low-speed saw. Three undrained deformation experiments at effective confining pressures (σ′ After the deformation experiments, samples were unloaded and dried slowly over several months (without the rubber jackets) to minimize drying cracks, in an atmosphere with stepwise decreasing humidity. Relative humidity (RH) was controlled by different salt solutions (KCL – RH: 85%; NaCl – RH: 76%; air – 45% < RH < 60%) at room temperature ( Bulk porosities (Φ) before and after the experiments were determined as follows: After deformation and drying, samples deformed at 0.375 MPa and 1.5 MPa were cut dry parallel to both σ Samples for SEM (Zeiss Supra 55) were coated with 7 nm tungsten (Leica EM ACE600) to allow imaging fine microstructural details in true 2D flat cross-sections including sub-micron pores in the clay matrix. Secondary electron (SE) images were acquired to image pores (3 kV acceleration voltage; 8 mm working distance (WD); 20,000× magnification; 14.7 nm pixel size), backscattered electron (BSE) images to visualize phase density contrasts (20 kV acceleration voltage; 8 mm WD; 5,000× magnification; 58.6 nm pixel size), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses to map the elemental composition (20 kV acceleration voltage; 8 mm WD; 3,500× magnification; 83.8 nm pixel size). Single images were stitched automatically using the Kolor Autopano giga 2.0 software ( The representativeness of SEM-visible porosity measurements ( Samples show a trajectory of strain hardening, a poorly defined peak stress and subsequent onset of minor strain softening ( Evaluating these results in a Mohr diagram ( Deformed samples are slightly barrelled and display shear zones indicating localized deformation ( Pores in the clay-rich matrix reflect grain boundaries between individual clay aggregates ( Qualitative microstructural investigations of the undeformed sample and the areas of the deformed samples located outside the shear zones (e.g. Deformed samples display gypsum mineralization within the shear zones ( Furthermore, samples split along the shear plane locally show slickensides and imbricated, flaky clay aggregates aligned parallel to shear displacement ( To study particle and pore size distributions “sieve curves” were generated ( The quantitative observation of apparently smaller grain sizes within the shear zone is supported by qualitative microstructural investigations ( Measured SEM-visible porosities, based on about 10 Whereas there are no micro-cracks observed in the undeformed sample, deformed samples contain micro-cracks outside the shear zones oriented parallel to S In our experiments, the samples experienced the following sequence of perturbations: (i) stress unloading after coring and slight dehydration during the packing in Al-barrier foils at the URF; (ii) water migration and swelling while stored in Al-barrier foils; (iii) swelling and compaction during the saturation and consolidation before the triaxial tests; (iv) stress unloading after the experiments; (v) slow drying after deformation; (vi) sawing and mechanical polishing during subsampling for BIB-polishing; (vii) high vacuum during BIB-polishing and SEM analyses; (viii) high energy electron beam during SEM analyses. It is known that drying of undeformed Boom Clay leads to shrinkage and slight changes of the pore fabric together with shrinkage of swelling clay aggregates ( Pre-existing micro-cracks are expected to have closed during the consolidation phase, which implies that any micro-cracks must have been activated during or after the experiment ( Striking differences between undeformed and deformed samples are (i) intact and commonly dissolved dolomite grains ( Pore pressure drops of samples confined at 0.375 and 0.750 MPa ( The geomechanical behaviour exhibited by deformed samples with stress-strain curves displaying trajectories of strain hardening, poorly-defined peak stresses and subsequent onsets of minor strain softening ( In general, geomechanical parameters (apparent cohesion, angle of internal friction; About 80% of bulk strain is accommodated outside the shear zone (see section Considering that maximum displacement along the shear zone is up to 4 mm ( Microstructures of non-phyllosilicate minerals do not show any evidence of fragmentation such as angular, chipped or abraded edges (e.g. In contrast to the usually framboidal pyrite aggregates in undeformed Boom Clay and in deformed samples outside the shear zone (this study and To identify deformed clay aggregates, nanoscale investigations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) would be necessary ( With their formation being related to syndeformational grain and pore reorientation, the orientation of S Pore size distributions and qualitative microstructural investigations demonstrate that syndeformational dilatancy localized within shear zones: “sieve curves” indicate that pores in the shear zone tend to be larger compared to the undeformed sample and areas located outside the shear zones of deformed samples ( As expected for the large strains achieved in the shear zones (e.g. In addition to identifying acting deformation mechanisms, it is equally important to unravel how and why strain localized to understand the rheology of investigated Boom Clay samples. In the following we discuss constraints on strain localization and propose a conceptual model for the strain localization in experimentally deformed Boom Clay at low confining pressures. Boom Clay is a complex heterogeneous material. However, in order to understand its bulk geomechanical behaviour and how it accommodates strain, it can, in a first approximation, be considered as a two-phase material composed of a strong phase (non-phyllosilicates) embedded within a matrix of a weak phase (phyllosilicates). The proportion of hard to soft phases in deformed samples (1:2; In a two-phase material the strength contrast between clasts and matrix promotes strain localization, i.e. a shear zone evolves in the low-strength phase ( The assumption that strain localizes in zones with a lower fraction of large, hard particles is supported by such bands present in every orientation in the undeformed sample and outside the shear zones of deformed samples ( Deformation-related microstructures observed in naturally deformed Boom Clay comprise shear bands with and without slickensides, hybrid shear fractures and cracks ( Microstructures in our experiments are comparable to those generated during construction processes at the URF at Mol-Dessel, where excavation lead to hybrid failure, slickenside formation and reorientation of phyllosilicates manifested in an excavation damaged zone ( In this first look then, comparisons between Boom Clay deformed artificially (i.e. during experiments and excavation) and naturally indicate that deformation mechanisms inferred in this study (i) are representative of those occurring during URF excavation and in nature at low confining pressure, and (ii) are suitable to extrapolate the understanding of Boom Clay rheology beyond the time scales accessible in the laboratory. While these experimental outcomes appear promising on the first look, a more sophisticated experimental and observational setup is required to fully understand deformation of Boom Clay. Necessary modifications include for example using in-situ pore fluid compositions and measuring the incremental deformation field ( At Bure (France; approx. 220 km ESE of Paris), the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) operates an URF to explore the feasibility of Callovo-Oxfordian Clay to host radioactive waste ( Deformation mechanisms in experimentally deformed Callovo-Oxfordian Clay are predominantly cataclastic with minor crystal plasticity (i.e. inter- and intragranular fragmentation; granular flow and particle rotation resulting in SPOs and particle bending; BIB-SEM investigations of Boom Clay experimentally deformed at confined and undrained conditions provide first detailed insights into the evolution of deformation-related microstructures, which allows in combination with data recorded during the experiments to understand the rheology of this plastic, uncemented claystone. Deformed samples display strong strain partitioning between shear zones and the rest of the samples. Most of the strain (~80%) was accommodated outside the shear zones, mostly by pore collapse. Dominating deformation mechanisms within the shear zones are pore collapse, independent particulate flow (grain boundary sliding) and particle rotation. These mechanisms promoted particle reorientation leading to shape preferred orientations manifested by distinct foliations oblique (P-foliation) and parallel to displacement (Y-shears). Fragmentation of mica grains and intracrystalline deformation leading to bent micas are subordinate. Furthermore, succeeding initial fluid pressure increases in response to pore collapse, the formation of microcracks within shear zones resulted in decreasing pore pressures. On macro- and mesoscale, strain localization is governed by the viscosity contrast between the dominating frictionally weak phyllosilcate-rich matrix and embedded, harder quartz and feldspar grains. At these scales, shear zones localize predominantly in bands where there are less large, hard phases. At the microscale (scale of phyllosilicates constituting the matrix) strain is accommodated within shear zones by particle rotation and subsequent sliding along grain boundaries initiated by the initial phyllosilicate orientation. This “geometric softening” requires sufficiently large initial porosities. Deformation mechanisms deduced from experimentally generated microstructures are very similar to those inferred in Boom Clay having been deformed naturally and artificially during the excavation of an Underground Research Facility at low confining pressures. Consequently, deformation experiments at low confining pressure in combination with microstructural analyses appear suitable to understand Boom Clay rheology on the microscale, which is required to understand its macroscale behaviour. However, further investigations will be necessary to test this hypothesis.
