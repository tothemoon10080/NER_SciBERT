This work is based on the third body concept, from which wear can be defined as the complex competition between third body flows inside a contact. Experimental observations have shown that particle detachments are linked to their definitive ejection from the contact. This paper presents a (DEM) numerical model and proposes a study of the life of a contact, by treating the creation of particles and their ejection separately in order to identify their influence on each other. This work focuses in particular on modelling particle detachments, when the ejection of the particle is imposed. Importnat information is obtained by analysing the stresses in the skin of a degradable granular material.
