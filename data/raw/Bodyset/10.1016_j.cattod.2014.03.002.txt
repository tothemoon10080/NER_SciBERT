The study is about a novel method of decomposing and mineralizing the emerging contaminant ibuprofen (IBP) by catalytic ozonation using catalysts such as high-frequency ultrasound (US) and soluble/insoluble Fe-bearing species. Preliminary experiments with single processes were run to select the optimum values of IBP concentration, O3 flow rate and specific US power as 50μM, 12mgmin−1, and 0.23WmL−1, respectively. It was found that the most critical operation parameter was pH, as it controlled the mass transfer and decomposition of O3, as well as the diffusion of solutes from the bulk solution to the gas–liquid and solid–liquid interfaces. As such, ozonation and sonication alone were most effective at pH 9.0 and 3.0, respectively owing to the higher rate of OH production and gas–liquid interfacial reactions at these conditions. Catalytic ozonation with Fe-bearing species but no ultrasound was most effective at pH 6.5, with a maximum degree of IBP decay in the presence of FeSO4. Catalytic ozonation with ultrasound and solid particles was effective at pH 6.5, but maximum degree of oxidation/mineralization was obtained with nanoparticles of zero-valent iron (ZVI) at pH 3.0 (100%, 58%). The synergy of US+ZVI at acidic pH was attributed to: (i) the massive surface areas enriched with extensive reaction and nucleation sites, (ii) the role of reactive Fe (furnishing out from the metal core onto the catalyst surface) and reactive oxygen species as promoters of Fenton-like reactions, and (iii) the contribution of hydrodynamic shear forces to continuous enhancement and cleaning of the catalytic surfaces.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with more than 70 million global prescriptions annually are a special group of pharmaceuticals that exhibit “persistent toxic waste” character Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have so far emerged as promising solutions to the elimination of refractory micropollutants in water Catalytic ozonation is a modified AOP technology, whereby the rate of ozonation is accelerated by the addition of active metallic catalysts, which also lead to a reduction in the operation cost despite the additional cost of catalyst separation. A similar argument can be found in the literature on the cost efficiency of catalytic ozonation Among a wide variety of heterogeneous catalysts to enhance the rate of ozonation of organic compounds, Fe-bearing minerals have been found highly effective Ultrasonication (US) is also an advanced oxidation technology, whereby very reactive species including the hydroxyl radical are produced by thermal fragmentation of water molecules and organic solutes via the implosive collapse of gaseous cavity bubbles There are only three studies in the literature related to the catalytic ozonation of IBP, but they all involve heterogeneous catalysis with MnO Ibuprofen was purchased from Sigma with >98% purity and used as received. The chemical structure and some of its environmental properties that are of significance are as given  MW: 206.3 Fresh test samples of IBP were prepared by dissolving the compound in proper volumes of ultrapure water (Mili-Q) at 45 The catalysts, their commercial or given names and particle properties of the solid forms are listed in Preliminary experiments with ozone alone were carried out in 250 Catalytic experiments with Fe-bearing species were run with 50 IBP was analyzed by HPLC using a Shimadzu LC-20AT HPLC with a 20A UV-Vis photo diode array detector set at 220 The aim of preliminary experiments without catalysts was to select the optimum ozone flow rate and pH based on rates of ozone mass transfer and IBP degradation. Mass transfer rate coefficients were estimated using the non-steady state aqueous concentration of O Despite the increasing trend of ozone mass transfer rate with decreasing gas flow ( Ozonation alone was found inadequate for mineralization regardless of the applied conditions, as depicted in Preliminary sonication of IBP without ozone showed that ultrasound was much more effective, justifying our argument in previous section about low reactivity of the compound with molecular ozone and the rate determining effect of HO Preliminary experiments with the solid catalysts and IBP carried out at pH 3.0 and 6.5 showed that adsorption can safely be ignored as a potential elimination pathway during 1-h ozonation, because the disappearance of the compound from solution was none or negligible at short contact times with the catalysts, reaching a maximum after 20-h only in the presence of ZVI and ZVI-graphite at pH 6.5 (22% and 18%, respectively). On the other hand, no leaching of Fe-species was observed at pH 6.5 and various degrees of leaching at pH 3.0, signifying a low probability of Fenton or Fenton-like reactions at pH 6.5 in the bulk solution. Fractions of IBP adsorbed on and Fe Catalytic ozonation with Fe-species were run at The data show that all catalysts except ZVI provided a positive enhancement to the degradation of IBP, while only the solid forms were effective in enhancing the mineralization of the compound. Good performance of the solids in general signifies their reactivity with O Final experiments with O The three solid catalysts were also assessed for their relative performance in the mineralization of IBP, as presented in As in all catalytic processes, the knowledge on regeneration/reuse performances of the catalysts is essential to assess the cost effectiveness of the processes. The stability of Goethite has already been reported by Zhang et al., as 90% after seven consecutive uses The study has shown that ozonation at pH 9.0 provides sufficient decomposition of the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical IBP, but is ineffective for its mineralization (15%), while sonocatalytic ozonation with Fe-bearing species at pH 6.5 provides not only decomposition but also appreciable degrees of mineralization of the compound. As such, pH is the most critical operation parameter for it controls the formation and distribution of reactive oxygen species, the mass transfer and diffusion of ozone and organic solutes within the bulk solution and the gas–liquid/liquid–solid interfaces, and the reactivity of all species on Fe-active surfaces of the solid particles. The study has also shown that both IBP and its oxidation byproducts react very slowly with molecular ozone and the rate of degradation is controlled by the availability of HO The most effective catalysts in the absence of ultrasonic irradiation were FeSO Finally, the study has shown that ultrasound is not only a good catalyzer of ozonation reactions, but also a wonderful means of building up synergies between different processes. As such, maximum IBP elimination and TOC decay were observed after 40-min ozonation of IBP with US and ZVI-graphite (100%, 58%) at pH 3.0, which facilitates the diffusion of solutes from the bulk solution to the bubble–liquid and solid–liquid interfaces. Regarding the additional cost of operation due to reducing the pH from the natural level (6.5) to 3.0, it is possible to consider operating the same process without any pH change, with however a lower degree of mineralization (45%) and thus a higher environmental cost.
