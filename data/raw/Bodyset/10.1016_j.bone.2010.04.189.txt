This work is an attempt to organize the information available about bone nanostructure and improve the models of bone nanostructure and collagen mineralization. Models for the nanostructure of bone matrix assume that bone mineral formation occurs mainly inside collagen fibrils, among collagen macromolecules, and, in lesser quantities, around those fibrils. In this work we evaluate the existing models of collagen mineralization and bone nanostructure. We have determined diameters of collagen fibrils of decalcified and calcified bone from micrographs (present in the literature), for demineralized and mineralized collagen fibrils, respectively. Based on these results, we have predicted the diameter of decalcified fibrils from calcified fibril diameters and
