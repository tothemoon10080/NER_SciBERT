The Sr doped lanthanum manganite coatings were prepared using La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 particles and epoxy modified polyurethane as pigment and resin matrix, respectively. The structure, morphology, surface roughness and infrared normal emissivity (ɛ

                      values in the 8–14μm waveband are higher than those in the 3–5μm waveband. The surface roughness has no significant effect on the infrared emissivity of LSMO coatings. For 50% LSMO coating, the sample shows variable-emissivity property in the 8–14μm waveband and the emissivity property remains unchanged before and after ultraviolet irradiation.As we know, infrared emissivity ( It has been reported that doped manganites at certain doping levels undergo metal–insulator (MI) phase transition Therefore, this work is focused on the infrared emissivity of La LSMO pigment: La LSMO coatings: tinplate substrates were cleaned by 10% dilute H The structure of LSMO was characterized by Bruker D8 X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation (  The SEM images of 10% and 50% LSMO coatings are shown in   In summary, the infrared emissivity of Sr doped lanthanum manganite coatings decreases with LSMO concentration, and the emissivity values in the 8–14 We are thankful for the financial support provided by the
