Particle size reduction and enlargement are regular operations for many industries. Selection of correct equipment and its sizing are the main problems faced by a process engineer in such cases. This chapter discusses the physics of the breakage and aggregation processes in brief and elaborates on the construction and applications of a range of size reduction/enlargement equipment. The energy requirements of such equipment are also discussed.
               Quantification of the size reduction and enlargement process can be carried out using population balance equation (PBE). In this chapter, formulation and solution of PBE for both the breakage and aggregation processes are discussed. Extraction of model parameters from lab-scale equipment is discussed with example.Materials are rarely found in the size range required, and it is often necessary either to decrease or to increase the particle size. When, for example, the starting material is too coarse, and possibly in the form of large rocks, and the final product needs to be a fine powder, the particle size will have to be progressively reduced in stages. The most appropriate type of machine at each stage depends not only on the size of the feed and of the product, but also on such properties as compressive strength, brittleness, and stickiness of the particles. For example, the first stage in the process may require the use of a large jaw crusher and the final stage a sand grinder, two machines of very different characters. At the other end of the spectrum, very fine powders are difficult to handle in some cases. Such fine powders may also give rise to hazardous dust clouds during transport (see In this chapter, the two processes of size reduction and size enlargement are considered in In the materials processing industry, size reduction, or There are a number of other reasons for carrying out size reduction. It may, for example, be necessary to break a material into very small particles in order to separate two constituents, especially where one is dispersed in small isolated pockets. In addition, the properties of a material may be considerably influenced by the particle size; for example, the chemical reactivity of fine particles is greater than that of coarse particles, and the colour and covering power of a pigment are considerably affected by the size of the particles. Also, far more intimate mixing of solids can be achieved if the particle size is relatively small. While the mechanism of the process of size reduction is extremely complex, in recent years, a number of attempts have been made at a more detailed analysis of the problem. If a single lump of material is subjected to a sudden impact, it will generally break so as to yield a few relatively large particles and a number of fine particles, with relatively few particles of intermediate size. If the energy in the blow is increased, the larger particles will be of a rather smaller size and more numerous, and, whereas the number of fine particles will be appreciably increased, their size, however, will not be greatly altered. Therefore, it appears that the size of the fine particles is closely connected with the internal structure of the material, and the size of the larger particles is more closely connected with the process by which the size reduction is effected. This effect is well illustrated by a series of experiments on the grinding of coal in a small mill, carried out by Heywood. The energy required to effect size reduction is related to the internal structure of the material, and the process consists of two parts: first, opening up any small fissures which are already present, and second, forming a new surface. A material such as coal contains a number of small cracks and tends first to break along these weak spots, and therefore, the large pieces are broken up more readily than the small ones. Because a very much greater increase in surface results from crushing a given quantity of fine as opposed to coarse material, fine grinding requires very much more power. Very fine grinding can be impeded by the tendency of some relatively soft materials, including gypsum and some limestones, to form aggregates. These are groups of relatively weakly adhering particles held together by cohesive and van der Waals forces. Materials such as quartz and clinker form agglomerates in which the forces causing adhesion may be chemical in nature, and the bonds are then very much stronger. In terms of energy utilisation, size reduction is a very inefficient process, and only between 0.1% and 2.0% of the energy supplied to the machine appears as increased surface energy in the solids. The efficiency of the process is very much influenced by the manner in which the load is applied and its magnitude. In addition, the nature of the force exerted is also very important, depending, for example, on whether it is predominantly a compressive, an impact, or a shearing force. If the applied force is insufficient for the elastic limit to be exceeded, and the material is compressed, energy is stored in the particle. When the load is removed, the particle expands again to its original condition without doing useful work. The energy appears as heat, and no size reduction is effected. A somewhat greater force will cause the particle to fracture, however, and in order to obtain the most effective utilisation of energy, the force should be only slightly in excess of the crushing strength of the material. The surface of the particles will generally be of a very irregular nature so that the force is initially taken on the high spots, with the result that very high stresses and temperatures may be set up locally in the material. As soon as a small amount of breakdown of material takes place, the point of application of the force alters. Bemrose and Bridgwater Hess and Schönert All of these values are several orders of magnitude higher than the thermodynamic surface energy, which is about 10 During the course of the size reduction processes, much energy is expended in causing plastic deformation, and this energy may be regarded as a waste as it does not result in fracture. Only part of it is retained in the system as a result of elastic recovery. It is not possible, however, to achieve the stress levels necessary for fracture to occur without first passing through the condition of plastic deformation, and, in this sense, this must be regarded as a necessary state which must be achieved before fracture can possibly occur. The nature of the flaws in the particles changes with their size. If, as is customary, fine particles are produced by crushing large particles, the weakest flaws will be progressively eliminated as the size is reduced, and thus, small particles tend to be stronger and require more energy for fracture to occur. In addition, as the capacity of the particle for storing energy is proportional to its volume (∝ The exact method by which fracture occurs is not known, although it is suggested by Piret The method of application of the force to the particles may affect the breakage pattern. Prasher     Although it is impossible to estimate accurately the amount of energy required in order to effect a size reduction of a given material, a number of empirical laws have been proposed. The two earliest laws are due to Kick Writing Because the surface of unit mass of material is proportional to 1/ If Neither of these two laws permits an accurate calculation of the energy requirements. Rittinger's law is applicable mainly to that part of the process where new surface is being created and holds most accurately for fine grinding where the increase in surface per unit mass of material is large. Kick's law more closely relates to the energy required to effect elastic deformation before fracture occurs, and is more accurate than Rittinger's law for coarse crushing where the amount of surface produced is considerably less. Bond Bond Austin and Klimpel A material is crushed in a Blake jaw crusher such that the average size of particle is reduced from 50 to 10 assuming Rittinger's law applies? assuming Kick's law applies? Which of these results would be regarded as being more reliable and why?   This is given by: Thus: and: Thus the energy required to crush 75  This is given by: Thus: and: Thus, the energy required to crush 75 The size range involved in this case should be considered as that for coarse crushing. Because Kick's law is more accurate for coarse crushing, this would be taken as given the more reliable result. One of the first important investigations into the distribution of the energy fed into a crusher was carried out by Owens, In producing elastic deformation of the particles before fracture occurs, In producing inelastic deformation which results in size reduction, In causing elastic distortion of the equipment, In friction between particles, and between particles and the machine, In noise, heat, and vibration in the plant, and In friction losses in the plant itself. Owens In an investigation by the US Bureau of Mines, This conclusion was substantiated in a subsequent investigation of the power consumption in a size reduction process that is reported in three papers by Kwong et al., The velocity of impact, The mass and arrangement of the sample, The initial particle size, and The moisture content of the sample. Between 30% and 50% of the energy of the ball on impact was absorbed by the material, although no indication was obtained of how this was utilised. An extension of the range of the experiments, in which up to 120 In order to determine the efficiency of the surface production process, tests were carried out with sodium chloride, and it was found that 90 The apparent efficiency of the size reduction operation depends on the type of equipment used. Thus, for instance, a ball mill is rather less efficient than a drop weight type of crusher because of the ineffective collisions that take place in the ball mill. Further work There are two distinct methods of feeding material to a crusher. The first, known as If the plant is operated, as in The desirability of using a number of size reduction units when the particle size is to be considerably reduced arises from the fact that it is not generally economical to effect a large size reduction ratio in a single machine. The equipment used is usually divided into classes, as given in A greater size reduction ratio can be obtained in fine crushers than in coarse crushers. The equipment may also be classified, to some extent, according to the nature of the force which is applied, though, as a number of forces are generally involved, it is a less convenient basis. Grinding may be carried out either wet or dry, although wet grinding is generally applicable only with low speed mills. The advantages of wet grinding are: The power consumption is reduced by about 20%–30%. The capacity of the plant is increased. The removal of the product is facilitated, and the amount of fines is reduced. Dust formation is eliminated. The solids are more easily handled. Against this, the wear on the grinding medium is generally about 20% greater, and it may be necessary to dry the product. The separators in The choice of a machine for a given crushing operation is influenced by the nature of the product required and the quantity and size of material to be handled. The more important properties of the feed, apart from its size, are as follows:          Work The most important coarse, intermediate, and fine crushers may be classified as described in The features of these crushers are now considered in detail. The Stag jaw crusher, shown in Stag crushers are made with jaw widths varying from about 150 Because the crushing action is intermittent, the loading on the machine is uneven, and the crusher, therefore, incorporates a heavy flywheel. The power requirements of the crusher depend upon size and capacity and vary from 7 to about 70 In the Dodge crusher, shown in The gyratory crusher shown in The jaw crushers and the gyratory crusher all employ a predominantly compressive force. Friable materials, such as coal, may be broken up without the application of large forces, and, therefore, a less robust plant may be used. A common form of coal breaker consists of a large hollow cylinder with perforated walls. The axis is at a small angle to the horizontal, and the feed is introduced at the top. The cylinder is rotated, and the coal is lifted by means of arms attached to the inner surface and then falls against the cylindrical surface. The coal breaks by impact and passes through the perforations as soon as the size has been sufficiently reduced. This type of equipment is less expensive and has a higher throughput than the jaw or gyratory crusher. Another coarse rotary breaker, the rotary coal breaker, is similar in action to the hammer mill described later and is shown in In the edge runner mill, shown in The hammer mill is an impact mill employing a high speed rotating disc, to which are fixed a number of hammer bars, which are swung outwards by centrifugal force. An industrial model is illustrated in A number of similar machines are available, and in some, the hammer bars are rigidly fixed in position. Because a large current of air is produced, the dust must be separated in a cyclone separator or a bag filter. The Alpine pin disc mill, shown in The Alpine universal mill with turbine beater and grinding track shown in The single roll crusher, shown in Two rolls, one in adjustable bearings, rotate in opposite directions as shown in An idealised system where a spherical or cylindrical particle of radius For steel rolls, the angle of nip is not greater than about 32 degrees. It is clear that the angle of nip is dependent on the coefficient of friction between the rolls and the material. It can be shown that tan( Crushing rolls are extensively used for crushing oil seeds and in the gunpowder industry, and they are also suitable for abrasive materials. They are simple in construction and do not give a large percentage of fines. If crushing rolls, 1 If the actual capacity of the machine is 12% of the theoretical value, calculate the throughput in kg/s when running at 2.0  The particle size may be obtained from: In this case: 2 Thus: The cross-sectional area for flow and the volumetric flowrate Thus, the actual throughput or: (0.0012 The disc crusher shown in The buhrstone mill, shown in The roller mill consists of a pair of rollers that rotate at different speeds, a 3:1 ratio for example, in opposite directions. As in crushing rolls, one of the rollers is held in a fixed bearing, whereas the other has an adjustable spring-loaded bearing. Because the rollers rotate at different speeds, size reduction is effected by a combination of compressive and shear forces. The roller mill is extensively used in the flour milling industry and for the manufacture of pigments for paints.   Some typical figures for power consumption with the Lopulco mill are given in  As the mill operates at high speeds, it is not suitable for use with abrasive materials, nor will it handle materials that soften during milling. Although the power consumption and maintenance costs are low, this machine does not compare favourably with the Lopulco mill under most conditions. It has another disadvantage in that wear will take place if the machine is run without any feed, because no clearance is maintained between the grinding heads and the bull ring. Originally used for the preparation of pulverised coal, the pendulum mill is now used extensively in the fine grinding of softer materials such as sulphur, bentonite, and ball clay as well as coal, barytes, limestone, and phosphate rock. In many industries, the sizing of the raw materials must be carried out within fine limits. For example, the pottery industry might require a product whose size lies between 55 and 65 The crushing force in a pendulum mill may be obtained as follows. Considering one arm rotating under uniform conditions, the sum of the moments of all the forces, acting on the roller and arm, about the point of support O shown in Using the following notation:        For a length d Thus: Thus: The Griffin mill is similar to the pendulum mill, other than it employs only one grinding head, and the separation of the product is effected using a screen mesh fitted around the grinding chamber. A product fineness from 8 to 240 mesh at an output from 0.15 to 1.5 The Szego mill is a planetary ring-roller mill shown schematically in The material is fed by gravity, or pumped into a top-feed cylinder, and is discharged at the bottom of the mill. The particles, upon entering the grinding section, are repeatedly crushed between the rollers and the stationary grinding surface. The crushing force is created mainly by the radial acceleration of the rollers. Shearing action is induced by the high velocity gradients generated in the mill, and hence, the primary forces acting on the particles are the crushing and shearing force caused by rotational motion of the rollers. Attrition is also important, particularly in dry grinding, and impaction also occurs at higher rotational speeds. An important feature is the ability of the roller grooves to aid the transport of material through the mill, thus, providing a means to control residence time and mill capacity. This transporting action is particularly important with materials which would not readily flow by gravity. Pastes and sticky materials fall into this category. The mill has several design variables which may be utilised to meet specific product requirements. The important variables are the number of rollers, their mass, diameter and length, and the shape, size, and number of starts of the helical grooves on the rollers. As the number of rollers is increased, the product becomes finer. Heavier rollers and higher rotational speeds generate greater crushing forces and give higher reduction ratios. The ridge:groove size ratio may also be changed to increase or decrease the effective pressure acting on the particles. The common groove shapes are rectangular and tapered, and the latter will decrease the chance of particles getting stuck in the grooves. The Szego mill has been used for dry as well as wet grinding of coal, in both water and oil, for the preparation of coal-slurry fuels. To grind coal in water to the standard boiler size (80% The mill has also been used to grind industrial minerals and technical ceramics including limestone, lead zirconates, metal powders, fibrous materials (such as paper, wood chips, and peat), and chemicals and agricultural products (such as grains and oilseeds). Because its grinding volume is some 30–40 times smaller than that of a ball mill for the same task, the Szego mill is compact for its capacity. It is characterised by relatively low specific energy consumption, typically 20%–30% lower than in a ball mill, and flexibility of operation. It can give a large reduction ratio, typically 10–20, and grinds material down to a 15–45 The mill has been developed, partly at the University of Toronto, Canada, In its simplest form, the ball mill consists of a rotating hollow cylinder, partially filled with balls, with its axis either horizontal or at a small angle to the horizontal. The material to be ground may be fed in through a hollow trunnion at one end, and the product leaves through a similar trunnion at the other end. The outlet is normally covered with a coarse screen to prevent the escape of the balls. The inner surface of the cylinder is usually lined with an abrasion-resistant material such as manganese steel, stoneware, or rubber. Less wear takes place in rubber-lined mills, and the coefficient of friction between the balls and the cylinder is greater than that with steel or stoneware linings. The balls are, therefore, carried further in contact with the cylinder and, thus, drop onto the feed from a greater height. In some cases, lifter bars are fitted to the inside of the cylinder. Another type of ball mill is used to an increasing extent, in which the mill is vibrated instead of being rotated, and the rate of passage of material is controlled by the slope of the mill. The ball mill is used for the grinding of a wide range of materials, including coal, pigments, and felspar for pottery, and it copes with feed up to about 50 The balls are usually made of flint or steel and occupy between 30% and 50% of the volume of the mill. The diameter of the balls used will vary between 12 and 125 During grinding, the balls wear and are constantly replaced by new ones so that the mill contains balls of various ages, and, hence, of various sizes. This is advantageous because the large balls deal effectively with the feed, and the small ones are responsible for giving a fine product. The maximum rate of wear of steel balls, using very abrasive materials, is about 0.3 In the compound mill, the cylinder is divided into a number of compartments by vertical perforated plates. The material flows axially along the mill and can pass from one compartment to the next only when its size has been reduced to less than that of the perforations in the plate. Each compartment is supplied with balls of a different size. The large balls are at the entry end and, thus, operate on the feed material, while the small balls come into contact with the material immediately before it is discharged. This results in economical operation and the formation of a uniform product. It also gives an improved residence time distribution for the material, because a single stage ball mill closely approximates a completely mixed system. In wet grinding, the power consumption is generally about 30% lower than that for dry grinding, and, additionally, the continuous removal of product as it is formed is facilitated. The rheological properties of the slurry are important, and the performance tends to improve as the apparent viscosity increases, reaching an optimum at about 0.2     The effect on grinding performance of the loading of balls in a mill has been studied by Kano et al.,     The corresponding critical rotational speed, In this equation,  A ball mill, 1.2  The critical angular velocity is given by: In this equation, The actual speed The optimum speed of rotation lies in the range (0.5 This is equivalent to: (2.42 the speed of rotation should be halved.  The mill may be used wet or dry, although wet grinding facilitates the removal of the product. The costs of installation and power are low. The ball mill may be used with an inert atmosphere, and, therefore, can be used for the grinding of explosive materials. The grinding medium is cheap. The mill is suitable for materials of all degrees of hardness. It may be used for batch or continuous operation. It may be used for open or closed circuit grinding. With open circuit grinding, a wide range of particle sizes is obtained in the product. With closed circuit grinding, the use of an external separator can be obviated by continuous removal of the product by means of a current of air or through a screen, as shown in The tube mill is similar to the ball mill in construction and operation, although the ratio of length to the diameter is usually 3 or 4:1, as compared with 1 or 1.5:1 for the ball mill. The mill is filled with pebbles, rather smaller in size than the balls used in the ball mill, and the inside of the mill is so shaped that a layer of pebbles becomes trapped in it to form a self-renewing lining. The characteristics of the two mills are similar, although the material remains longer in the tube mill because of its greater length, and a finer product is therefore obtained. In the rod mill, high carbon steel rods about 50 The Hardinge mill, shown in The sand mill, or stirred ball mill, achieves fine grinding by continuously agitating the bed of grinding medium and charge by means of rotating bars which function as paddles. Because of its high density, zircon sand is frequently used as the grinding medium. A fluid medium, liquid or gas, is continuously passed through the bed to remove the fines, as shown in In cases where it is important that the product should not be contaminated with fine fragments of the grinding medium, A serious limitation of the ball or tube mill is that it operates effectively only below its critical speed, as given by Eq. A ball of mass A centrifugal force attributable to rotation about the axis of gyration (radius A centrifugal force attributable to rotation of the cylinder (radius In unit time, the total number of revolutions of the cylinder is In addition, the gravitational force acts on the particle, although, under normal operating conditions, this is small compared with the centrifugal forces. At the critical condition: If The positive sign applies when It may be noted that it is necessary to take account of It is possible to achieve accelerations up to about 15 Another way of increasing the value of the critical speed, and so improve the performance of a mill, is to increase the effective value of the acceleration due to gravity By imparting a vibrating motion to a mill, either by the rotation of out-of-balance weights or by the use of electromechanical devices, accelerations many times the gravitational acceleration may be imparted to the machine. The body of the machine is generally supported on powerful springs and caused to vibrate in a vertical direction. Vibration frequencies of 6–60 The vibration mill has a very much higher capacity than a conventional mill of the same size, and consequently, either smaller equipment may be used, or a much greater throughput obtained. Vibration mills are well suited to incorporation in continuous grinding systems. Colloidal suspensions, emulsions, and solid dispersions are produced by means of colloid mills or dispersion mills. Droplets or particles of sizes < As shown in The gap setting between rotor and stator is not necessarily in direct proportion to the droplet size or particle size of the end product. The thin film of material continually passing between the working surfaces is subjected to a high degree of shear, and consequently, the energy absorbed within this film is frequently sufficient to reduce the dispersed phase to a particle size far smaller than the gap setting used. The rotor speed varies with the physical size of the mill and the clearance necessary to achieve the desired result, although peripheral speeds of the rotor of 18–36 Some of the energy imparted to the film of material appears in the form of heat, and a jacketed shroud is frequently fitted around the periphery of the working surfaces so that some of the heat may be removed by coolant. This jacket may also be used for circulation of a heating medium to maintain a desired temperature of the material being processed. In all colloid mills, the power consumption is very high, and the material should, therefore, be ground as finely as possible before it is fed to the mill. Another form of mill which does not give quite such a fine product is the jet pulveriser, in which the solid is pulverised in jets of high pressure superheated steam or compressed air, supplied at pressures up to 3.5 The microniser, probably the best known of this type of pulveriser, effects comminution by bombarding the particles of material against each other. Preground material, of about 500 Gaseous fluid, often compressed air at approximately 800 The majority of applications for fluid energy mills are for producing powders in the sub-sieve range, on the order of 20 A section through a typical microniser is shown in Another pulveriser in this group is the Wheeler fluid energy mill, which is in the form of a vertical loop. The preground feed material is injected toward the bottom of the loop in which are situated the nozzles for admitting the compressed air or superheated steam. Size reduction occurs as a result of bombardment of the particles against each other, and classification is effected by arranging for the fluid to leave the circulating gas stream through vanes which are situated just downstream of the top of the loop and on the inner face of the loop. Oversize particles continue their downward path with the circulating fluid and reenter the reduction chamber for further grinding. Several techniques have been developed for specialised applications, as discussed by Prasher.     There are many situations in which fine particles are difficult to handle, mainly due to the fact that particles in bulk do not flow readily because of their tendency to adhere together as conglomerates as a result of the action of surface forces. In such cases, the finer the particles, the greater is their specific surface, and the gravitational forces acting on the particles may not be great enough to keep them apart during flow. The flowability of particulate systems can sometimes be improved by the use of “glidants,” which are very fine powders which are capable of reducing interparticle friction by forming surface layers on the particles, thereby combating the effects of friction arising from surface roughness; they can also reduce the effects of electrostatic charges. However, the optimisation of particle size is by far the most important method of improving flow properties. As discussed in Fine particles may be difficult to discharge from hoppers as particles may cling to the walls and form bridges at the point of discharge. Although such problems may be minimised, either by vibration or by mechanical stirring, it is very difficult to overcome them entirely, and the only satisfactory solution may be to increase the particle size by forming them into aggregates. In addition, very fine particles often give rise to serious environmental and health problems, particularly as they may form dust clouds when loaded into vehicles, and in windy conditions, may become dispersed over long distances. Although the particles involved may, in themselves, be inert, serious respiratory problems may result if these are inhaled. In such situations, particle size may be a critical factor because very fine particles may be exhaled, and very large particles may have a negligible effect on health. In this respect, it may be noted that the particular health hazard imposed by asbestos is largely associated with the size range and shape of the particles and their tendency to collect in the lungs (see The size of particles may be increased from molecular dimensions by growing them by crystallisation from both solutions and melts as discussed in volume 2B. Here, dissolving and recrystallising may provide a mechanism for controlling both particle size and shape. It may be noted, as also discussed in A desired particle size may also be achieved by building up from fine particles, and one example of this is the production of fertiliser granules by agglomeration, or by a repeated coating process. Another example is the formation of pellets or pills for medicinal purposes by the compression of a particulate mass, often with the inclusion of a binding agent that will impart the necessary strength to the pellet. von Smoluchowski There are essentially two types of processes that can cause agglomeration of particles when they are suspended in a fluid:   According to Söhnel and Mullin, For The stability of the aggregates may be increased by the effects of mechanical interlocking that may occur, especially between particles in the form of long fibres. It is often desirable to add a liquid binder to fill the pore spaces between particles in order to increase the strength of the aggregate. The amount of binder is a function of the voidage of the particulate mass, a parameter that is strongly influenced by the size distribution and shape of the particles. Wide size distributions generally lead to close packing, requiring smaller amounts of binder, and, as a result, the formation of strong aggregates. As discussed in volume 2B, the size distribution of particles in an agglomeration process is essentially determined by a In general, starting with a mixture of particles of uniform size, the following stages may be identified:     It is difficult to build these four stages into a mathematical model because the kinetics of each process is not generally known, and therefore, more empirical methods have to be adopted. Processes commonly used for size enlargement are listed in  In this case, particle size is largely determined by the size of the droplet of liquid or suspension, which may be controlled by a suitably designed spray nozzle. The aggregates of dried material are held together as a result of the deposition of small amounts of solute on the surface of the particles. For a given nozzle, the drop sizes will be a function of both flow rate and liquid properties, particularly viscosity, and to a lesser extent, outlet temperature. In general, viscous liquids tend to form large drops, yielding large aggregates.  (c) (d) In (e)  (f) With many materials, agglomeration may be achieved by heating, as a result of which, softening occurs in the surface layers. For the formation of porous metal sheets and discs, high temperatures are required. (g) If a material is subjected to very high compaction forces, it may be formed into sheets, briquettes, or tablets. In the tableting machines used for producing pills of pharmaceuticals, the powder is compressed into dies, either with or without the addition of a binder. Powder compaction may also be achieved in roll processes, including briquetting, in which compression takes place between two rollers rotating at the same speed—that is, without producing any shearing action. In pellet mills, a moist feed is forced through die holes where the resistance force is attributable to the friction between the powder and the walls of the dies. A commercial pelleting process, used for powdery, lumpy, and pasty products, is illustrated in Quantitative models are frequently needed to predict the particle size distribution (PSD) after milling or agglomeration process. Unlike other chemical engineering systems, modelling of particulate systems requires a number balance equation along with mass, energy, and momentum balances. This number balance equation is known as Population Balance Equation (PBE). PBE describes the evolution of the particle size distribution (PSD) with time. In this section, we shall discuss a few key ideas and develop the population balance equation for breakage and aggregation processes. Although breakage and aggregation of solid particles will be in focus, the framework developed in this section is general and can be used for a variety of situations such as predicting the final molecular weight and its distribution from a polymerisation reactor, total available mass transfer surface in a mixer-settler, or the shape and size of a crystals from a crystallizer. A detailed discussion on the application of population balance modelling to wide variety of problems is provided by Ramkrishna and Singh. The first step for modelling of a system of particles is to represent a set of particles mathematically. Usually, a particle can be represented by its size. The simplest example is a spherical particle which can be described by its diameter. Because most particles are non-spherical, a representative size can be used. In Particles are not stationary and always undergo motion in the mill. The location of the particle might also be important. For example, a ball mill has zones where vigorous impact occurs (the top layer of balls) as well as milder rolling action zones (between the mill and the balls). The size and size distribution of comminuted particles will be different in these two zones. The location of a particle in a mill with respect to a fixed coordinate system is called its Although mills might have inhomogeneous regions, it is difficult to take such effects into account, especially when all three space dimensions are involved. Hence, for practical purposes, mills are often considered to be well mixed. In that case, only internal coordinates are needed. In this section, we shall assume mills to be well mixed and consider only internal coordinates. If spatial nonhomogeniety is to be considered, the multidimensional population balance equation (Kuvadia and Doherty Sometimes particles need to be characterised by more than one internal variable. For example, if we are interested in the aspect ratio of particles, we need both length and breadth of the particle. Such a need frequently arises for pharmaceutical powders. In the manufacturing of pharmaceutical powders, needle like shape ("habit") is to be strictly avoided because such forms create problems in downstream processing. Although multidimensional problems resulting from such descriptions can be formulated readily, their solution is computationally intensive. Hence, simplified assumptions should be used to reduce the dimensionality of the problem whenever possible. In this section, we shall assume that a one-dimensional description of a set of particles is adequate. The reader is referred to advanced texts and references (Chakraborty and Kumar  A concentrated slurry containing spherical particles is settling in a tall cylindrical vessel. The particles can form an agglomerate if in contact. Assign the appropriate internal and external coordinates to the particles. Flat, sheet-like particles (nanosheets Cu, shown in  Because the slurry contains spherical particles, the particle diameter can be used as the internal coordinate. Settling of dense slurry produces crowding of particles toward the bottom of the vessel. Hence, external coordinates will be required. In a cylindrical vessel, the particle density does not vary appreciably in Because the crystallizer is generally well mixed, the external coordinates are not required. Because the particles are nonspherical, more than one length dimension is needed to describe them. It appears that length, breadth, and thickness should be used to characterise the particles. This will require a 3-D population balance approach. It can be seen that the thickness of the particles does not vary appreciably, and hence, it can be taken to be constant. This keeps the dimensionality of the system to two. Further, if we can assume all particles are of the same aspect ratio, the dimensionality reduces to one. Such simplifications, if possible, are very useful for modelling of the breakage and aggregation processes. Without the requirement of external coordinates and only one internal coordinate to describe the particle, powders can be represented by a size distribution curve (shown in The number density function is very similar to probability density function. As probability can be obtained by integrating the probability density function within the required limits, the number of particles within a size range can be obtained by integrating the number density function within the limits. For example, the number of particles in between the size It is also clear that the number of particles in a differential size range d For modelling breakage and aggregation, a set of mathematical functions is used. These functions are called breakage functions and aggregation efficiency for the respective processes. As described by Ramkrishna,  This function quantitatively describes the propensity of particles of a certain size toward breakage. In  Like breakage frequency, the average number of daughter particles is dependent on particle size. However, there are cases where it remains constant. One such example is cell division, where  The daughter distribution function must obey the following constraints: In the above,  Verify if the following daughter distribution function satisfies the required constraints for binary breakage:  It can be readily seen that The second constraint Hence, the given kernel satisfies the required constraints. In a grinding and/or aggregation process, the number of particles changes due to breakage, aggregation, or a combination of both. Other processes like in-out, nucleation, or growth may also be present, but we consider only breakage and aggregation in a batch mill in this chapter. First, we shall develop the number balance for breakage alone. To write the number balance for breakage, we consider a differential strip on the size axis, as shown in Particles in this size range break, become smaller, and are, therefore, removed from this size class. Larger particles break, and some of them fall into the size ranging from Now, we need to quantify these two processes by using the breakage functions. The number of particles in the differential strip of interest is given by The breakage birth term is a little complicated. To elucidate this term, let us consider another differential size range, from Any such differential domain larger than In should be noted that the breakage number balance equation is a linear partial The number balance for the aggregation process can be written in a similar way. Like breakage birth and death, there will be aggregation birth and death terms. For particles of a specific size, aggregation death corresponds to a process in which particles in the said range aggregate with other particles and, therefore, grow in size and are removed from the size range of interest. Two smaller particles of size Expressions for aggregation birth and death terms can be written by recognising the binary aggregation as a second order process. Let us consider a pair of particles where one of the particles is from size In aggregation birth, two particles of size It is important to note that the form of the equation relating The functional relation between With this understanding, the aggregation birth term may be written as: Because In this case, Combining aggregation birth and death terms and cancelling d In both aggregation and breakage equations, the phenomenology of the process is tucked into the breakage and aggregation functions. These are also called breakage and aggregation Formulate the aggregation population balance equation where the internal coordinate is the particle radius.  All other parts of the aggregation equation remain the same except for the aggregation birth term. The functionality in Eq. Therefore, the aggregation birth term becomes: It can be seen that the number balance equations are useful if the kernels are known. There are various ways by which kernels can be obtained. The foremost one is through phenomenological models. For a few breakage and aggregation processes, such phenomenological functions can be obtained. For example, if particle breaks into two fragments distributed evenly around the middle size, a simple argument leads to analytical expressions for breakage functions. Such a situation arises for polymer degradation in high-shear extensional flow where a polymer chain has the highest probability to break at the midpoint. Because it is a binary breakage, The quantity Note that the above expressions provide the “normalised” form of the kernels, and proportionality constants should be included for matching with the experimental data. For most cases of solid particle breakage, the breakage process is more complicated, and kernels are mostly empirical. For breakage frequency, a power law is most frequently used: It is generally observed that the rate of breakage is also dependent on the granular flow condition inside the mill (Tsoungui et al. For empirical breakage kernels, For daughter size distribution, a cumulative probability distribution function is usually available. A widely used form (Bilgili et al. The cumulative form is preferred because of its monotonic nature. Note that, in the above kernel, the cumulative probability is a function of the ratio of the mother and daughter particle size. The absolute size of the particles is immaterial for determining the size distribution. Such properties are called similarity or scaling behaviour, and are frequently observed (see Kick's law in It is important to note that the form of the daughter distribution function should be determined by keeping the actual process in mind. Different breakage processes produce qualitatively different daughter particles, as shown in The aggregation kernel can also be obtained by writing a suitable phenomenological model. For perikinetic process, the random Brownian motion of particles can be described by a diffusion-like process, and it can be shown that the aggregation kernel is given by Ramkrishna Aggregation kernels for a variety of other situations are also available in standard handbooks (Lewis et al. Constant kernel: The aggregation process is independent of size. Sum kernel: Product kernel: This should be used for stronger size dependent aggregation: It can be seen that the PBE is a nonlinear partial integro differential equation when breakage and aggregation are considered. Hence, its solution is not trivial. Analytical solution is very difficult except for a few simplified cases, and numerical solution is generally needed. Algorithms specifically designed for this equation should be used for its numerical solution. The most well-known algorithm for the solution of the population balance equation is the so-called Fixed Pivot Technique (FPT) (Kumar and Ramkrishna In this algorithm, the population balance equation is integrated over a finite range of internal coordinates to yield a discretized equation. A geometric grid, as shown in For a combined breakage and aggregation, the discretized equation becomes: In this case, particle volume ( An ODE solver needs to be used to solve this equation. The users need to supply the initial condition and change the kernels according to the situation at hand and can obtain the evolution of numbers in each bin. The approximate number density function, if needed, can be obtained by dividing the number by bin width. In some situations, evolution of the entire particle size distribution is not needed, and evolution of a few average properties such as the total number of particles and the number weighted average diameter, etc., need to be tracked as a function of time. These quantities are called moments, and the reader is advised to revisit It can be readily seen that The evolution of To obtain the equation for It can be noted that the second term has number density in After changing the sequence of evaluation of the integrals and changing limits appropriately: It can be seen that the lower moment is dependent on the higher moment for this case, and hence, the system of moments does not form a closed set of equations. This occurs for most cases except a few. For example, if If we write the equations for the first two moments: Obtain the equation for moments for aggregation equation for a constant kernel. Particle mass is the internal coordinate.  From Eq. Now, multiplying both sides of the equation with Changing the limit of the first term: Denoting Expanding the For As the total mass of the system is constant, the first moment remains constant. This serves as a check. For breakage of solid particles in a mill, a discrete form of the breakage equation is more common than the continuous population balance equation (Austin This equation can be readily solved by diagonalization Now, rearranging Eq. Because Denoting Similar to the continuous breakage equation, discrete breakage equation becomes useful if Usually, a form of the breakage function is assumed, and the parameters are obtained by fitting the laboratory milling data to the model. For such fitting, an approximate solution is used instead of the exact solution as given in Eq. It can also be shown that With these simplifications, it is straightforward to obtain the size dependent parameters Berthiaux et al. Determine the selection and breakage matrices for this system. Assume a power law for breakage frequency (  The plot of Ln( It can be seen that straight lines can be fitted to each of the size classes. Using MATLAB curve fitting, the slopes of these lines are obtained, and We have added a size class corresponding to very small size for which the breakage rate is zero. This is required to prevent any mass loss through fragmentation. Using Eq. A plot of ln(
