The temperature induced or generated during deep hole drilling operations is due to the heat generated between the interface of work piece surface and the tool surface. Several research study have been conducted to predict the temperature involved while drilling process as a predominant functions of many parameters like feed rate, torque, depth of cut etc. Similarly many experimental procedures have been conducted by several researchers to measure temperature directly by using thermocouples, infrared measurement, pyrometer, and thermisters etc. There is no precise experimental method is available to measure analytical value of energy, power, heat flux etc, while drilling process. The temperature rigma depends on material compositions and physical properties. This paper presents the influence of temperature on physical properties of some study samples during drilling operations.
