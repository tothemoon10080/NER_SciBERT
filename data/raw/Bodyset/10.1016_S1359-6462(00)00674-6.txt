One of the promising methods of increasing the surface hardness of engineering components is by boriding. Compared to other conventional thermo-chemical surface modification methods like carburizing and nitriding, boriding results in a much higher hardness, wear, oxidation and corrosion resistance Boriding generally results in the formation of FeB and/or Fe Boriding was carried out on mild steel (C 15) plates of 3 mm thickness using a ferroboron based pack process in a muffle furnace at 1223 K for 2 h, to produce a 40 Î¼m thick boride layer. More details of the experimental procedure are described elsewhere  XRD scans of the as-borided specimen confirmed the presence of only Fe    Under the experimental conditions used in the present study, a minimum laser power of 200 W was found essential to break down the needle morphology of the boride case. Laser surface modification using a 250 W beam results in the formation of equiaxed globular borides at the surface along with a significant breakdown of the boride needles away from the surface. Although, laser surface modification is found to significantly reduce the surface hardness, it also reduces the hardness gradient across the case and results in break down of directional structure of the case and thereby results in a significant enhancement in the ductility and toughness of the case. Laser surface treatment of borided steels with a power of 150 W or lesser results in the deterioration of the case microstructure and properties.
