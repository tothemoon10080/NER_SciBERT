The special requirements for frother were raised because of the higher height, thickness foam layer and highly turbulent middling circulation circumstance of cyclonic-static microbubble flotation column (FCSMC). The characteristics of 730 series frother were studied for selecting suitable frother for copper sulfide ore separation by FCSMC. And copper sulfide ore flotation experiments were tested by laboratory FCSMC. The results indicate that the foaming ability of 730C is well which can form much more gasliquid interfaces at the same reagent dosages, 730E is the most stable frother. And frother 730C has satisfactory effect by laboratory FCSMC to separate copper sulfide ore, and the suitable gas hold-up is in the range of 22%-24%.
