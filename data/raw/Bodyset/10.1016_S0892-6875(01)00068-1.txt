Most ilmenites can be improved by reducing the level of alumina—silicate coatings on the ilmenite grains. A batch and pilot-scale study has shown that the Hicom mill can be used as a high-intensity attritioning device to successfully remove a significant proportion of the alumina—silicate coatings on the surface of ilmenite grains, leading to increased product quality and recovery efficiencies. Although normally used as a grinding mill, the Hicom mill has also found application in intensive attritioning areas such as diamond recovery plants and minerals sands. Small-scale attritioning tests on ilmenite samples in a batch Hicom mill showed that significant reductions in surface coating levels were obtained at energy inputs of 5 to 20 kW.h/t. Typical reductions at 10 kW.h/t on one sample were: Al2O3 reduced by 34%, and SiO2 reduced by 30%. These reductions are comparable to acid leaching results, and add significant value to the product. Lower and higher energy input levels resulted in correspondingly lower or higher reductions in SiO2 and Al2O3. The batch tests were repeated on a bulk sample of heavy mineral concentrate using a 25kW Hicom pilot plant running continuously in open circuit, at feed rates up to 1.5 t/h. Attrition energy levels were varied by altering the discharge open area in order to verify the batch test results.
