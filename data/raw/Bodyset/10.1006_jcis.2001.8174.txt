The adsorption behavior of tallow 1,3-propanediamineâ€“dioleate (Duomeen TDO) collector on albite and quartz minerals is assessed through Hallimond flotation, zeta potential, and diffuse reflectance FTIR investigations, together with the species distribution of the collector. The collector performance on albite separation from a natural feldspar material is evaluated in bench scale flotation tests. The Hallimond flotation responses of the minerals as a function of pH and collector concentration indicate that albite can be selectively floated from quartz at pH 2 where the doubly positively charged collector species adsorb on albite but not on quartz. However, the zeta potential and infrared spectra reveal that the adsorption behavior of the collector is similar on both minerals. The discrepancy in the flotation and adsorption results is attributed to the coarse and fine particle size fractions, and the shorter and longer equilibration periods employed in these studies respectively. The comparable adsorption on fine particles of albite and quartz at pH 2 is explained by the interaction of ammonium ions on silanol groups by hydrogen bonding as well as electrostatic interactions. The changes in zeta potentials are in good agreement with the formation of ionic species and free molecular forms of the collector. The IR spectra show the coexistence of neutral oleic acid together with charged amine species at low pH values in accordance with the species distribution diagram. Selective flotation of albite is accomplished from a natural feldspar material with tallow diamine-dioleate collector at pH 2 using sulfuric acid, only when the feed is deslimed prior to the bench scale flotation tests. An albite recovery exceeding 85% is achieved from a feed material containing about 50% albite.
