Fluorapatite and magnesium-substituted fluorapatite powders synthesized by the precipitation method were pressureless sintered in the range 900–1300 °C. The results showed that both materials exhibited a good sinterability. Concerning fluorapatite, a relative density of about 97% was attained at 1050 °C for 1 h. Although the incorporation of Mg into the apatite framework induced a slight decrease in the density, the substituted samples presented slightly higher mechanical properties. The maximum values of flexural strength, fracture toughness, hardness and Young's modulus of these latter samples were about
