This work describes an investigation on the ceramic encapsulation of mineral residues, and refractories residues in special, by a chemically bonded ceramic technique, using a new binder system based on potassium and magnesium phosphate. This process shows as advantage to the conventional chemically bonded ceramics based on Portland and high alumina cements a less permeable and soluble structure, which is more compatible with the treatment of noninert and even more environmentally dangerous residues. The mechanical strength developed by this ceramic, with cold crushing strength above 40MPa after 24h of curing, allows its use in a great variety of applications. The development of high mechanical strength within a short period of curing makes possible some uses where conventional binders have limitation. The efficacy of the encapsulating concrete was demonstrated by chemical, physical, mineralogical and microstructural characterization methods and also assessed by standardized leaching tests.Residues generated by the industry, dangerous or not dangerous, inert or not, are one of the great concerns for the environmentalists in the present time. The ceramic encapsulation technique can be the ideal solution to prevent that these residues are disposed in landfills or inadequate places. In this process, the residue is incorporated into a ceramic mixture, being formed and treated to acquire physical–chemical properties which makes it useful to the society ( Some alternative processes for ceramic encapsulation already exist ( A new process of ceramic encapsulation was recently developed by the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States and has received the name “Ceramicrete”. The process is very similar to the one of a concrete, where the hydraulic binder in this case is based on a phosphate solution, preferentially a potassium phosphate. The “Ceramicrete” technology involves the mixture of a solid or liquid residue and an initiating oxide powder, blending this pre-mixture with an acid phosphate solution in order to get a suspension, pouring this mix in a mold and leaving it to harden. One of the most used initiating oxides is calcined MgO ( When stirred in an acid phosphate solution, MgO is dissolved liberating cations that react with the phosphate anions to form a gel. This gel will crystallize later and consolidate into a ceramic material ( The Brazilian refractories industry produces about 450,000 tonnes per year of products and it is estimated that after use, 32% of this total, that is, 144,000 tonnes is transformed into refractory scrap. Part of this stuff is processed and recycled and the other part (contaminated) is transformed into residue ( Samples were prepared initially from mixtures containing silica sand as standard aggregate, with sand simulating the behaviour of a residue ( In addition to quartz sand, the following residues from several refractory types have also been encapsulated using this technique: high alumina brick with Al The use of an additive as retarder, for raising the mix working time, such as boric acid, is important to control the exothermic reaction that occurs between the phosphate and magnesium oxide, thus making possible the treatment of a great amount of material. The working time and the reaction temperature evolution can, therefore, be controlled in a level desired for handling the mixture during the application. Levels of 0.5% boric acid are shown to be adequate to all types of residues studied ( The wet mixes were molded by vibration, using a process similar to concrete. The main analysed parameters were the working time, pH, reaction temperature evolution, mechanical resistance development with curing time, and the mineralogical phases and microstructures developed. The mix was performed in a planetary-type mixer and molded on a shake table in forms with standardized parts with dimensions of 160 Many physical and instrumental methods were used with the objective of getting information on the encapsulated ceramics produced with the residues studied. The following physical, mechanical, chemical and mineralogical properties were evaluated: apparent porosity (ABNT NBR 6220 and NBR 8592), mercury porosimeter (Micromeritics Poresizer 9320 equipment), setting time (ABNT NBR 8382), reaction temperature, pH, compressive strength at room temperature (ABNT MB 71 and NBR 11222; Kratos 10t press), X-ray diffraction (PHILIPS PW 1730/10 model), optical microscopy (Carl Zeiss Ultraphot-II microscope), scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis (SEM-EDS – microprobe Jeol JXA-50A), infrared spectrometry (Perkin–Elmer Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer, model FTIR 1760X), leaching (ABNT NBR 10.005) and solubility (ABNT NBR 10.006). According to the leaching test used, the material is ground to below 9.5 The ratio between the magnesium oxide and the potassium phosphate (KH The amount of the reagents in the mixture, the MgO source and the KH The room temperature compressive strength developed by these ceramics, with values above 40 The potassium and magnesium phosphate, KMgPO The displays of chemical elements obtained in the SEM-EDS show that the MgO sinter particles are dissolved from the surface and the dissolution intensity varies throughout the sample, what can explain the gel presence in part of the material after a long period of curing. The gel can be consequence of the local magnesium deficiency, necessary for the reaction of formation of KMgPO Results of mercury porosimeter studies show that the size of the pores reduces with the curing time, leaving a more impermeable ceramic body ( Compositions with different types of refractory residues (see footnotes on Leaching and solubility tests for refractory scraps from high alumina and fireclay bricks ( It is possible to obtain ceramic structures with compressive strength at room temperature close to 40 The ceramic encapsulation of solid residues and specifically of refractories residues is feasible with the use of this technique. High mechanical resistance, low apparent porosity and low pore size distribution were obtained, what contributes to confine the residues within a ceramic structure. The very low solubility values for the binder may be used to confine dangerous refractory residues, but studies need to be done to optimize the mix for each kind of residue. Ceramic structures made from refractory residues using this binder system have a limited application in the refractory field due to liquid formation at relatively low temperatures; therefore, they can be used only in temperatures below 1200
