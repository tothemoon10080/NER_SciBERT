The aim of this work was to study gold stripping from activated carbon using a range of different alcohols (isopropanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol). The experimental work was carried out on a laboratory scale, using activated coconut carbon, at 40 to 80 °C and up to 8 h extraction time. Isopropanol was the most rapid eluent with >98% Au eluted after 1 h at 80 °C, ethylene glycol had a similar extraction after 2 h, ethanol was the least effective with 5 h required for >95% extraction. Interestingly, 77% Au extraction was obtained at 40 °C using ethylene glycol.
                  A second order semi-empirical model was used to successfully describe the stripping. The activation energies were >57 kJ/mol, indicating that desorption was rate determining. The following order of the estimated kinetic constants has been observed at any investigated temperature: K

                     ethanol indicating that isopropanol was the best organic compound for the gold stripping process among the selected compounds investigated in this work. From a practical viewpoint, the non-flammability of ethylene glycol makes it the most attractive.Gold solubilised during cyanidation can be recovered by precipitation on powder of zinc (Merrill–Crowe process) or by adsorption onto activated carbon ( In the present work the efficiency of the alcohol use in gold stripping process from previously loaded activated carbon was investigated, with the aim to find an interesting alternative for gold stripping, which might be cheaper than conventional systems. In particular, the effects of extraction time and of temperature on the gold desorption rate have been investigated, in the presence of different hydro-alcoholic eluants (containing NaOH and no cyanide). Furthermore, kinetic data were successfully fitted by a second order semi-empirical model whose parameters gave important information concerning the elution kinetics. Gold stripping from loaded activated carbon was carried out utilising the following analytical grade regents: ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, sodium hydroxide and demineralised water. The gold-loaded carbon was obtained by loading cocoanut carbon from a cyanide process solution containing 5.55 mg Au/L, the final carbon loading was 2.56 g Au/kg carbon. Extraction tests were performed on a continuous basis in a water-jacketed 50 ml glass column containing 10 g of carbon. Stripping solution was pumped up through the bed with 10 ml samples withdrawn during the process. Gold was recovered from the pregnant solution by electrowinning, and the barren solution was recycled through the stripping vessel, after re-heating. All desorption tests were conducted using the following experimental conditions: temperature: 40–60–80 °C; 8 h extraction; pH 12 and a flow-rate of 4 ml/min. Preliminary tests verified that the stripping rates were not controlled by solution supply. The stripping solutions used were water containing 20% The stripping kinetic data were modelled with a second order equation as reported elsewhere for adsorption processes ( From Eq. Integrating Eq. The value of After desorption, carbon was submitted to regeneration stage by acid washing and subsequent thermal treatment ( In all cases, the presence of NaOH in the solvent mixture was needed to achieve high desorption rates and good extents of desorption; in fact, preliminary experiments demonstrate that, without NaOH, gold extraction decreases to about 30% Au. Using hot water/NaOH/NaCN, the kinetics of gold extraction were very slow: only 70% Au was recovered after 36 h and 78% after 72 h. Preliminary tests with hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 25% and 30%   In As expected, temperature plays a positive role on the stripping kinetic and these tests quantified this behaviour. The average chemical composition of the final solutions obtained after the full 8 h desorption process conducted at 80 °C by the different alcohols is given in Also when the desorption process was conducted using ethylene glycol, gold and silver concentrations increased after extraction (i.e. for gold from 5.55 mg/L to about 33 mg/L) whereas Cu, Zn, Fe and S concentrations decreased their concentration in the stripping solution. Gold concentration was higher with respect to the ethanol stripping test but lower in comparison with the isopropanol system. In comparison with the original solution, S concentration decreases from 1.60 g/L S to 38.84 mg/L (by ethanol), to 63.50 mg/L (by isopropanol) and to 70.40 mg/L (by ethylene glycol), due to carbon purification (see It should be noted that the solution concentrations of gold and silver would be significantly higher and those for other metals lower were the desorption process stopped after the gold had been eluted after 2 h. Semi-empirical models were used to fit the results of the stripping tests. Experimental data were fitted by means of a first order kinetic model (  Isopropanol is the best organic compound for the gold stripping process considering the selected compounds investigated in this work. It was shown that, isopropanol is the most effective eluant in the investigated operating conditions. Ethylene glycol gave a gold extraction of 77% Au after 8 h, at 40 °C. This fact is very important, considering that the major disadvantage of alcoholic processes is the potential for fires, but glycols are virtually non-inflammable; moreover, this study demonstrates that ethylene glycol can be used at low temperature. One complete cycle of extraction involves consumption ∼0.3 L of alcohol/t of ore, but this may be reduced via the use of a alcohol recovery system, 0.04 kg/t of NaOH are lost for evaporation and spilling. Other good results concern the high grade of purification of the solution obtained at the end of the process. This fact is demonstrated from the low metals concentration in the final solutions. In particular, Cu concentration was between 1.33 and 4.15 mg/L, after stripping at 80 °C. This aspect is very important for final gold recovery by the subsequent electrowinning stage. Exhausted solutions contain only about 0.1 mg/L Au, after electrowinning. Moreover, laboratory tests have indicated that carbon activity is not adversely impacted by alcohol stripping. The loss of carbon was 0.1 kg/t ore for each cycle. Fresh carbon was found to be able to undergo 6 adsorption–desorption cycles before regeneration was required. Analysis of the experimental data allowed development of a suitable model (Eq. Isopropanol was the best organic compound for the gold stripping process, considering the selected compounds investigated in this work. The process allowed 95-100% gold extraction after 8 h desorption at 80 °C. Elution with ethylene glycol showed 77% elution after 8 h at 40 °C warranting further investigation. Low metals concentration in the final solution demonstrates a high degree of purification of the solutions obtained at the end of the process. Exhausted solutions (after electrowinning) contain only 0.1 mg/L of gold. Complete cycle of extraction involves a low consume of alcohol (0.3 L/t of ore), NaOH (0.04 kg/t), carbon (0.1 kg/t of ore for each adsorption–desorption cycle). Further experimental work will be realised for the process scale up. In particular, during the next phase of the study, adsorption–desorption, carbon regeneration and electrowinning steps will be carried out in a continuous operation. The achieved technical–economical data will allow the evaluation for commercial scale application of the process. The authors are grateful to Mr. P. Fornari and Ms. E.
