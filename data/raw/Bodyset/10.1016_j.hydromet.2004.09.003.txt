Biosorption of heavy metals using membrane reactors as confining devise for free cells is an alternative process to remove these metallic pollutants from aqueous solution. In this paper, experimental data and modelling of heavy metal biosorption onto Sphaerotilus natans cells confined by a ultrafiltration/microfiltration (UF/MF) membrane reactor are reported. Biosorption tests using single and binary metallic solutions (Cu, Pb and Cu–Pb) denoted the biomass affinity (Pb>Cu), the competition among metals simultaneously present in the system, the filtrate flux decline and the change of metal retention coefficient on the membrane for pore plugging by cell fragments. Dynamic modelling is developed considering the unsteady mass balances of the metal in the system and the equilibrium parameters obtained by biosorption batch tests using Langmuir models. Experimental validation of the dynamic models denoted the importance of partial degradation of cells, which is specifically considered in modelling by introducing a time-depending profile for the biomass concentration.Biosorption of heavy metals is an alternative technology to remove these pollutants from aqueous solutions by using low-cost abundant and nonhazardous biomaterials such as marine seaweed, especially propagated biomasses (bacteria, yeast and fungi) and wastes from agricultural and industrial activities ( The main challenges for the industrial application of biosorption technology are the selectivity of the adsorbent in real waste waters (multimetallic systems) and the development and design of continuous processes. Biomass selectivity is strictly related to the mechanisms operating in metal removal, which can be different and simultaneously occurring (physical adsorption, ion exchange, complexation and surface microprecipitation) ( Large scale use of biomass generally requires preliminary immobilisation in polymeric matrixes enhancing the mechanical strength of the particles but also causing additional costs and an increase in mass transfer resistance. Membrane reactors can provide an alternative by retaining the biomass in the system using filtration devices ( This paper aims to investigate biomass selectivity and continuous process design according to the most important aspects related to an up-to-date biosorption research. In particular, previous dynamic models are validated and implemented to represent biosorption data in a membrane reactor [combination of CSTR and ultrafiltration/microfiltration (UF/MF) membrane filter] for both single and binary metal systems by using an especially propagated biomass of  The experimental apparatus for continuous biosorption tests consisted of a glass jacketed vessel (0.2 L) magnetically stirred and kept at constant temperature (25 °C) and a cross-flow polysulfone membrane module for ultrafiltration/microfiltration (UF/MF; tangential velocity=0.3 m/s, transmembrane pressure=200 kPa, total area=36 cm The biomass suspension ( Experimental data of metal concentration in the filtrate and flow rate during continuous biosorption of single and binary metal solutions are shown in Biosorption efficiency of In the case of multimetal systems, the blank is simulated by solving simultaneously the differential equations coming from the mass balances of both metals. These simulations are developed according to two main assumptions derived from previous experimental results ( Preliminary tests without biomass also demonstrated that the membrane itself cannot remove metallic species from solution. Consequently, the metal concentration in the reactor and in the filtrate are the same, and the metal retention coefficient of the membrane ( Comparison of the experimental data and simulated blanks indicates that, for the investigated systems (Cu single system, Pb single system and Cu–Pb binary system), the presence of the biomass in the reactor causes a reduction in the metal concentration in the filtrate due to biosorption onto the cells. Furthermore, from the biosorption data of the Cu–Pb solutions ( Competition between copper and lead can be better denoted by comparing filtrate concentrations obtained both in single and binary solutions for each metal. A quantitative comparison can be obtained reporting the experimental data as dimensionless variables of concentration ( Dynamic models of continuous biosorption can be derived making the following general assumptions: perfect mixing (according to dynamic simulation of blank tests); zero metal retention coefficient (observed in blank tests); negligible transport resistance in the bulk solution (according to good mixing conditions ensured by magnetic stirring and solids recycle in the reactor so that metal concentration in the bulk solution is equal to that near the solid adsorbent). Preliminary kinetic batch tests showed equilibrium was achieved after 20-min contact inasmuch as residence time of the continuous system was greater than this ( The choice of the equilibrium model depends on knowledge of the functional groups on the adsorbent and of the mechanisms operating in metal removal. If a good adsorbent characterisation is available and a wide number of experimental tests are performed in different operating conditions, then a mechanistic model can be developed predicting the effect of environmental factors such as pH, ionic strength and presence of several ionic species and organic ligands in solution. Otherwise, if only preliminary knowledge of the system is available, empirical models such as the Langmuir isotherm and extensions to multicomponent systems can be used to describe the relationship between the equilibrium concentrations of the metal in solid and liquid phases. In the following, the Langmuir isotherm ( These adjustable parameters were determined by single batch biosorption tests ( When binary metal systems are analysed, two distinct equations have to be considered to represent the dynamic behaviour of each component. In addition, the equilibrium relation between metal concentration in the adsorbent phase and in the filtrate has to be chosen considering the competition among metals for the active sites. The equilibrium metal concentrations in the solid ( Langmuir extensions reported in the literature ( Application of these models to batch tests both in single and binary systems denoted that ( Model A, being a predictive model, reproduces exactly the isothermal data of single metal systems, while it does not reproduce adequately the different affinity of metals and their competition in binary systems. Model B, being a corrected extension of Model A, can reproduce exactly single metal system equilibrium data but at the same time highlights the selectivity order which is experimentally observed in binary systems. Model C gives a binary representation that is very similar to Model B, reflecting the different metal affinity for the adsorbent material but does not represent adequately single metal system data. The values of the adjustable parameters of the different equilibrium models are obtained by nonlinear regression of biosorption batch data in binary and/or single systems ( In particular, the correction parameters in Model B fitted to binary data denote that: the effect of lead on copper biosorption is larger than that predicted by Model A on the basis of single metal system data ( the effect of copper on lead biosorption estimated by Model B is lower than that predicted by Model A ( Adjustable parameters for Model C obtained by simultaneously fitting single and binary biosorption data can reproduce competition effects with the following characteristics: the total active site concentration is the same as that found for single metal systems ( the effect of copper concentration on lead biosorption is lower than that estimated only by single metal system regression ( The different equilibrium equations can be inserted in metal mass balances to determine the metal concentrations in the filtrate during time when a step function of feed concentration is considered. For single metal systems, the combination of metal mass balance with the Langmuir isotherm, assuming a constant active biomass concentration in the reactor, gives a first order nonlinear differential equation which can be solved numerically using a Runge–Kutta algorithm (Mathcad 2000 Professional). In the case of binary system under the same assumptions, equilibrium equations Eqs. Analogous equations can be obtained for Dynamic simulations both in single and binary systems account for the experimental evidence of filtrate flux decline during time (due to membrane fouling), introducing a time-dependent empirical function. A first dynamic model can be then developed, defined in the follow as Simul 1, assuming a constant active biomass concentration and zero metal retention coefficient (see Simul 1 model also shows the effect of the different empirical equilibrium models on dynamic predictions ( Model C was the best in representing heavy metal competition in biosorption batch tests ( Dynamic simulations of Model C were performed considering experimental evidence which can be related to the partial cell disruption due to mechanical stressing conditions in the reactor (magnetic stirring and cell recycling from the membrane) and osmotic shock (due to increasing ionic concentration in solution as the test proceeds, and metal is fed in the system). In particular, the filtrate flux decline observed in all the experimental tests can be explained by interaction between cell fragments and membrane pores ( The retention coefficient Both pore plugging and copper complexation by fragments can occur simultaneously, probably causing a change of the copper retention coefficient: in the first case, for the larger dimensions of complexed copper with respect to free aquo-ions and, in the latter case, for the pore size decrease. The experimentally observed trend of metal retention coefficient can be represented by the following empirical model: Adding this model, a second simulation was performed (Simul 2), the metal concentration in the filtrate is determined by the metal concentration in the reactor (assumed to be equal to the metal concentration in the retentate). Even with this modification, Simul 2 cannot represent the experimental trends observed in the different tests, giving very similar predictions to Simul 1, as shown in ( Further model improvement can be carried out by considering that cell degradation also causes a change of the active biomass concentration in the reactor. Different concentration-time functions can be considered, depending on the assumptions about the adsorption performances of cell fragments. A first attempt is made considering a relationship between active biomass concentration and metal retention coefficient, being both changes of cell concentration and metal retention strictly related to cell degradation (Simul 3). The calculated trend for The biomass concentration profile versus time obtained by Eq. The introduction in the metal mass balance (Eq. Analogously, for two metal solutions, Eqs. The inclusion of a time-dependent function for the representation of active biomass concentration and then the relative terms in the differential equations are necessary to have an accurate description of the dynamic behaviour of the system. Although the absolute value of the rate of changing of active biomass concentration during time seems to be small ( The results obtained by Simul 3 for Simul 3 cannot represent adequately the experimental results obtained for the different systems giving predictions very similar to Simul 1 and Simul 2 (simulated values of metal concentration in the filtrate are lower than the measured ones). All these three models (except Simul 3 in the first stage of the test) assume that the active biomass concentration in the reactor is constant and equal to the initial one. Dynamic modelling is then oriented through the search of a function representing the diminution of activity of biosorption in the system. A dynamic model (Model 1) is then developed assuming a constant biomass concentration in the reactor but lower than The new model includes the regression of one adjustable parameter on the base of filtrate metal concentration profiles. The previous Simul parameters were derived from independent sets of experimental data, such as batch tests for equilibrium parameters. Model 1 gives a significantly improved representation of the experimental data in all the tested conditions ( In the case of binary solution, Model 1 predicts that the metal with the lower affinity (in this case copper) presents a concentration in the filtrate larger than in the feed. This phenomenon named overshoot has been experimentally observed during biosorption tests performed in similar membrane apparatus ( A further model, Model 2, can be formulated by giving flexibility to the equation that represents active biomass dependence by time and inserting two adjustable parameters in the previous equation relating This formulation allows both Because of the ineffective addition of a second parameter, a third dynamic model (Model 3) is hypothesised, assuming a decline of biomass concentration according to the equation Dynamic predictions obtained by this last model gives results that are similar to Model 1 and Model 2. In addition, the active biomass concentration profile during time supposed by Model 3 gives the same final values of Model 1 and Model 2 (as an example, see In the last line of Comparison of all models leads to the following conclusions: the active biomass concentration seems to be responsible for the detachment among simulated trends and experimental data obtained for Simul 1, 2 and 3 ( considering the quite good agreement between experimental data and calculated profiles by Models 1–3, then active biomass decline can be supposed to be very fast and to take place in the first few minutes, so that a constant value during the whole biosorption process can be assumed for active biomass, equal to a fraction Experimental data of single and binary metal biosorption in membrane reactor reported in this work denoted the effect of metal competition for the active sites on the biosorbent. Dynamic models are developed as fundamental mathematical tools for the design of continuous biosorption processes in membrane operations and also as a means of understanding the physicochemical phenomena involved. Dynamic models developed for binary biosorption in membrane reactors give an improved representation of experimental data with respect to simple simulations by introducing a minimum number of adjustable parameters (Model 1 and Model 3 are one-parameter models). Nevertheless, a comparison among data and model predictions denoted that these models are not a perfect representation of the experimental trend, systematically underestimating or overestimating the data. Clearly, further experimental investigation is required, especially on the effect of partial biomass degradation on the biosorption.
