The paper presents strategies for control of parallel gravitational coal separation processes in dense media vessels and jigs. These strategies are designed to maximize the yield of the final product at the desired ash content. The principle of circuits operating in parallel at equal incremental ash contents has been discussed from the point of view of its practical application. In the case of an ideal separation process this principle can be reduced to the requirement of equal separation densities for parallel circuits; so far, however, it has not been applied in real industrial processes. The paper includes a discussion on the concept of a separation density and incremental ash for computer simulation of parallel processes and their control. Conclusions from this discussion, presented in the paper are not available in open literature especially as regards the optimal control of jigs operating in parallel: (a) the separation density (elementary ash) defined as the density of the feed fraction reporting in half to the concentrate and in half to refuse and incremental ash (density of the elementary mass of material recovered in a process in which the yield is increased by an infinitesimally small amount) can be used for real time control in dense media baths and in jigs; (b) the autogenous separation process in jigs makes it possible to determine the incremental ash as the ash content in the separation layer of the material as measured by the correlation between ash content and the density of the separation layer. The concept of a new control system which may be used in practice, based on a radiometric density meter with a properly collimated radiation beam and located at the level of the separation layer has been discussed. The radiometric density meters, applied to monitor the density of the separation layer in jigs on-line and to monitor the density of heavy media in dense media baths can be used effectively in real-time control systems optimizing the yield of product.Raw coal is often beneficiated in separation processes in dense medium vessels (DMV) and dense medium cyclones (DMC), which apply manufactured medium in jigs (J) i.e. autogenous medium devices, and in flotation where physical and chemical properties of coal particles are used. Many authors in research literature use simulation algorithms to identify optimum set points in particular circuits ( The following symbols are used in      Flow rates By applying the method of Lagrange multipliers to Eq. Let us create a new unconstrained function: The necessary condition for maximum By applying Eqs. Eq. Incremental ash can be thought of as the ash content in the last elementary mass of material recovered in a process in which the yield is increased by an infinitesimally small amount ( The following symbols are used in   Flow rates The practical application of the principle of the maximum product yield in coal preparation systems requires a detailed interpretation of control variables. The content of each density fraction From Eqs. According to Eqs. Raw coal is often beneficiated in jigs where coal grains are stratified according to their density in a pulsating coal/water medium in jigs ( The following symbols are used in      The yield and ash content in the final product for two jigs operating in parallel is determined by Eqs. Transformation of Eqs. Eqs. The separation layer divides the stratified bed into the upper product (concentrate) and the bottom product (refuse). The yield of the The separation density For the second layer: For the “ The density of the “ An example of the distribution of three density fractions along the height of the bed in a jig was calculated using Eqs.         The model of the jig uses the partition curve of the hyperbolic tangent (  This problem has been discussed by  The above considerations lead to the formulation of the general principle of maximizing the yield in product of a desired quality in all types of parallel circuits with DMV and jigs (J), namely: DMV–DMV, DMV–J, J–J. For DMV–DMV systems, the separation should be conducted according to the principle of equal separation densities, thus approximately at the same density of heavy media; in DMV–J circuits, at densities of separation layers in jigs equal to the density of the heavy media in the DMV; and in the J–J systems, at equal densities of the separation layers in the individual jigs. These principles have been verified by simulation methods based on the partition models of the separation processes. The simulation analysis of parallel separation processes has been performed to compare results of coal separation in various configurations of two washers (DMV and J) for various parameters of separation. Separators were modeled by the partition curve of the hyperbolic tangent (Eq. The aim of the simulation was to determine the optimal separation densities Optimal separation densities in the case of two dense media vessels (D–D) with small imperfections ( In a jig, the separation density cannot be directly measured. The cut point for the separation of the stratified material in the bed is the density of the separation layer at the edge of the discharge gate. The relationship between the separation density and the density of the separation layer for both jigs, derived from Eqs. Optimal densities of separation layers in both jigs should be identical and set accordingly so as to achieve the desired ash content In recent years, many research papers have addressed the issues of automation in coal preparation plants, including systems to monitor technological parameters, local control systems for individual processes and central dispatching systems with visualization and reporting on production processes. Most coal preparation plants use PLCs in on-off systems where, for example, the actuator opens or closes a valve or changes the direction of a coal stream. This is Level 1 of control. Common practice at Level 2 control is to use continuous PID controllers in heavy media circuits, cyclones, froth flotation, thickeners and jigs. Some controllers apply advanced adaptive or fuzzy algorithms and transfer data to the central dispatching system. Decidedly fewer control systems operate at Level 3 of control where there are problems of optimizing the production process in real time to achieve the desired economic effect. In the case of coal separation processes in dense media baths and in jigs that are subject to current analysis, commonly used automation systems include density and level control in dense media circuits, stabilization of the feed rate to jigs, and the refuse discharge control in float-based systems (control at Level 2). So far, in the case of jigs, there are no established methods to measure incremental ash and to use this measurement in control systems optimizing the technological process. The solution to the problem may have been found in successful attempts to use radiometric density meters to monitor the stratification of grains in jigs. The application of these instruments to monitor coal separation processes in jigs has been discussed in detail by  As the above results show, it is possible to apply radiometric density meters in jigs to monitor and stabilize the density of the separation layer (incremental ash), and – together with density meters applied in dense media vessels – to design real-time control systems optimizing the yield of products in parallel circuits with DMV and jigs.  Gravitational coal separation processes in dense media vessels (baths) and jigs use different mechanisms to separate particles according to their density. In dense media vessels (DMVs), particles are separated based on the difference between the buoyancy of particles of various densities and their direct reporting to floats and sinks. In jigs, at first, the stratification of grains takes place in the bed and then the stratified bed is mechanically divided into concentrate and refuse. In the first case the separation parameter is the density of the dense media and in the second it is the tonnage of the discharged refuse. Technological systems of parallel gravitational separators apply the principle of the maximum final product yield of the desired quality (ash content). This principle states that the product yield is highest when all parallel circuits are operated at the same incremental ash. This is true for any number of parallel circuits and is independent of the washability characteristics and size composition of the feed. In processes potentially modeled by partition curves, optimal set points are the separation densities which are defined as densities of feed fractions which report in half to concentrate and in half to refuse. The separation density is a measurable parameter only for those dense media vessels (baths) in which partition curves are close to the ideal one (small imperfection). In this case the separation density is approximately equal to the density of the heavy media and can be measured by radiometric density meters. In jigs applying conventional float-based refuse discharge control systems, incremental ash is an unknown parameter. Coal is separated at first in a stratification process of particles according to their density and then though mechanical separation of the layered material. This autogenous process makes it possible to determine the incremental ash value defined as the ash content in the stratification layer of the material, measured by the correlation between ash content and density. For this purpose, a radiometric density meter with a properly collimated radiation beam and located at the level of the separation layer may be used. The use of radiometric density meters to measure the density of heavy media in DMV systems and the density of the separation layer in jigs ensures the same incremental ash for these processes and, at the same time, fulfils the principle of maximizing the amount of concentrate. The use of radiometric ash meters makes it possible to simultaneously control these parameters in real time to optimize the yield and to stabilize the ash content in the concentrate. Simulation analysis of the coal separation process shows that, for parallel systems of the same type of units (DMV–DMV and J–J), the same effects are achieved as for separation of combined feeds in a single unit of sufficient capacity, provided that the efficiency of these devices is identical, and the separation process is carried out at the same incremental ash content.
