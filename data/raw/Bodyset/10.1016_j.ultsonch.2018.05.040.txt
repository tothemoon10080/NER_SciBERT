The aim of these studies was to investigate the influence of airborne ultrasound-assisted convective drying and microwave-assisted convective drying, as well as their combination, on process kinetics, total color change, water activity, content of carotenoids, polyphenols and antioxidant activity of carrots (Daucus carota L.). The global model of drying kinetics based on coupled ordinary differential equations was used to describe the moisture and material temperature profiles during drying. Application of ultrasound and microwave in convective drying reduced drying time in the range of 9–81%, but the shortest drying time was observed for simultaneous action of convection, ultrasound and microwave. The results of qualitative analysis showed a product improvement due to ultrasound as compared to convective drying and microwave-convective drying. The proposed mathematical model of drying kinetics successfully simulated real drying processes. The proposed mathematical model of drying kinetics successfully simulated real hybrid drying processes.Convective drying is one of the oldest methods of food preservation. Nowadays, due to the need of energy saving and rising interest in healthy food rich in bioactive compounds, a lot of modifications of natural convection drying methods (such as microwave- and infrared-assisted drying It is known that ultrasound application enhances heat and mass transfer both by diffusion inside the material Until now, published papers have mainly focused on kinetics and modeling of the ultrasound-assisted drying process. These tests were carried out e.g., for persimmon Meticulous examination of dried carrots in terms of the content of antioxidants is particularly important because carrots is the leading vegetable providing Carotenoids are also, next to chlorophyll and anthocyanins, the most popular natural pigments that determine the color of yellow, orange and red in fresh materials. Their retention in the biological product significantly affects the color and, at the same time, the perception of the consumer The main aim of this study was to describe the changes in drying kinetics and quality parameters such as total color change, water activity, content of polyphenols, carotenoids and antioxidant activity of carrots dried by ultrasound- and microwave-assisted convective drying as well as in their combinations. Moreover, a mathematical modeling was used to compare theoretical drying and temperature curves with experimental data. Carrots roots ( All ultrasound assisted drying processes were carried out in the hybrid (convective – microwave – ultrasonic) laboratory dryer ( The flow of the drying medium is from the bottom of the scale pan, but the ultrasound is fed from the top to the material on the rotating scale pan. The hybrid dryer is equipped with a software to control the air temperature (in the range of room temperature to 95 °C), as well as the air flow rate (in the range of 1–5 m/s). The air temperature and humidity at the inlet and outlet of the hybrid dryer is measured by a temperature-humidity sensors (HD29371TC1.5 and HD4817ETC1.5, Delta OHM, Italy). The temperature of sample’s surface during drying is measured by an infrared thermometer (pyrometer) (CT LT15, Optris, Germany), with a precision of 0.1 °C. The process parameters such as: air temperature, velocity and humidity, ultrasound and microwave power, material mass and temperature, and the total energy consumption in kWh (by a standard electricity meter, precision of 0.01 kWh) were measured continuously (every 5 min) during drying. However, the system is switched off during measurement of the material mass. The photo of the experimental setup is presented in The average temperature and relative humidity of the drying medium at the inlet during all experiments was 45 °C and 8%, respectively, and the air flow velocity was 4 m/s. The temperature was selected according to Regier et al.         The process parameters and drying schedule are shown in The mass of samples was measured during experiments. Then the moisture content The drying kinetics represents the moisture ratio decrease The qualitative assessment was based on the following parameters: water activity, total color change Δ Water activity was measured for fresh and dried samples by the converter of temperature and humidity with the function of water activity measurement Testo 650/0628.0024 (Germany). The accuracy of the device was 0.001. About 2 g of fresh/dried carrots was triturated in a mortar, and then placed in a test chamber. The value of water activity was read when the equilibrium was established. Total color change was determined using a colorimeter CR-400 Konica Minolta (Japan), equipped with the Color Data Software Spectra Magic NX QC software. Total color change was calculated as a color difference between fresh and dried material and indicated by CIE The content of carotenoids were determined using HPLC method. Extraction of carotenoids was carried out in accordance with the following procedure. At first, fresh carrots (about 10 g) and dried carrots (about 0.5 g) were weighed. Next, the samples were mixed with 50 mL acetone (POCH, Poland) for 20 min in the dark and then the mixture was filtered. Carotenoids from the remaining material were subsequently extracted in the same way twice. The obtained filtrates were combined in a separating funnel. Afterwards, petroleum ether (75 mL) (POCH, Poland) was added to the extract and the organic phase was washed three times with 50 mL of distilled water. Remaining water was removed with anhydrous sodium sulfate (POCH, Poland). Petroleum ether layer was evaporated in a vacuum Büchi R-205 evaporator (Switzerland). Finally, the condensed extracts were made up to 10 mL with acetone and filtered through a 0.22 m PTFE syringe filter (Millipore, USA). Chromatographic analysis was performed with the LC Agilent Technologies 1200 Rapid Resolution system (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a Poroshell 120, SB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 µm) (Agilent Technology InC, USA). The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile contained 0.5 g/L of triethylamine (solvent A) and acetonitrile:methanol:ethyl acetate (solvent B) (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Germany) in a gradient from 95:5:0 to 60:20:20 in 20 min, the latter proportion being maintained until the end of the run. Flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min Phenolic compounds extraction procedure proceeded as follows: fresh material (about 10 g) and dried material (about 0.5 g) were homogenized using a homogenizer IKA T-25 (Germany) with 50 mL 70% methanol. Next, the homogenates were shaken for 15 min in a mechanical Water Bath Shaker type 357 (Elpin, Poland) and then vacuum filtered. The residue was collected from the filter and shaken again with 50 mL 700 g/L methanol and filtered. The filtrates were mixed and centrifuged in a mechanical MPW-351R centrifuge (Poland) at 3000 Phenolic profiles were determined using the LC Agilent Technologies 1200 Rapid Resolution system equipped with a Poroshell 120, SB-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 µm). The binary mobile phase according to Tsao et al. 2,2-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical monocation scavenging activity was determined following the procedure described by Pellegrini et al. In the case of bioactive compounds determination, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine the significance of the main effects. Differences between the mean values of multiple groups were analyzed by parametric Tukey’s post hoc test. Statistical significance was considered at The drying kinetics of carrots was evaluated on the basis of drying and material temperature curves ( Next, the ultrasound-assisted convective drying tests were performed. There were applied the same parameters of air flow and air temperature as in the convective drying. In this case, the carrots samples reach a temperature of the drying air faster, i.e. after 20 min in (CVUS200W) and after 25 min in (CVUS75W and CVUS125W) ( In the CVMW100W program, the temperature of carrots reaches a temperature of the drying agent after about 10 min and then rises slowly reaching 47 °C in the end of the process. Further programs with the increasing ultrasound power (CVMW100WUS75W, CVMW100WUS125W, CVMW100WUS200W) were characterized by a similar dynamic temperature growth, where the material temperature was higher by about 1.5, 2 and 3.5 °C, respectively, as compared to the CVMW100W ( The results of the total energy consumption in different drying processes of carrot samples are shown in As follows from the results presented in The results of total color change according to different drying programs are shown in The material is considered to be protected against the growth of mold and mildew, if the value of water activity is below 0.6 The results of retention of carotenoids (precursors of vitamin A: The application of ultrasound in the drying process was particularly beneficial regarding retention of The total phenolic content in the fresh carrots sample was 1102 mg/kg d. m. ( The application of ultrasound-and microwave-assisted convective drying caused significantly (p < 0.05) greater polyphenol losses in relation to CV and CVUS drying. In these samples the losses were from 37% (CVUS125WMW100W) to 86% (CVUS200WMW100W). In particular, the application of CVUS200WM100W caused an 86% decrease in polyphenol contents in relation to the level in the raw material, and a 76% reduction in relation to CV drying. Probably, it was the result of the considerable interference into the tissue structure. Dipole rotation as a consequence of microwave action may have caused considerable damage to cells and cell structures, resulting in oxidation of phenolic compounds. Moreover, too rapid mass transport by microwave power may cause tissue damage or undesirable changes in the food texture leading to ‘puffing’ The contents of phenolic compounds in the tested samples may be affected by the losses due to the drying process, oxidation but also by the de novo synthesis. The drying process was carried out at 40–50 °C. This temperature does not cause complete inactivation of the oxidative enzymes, polyphenoloxidases and peroxidases, which may result in degradation of phenolic compounds, reported by Garau et al. In the fresh carrots sample the dominant compounds were the chlorogenic acid (CHA) and isocoumarin (IC), while p-coumaric acid derivatives (P-CAD) were not detected. The other identified compounds included ferulic acid (FA), derivatives of hydroxycinnamic acid (HCAD) and caffeic acid (CA) ( In all dried samples a significantly (p < 0.05) lower IC content was recorded in comparison to the fresh material, and derivatives of p-coumaric acid (p-CAD) were detected. P-CAD is a precursor of IC formed under stress conditions as well as hydroxycinnamic acids, including chlorogenic and ferulic acids  The global model of drying kinetics describing heat and mass transfer was elaborated by Kowalski and Pawłowski It was assumed that the mass and heat transfers occur on the whole material surface and that the material undergoes linear volumetric shrinkage. As a result the surfaces of mass and heat exchange are equal to each other and they are described by Eq. To evaluate the relative humidity The drying kinetics model (Eqs. The method used to estimate model parameters is based on an inverse problem. The experimental data of the kinetics consist of the drying and temperature curves. In the optimization process the best fitting of the experimental and numerical data was searched. In the model four unknown parameters describing drying process are introduced. Namely, the effective coefficients of mass The differences of the experimental and numerical data were normalized by the differences of the experimental minimum and maximum values of the moisture content and the temperature. To estimate unknown parameters, the non-gradient Rosenbrock The presented method was used to determine model parameters of convective drying (CV) and convective drying with application of ultrasound of different power (75 W, 125 W, 200 W). Exemplary comparisons of experimental and theoretical (numerical) drying kinetics are shown in  The results of the process modeling make it possible to analyze the efficiency of ultrasound application. Additional parameters should be specified for this purpose. Drying rate DR expresses the rate of moisture decrease in the material during drying as a function of time and is determined as The average drying rate ADR expresses the mean of the drying rate function DR, where The average drying time for convective and ultrasound-assisted convective drying was determined experimentally and was equal to The values of the drying rate enhancement DRE are presented in The experimental and modeled drying rate, as well as the share of these effects in drying rate (for CVUS200W process) are presented in The obtained results clearly indicate a very high share of the “vibration effect” in the mass exchange. At the same time, it was found that the shares of the other two effects are small. The ratios of the three ultrasonic effects These calculated values confirm particular importance of “vibration effect” in ultrasound assisted drying. The results confirm the efficacy of ultrasonically-assisted convective drying over conventional convective drying. The test results show that the use of ultrasound intensifies mass exchange in relation to the process of convection. As a result, the duration of the process is shortened. Unfortunately, this is associated with an increase in total energy consumption. The intensification of the microwave-convection drying by ultrasounds is not obvious. The analysis of the composition of dried carrots proves that the processes assisted with ultrasound of a lower power have the positive effect on the quality of the product with respect to carotenoids and colour. The application of ultrasound-assisted convective drying has more beneficial effect on total phenolic compounds in comparison with microwave-assisted process. The quality changes may be connected to the action of enzymes, in carrots tissue during drying in low temperature. The mathematical modeling of drying kinetics gives some information about heat and mass transfer coefficients and the value of effectiveness of ultrasound absorption in the sample. The presented model fits the experimental data well. A new approach determining quantitatively the “vibration”, “heating” and “synergistic” effects was proposed in the work. As it has been demonstrated, the “vibration effect” is the superior factor, but “heating effect” and “synergistic effect” are also significant.
