Carbon nanotube (CNT)- and Fep-reinforced copper–matrix composites were successfully fabricated by laser induction hybrid rapid cladding to enhance simultaneously their thermal conductivity and mechanical properties. The microstructure and properties depended on the interaction between CNTs and Fep. When the CNT content was 2.6wt.%, smaller Fep and CNTs were uniformly embedded in Cu-rich matrix. The composites exhibited attractive properties including thermal conductivity (197Wm−1
                     K−1), hardness (429HV0.2), coefficient of friction (0.11) and wear rate (5.3×10−16

Previous studies have mainly focused on the microstructure characteristics and solidification process of Cu–Fe alloys during liquid-phase separation Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which possess many unique properties, are ideal reinforcements to fabricate high-performance composites for various applications, and have therefore attracted extensive attention The substrate used was pure copper with dimensions of 150 After LIHRC, metallurgical samples were prepared by standard procedures and etched by a solution consisting of 4     For a simple qualitative analysis, the cooling rate during LIHRC can be estimated as the product of the temperature gradient For a low CNT content, the uniform distribution of CNTs in the melt pool can not only impede the Fe-rich droplets from colliding and coalescing, but also improve the heat transfer. This leads to a higher cooling rate, which in turn results in smaller Fe-rich particles and their uniform distribution in the copper-rich matrix ( For a high concentration of CNTs, the heat in the melt pool cannot be efficiently transferred due to the coagulation of the nanotubes, resulting in a decrease in cooling rate. The Fe-rich droplets have more time to coalesce and therefore become larger in diameter. Furthermore, clustering CNTs cannot efficiently block the collisions and coalescence of the Fe-rich droplets and hence do not hinder the coarsening process. As a result, many larger Fe-rich particles connect with each other and are unevenly embedded in the Cu-rich matrix ( In summary, the microstructure and properties of CNT-Fe
