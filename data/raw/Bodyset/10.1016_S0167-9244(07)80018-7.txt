This chapter explains generalities on ultrasound-assisted sample preparation. The analytical process involves preliminary operations, measurement of the analytical signal, and acquisition and processing of the information it provides. The first step in the process varies and includes operations such as sampling, dissolution or leaching (of solid samples), filtration, clean-up, preconcentration and derivatization. Sampling is a complex process by virtue of the large number of factors that can influence it; such factors include sample homogeneity, the type of sampling model used the physical state of the system and its stability, and the analyst's expertise. Consequently, the complexity of the sampling operation depends on the particular application that makes generalization impossible. In addition, some analytical methods exclude sampling in the analytical process as the sample would be unchanged before and after the process. A sample can be named differently at different stages of the sampling process. Sample preparation is most often a necessity as even the simplest samples are frequently unsuitable for direct analysis.
