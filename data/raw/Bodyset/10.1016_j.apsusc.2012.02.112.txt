In the present study, the surface properties and osteblastic responses to a titanium–8%tantalum–3%niobium (Ti–8Ta–3Nb) alloy were investigated in vitro. The surface roughness and morphology of all samples appeared similar. The surface of the Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy was more hydrophilic than those of commercially pure titanium (TiS) and Ti–6Al–4V alloy. The Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy had a better cellular response with regard to proliferation and ALP activity. The present study showed improved surface characteristics and osteoblastic response to the Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy compared to TiS and Ti–6Al–4V alloy.The Ti–8 The samples were divided into 3 groups. Group I was an untreated machined smooth titanium surface (Ti Cultures of mouse MC3T3-E1 cells were grown in T-75 flasks in alpha minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Invitrogen Corp., USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen Corp., USA), 100 For morphological evaluation of cell spreading by SEM, the MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 1 Cell proliferation was assessed using a methyltestosterone (MTS) assay. Fomazan accumulation was quantified by the absorbance at 490 The SPSS (v.12.0) software package was used to examine the data for surface roughness, contact angle measurement, cell proliferation, and ALP activity. The surface roughness and morphology appeared to be similar in all groups (  Although not significant, the ALP activity was slightly higher on the Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy than Ti In summary, the Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy showed better osteogenic responses than Ti The present study showed improved surface characteristics and osteoblastic response to the Ti–8Ta–3Nb alloy compared to Ti This study was financially supported by research fund of
