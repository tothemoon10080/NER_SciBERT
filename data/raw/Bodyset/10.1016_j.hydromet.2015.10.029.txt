The present research evaluated lanthanide desorption levels from ion-adsorption clays subjected to thermal pre-treatment at various temperatures in the range 100–900°C. The authors identified macro- and micro-structural changes occurring in the clays during heating and related the observed trends to the water content and rare earth elements (REE) desorption behavior during subsequent ion exchange leaching, in order to gain a better understanding of how temperature and moisture may affect the overall REE recovery, hence impacting the ore processing route.
                  It was found that the total lanthanide extraction from clays pre-heated in the range 100–300°C increased with the temperature, then decreased drastically, reaching near-zero levels for the range 700–900°C. This trend was explained in terms of improved clay permeability achieved upon elimination of pore and adsorbed water molecules in the interval 100–300°C, which facilitated better lixiviant access to the REE adsorption sites. The subsequent decrease in REE extraction in the interval 300–900°C was related to the loss of hydroxyl groups from the aluminosilicate matrix (dehydroxylation), resulting in irreversible REE fixation to the surface and major structural changes such as layer collapse, loss of crystal structure and vitrification, with the ultimate result of completely blocking lixiviant access to the adsorbed cations.Rare earth elements (REE) are a collection of sixteen chemical elements, namely scandium, yttrium, and fourteen of the fifteen naturally-occurring lanthanides (excluding promethium); the former two are included as they occur with the latter in the same ore deposits and have similar properties. Their unique properties make them essential for the hi-tech industry, with applications in permanent magnets, lasers, automotive catalytic converters, fiber optics, superconductors, alloys, and catalysts ( China dominates the global REE potential with deposits comprising ~ Over 90% of the world's economically recoverable rare earth elements are found in rich primary mineral deposits such as bastnaesite (carbonate-based ores containing up to 70% REE), and monazite/xenotime (phosphate-based ores containing 55–60% REE). In spite of being high grade, these sources are associated with elevated recovery costs due to difficulties in mining, beneficiation, and the need for aggressive conditions to liberate the REE ( One of the major commercially viable secondary sources of rare earths are the weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ores (also known as “ion-adsorption clays” or “ionic clays”), containing 0.05–0.5% w/w rare earth oxides (REO) adsorbed on the surface of mixed clay minerals. The formation of this type of ore is due to physical, chemical and microbial weathering of REE-rich granitic and volcanic rocks under warm, humid, slightly acidic conditions in subtropical zones. Presently, China is the only country to pursue this type of resource for commercial REE production, these deposits accounting for 35% of Chinese REO output since 2009 ( Under acidic and near-neutral conditions, most of the adsorbed lanthanides (60–90% of the total REE content) occur as free or hydrated cation species electrostatically bound on the surface at sites of permanent negative charge via a pH-independent reversible physisorption; for pH Modern technologies implemented for the economical processing of low-grade ores such as the ion-adsorption clays are heap and in-situ leaching, as described by It is also well documented that thermal treatment irreversibly alters the physical and mechanical properties of clays: heat impacts on strength, plasticity, permeability, particle size, specific gravity, etc. ( The aim of the present research is to evaluate and compare lanthanide desorption levels from ion-adsorption clays previously subjected to thermal treatment at various temperatures. For this purpose, we investigated the macro- and micro-structural changes occurring in clays during heating and relate the observed trends to the water content and lanthanide desorption behavior during ion exchange leaching, in order to gain a better understanding of how temperature may affect the overall REE recovery, hence impacting the ore processing route. For the preparation of all solutions used in the present work, de-ionized water and ACS-grade reagents were used. Two types of natural clays of African origin and known to contain adsorbed REE were tested, referred to C1 (Clay 1) and C2 (Clay 2), respectively. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF, Brucker AXS S2 Ranger) was employed to determine the overall bulk chemical composition of clays. The REE content was determined by acid digestion at 220 100 The procedure involved 50 In order to assess the influence of water saturation of clays on REE extraction, and therefore to evaluate an in-situ leaching scenario, 50 The bulk chemical composition of clays ( Detailed REE content and relative REE distribution for both clays ( The clay samples with the above REE content were maintained at various temperatures (100, 300, 500, 700 and 900 The present results are consistent with previously-published literature data on aluminosilicates: In their comprehensive review,  There is a consensus between As the temperature increases beyond 400 As the temperature increases beyond 600 These physical and chemical changes revealed by TGA are the underlying factors explaining the changes of CEC with temperature, as previously described by The qualitative XRD spectra of the “as is” and pre-heated C1 clay samples are given in The XRD patterns reinforce the clay behavior detected via TGA in terms of water content and structural changes upon heating and confirms that REE extraction is adversely influenced by subjecting the clay ores to temperatures above 200–300 From a heap leaching process perspective it is obvious that, although heating the clays up to 200–300 REE extraction levels from clays saturated with water (according to procedure described in The observed decrease in REE recovery can then be explained through the following phenomenon: upon re-hydration (soaking), the adsorbed water uptake exceeds the initial water content of the original clays, as demonstrated by The corollary of the above findings is that the in-situ leaching will lead to slightly lower lanthanide recoveries (5–15% less, depending on the specific REE, as indicated in The present study investigated the effect of ore thermal pre-treatment and dryness on the recovery extent of rare earth elements (REE) adsorbed on two types of clay minerals, and attributed the observed trends to water content as well as micro and macro-structural changes occurring in clays upon heating. It was found that the total lanthanide extraction from clays pre-heated up to 300 The increased REE extraction from clays pre-heated up to 300 The dramatic decrease in REE extraction in the range 500 to 900 From a process perspective, although heating the clays up to 200–300 The authors would like to thank Tantalus Rare Earth A.G. for providing clay samples and financial support.
