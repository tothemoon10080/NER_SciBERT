The use of ionic liquids for micro-extraction of metals has been popularized during the last decades. The main drawback for this application of ILs is leaching into the sample. Hollow fiber liquid phase micro-extraction might be a promising approach due to the immobilization of the ILs during the extraction process.
                  Herein, we evaluate the abilities of Aliquat® 336 and its thiosalicylate ([A336][TS]) and 2-(methylthio)benzoate ([A336][MTBA]) derivatives, as well as Cyphos® IL 101 salicylate ([C101][Sal]) and anthranilate ([C101][Ant]) analogs supported on a solvent micro-extraction bar to extract metallic ions such as Ag(I), Cd(II), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II) and Pt(VI) from aqueous solutions. Leaching was reduced by ca. 60% using SBME compared to liquid-liquid extraction for most of the ionic liquids tested; an 88% reduction was achieved using Aliquat® 336.
                  Regarding metal extraction, quantitative removal was obtained for Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb using [A336][TS] after an extraction period of 5 h. For Ag and Pt, the phosphonium-based ionic liquids [C101][Sal] and [C101][Ant] showed the highest efficiency, only surpassed by Aliquat® 336 in the case of Ag extraction (97%).In recent years the application of ionic liquids (ILs) in micro-extraction methods has gained increasing attention ( ILs have been used in liquid micro-extraction of toxic metals ( ILs have been used in HFLPME as additives to improve the extraction capability of the organic solution containing the ligand that extracts the metal from the sample ( The introduction of functional groups to either cation or anion of the ILs enables coordinative binding to metal ions is a promising approach to improve the metal extraction efficiency of ILs in water samples ( Here, we propose combining room temperature TSILs and SBME for HFLPME. This approach improves the extraction capability and stability of HFLPME systems while at the same time reducing the effect of IL leaching, reducing the impact, the cost and the energy required for the extraction of metals, since the ILs are already supported in the fiber. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were reagent grade and were used as received without further purification. Nitric acid (65%) was purchased from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain), the ILs tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride (Aliquat Aqueous solutions of Ag(I), Cd(II), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Ni(II), Pb(II) and Pt(VI) were prepared from 1000 mg L The ILs tricaprylylmethylammonium thiosalicylate ([A336][TS]), tricaprylylmethylammonium 2-(methylthio)benzoate ([A336][MTBA]), trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium salicylate ([C101][Sal]) and trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium anthranilate ([C101][Ant]) were synthesized via deprotonation-metathesis reactions from Aliquat Polypropylene Accurel PP S6/2 hollow fibers of 0.2 μm pore size and 1800 μm internal diameter were used in this study (Membrana, Germany). Samples were stirred using an IKA-Big Squid magnetic stirrer (Ika-Werke, Germany). Metal concentrations in the samples were quantified using an AAnalyst200 flame atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) for Ag, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mg, Na and Ni; a PinAAcle 900Z graphite furnace atomizer was used for Pb and Pt (Perkin-Elmer, USA). Organic matter in the samples before and after extraction were measured in a total carbon analyzer Analytik Jena multi N/C 3100 (Analytik Jena, Germany) after filtering the samples through a 0.2 μm pore sized polytetratfluoroethylene syringe filter (VWR, USA). Sample pH and conductivity were measured using a portable instrument (WTW GmbH, Germany). In order to setup the SBME ( In all cases, three independent replicates of the sample were extracted and two solvent bars were used for each sample. To evaluate the effect of potential precipitation of added metals in the samples, further experiments were conducted using control samples. In particular, three samples were stirred in the absence of fibers and, in order to evaluate the interaction of hollow fiber material with metals, experiments were conducted using two empty fibers added to the sample. The initial concentrations of metals in the samples were 1 mg L ILs stability in solvent micro-extraction bars is determined by their capability to impregnate the fiber’s pores and their water solubility. In this work, we evaluated the stability of ILs in the HF by measuring the leaching of IL from the fiber into the sample during the extraction process. Leaching was measured as the difference of DOC in the sample before and after extraction. Leaching from SBME was compared with data obtained by liquid-liquid extraction. For this purpose, 50 mL of metal solution were stirred together with 300 mg of IL at 250 rpm for 1 h. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm and the IL residue in the aqueous phase was measured as DOC concentration. As in the case of SBME experiments, extractions were carried out at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). Extraction efficiency was calculated as the percentage of metal removed from the sample after the extraction experiment (equation Reducing leaching of ILs into the aqueous sample during extraction is a key factor in their applicability for metal extraction in natural systems. Therefore leaching was evaluated at pH = 2, 6 and 10 using the configuration of SBME. The DOC released during extraction was similar at pH 6 and 10, whereas at pH = 2 the leaching behavior differed between the investigated ILs. In order to evaluate the effect based on the applied setup (SBME instead of a liquid-liquid extraction) on leaching behavior, we compared the dissolved organic carbon concentration after extraction using both methodologies ( In particular, for Aliquat Regarding the final DOC concentration, after one hour of extraction, Aliquat Summarizing, the applied ILs are ranked regarding their leaching after immobilization in hollow fiber as follows: Aliquat To evaluate the extraction efficiency of the proposed ILs in SBME, we screened metal extractions first using 50 mL of samples at pH 5 to avoid precipitation of metals during extraction and beneficial leaching properties of the investigated ILs between pH 4–10. Metal loss was negligible in the control samples containing empty fibers or without fiber addition.  [A336][TS] and [A336][MTBA] behaved differently for SBME versus single drop liquid-liquid micro-extraction (SDLLME) for some metals ( In general, phosphonium-based ILs [C101][Sal] and [C101][Ant] have a lower affinity for the studied metals (except Ag(I) and Pt(VI)). In particular, [C101][Sal] and [C101][Ant] yielded quantitative extraction for Ag. In the case of Pt, [C101][Ant] has a similar yield as Aliquat Overall [A336][TS] is the most effective extractant in SBME for metal ions as Cu(II), Cd(II), Ni(II), Pb(II) and for Cr(VI). For Ag(I) and Pt(VI) the best results were obtained for [C101][Sal] and [C101][Ant]. Apart from the influence of different functional groups on metal extraction, impurities of ILs, e.g. their chloride content, have to be considered as well. On one hand, impurities in ILs are known to greatly influence the physico-chemical properties ( The time dependence of metal extraction was studied using the combination of metals and ionic liquids that showed the best performance in the screening study. The highest efficiency for Cd(II), Cr(VI), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II) was recorded for the ionic liquids [A336][TS] and [A336][MTBA] ( The time impact on the extraction properties of [A336][MTBA] was studied for Cr(VI) and Cu(II), revealing a lower capacity than [A336][TS] for Cu(II). An equilibrium was reached after 6 h. For Cr(VI), however, [A336][MTBA] yielded a similar extraction after 6 h, but showed a higher efficiency for shorter times. In Ag(I) and Pt(VI), the Cyphos After evaluating the extraction efficiency of metals in ultrapure water samples, the IL-SBME systems were applied to extract metals in drinking water samples. To guarantee the comparability of the results, synthetic drinking water samples were prepared according to the average composition of drinking waters supplied by Vienna Water ( Our application to drinking water samples used the combination of ionic liquids and metals that offered the best extraction efficiency. Time of extraction was selected according to experiments performed in ultrapure water ( In the case of the divalent metals Cd(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II), the ionic liquid [A336][TS] was tested ( For Cr(VI), we evaluated the efficiency of the two Aliquat Finally, regarding Ag(I) and Pt(VI), the extraction efficiency in drinking water was evaluated for Cyphos Using hollow fibers in solvent micro-extraction helps to stabilize ionic liquids in the liquid extraction of metals compared to conventional liquid-liquid extraction, by minimizing leaching of the ionic liquid. The use of SBME simultaneously reduces operational cost and improves the environmental profile of metals extraction with an excellent performance, because the fiber can be left tumbling in the source solution during extraction, becoming a feasible alternative for metals removal in water treatment or for the recovery of metals in hydrometallurgy. Moreover, Aliquat In conclusion, the use of SBME improves the applicability of presented ionic liquids by stabilizing them in the hollow fiber. Consequently, the impact, the cost and the energy required for the extraction of metals reduced by means of the use of a support for a few micro-liters of the ionic liquids. Accordingly, SBME might be a very promising approach for the future application of ILs in removing heavy metals from natural waters. The present work was partially financed by the
