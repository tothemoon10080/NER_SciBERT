A new ternary alloy is prepared (Al-20Cu-10Mg) with Al as a base material. An Al composite has been prepared using this new ternary alloy in a view to enhance strength, ductility, and effective transfer of load. Al-ternary alloy composite is prepared through stir casting route with an average particle size of 125µm at 0%, 5%, and 10% weight fractions. The casted billets are hot extruded to Ф14mm diameter rods. The mechanical behavior of composite is studied in terms of hardness, tensile, and compression. An increment of 20% of hardness has been observed for 10% reinforced composite. Increased reinforcement enhanced the mechanical properties such as yield strength and tensile strength. Wear studies are also performed on the composites and revealed that the composite with 10%reinforcement has shown better wear resistance compared to the 0% and 5% composite due to the effective transfer of load from matrix to reinforced material.
