A comparative study between solvent extraction and hollow fiber membrane technique has been carried out for the extraction of V (V) from an aqueous chloride solution. LIX 84I has been used as carrier/extractant. Also the extraction of vanadium in presence of various other metals, such as iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel and manganese using hollow fiber supported liquid membrane (HFSLM) has been studied. Effect of different parameters such as pH of feed solution, flow rate, extractant concentration, metal ion concentration and strip solution concentration on vanadium extraction has been investigated. With increase of pH, extractant concentration and flow rate, the flux value increased up to certain level and then decreases. The flux increased from 1.0 to 1.82×10−5, 0.97 to 1.82×10−5 and from 0.6 to 1.82×10−5

The extracted species was determined to be VO2R·RH. Vanadium was extracted selectively and separated completely from a multi metal bearing solution by using hollow fiber membrane module and the separation factor values were found to be in the order of α

Oxides of vanadium are used in the manufacture of sulfuric acid which is an important industrial chemical. Due to high coefficient of thermal resistance, vanadium (V) oxide finds application as a detector material for thermal imaging and an ethanol sensor in ppm levels (up to 0.1 Organophosphorus acid derivative such as di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) has been widely used for the extraction of vanadium (V) from both acidic chloride and nitrate solutions LIX 84I is a commercially used extractant for copper and nickel by solvent extraction Hence in the present study, LIX 84I has been explored for the extraction of vanadium (V) from acidic chloride solutions with hollow fiber membrane. The effects of different parameters such as pH, flow rate, LIX 84I concentration, metal ion concentration, NaOH concentration in the strip solution have been studied in detail to investigate vanadium (V) mass transfer through HFSLM for practical applications. Also a comparison has been made between the hollow fiber and the solvent extraction data which is very useful for industries. Vanadium is known to form several chemical species (usually oxoanions/oxocations) in aqueous solution as a function of pH with different oxidation states The permeability coefficient The hollow fiber membrane Liqui-Cel 2.5 The extractant LIX 84I (2-hydroxy-5-nonylacetophenoneoxime) used as the mobile carrier for the hollow fiber membrane and was supplied by Cognis Corporation, USA. The extractant was used without any purification. Distilled kerosene (b.p. 180–240 Chemi Line, model CL-182 pH meter was used for the measurement and adjustment of pH during the study. The metal ion concentration in the aqueous phase was measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Model AAnalyst-200). Peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 520 S) was employed for the circulation of feed and strip solution through the membrane. The phase identification of the product was carried out by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis (PANanalytical X’pert pro) using Mo Kα anode with A laboratory scale mixer-settler was used for this work. This mixer-settler was rectangular box-type and was made of PVDF. The volumes of the mixer and settler were 120 and 480 A suitable aliquot (10 The hollow fiber membrane was impregnated with the required extractants (LIX 84I) before starting of the experiments. After impregnation of the fibers, extra extractants adhered to the fibers were washed off with distilled water. The pH of the feed solution was adjusted to the desired value by adding dilute H Extraction of vanadium from a solution containing 20 LIX 84I concentration was varied within 0.05–0.5 The pH of the feed solution is an important parameter for the permeation of vanadium through the hollow fiber membrane because vanadium exists in different oxidation states in aqueous solution which is pH dependant. The extraction of vanadium was carried out from a feed solution containing 20.003 The effect of flow rate of both the feed and strip solution on vanadium transport was studied within the range of 105–410 The extraction of vanadium was carried out with different concentrations (0.08–0.96 The role of metal ion concentration on vanadium flux was investigated by carrying out experiments with various concentration of vanadium in feed solution ranging from 10.267 to 98.407 A set of permeation experiments were carried out to optimize the stripping solution concentration for vanadium as it is the vital step for hollow fiber study. If stripping will not take place immediately after extraction then membrane will not be free for further extraction. For vanadium, NaOH was used as the stripping solution and its concentration was varied from 0.01 to 0.1 In this study vanadium was separated and recovered from a solution bearing V: 20.121, copper: 15.855, nickel: 17.298, cobalt: 17.447, zinc: 15.473, iron: 18.321 and manganese: 18.589 So a clean separation of vanadium was possible from the solution bearing multi metals such as vanadium, copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, iron and manganese by the hollow fiber membrane using LIX 84I with no co-permeation into the strip side. The extraction of vanadium was carried out from two separate solutions of 4L each bearing 20.003 The equilibrium studies for solvent extraction showed maximum extraction with 0.2 Several stripping studies were carried out with various concentrations of NaOH within the range of 0.01–0.2 To confirm the above generated data, 4L of solution containing 20.003 Another 4L of solution containing 20.003 This strip solution was acidified to pH A comparative study has been carried out between hollow fiber and solvent extraction technique for extraction of vanadium. Parameters such as feed solution pH, LIX 84I concentration, flow rate and NaOH concentration in strip solution were optimized to obtain maximum flux using hollow fiber membrane. A clean separation of vanadium was achieved from a multi-metal solution bearing vanadium, copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, iron and manganese. The separation factor values of V with respect to Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, Zn and Mn were found to be in the order of The authors wish to thank Prof. B.K.
