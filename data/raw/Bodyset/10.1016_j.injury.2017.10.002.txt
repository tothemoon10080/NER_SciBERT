The management of acetabular and femoral head fractures continues to evolve with improvements being made in planning, surgical techniques and modifications of approaches for these injuries Pipkin fractures are caused by high-energy trauma, affect younger people (mean age 38.9 years), and frequently occur in the context of polytrauma Pipkin Type-III fractures usually occur in the setting of hip dislocation. It is well known that in hip dislocations the vascular supply of the femoral head is compromised and its survival depends on the timely and successful reduction The first step in the management of a hip dislocation with or without a femoral head fracture is the prompt closed reduction On the other hand, given the challenges of the osteosynthesis and the universally bad outcomes of Type-III Pipkin fractures, an acute THR seems to offer an alternative solution. THR has gained popularity as a solution for femoral neck fractures in elderly individuals with active lifestyle, good general medical condition and independent pre-injury mobilisation status Taking into account the above evidence as well as our institutional experience, it is our belief that a primary THR should be considered in management of Pipkin Type-III fractures and we are reluctant in advocating for ORIF.
