We have deposited copper (Cu) thin films on Si(100) and glass substrates in the growth temperature range between 573 and 753 K using a pulsed DC magnetron sputtering method. Based on the magnetic field simulation, we have designed and constructed a high-power (120×10−4 W/m2) unbalanced magnetron sputtering (UBM) source for high-rate deposition. The maximum deposition rate of the newly developed sputtering source under a target power density of 115×10−4 W/m2 we have obtained is 2.8 μm/min. This is five times higher than that using the conventional sputtering method, and the sputtering yield also reached 70% due to low voltage and high-current Cu-accelerated ions. We have also adapted an ion extraction grid between the Cu target and substrate. Although the growth rate was decreased to 2 μm/min, XRD and XPS showed that highly oriented polycrystalline Cu(111) thin films without carbon and oxygen impurities were obtained with lowest electrical resistivity of 2.0×10−2 μΩm at a target power density of 96.7×10−4 W/m2, substrate temperature of 723 K, and working pressure of 1.3×10−1 Pa. During film deposition, moreover, plasma diagnostics was also carried out in situ by optical emission spectroscopy analysis.Various metals, such as Ag, Cu, Au, and its alloys have been investigated as possible materials for the replacement of Al and its alloys for electrical interconnects for ULSI applications The conventional methods to fabricate the pure Cu thin films are chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as well as physical vapor deposition (PVD), such as simple sputtering Experiments were carried out using a homemade sputtering system with newly developed high-rate and high-power magnetron sputter source, as schematically shown in We used a pulsed DC of 3.333-kHz frequency and 50% duty ratio to improve the crystallinity and grain size of the Cu thin film grown at a low-temperature growth of below 753 K. Si(100) and Corning 1737 glass were used as substrates, which were heated by either a heater or plasma in the temperature range between 573 and 753 K. The substrate temperature was measured using an optical pyrometer. The general growth conditions of the Cu thin films are 2.7×10   OES is a powerful tool for controlling the sputtering and deposition process and for optimizing both the Cu film layers properties. In this study, we used OES for qualitative in situ plasma diagnostics.  To check whether the film crystallinity as well as impurity, such as carbon and oxygen, can influence to the electrical resistivity or not, we carried out X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectra measurements. New unbalanced magnetron sputtering source was designed and constructed for improving growth rate and target yield. Due to the homogeneous magnetron field of 0.03 Tesla, we were able to operate the target power density up to maximum 115×10 Support of this research by the Center for Advanced Plasma Surface Technology of the Sungkyunkwan University and by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Korea (Project No. M10214000278-02B1500-04211) is gratefully acknowledgment.
