The oxygen evolution and corrosion behaviors of Pb/Pb-MnO2 composite anode in H2SO4 solution were investigated comparing with Pb and industrial Pb-Ag (1.0%) anodes. Its electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corrosion resistance were evaluated using galvanostatic polarization and ionic equilibrium method. The microcosmic morphology of the anodic layer during the polarization was observed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The results indicate that this kind of composite anode displays particular anodic behaviors during the galvanostatic polarization due to the changes of surface state: A “potential valley” with the minimal potential of about 300mV lower than that of Pb anode can be observed at the very beginning of the polarization; then the anodic potential gradually decrease. The stable potential after 72h is 100–150mV lower than that of Pb anode and comparable to industrial Pb-Ag (1.0%) anode. Furthermore, the corrosion resistance of the composite anode largely depends on the MnO2 content in deposit. The dissolution of Pb is very little at the early stage, then, after standing a period of heavy intergranular corrosion, a stationary PbO2-MnO2 composite layer will be formed on the anode surface, which is predicted to present satisfactory corrosion resistance in the long-time electrolysis.Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important electrochemical processes during the electrowinning of nonferrous metals ( Aimed at decreasing the high over-potential of OER, some researchers paid their attention to the development of electrocatalytic oxides, which were typically coated on a titanium plate or mesh by thermal-decomposition or electrodeposition, called Dimensional Stable Anode (DSA) ( In order to avoid the passivation problem of DSA, recently, the association of a conducting matrix and an active dispersed phase has been explored as a new type of anode for OER. This design couples the high electrocatalytic activity of dispersed phase to the high electrical conductivity, good mechanical and chemical stability of the matrix ( As one of the most frequently used OER catalysts, MnO According to the satisfied electrocatalytic activity of MnO This paper presents a further electrochemical study on this matrix-dispersed phase composite anode in the typical H The Pb-MnO The microscopic morphologies of Pb, industrial Pb-Ag (1.0%) alloy (YGGL Co. Ltd., China) and Pb/Pb-MnO Electrolysis experiments of aforesaid Pb, Pb-Ag and Pb/Pb-MnO The corrosion of lead-based anode in H In this paper, the concentrations of lead and manganese in electrolyte were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Z-5000) at several time points during the galvanostatic polarization. The average corrosion rates between every two adjacent points were separately calculated to analyze the electrochemical corrosion disciplines of the three kinds of anodes.  Since industrial electrowinning processes are operated at constant current, the anodic potential is one of the most significant criterions to estimate the energy consumption. Magnifying the very beginning of the polarization curves, a visible “potential valley” can be found in the curves of Pb/Pb-MnO The relationships of anodic potentials, particles content in deposit and CED suspension are shown in The relationships of anodic potentials, particles content in deposit and deposition time (represent the deposit thickness) are shown in These aforesaid dependences of anodic potentials on particles content in deposit and deposit thickness (indicated by the deposition time) are probably ascribed to the integrative influence of high electrocatalytic activity and poor conductivity of embedded MnO Lead and manganese concentration in the electrolyte of Pb, Pb-Ag and Pb/Pb-MnO The average values of anodic corrosion rate between every two adjacent times points, as shown in The micrographs (SEI) obtained on the surface of Pb, Pb-Ag and Pb/Pb-MnO When the polarization reaches the 24th hour, the surface morphologies of three anodes have changed to a large extent. The anodic layer of Pb-Ag anode represents the most compact and smoothest surface with the absence of prismatic PbSO After polarization for 72 The electrocatalytic activity and corrosion behaviors of the matrix-dispersed phase type Pb/Pb-MnO The corrosion rate of Pb/Pb-MnO
