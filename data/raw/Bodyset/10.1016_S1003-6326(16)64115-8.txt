Six kinds of galena with different impurities were synthesized and the effects of impurities on the floatability of galena were investigated. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters on the galena surface were measured using microcalorimetry, and the adsorption configuration and energy of butyl xanthate on the surfaces of galena with different impurities were simulated by density functional theory. Flotation experiments showed that Ag and Bi significantly promoted the recovery of galena, while Zn, Sb, Mn, and Cu reduced the recovery of the flotation. Microthermokinetic results indicated that the absolute value of xanthate adsorption heat was directly proportional to the flotation recovery of galena. Adsorption heat and reaction rate coefficients of xanthate on galena containing Ag or Bi were larger than those on pure galena, but smaller on galena containing Cu or Sb. Additionally, the relationship between the heat of unsaturated adsorption of xanthate and the adsorption energy of impurity atom on galena surface was investigated.
