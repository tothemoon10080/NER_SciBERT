We retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of a clavicle hook plate as a fixation device for unstable distal end comminuted clavicle fractures. Seven patients who visited our hospital between March 2004 and January 2009 were included in this study. The patients' age ranged from 26 years to 65 years, and the mean follow-up period was 6.9 months. All fractures were united, and there was no case of delayed union. There were no complications after surgery. At the final follow-up in January 2010, six excellent and one good Constant-Murley scores were noted. We conclude that the use of a hook plate is a reasonable option for fixation of an unstable distal end comminuted clavicle fracture, resulting in a high rate of union and satisfactory functional results.
