Expressions and guidelines for determination of electrode's effective thickness, optimum charging current density and electrode utilization in device with certain electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivity were developed, and systematically used to study the performance of electrochemical capacitors (ECs). Effective thickness of electrode increases along with increase in effective conductivity of electrolyte and decreases as charging current density is increase. It was seen that every current density applied to device of specific electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivity has corresponding effective thickness of electrode, and when charged at current density higher than its maximum current density, materials (electrodes) utilization was less than 100%. Also, when device with electrode's thickness higher than the effective thickness was charged at its maximum current density, materials (electrodes) utilization reduced below 100%. Materials utilization decreases along with increase in charging current density and electrode thickness, but increases as effective conductivity of electrode and electrolyte are increase. Therefore, optimum/effective thickness of electrode and optimum current density must be employed in charging device of given electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivity for maximum materials utilization and performance (with minimum or no potential drop). Optimum current density beyond which energy density decays increases along with increase in electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivity and decrease in electrode thickness. Use of optimum current density and effective electrode's thickness to maximize energy and power densities is inevitable, because increase in current density results in increase in power density and decrease in energy density.Is electron’s absolute charge, Is rate of charge’s change when ions are oxidized (reduced), Is total concentration of shuttle ions in electrolyte, cm Are surface rates of oxidation and reduction of ions respectively, (cm Are coefficients of diffusion of oxidized and reduced ions in separator whose pores are filled with electrolyte respectively, cm Is capacitance, F Is volume specific capacitance, F/cm Is area of visible surface of electrodes, cm Are diffusivity of positive and negative ions of electrolyte respectively, m Are values of charges of positive and negative ions of electrolyte, respectively, C Is number of electrons transferred in electrode reaction, Is surface density of current, A/cm Are thicknesses of negative/positive electrode, separator, and capacitor, respectively, cm Are current densities in electrode and electrolyte respectively, A/cm Are volume density of current of generation and recombination of non-equilibrium charge carriers in capacitor respectively, A/cm Are time of charging and discharging, respectively, h or s Is mass of symmetric electrochemical capacitor, kg Is energy density of symmetric electrochemical capacitor, Wh/kg Is power density of symmetric electrochemical capacitor, kW/kg Is initial concentration of reactant, mole/cm Is concentration of oxidized specie, mole/cm Is total thickness of separator and anode, cm, Is diffusion coefficient of oxidized species, cm Is total current density that are lost due to self-discharge Is migration/shuttle self-discharge current density Are conductivity of electrodes matrix and electrolyte, respectively, S/cm Are effective conductivity of electrode and electrolyte, respectively, S/cm Are porosity of electrode and separator, respectively.

Nevertheless, the major challenge for existing ECs is the energy density that is usually much less than those of batteries and fuel cells, even for pseudocapacitors and hybrid capacitors. The low energy density of existing ECs cannot completely serve the growing demand of applications that needs high energy density, and therefore, limits their general application In order to prevail over this challenge, substantial study has been dedicated to improve the energy density of ECs The value of electrodes density is ignored while searching for enhanced EC performance. Best EC performance in terms of gravimetric energy and power densities are achieved when electrodes of low density are used and only mass of the electrodes were taken as mass of the device, but this performance metrics are artificially enhanced Value of high density electrodes has been recently presented by various researchers Wu et al. Ghodbane et al. It was shown in our previous work that specific capacitance and specific energy of device with given electrodes thickness and effective conductivities of electrodes and electrolyte decrease along with increase in current density, while specific power increase Herein, we successfully studied the dependence of EC's energy and power densities on electrode thickness, electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities and applied current density. Expressions and guidelines for determination of electrode's effective thickness, optimum charging current density and electrode's utilization in device of certain electrode and electrolyte's effective conductivity were developed, and systematically used to study performance of ECs. Expressions for determination of electrode's effective thickness and utilization were used to demonstrate the dependence of every current density applied to device on specific electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities, and the corresponding effective thickness of electrode. It was shown from electrode utilization expression that when cell of specific electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities with electrode's effective thickness was charged beyond its maximum current density, materials (electrodes) utilization was less than 100%. It was similarly shown that when device with electrodes thickness higher than the effective thickness was charged at its maximum current density, materials (electrodes) utilization reduced below 100%. Liquid-phase potential drops that occur in ECs of the same electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities but different electrode thicknesses when charged at different current density were determined from the model expression. Also, storable energy, energy density and power density of ECs with the same electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities and different electrode thicknesses when charged at different current density were determined from the developed model equations. Applied current density at which maximum energy and maximum power densities were achieved in capacitors of specific electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivities and different electrode thicknesses was determined ( Electronic current Total current in electrodes is sum of electronic current Potential drop in solid-phase is greatly smaller than potential drop in liquid-phase, because effective conductivity of electrodes is usually greatly bigger than effective conductivity of electrolyte in electrochemical capacitors The limit of potential drop and electrodes length [ Typical length scale [ The ratio of electrodes thickness Electrodes utilization The model for potential The boundary conditions of this task during capacitor discharging are as follows: The boundary conditions of this task during capacitor charging are as follows: Eq. Since this is symmetric EC, potential of positive electrode is similarly given by: The voltage of symmetric electrochemical capacitors as functions of electrode thickness, separator thickness, specific capacitance of device and time is determined by: From Eqs. Electronic conductivity of separator is zero, because it is a non-conductor of electrons and entire charge current in separator is ionic (by ions). Storable energy, deliverable energy and power The mass of symmetric EC is mass of each porous electrode, separator, and electrolyte inside each electrode and separator, and is determined by Energy density In the simulation, the device was charged from its lower voltage of 0.0 The data used in simulation were obtained from our last work, Ike et al. Effective thickness of EC electrodes is dependent on electrode's and electrolyte's effective conductivity as well as applied current density. Effective thickness of EC electrodes majorly depends on effective conductivity of electrolyte and applied charging current, because electrode's effective conductivity is usually very high compared with that of electrolyte.
