The Magotteaux Automatic Ball Charger (ABC) optimizes ball mill performance by controlling ball addition. Each ABC consists of a storage hopper, vibrating feeder, load cells, local control electronics and computer link to the grinding process. The system continuously monitors absorbed power, feed rate and ball consumption to calculate the proper ball addition rate to maintain optimum mill power. Advantages of the ABC include optimized grinding through mill power control, reduced operator involvement, and real time adjustment of ball consumption rates relative to the abrasiveness off the current mill feed.
