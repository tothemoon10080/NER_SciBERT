A combination of open pit (OP) and underground (UG) mining methods may be applied for extraction of large scale orebodies. Although the optimization of production scheduling of each of these methods has been addressed separately, the simultaneous optimization of the whole mining operations has less been studied. However, such overall optimization strategy may enhance the net present value (NPV) of the adventure, determine the optimum transition depth (OTD), and help to manage natural resources accurately. This paper aims to determine an OTD between OP and block caving (BC) mining methods while scheduling an orebody entirely. In this regard, a semi-symmetrical integer programming (IP) model has been developed and implemented on a real orebody. The numerical results indicate that the OTD locates 10 m above the original OP bottom. By considering this level as the optimum separating limit of OP and UG mining operations, the NPV of the whole project will increase by up to 0.28%. Through the study, the definition of transition zone has been clarified and the transition capability has been introduced as a new term in mining literature.The growing consumption of mineral-based commodities all through the world in one hand, and the depletion of high grade and shallow deposits on the other hand, forces the mine planners to exploit the rest of mineral reserves more optimally ( The cheapness and safety of OP operations persuade mine planners to extract the surficial portions of mineral reserves by this mining method. Besides, the use of large-scale machinery in OP mines can provide the highest production rate, expedite the capital return, and enhance the When a unique deposit is planned to be extracted by a combination of OP and BC mining methods, the total The determination of a depth for transitioning from OP to UG mining has been addressed for more than five decades. The primitive solution approaches, which are a type of simple cost models, derived from the notion of balancing or minimizing the cost of upper and lower mining methods ( The recent studies indicate that the transition problem has been addressed in the form of a combined scheduling problem. The novelty of this approach, along with a variety of UG mining methods, have provided a broad field of operational research application in the mining industry ( The economic benefits of mining adventures should be attractive to investors. Thus, the mine planners are commonly seeking to maximize the             The former and latter parts of objective function in Eq. During the last decades, the structure of the OP scheduling problems has been identified comprehensively (         The rest of parameters and indexes are the same as previously defined for Eq. Due to the variety of UG mining methods and a collection of different complexities that each method contains, the literature on this optimization field is recent. Lately, Khodayari and Pourrahimian proposed a Reducing the amount of ore dilution while applying caving methods is considered as one of the main challenges in mining industry. In BC, the waste rocks flow toward the empty space and dilution occurs as the ore is drawn from under cuts. Thus, it is practiced to control the dilution percentage by drawing the broken rocks from neighboring columns in harmony with each other.     In BC, the overlaying blocks move downward as the lower blocks are depleted. Thus, the location of unmined blocks changes dynamically before depletion. Therefore, regarding the block dependencies in the form of constraints (9–13) seems hard and confusing. From a different point of view, the present study suggests another approach that controls the flow of broken materials in the form of OP precedence constraint ( It is notable that a significant difference exists between the OP and BC methods in a sequential viewpoint. As shown in By considering the suggested approach, a set of semi-symmetrical formulations is proposed as the transition model between OP and BC mining methods (Eqs.         As shown, the sequences of block depletion in the caving part would not be restricted to a specific direction. The free-directional sequencing approach can be applied in the long-term production scheduling of BC when the maximum The proposed model of the transition problem was applied in a scenario-based framework on a real iron ore mine. According to the existing plans, the mine was designed to produce around 50 million tons of ore from an OP area with a maximum depth 260 m. Without having a perspective of UG mining, almost 44 million tons of ore remained unmined beneath the pit bottom. The brittleness characteristic of the orebody was encouraging to launch the early UG studies based on an appropriate caving method. Determination of the transition depth emerged as a main concern through the studies. In order to create the required scenarios, the block model of the whole deposit was divided into two parts for each scenario. The elevation of predesigned OP bottom, which had been distinctively optimized and fixed at level of 1300 m, was considered as the base scenario. Rationally, the transition zone is located just above the pit bottom since the optimal limit of the original OP mine cannot be deepened. The transition zone is an area which could be potentially mined by OP or UG mining methods ( As it was mentioned already, the transition problem lies within the scope of long-term production scheduling. It is commonly known that solving the OP production scheduling is difficult due to the large number of blocks which should be taken into account. Regarding the transition problem, the excessive blocks of UG part exacerbate the problem. The time and block aggregation policies are commonly used in such conditions ( The total undiscounted values of the upper and lower block models can be used for an early detection of possible transition depths (i.e., scenarios that can be evaluated). This is feasible by summing the values of the OP and UG mining portions, which locate above and below each candidate level, respectively. Expectedly, releasing the ore and waste blocks from the upper models, removing the waste ones, and incorporating ore blocks to the corresponding lower models increases the value of UG portions in successive scenarios. Following this policy for our case, a number of considerable upsurges observed between levels 1300 m–1310 m, 1310 m–1320 m, and 1350 m–1360 m ( In our case under study, as the production scheduling of all scenarios was accomplished, it was revealed that the best transition level locates 10 m above the pit bottom (1300 m + 10 m). This OTD has been determined by considering economic aspects of the project solely. However, the other significant factors such as reserve uncertainties, unpredicted operational risks, and geotechnical considerations may prohibit the decision makers to migrate from OP to UG mining. In addition, the accessibility of OP machinery, the number of personnel who have been trained for OP operation, the safety and ease of OP activities are some advantages that cannot be overlooked. Further, as shown in Furthermore, although the rate of increment in In a mathematic language, by considering Further, the capability of transition decreases when the It is notable that the The greater values of Determining the OTD is considered as one of the main concerns in the extraction of mineral reserves that extend from surface to the greater depths. The present study focused on the reserves that are viable to be mined by both OP and BC mining methods. By considering a new approach in solving the transition problem, we adapted the drawing process of broken materials in BC to the OP block removal order. This way, a combination of OP model and its reverse form was constructed as a semi-symmetric optimization model. Then, the model was implemented on some combinations of OP and UG block models. The OTD was found to be 10 m above the predesigned OP bottom. In addition, the reasons why a negligible improvement in total The present study discussed some essential aspects of the transition problems. The definition of transition zone was clarified with the help of total
