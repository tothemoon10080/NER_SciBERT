Purpose
                  The purpose of this study is to report the results of a series of infected forearm nonunions treated from 1998 to 2012 using a staged reconstruction technique.
               
                  Methods
                  At a median of 42 months follow-up, 7 patients who had an average segmental defect of 4.9 cm (range, 2.3â€“10.4 cm) were available for clinical and radiographic evaluation. Treatment consisted of serial debridement, implantation of an antibiotic cement spacer, and staged reconstruction using a bulk radius or ulna allograft with intramedullary fixation.
               
                  Results
                  All 7 patients ultimately achieved solid bone union, although 4 patients (57%) required additional surgery, consisting of autologous bone grafting and plating, to achieve healing at 1 of the allograft-host junction sites. No patient had recurrence of infection, and all reported substantial improvement with increased function and decreased pain.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Our approach ultimately resulted in a 100% union rate without recurrence of infection, although many patients may require additional surgery to attain healing at both allograft-junction sites. Using bulk allograft provides the ability to span a large defect while reconstituting the forearm anatomy.
