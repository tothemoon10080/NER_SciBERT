A new hybrid process for cleaning wastewater combining membrane microfiltration and flotation was investigated. The hybrid process combined the advantages of both membrane separation and flotation: the flotation cell removed a large proportion of suspended solid particles, while the membrane module produced a clean water permeate effluent. The proof of concept for the hybrid solid/liquid separation process was investigated using an aqueous suspension of ultra-fine zeolite particles. Process parameters investigated were liquid and gas superficial velocities and backflushing. Promising results are reported regarding solid/liquid separation, including a case study of mine wastewater; attention has also been paid to the economics of this integrated process.
