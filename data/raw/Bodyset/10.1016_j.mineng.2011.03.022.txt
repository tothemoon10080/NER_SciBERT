The entrainment of fine quartz particles into magnetite coagulates in a uniform magnetic field was studied through in situ observation using a video microscope. It is shown that the mechanisms for this entrainment are attributed to the magnetic coagulation of locked quartz–magnetite particles with free magnetite particles, the entrainment of free quartz particles into magnetite pearl chains, and wrapping of magnetite circular chains round free and locked quartz particles.Magnetic coagulation is termed for the aggregation of magnetic particles in an external magnetic field due to magnetic attraction between the particles ( Magnetic drum separator is widely used in industry for magnetite concentration ( The magnetite concentrate sample was collected from the Peña Colorada concentrate plant in Colima state, Mexico. Only the size fraction of −25 Two Helmholtz coils were used in this study for the generation of a uniform magnetic field ( The sequence of photographs of a locked quartz–magnetite particle entrained into a magnetite chain in the uniform magnetic field with gradual increase of field intensity is shown in The sequence of photographs of a free quartz particle entrained into magnetite pearl chain in a uniform magnetic field with gradual increase of field intensity is shown in  In all of the three cases, the entrainment of quartz particles into magnetite coagulates closely correlated with magnetic field intensity. Therefore, it is suggested that the magnetic separations of magnetite from ores (magnetic drum and magnetic screening, etc.) should be realized at a low-intensity magnetic field, in order to avoid the contamination of silicate minerals into magnetite concentrates. The experimental results presented in this paper have indicated that quartz particles entrained into magnetite coagulates in an external magnetic field in the following ways: (1) magnetic coagulation of locked quartz-magnetite particles with free magnetite particles, (2) free quartz particles being a link of magnetite pearl chain, (3) magnetite circular chains wrapping round free and locked quartz particles. Therefore, it is suggested that the magnetic coagulation and drum separation of magnetite fines should be realized in a very low-intensity field, in order to remove silicate minerals deeply from magnetite concentrates.
