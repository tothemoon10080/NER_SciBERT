Proteins comprise the largest soil N reservoir but cannot be taken up directly by microorganisms and plants due to size constraints and stabilization of proteins in organo-mineral associations. Therefore the cleavage of this high molecular weight organic N to smaller soluble compounds as amino acids is a key step in the terrestrial N cycle. In the last years two isotope pool dilution approaches have been successfully established to measure gross rates of protein depolymerization and microbial amino acid uptake in soils. However, both require laborious sample preparation and analyses, which limits sample throughput. Therefore, we here present a novel isotope pool dilution approach based on the addition of 15N-labeled amino acids to soils and subsequent concentration and 15N analysis by the oxidation of α-amino groups to NO2
                     − and further reduction to N2O, followed by purge-and-trap isotope ratio mass spectrometry (PT-IRMS). We applied this method in mesocosm experiments with forest and meadow soils as well as with a cropland soil amended with either organic C (cellulose) or organic N (bovine serum albumin). To measure direct organic N mineralization to NH4
                     +, the latter was captured in acid traps and analyzed by an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method provides fast and precise measurements of at%15N even at low amino acid concentrations, allows high sample throughput and enables parallel estimations of instantaneous organic N mineralization rates.The cleavage of high molecular weight (HMW) organic N to small organic N compounds such as free amino acids (FAA) and amino sugars, which can be taken up directly by soil microorganisms and plants, has been recognized as the rate limiting step in the terrestrial N cycle, also fueling the inorganic N cycle ( Promising approaches to fill this knowledge gap are isotope pool dilution (IPD) experiments which have already been successfully applied for inorganic N processes including organic N mineralization and nitrification ( Currently available protocols for isotope analysis of FAA are based on compound-specific isotope analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of derivatized samples (e.g. However, both protocols involve tedious sample preparation and subsequent isotope analysis of single amino acids, and one may only want the integral of FAA production and consumption rates. We therefore sought to simplify the isotope analysis for FAA, and here present a high-throughput method to measure FAA concentrations and δ The proposed method for isotope analysis of FAA-N is based on the cleavage and oxidation of the terminal α-amino groups (α-NH To evaluate the method proposed by Mineral soil samples (0–15 cm) used for high resolution time kinetics were collected in triplicate from a temperate meadow and a mixed spruce-beech forest in the vicinity of Vienna (Austria) in spring 2016 ( To address the effects of the relative availabilities of organic C and organic N on protein depolymerization and microbial FAA uptake in cropland soils, the presented IPD assay was applied to two treatments, manipulating the availabilities of organic C or organic N, as well as to a control treatment. Triplicate mineral soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected from a cropland in Styria (Austria) in June 2016 and sieved to < 2 mm. The soil was cropped by a mixture of vegetables and classified as Eutric Cambisol ( Gross rates of protein depolymerization and microbial amino acid uptake were measured by an isotope pool dilution assay ( To measure concentrations of FAA and at% All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck or Fluka in the highest available purity, and reagent solutions were prepared in ultrapure water (MilliQ, Millipore, Germany). For the cleavage and oxidation of the α-NH Measurements of N Accounting for the variable oxidation yields of different amino acids ( Recoveries of added tracer in the FAA and NH Limits of detection (LOD) were calculated as 3σ/S and limits of quantification (LOQ) as 9σ/S, where σ is the standard deviation of repeated blank measurements and S is the slope of the respective regression line (a(x)) of the N Mean residence times (MRT) were calculated as FAA concentration divided by gross amino acid uptake. Errors of gross depolymerization, gross microbial amino acid uptake rate and MRT were propagated by Gaussian error propagation using an online tool ( The yield of NO The applicability of the presented To study the response of organic N transformations to soil C and N availabilities, we conducted a mesocosm experiment with a cropland soil with addition of either organic C (cellulose) or organic N (bovine serum albumin) and with unamended soil as a control treatment. Due to the addition of cellulose the soil C:N ratio increased by 3 units in the C treatment, while C:N ratios in the protein-N treatment decreased by 1.4 units ( The observed yields of NO Considering the variability of the NO However, the precision of LC-MS and GC-MS measurements is affected by the amino acid composition, and comparisons with PT-IRMS need to account for single versus total free amino acids. The precision of the isotope calibrations was excellent even at low concentrations (10 μM, In a preliminary experiment with soils from the sampling site in Styria (Austria) we tested the extraction of FAA with different concentrations of KCl (0.1 M, 0.2 M, 0.4 M, 0.6 M, 0.8 M, 1 M) and different extractants (1 M KCl, 10 mM CaSO In summary, the LC-MS method provides by far the highest precision of all currently available methods for amino acid N isotope analysis, and it offers the great potential to be applied in metabolic flux analyses using uniformly A major limitation of isotope pool dilution experiments is that other potential sources of influx cannot be distinguished from the target process (i.e. protein depolymerization). For example, increasing soil water potential due to liquid Our results on the MRT of FAA suggest rapid turnover of the soil FAA pool ( The addition of organic C in the form of cellulose resulted in higher average protein depolymerization rates, although not significantly ( Our work shows that the proposed PT-IRMS method is suitable for We thank Theresa Böckle, Claudia Schneider, Josephine Pfeifer and Sebastian Schneider for their help with the C:N-experiment.
