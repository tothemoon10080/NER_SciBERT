The effect of different binders on compressive strength and shatter resistance of flotation iron concentrate briquettes was investigated. Binders used were bentonite, lime, bituminous coal and cellulose. The Haematite concentrate was obtained by reverse flotation of fluorspar tailings. Characterisation of the iron concentrate was done and various operating parameters on the briquetting of the iron concentrate was investigated. The results showed that 80% of the tailings particles were - 150µm in size and major mineral phases are haematite, quartz and calcium tecto-dialuminodisilicate. The iron concentrate briquettes started forming at a concentration of 9% weight for all binders. Bentonite and cellulose briquettes showed compression strength above 650 KN/m2 at room temperature whilst lime and coal gave compressive strength of 185 and 40 KN/m2 respectively. Compressive strength of bentonite and cellulose briquettes decreased to 550 and 265 KN/m2 respectively after heating the briquettes at 1000°C whilst that of lime and coal to 0 KN/m2. Cellulose binder gave briquettes with higher shatter resistance of around 100% at temperatures between 25°C and 200°C. For temperatures above 200°C, bentonite gave better results.
