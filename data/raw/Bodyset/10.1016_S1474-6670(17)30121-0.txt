The presented idea of SOLARIS system is the reaction to the need to increase the efficiency of cooperation between automation systems. Due to such organization of information flow, plant operation managing persons, responsible for different elements of production, receive one coherent interface for data access. Dispatcher of the processing plant as well as Manager of Expedition Department will find here the information needed by themselves, and what is important, in any moment, without waiting for reports or compilations till the turn of a shift, or 24 hour period of time.
                  Due to the possibility of completing one's own portions of data, there is no need to make big reports from the work of the whole plant. Such a compilation can be needed for example for the person managing the whole plant, but the person responsible for the individual technological process will chose only the data he or she may need.
