Rigid spargers are enjoying renewed interest in some flotation column applications such as de-inking of recycled paper and de-oiling of water. Sparger selection depends on the characteristics of the sparger (material and geometry), the stream to be processed (% solids, presence of surfactants), and on the dimensions of the column. There is no method to predict gas holdup (or bubble surface area flux) for a given duty. Prediction is difficult because there are two processes involved: the formation of a bubble swarm at the sparger and the rise of the swarm against a countercurrent flow of pulp. A method is proposed to predict gas holdup by a combination of two models: one for bubble formation at the sparger which relates bubble size to sparger and stream characteristics; and the second for bubble flow which relates bubble size to gas holdup and phase hydrodynamics. The method requires a set of gas holdup data to characterize the sparger material in the stream of interest (i.e., calibration). Gas holdup can then be predicted for other spargers of the same material processing the same stream in any column. The method is trailed for a set of porous stainless steel spargers in a laboratory column run with water and frother.
