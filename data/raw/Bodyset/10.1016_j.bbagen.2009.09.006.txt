Background
                  Matrix vesicles have been implicated in the mineralization of calcified cartilage, bone and dentin for more than 40 years. During this period, their exact role, if any in the nucleation of hydroxyapatite mineral, and its subsequent association with the collagen fibrils in the organic matrix has been debated and remains controversial.
               
                  Scope of Review
                  This review summarizes studies spanning the whole history of matrix vesicles, but emphasizes recent findings and several hypotheses which have been recently introduced to explain in greater detail how matrix vesicles function in biomineralization.
               
                  Major Conclusions
                  It is now generally accepted that matrix vesicles have some role(s) in mineralization; that they are the initial site of mineral formation; that MV bud from the plasma membrane of mineral forming cells, but that they take with them only a subset of the materials found in the parent membrane; that the three proteins, alkaline phosphatase, nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase and annexin V have important roles in the process and that matrix vesicles participate in regulating the concentration of PPi in the matrix. In contrast, many open questions remain to be answered.
               
                  General Significance
                  Understanding the role of matrix vesicles in biomineralization will increase our knowledge of this important process.The term matrix vesicles (MV) refers to small (20–200 nm) spherical bodies observed in the pre-mineralized matrix of dentin, cartilage and bone. They appear to be bounded by a lipid bilayer, and are often found associated with small crystals of calcium phosphate mineral. The purpose of this review is to summarize the properties of MV and to describe how they function in the process of mineralization. It should be emphasized that both the properties and the mechanism(s) through which MV function are active areas of investigation and in some contention. This summary is therefore a snapshot of current knowledge from one vantage point. MV were originally discovered through ultrastructural analysis of growth plate cartilage and in bone, where they were seen as the initial sites of mineral formation, prior to matrix mineralization TNAP is the best studied of the MV proteins, and has been implicated in mineralization mechanisms since the 1920s Work from our laboratories and others has demonstrated the importance of the membrane proteins known as annexins in MV function That MV play some role in the calcification of cartilage, bone and dentin is now generally accepted, although the exact nature and extent of that role remains controversial, and the mechanisms through which MV initiate matrix mineralization in these tissues remains unclear. An emerging consensus now emphasizes the central role of the MV enzymes TNAP and NPP1, in conjunction with the cell associated ankylosis protein (ANK) in regulating the onset of calcification Early studies of MV lipid composition determined that there were significant differences between the lipid content of MV and the plasma membranes from which they arise. Wuthier and colleagues Morphological evidence supports the view that MV arise from cells by a “budding” process. In contrast, one study carried out in hybrid osteosarcoma cells concluded, “that matrix vesicle biogenesis is independent and distinct from that of plasma membrane biogenesis.” Recently we studied the lipid organization of MV and PM In bone, MV are also thought to arise by budding from the osteoblast plasma membrane The organic phase of bone, dentin, cementum and calcified cartilage is dominated by collagen fibrils, which serve as the scaffold for calcification. In addition to collagen, the pre-mineralized matrix contains proteoglycans and acidic non-collagenous proteins which are believed to assist and modulate collagen calcification. The principal non-collagenous proteins of bone can be classified as glycosaminoglycan-containing molecules, the proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing molecules, and phosphoproteins In calcifying cartilage, Type X collagen, fibronectin, matrix gla protein and transglutaminase 2 have been implicated in modulating mineralization The endpoint for matrix mineralization is the deposition of small crystallites into collagen fibrils, probably at the hole zones in the collagen structure It is currently believed that MV have at least two principal roles in initiating calcification: (1) MV enzymes regulate the ratio of Pi to PPi in the extracellular fluid, and (2) MV proteins and lipids, including acidic phospholipids serve as nucleation sites for apatite deposition Thus, mineralization is said to proceed in two phases: an initial formation of apatite within MV, and a subsequent propagation phase in the matrix These proposed mechanisms are presented schematically in Many reports have implicated MMPs in pathological mineralization associated with arthritis and cardiovascular calcification, but MMPs also appear to be important for normal tissue development and remodeling Tissue remodeling is a well-known feature in development, which is closely associated with the expression of matrix degrading enzymes A number of MMPs are expressed in growth plate cartilage, including MMP-1, 2, 3 and 9, and the expression of these enzymes is regulated by 1,25-(OH) It has been known for many years that triple-helical collagen molecules are resistant to proteolysis by ordinary proteases, and instead that specific collagenases are required to degrade the molecules. Vertebrate collagenases specifically split Type I collagen between Gly Consideration of the data and hypotheses above leads to some distinct conclusions, and also leaves some open questions about the detailed role of MV in the mineralization of bone, cartilage and dentin. That they have some role(s) is now generally accepted. It is now understood that MV bud from the plasma membrane of mineral forming cells, but that they take with them a subset of the materials found in the parent membrane, leading to enrichment in the MV membrane of acidic phospholipids and certain proteins, particularly TNAP, NPP1 and Annexin V. In the case of TNAP, we estimate that the specific activity in cartilage MV is 10 This work was supported in part by a Grant,
