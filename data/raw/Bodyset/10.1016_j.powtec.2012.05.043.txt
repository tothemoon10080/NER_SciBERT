The flotation of oxidized coal can be well‐improved by dry-grinding, and the flotation of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector will also be discussed in this investigation. The grinding time is 0min, 20min, 40min, 60min and 80min. The dodecane was used as the collector. The flotation tests were conducted in a 1.5L XFD flotation cell. The combustible matter recovery of oxidized coal dry-ground directly increases with the grinding time. But the combustible matter recovery of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector increases firstly and then has a little decrease while the grinding time is more than 40min.The oxidized coal is difficult to float using the oil collectors The coal samples were provided by Taixi Coal Preparation Plant (China). The coal samples were screened to pass 0.25 In this paper, the dodecane was used as the collector and the 2-octanol was used as the frother. The flotation tests were conducted in a 1.5 The grinding process was conducted in a laboratory dry rod mill. The grinding time was 20 The grinding products and flotation concentrate were screened to get four 3 fractions: 0.25–0.125   It is interesting that the combustible matter recovery of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector is higher than that of oxidized coal dry-ground directly while the grinding time is less than 60min, and then lower than that of oxidized coal dry-ground directly while the grinding time is 80 But the combustible matter recovery of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector is lower than that of oxidized coal dry-ground directly while the grinding time is more than 60 As in the flotation of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector, three factors, the decreasing of particle size, the increasing loss of collector, and the adsorption of collector on the oxidized coal surface affect the flotation process. From The combustible matter recovery of oxidized coal dry-ground with collector is much higher than that of oxidized coal dry-ground directly only while the grinding time is 20 This work was supported by a fund from the
