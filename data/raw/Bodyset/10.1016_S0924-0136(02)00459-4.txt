Heat transfer at the metal/chill interface during solidification of commercially pure aluminium square bar castings with cast iron chill at one end was investigated. Experiments were carried out for different chill thicknesses and superheats. The inner surface temperature of the chill initially was found to increase at a faster rate for higher superheats. The effect of chill thickness on the inner surface temperature of the chill was observed only after the heat from the solidifying casting had sufficient time to diffuse to the interior of the chill material.
                  Inverse analysis of the non-linear one-dimensional Fourier heat conduction equation indicated the occurrence of peak heat flux at the end of filling of the mould. The effect of superheat on heat flux was minimal after filling. However, the effect of chill thickness had a significant effect on the heat flux after the occurrence of peak heat flux. Higher heat flux transients were estimated for castings poured at higher superheats. The corresponding heat transfer coefficients were also estimated and reported. The heat flux model presented in this work can be used for determination of casting/chill interfacial heat flux as a function of chill thickness and superheat. These heat flux transients could be used as boundary conditions during numerical simulation of solidification of the casting.distance between interface and position C chill thickness correlation coefficient distance between interface and position D heat transfer coefficient enthalpy upper limit in thermal conductivity small integer heat flux maximum heat flux total heat flow number of future temperature+1 superheat time temperature temperature at location C temperature at casting surface temperature at the chill inner surface temperature at location D distance measured temperature density sensitivity coefficient In recent years, numerical modelling of casting solidification is receiving increasing attention because of its enormous potential in increasing productivity of the metal casting industry by reducing the time associated with the traditional experimental based design of castings The use of chills during freezing of aluminium alloys plays a major role in promoting the directional solidification. One of the important factors that affects heat transfer from the solidifying casting to chills is the resistance offered by the casting/chill interface A generalized temperature boundary condition coupling strategy for the modeling of conventional casting processes was implemented by Trovant and Argyropoulos In the present work, the effect of superheat and chill thickness on the interfacial heat transfer during solidification of commercially pure aluminium has been investigated by estimating the heat flux transients and heat transfer coefficients at the casting/chill interface. Commercially pure aluminium (Al, 99.5%; Fe, 0.25%, Cu, 0.15%, balance others) was melted in a gas fired pit furnace. The liquid metal was degassed using hexachloroethane tablets before pouring into the mould. For fluxing, ammonium chloride was used.  The one-dimensional heat conduction equation The other boundary condition The non-linear estimation procedure determines the value of The unknown boundary condition Now from        With increase in superheat, more heat flows through the chill material because of higher initial temperature difference and better casting–chill contact. This resulted in higher heating rates for the chills shown in Higher maximum chill temperatures were observed in lower chill thickness (  In the present investigation, the peak heat flux is obtained at the end of filling. As the level of liquid metal rises upward the metallostatic pressure increases continuously. When it fills the feeder at the end of filling, the metallostatic pressure is at its maximum. The contact is more intimate with increasing metallostatic pressure which resulted in the occurrence of peak heat flux at the end of filling. To verify whether the peak is associated with the start of solidification, the pouring temperatures were varied. At the end of filling, depending on the superheat of the molten metal, the casting surface was found to be liquid ( At the end of filling, as the liquid level decreases due to shrinkage, the contact pressure gradually decreases. In one hand, when the melt starts to solidify, the solidified skin may have sufficient strength to initiate gap after the end of filling and it gradually increases. On the other hand, when the melt is nearly at the melting point at the end of filling the solidification proceeds with non-conforming solid–solid contact. The lowering of pressure, the non-conforming contact and the initiation of gap are all possibly responsible for the sharp fall in heat flux after the end of filling. A number of investigators  Kumar and Prabhu When the liquid is poured at high superheats, larger is the temperature difference between the casting and chill and the better is the contact and the more is the heat passing through the interface for the same span of time (275 The chill thickness had no significant effect on the heat transfer coefficient ( The effect of superheat on peak heat flux could be represented by a linear regression equation The decrease in the heat flux after reaching a peak value was represented by logarithmic equation as Based on the results and discussion, the following conclusions were drawn: Both chill thickness and superheat had a significant effect on the rate of increase of temperature of chill in contact with the solidifying casting. The increase in superheat increased the heating rate of the chill material during solidification. The effect of chill thickness was observed only after the heat diffused into the interior of the chill material and affected the external surface temperature of the chill. However, the effect of superheat was evident from the initial stages of solidification. The peak heat flux ( The peak heat flux increased with the increase in the superheat and the effect of superheat on heat flux transients was minimal after the occurrence of peak heat flux. The effect of chill thickness on the total heat flux flow was significant at higher superheats. Higher heat transfer coefficients were obtained for higher superheats. The effect of chill thickness on heat transfer coefficients was not significant.
