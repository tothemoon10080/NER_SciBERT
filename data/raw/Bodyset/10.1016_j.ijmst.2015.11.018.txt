The stability control of longwall coalface is the key technology of large-cutting-height mining method. Therefore, a systematic study of the factors that affect coalface stability and its control technology is required in the development of large-cutting-height mining method in China. After the practical field observation and years of study, it was found that the more than 95% of failures in coalface are shear failure. The shear failure analysis model of coalface has been established, that can perform systematic study among factors such as mining height, coal mass strength, roof load, support resistance, and face flipper protecting plate horizontal force. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis of factors influencing coalface stability showed that improving support capacity, cohesion of coal mass and decreasing roof load of coalface are the key to improve coalface stability. Numerical simulation of the factors affecting coalface stability has been performed using UDEC software and the results are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The coalface reinforcement technology of large-cutting-height mining method using the grouting combined with coir rope is presented. Laboratory tests have been carried out to verify its reinforcement effect and practical application has been implemented in several coal mines with good results. It has now become the main technology to reduce longwall coalface failure of large-cutting-height mining method.
