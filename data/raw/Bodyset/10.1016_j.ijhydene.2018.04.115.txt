Ge doped α-Fe2O3 nanowires are synthesized through a hydrothermal procedure with GeO2 as a precursor and investigated as photoanodes for water splitting. The content of Ge in the photoanode rises with the increase of the amount of GeO2 in the precursor solution. A proper amount of Ge facilities the preferred oriented growth of the (110) plane of α-Fe2O3, while excessive Ge hinders the growth of α-Fe2O3 crystals. The doping of Ge increases the absorption efficiency and decreases the recombining rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Ge also improves the density and transfer rate of the charge carriers in the photoanode. Ge doped α-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits a highest photocurrent density of 0.92 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G simulated sunlight, which is nearly twice of that obtained by pure α-Fe2O3 under the same condition.The exploitation and consumption of fossil fuels contribute a lot to the rapid development of the global economy, but also result in an increasing risk of energy shortage and environmental pollution problems A PEC cell is constituted by a photoanode and a photocathode for the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. Hematite (α-Fe Morphology control and element doping are two of the most common strategies to enhance the PEC performance of hematite photoanodes Ge doped hematite has been synthesized through various approaches such as sputter deposition, spray pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, dip-coating and ultrasonic decomposition α-Fe Ge doped α-Fe The surface properties of the pure and Ge-doped α-Fe The photoelectrochemical properties of the photoanodes were investigated using a three-electrode configuration with a Pt sheet (10 × 10 mm The XPS results of pure and Ge doped α-Fe Characteristic peaks of the FTO substrate (JCPDS 41-1445) and α-Fe  Mott-Schottky plots of pure and Ge doped α-Fe The EIS results of the photoanodes and the equivalent circuit are illustrated in The polarization curves of the photoanodes are presented in In this work, Ge doped α-Fe The financial support of
