Jamaica has about 7.1% of world bauxite reserves however the ore characteristics vary significantly depending on mining location and mineralogy. Traditionally, low phosphorus hematite-rich deposits from south central Jamaica are processed in a low temperature alumina refinery but these ores are becoming depleted and will be replaced by high phosphorus goethite-rich resources that are located north of the current mines. Depending on type, P-minerals may dissolve during bauxite digestion, accumulate in the liquor and negatively impact the process. This work compares the caustic extractable PO4

                     3− concentrations from their total phosphorus levels measured via XRF. Filtered liquors from the low temperature caustic digestion of 104 samples from a goethite-rich future-bauxite reserve (0.4–32.8% PO4
                     3−) and 30 hematite-rich samples (0.1–1.27% PO4
                     3−) from current mines were analyzed for soluble PO4
                     3− concentrations using the ascorbic acid molybdenum blue spectrophotometric procedure. The concentrations of PO4
                     3− in liquor increased dramatically with processing of the goethite-rich ores (5–21,000 mg PO4
                     3−/L) in comparison to digestion of the traditional hematite-rich bauxites (52–319 mg PO4
                     3−/L if one unusual sample is excluded). An empirical equation (mg PO4
                     3−/L = 0.085(mg PO4/kg) + 103; R2 = 0.93) is proposed that uses the total phosphate concentrations of goethite-rich bauxites to predict the soluble PO4
                     3− concentrations of their digestion liquors to within ±20% of the measured values. A comparable equation (mg PO4
                     3−/L = 0.082 mg PO4
                     3−/kg – 26; R2 = 0.67) to predict caustic soluble phosphorus from the hematite-rich ores was also developed however it has a larger margin of error. The correlations are applicable only to normal bauxite samples from the specific mining areas and with Ca:PO4
                     3− ratios of <0.40; they are less effective at higher ratios however as apatite or calcite is often present in such bauxites and results in lower than usual soluble PO4
                     3− concentrations. Evaluation of the Ca:PO4
                     3− ratios in the bauxites in conjunction with the measured soluble PO4
                     3− concentrations confirms that crandallite is the dominant P mineral in both the hematite-rich and goethite-rich bauxites.The control of soluble phosphate in Bayer liquors is a challenge for engineers at plants that use Jamaican bauxites as the phosphate concentrations are generally higher than in bauxite deposits in other parts of the world ( Bauxite plants typically extract alumina by digesting suitable ores with concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions at either 135–150 °C (the low temperature process; LT) or 230–250 °C (the high temperature process; HT) ( The bauxite deposits in parts of south-central Jamaica are hematite-rich, have low phosphorus and are traditionally processed in a low temperature alumina refinery. Supplies of these resources are diminishing however and new bauxite feed is expected to come from the goethite-rich, high phosphorus deposits that are located north of the current mines ( The processing of Jamaica's goethitic bauxites has been associated with increased mud loads, poorer mud settling characteristics, enhanced caustic and alumina losses and increased dissolved phosphate and other liquor contaminants ( The secondary P minerals are caustic soluble and if not adequately managed, dissolved PO The amount of Ca required to effect PO During bauxite digestion, crandallite dissolves alongside the alumina minerals and contributes aluminate and PO The dissolution of wavellite (Eq. (3)) and variscite (Eq. (4)) proceed differently from crandallite as these phosphorus-bearing minerals do not contain calcium hence all the PO In order to manage soluble phosphate in refineries that process Jamaican high‑phosphorus bauxites there is need for a simple mechanism to estimate the Ca dosages required to precipitate the PO The XRF and XRD data available for stored bauxite exploration samples from both the hematite-rich and goethite-rich mining areas in south-central Jamaica were reviewed and 104 (numbered within 1–146) were selected from the future goethitic mining area and 30 (numbered within 147–178) selected from the currently mined hematite-rich deposits. Samples were selected to cover a variety of mining locations, sampling depths, and a broad range of elemental concentrations. About 80% of the samples selected had mineralogies and elemental concentrations that are typical of bauxites processed using the low temperature Bayer process while the remainder had high concentrations of P, Ca, Zn or other elements of interest. Sub-samples of the archived samples were crushed, sieved and stored for use in the analyses described below. The elemental concentrations and the major minerals in these bauxites have been discussed elsewhere ( Bauxite samples (1.3 g) were digested in 10.0 mL portions of 102 g/L NaOH (ACS grade; BDH Chemicals), initially in steel and subsequently in Teflon bombs at 145 °C for 30 min. Slurries were centrifuged and then filtered prior to taking an aliquot for dissolved phosphate analysis; the volume taken depended on the total phosphorus concentration in the bauxite. The aliquots were acidified to pH 2 with 5 M H The uncertainties in the data were assessed by digesting and analyzing several duplicates within analytical runs and through repeated digestions and analyses of selected samples across analytical runs. The detection limit was determined to be 10 mg PO The XRF characteristics of the bauxites studied in this work are summarized in The soluble phosphate concentrations of 30 exploration bauxite samples taken from a hematite-rich mining area and 104 from the goethite-rich deposits that will be mined in the future are plotted against their total PO  In all except bauxites 60 and 77, the only P mineral detected by XRD was crandallite and only when the PO Apatite could be detected in the XRD patterns of the insoluble digestion residues if the phosphate concentrations in the original bauxites were >26,000 mg PO Exploration samples of >60,000 mg PO The five points that fall well below the straight line in Detailed mineralogical data are not available for the five high calcium samples, however based on their elemental concentrations they all have Ca:PO The scatter in The performance of The data for the catchment samples are presented in Consideration of all the data from both the hematite-rich and goethite-rich samples that have phosphate concentrations of <60,000 mg PO When limiting the data to those from samples that are more likely to be processed, the regression lines model the data reasonably well although the equations for the two types of samples differ slightly. The slopes are only marginally different with both being slightly less than the theoretical crandallite solubility slope. The high‑calcium samples of goethitic bauxites (>11,000 mg Ca/kg) that were excluded from the hillside model all have Ca:PO Sample 59 that was omitted from the hillside model, has a Ca:PO The behavior of the other five bauxites that were not included in the hillside linear model because of high Ca concentrations can be rationalized by considering the Ca to phosphate mass ratio; the ratio exceeds 0.5 for these five samples. If the ratio is close to or exceeds that for apatite (1.68) then there is possibly no extractable phosphate, as is the case for bauxites 66, 69 and 76. Samples 40 and 80 have Ca:PO A Ca:PO The soluble phosphate concentrations of the catchment bauxite samples do not correlate to phosphate in the bauxites (mg PO Whereas the observed phosphate concentrations tended to be equal to or less than those predicted from crandallite for the hematite-rich samples, the situation for the hillside bauxites is slightly different, in that the concentrations are scattered about the crandallite solubility line. Goethite-rich bauxites with high phosphate concentrations from a new mining area in south-central Jamaica (hillside bauxites) were evaluated for use in a low temperature bauxite plant that currently processes low phosphorus bauxites with hematite as the dominant iron mineral (catchment bauxites). The goethite-rich bauxite samples have much higher concentrations of phosphate (4282–328,754 mg PO Trends in the soluble PO In conclusion, it was found that processing of the goethite-rich bauxite samples under typical low temperature Bayer conditions will result in significant PO The authors wish to acknowledge
