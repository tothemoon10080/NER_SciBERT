Existing methods for shale reservoir stimulation (e.g., hydraulic fracturing) focus mainly on improving the physical recovery of free phase gases from shales. Few studies explore the enhanced recovery of adsorbed methane from shale due to the difficulty in simultaneously separating the recovery of both the adsorbed and free phase gas. In this study, we use an NMR-based methodology to separately evaluate the change in adsorbed and non-adsorbed (free-phase) methane during the injection of CO2. We evaluate mechanisms contributing to the enhanced recovery of adsorbed-gas with CO2 injection (Longmaxi shale, Jiaoshiba field, SW China). Results show that the injection of CO2 can improve the efficiency of recovery of residual gas in the adsorbed phase by an additional ~25% and can enhance the percent recovery per hour of adsorbed methane by ~11% at ambient pressure and ~4% at abandonment pressure. The experiments also demonstrate that a higher concentration ratio of CO2/CH4 is more suitable for CO2-CH4 displacement, and the CO2-CH4 displacement rate is relatively rapid during the early phase of interaction, immediately after injection. Despite inherent uncertainty, these experiments demonstrate the capability of enhancing adsorbed-gas recovery by injection of CO2 into shale.Shales are fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks formed by the compaction of predominately clay-sized materials, including both mineralogical and organic materials ( Enhanced coalbed methane recovery with injected CO Recent studies in enhancing gas/oil recovery by injection of CO Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a fast, convenient and non-destructive detection method to investigate hydrogen-bearing fluid-phases (e.g., water and methane) in porous media. This method has been commonly used in the petrophysical characterization of reservoir rocks ( A sample of black shale core was collected from the Lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation (southeastern Sichuan basin) at a depth of 1072 The pores in the shale sample are mainly the organic pores, interpartical pores, and some microfractures ( The principal experimental setup consists of an NMR measurement apparatus, a core holder, a high-pressure gas supply system, a one-way release valve and an exhaust device ( The low-field NMR measurement method uses the The number of hydrogen atoms present in the CH The total signal amplitude from a typical In this study, the magnetic uniformity is as low as 30 Prior to the NMR measurements, the collected shale sample was crushed and sieved into fine fragments with a diameter of ~ The purpose of Processes A1 and A2 ( Except for the oven-drying of samples, all other experimental operations were conducted under a constant temperature of 35 For non-adsorbed methane (i.e., bulk methane), the specific density (or molarity) can be obtained by performing a series of NMR measurements on non-adsorbed methane at different pressures (see The quantification of the adsorbed gas content based on NMR measurements is extremely important for this study. Some researchers ever provided some methods to quantify the adsorbed methane in coals. A typical gas adsorption experiment is actually a core flooding process. After initial flooding, the free gas (non-adsorbed) is converted to an adsorbed phase. Using the NMR measurements of Process A2 as an example, the  Eq. Eq. As shown in Process A1 ( In this study, we defined the ‘desorption efficiency’ and ‘percent recovery per hour (PRPH)’ to quantify the methane desorption processes. The desorption efficiency is the percentage of the total desorbed mass amount relative to the original adsorbed mass that is present at the moment of CO For Process A2, after CO In the decompression processes B1 and B2, the P1 amplitude exhibits a weak decrease while the amplitudes of both P2 and P3 decrease substantially ( In Process B1, the complete desorption of the adsorbed CH In Process B2, an adequate CO In this study, the non-adsorbed/free-gas CH  As discussed previously, the total pressure in the sample cell was 0.1 According to the investigations of the shale gas plays such as the Barnett, Fayetteville, Haynesville Marcellus, and Woodford in USA, the unrecoverable gas of these shale reservoirs is commonly > This study provides a preliminary experimental evaluation of the recovery of adsorbed CH We evaluate the exchange of adsorbed and non-adsorbed/free-phase CH Comparing the situations both with and without injected CO Based on two experiments with CO This study has verified the quantitative capability of NMR-based measurements and methodology to analyze the recovery efficiency of adsorbed CH We acknowledge financial support from the
