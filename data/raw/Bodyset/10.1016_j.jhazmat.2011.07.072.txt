The research work presented in this paper is focused on the development of a purification process of red mud sulphate leach liquor for the recovery of titanium oxide (TiO2) nano-powders in the form of anatase. Initially, titanium was extracted over iron and aluminium from the leach liquor by solvent extraction using Cyanex 272 in toluene, at pH: 0.3 and T: 25°C, with 40% extractant concentration. Stripping of the loaded, with titanium, organic phase was carried out by diluted HCl (3mol/L) at ambient temperature. Finally, the recovery of titanium nano-powder, in the form of anatase, was performed by chemical precipitation at pH: 6 and T: 95°C, using 10wt% MgO pulp as neutralizing agent. The produced precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA). Their morphological characteristics and microstructure were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). High grade titanium white precipitate, in the form of anatase, was obtained. Iron concentration in the precipitate did not exceed 0.3%, whereas no aluminium was detected.At all the world's 85 alumina plants, 1.0–1.6 tons of red mud is generated per ton of alumina and it is estimated that over 66 million tons of this waste are produced annually in the world. The disposal of such a large quantity of this alkaline waste sludge is expensive (up to 1–2% of the alumina price), as it requires a large disposal area (approximately 1 The Laboratory of Metallurgy of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, has performed a laboratory-scale research on the recovery of titanium from red mud by a leaching process with diluted sulphuric acid, under atmospheric conditions and without using any preliminary treatment. The titanium recovery efficiency, on the basis of red mud weight, reached 64.5% at the following optimum conditions: acid concentration Titanium dioxide is a widely known material that is mostly used as pigment in paints, plastics, rubber, and paper industries. Besides, titania has been studied extensively because of its wide applications mainly in catalyst supports, fillers, coatings, photoconductors and dielectric materials. In recent years, nanocrystalline TiO Two types of manufactured TiO The dominant species in sulphuric acid is TiOSO The solvent extraction behaviour of tetravalent titanium from sulphate solutions with organophosphorus acid derivatives such as di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (EHEHPA) has been studied by several investigators Islam and Biswas reported equilibrium data for the extraction of Ti(IV) from sulphate solution by D2EHPA and examined the effects of the solution pH and the concentration of the extractant on the distribution ratio Jayachandran and Dhadke investigated the liquid–liquid extraction of Ti from sulphate solution using 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester in toluene (commercially known as PC88A or Ionquest 801 or P507) However, the so far published literature has given little attention to the titanium extraction from sulphate solutions by dialkylphosphinic acids. The starting point for the “Cyanex” range of extractants is phosphine (PH The method most frequently employed for the production of titanium oxide is the precipitation from chloride or sulphate solutions of titanium, by the addition of aqueous solution of ammonia or sodium hydroxide. TiO Li and Demopoulos examined the precipitation of Ti by aqueous titanium(IV) chloride solutions at different terminal pH (2.5–6.0) with magnesium oxide as base at 95 The present research work proposes a process for the titanium recovery from red mud sulphate leach liquor and the preparation of titanium oxide TiO The leach liquor, which was used during experimentation, had been produced by red mud agitation leaching with dilute sulphuric acid (3 The extractant Cyanex 272, registered by Cyanamid Canada, was kindly supplied by the Holland branch of the company, Cytec Holland. The reactive component C All batch experiments were conducted in a 500-ml five-necked, round bottomed split reactor, which was fitted with a glass stirrer, a vapour condenser, a thermometer and a pH electrode. The two phases (organic and aqueous) were contacted for 60 Titanium recovery from a loaded organic phase was investigated using different strength of stripping agents, such as solutions of sulphuric acid (with or without hydrogen peroxide) and hydrochloric acid. Furthermore, the alternative of titanium recovery by precipitation of TiO The precipitation tests were performed in a 500 The produced TiO TGA/DTA analysis was conducted at hydrous TiO In order to determine the ability of Cyanex 272 to selectively extract titanium from the red mud sulphate leach liquor, extraction tests (based on preliminary experiments) were carried out at various equilibrium pH values, at specific conditions (contact time: 60 As Cyanex 272 proved to be an efficient extractant for the titanium extraction from sulphate leach liquor, a Mc-Cabe Thiele diagram was constructed and the number of counter-current stages required was predicted. On the basis of conclusions drawn from preliminary experiments, the titanium extraction isotherm was determined at the following conditions: Cyanex 272 concentration Preliminary stripping tests of titanium from the loaded organic phases was conducted using various stripping agents, as it is shown in Besides stripping with HCl, the stripping with Na On the basis of conclusions drawn from preliminary experiments, the conditions for the stripping of titanium from the loaded Cyanex 272 were fixed at: Aqueous phase: 3 Temperature: 25 Stirring speed: 800 Cyanex 272 organic phase: [Ti Reaction time: 30 The Mc-Cabe Thiele interpretation for titanium stripping from the loaded organic phase indicated two stages requirement ( Runs were conducted to draw the precipitation curve of titanium as a function of pH, by the addition of MgO pulp (10 The hydrolytic precipitation reactions of metallic ions attain equilibrium very slowly. This is also valid for titanium(IV) and at least 2 The X-ray diffraction data of the precipitates obtained under the experimental conditions mentioned above, after drying at 110 Scanning electron microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive analysis (EDS) was performed to gain further knowledge of the mineralogical species contained in the mixed precipitate and their morphology. The anatase appeared with the form of aggregates of spherical nano-particles ( In acidic medium, the chloride solutions are stable because of the negative surface charge, which stabilizes particles towards agglomeration. By increasing the pH, this surface charge gradually disappears and the particles can form aggregates The FT-IR spectra of the produced TiO The results of the differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) of the powder precipitated by neutralization at final pH Based on the data presented in this paper, a purification process of red mud sulphate leach liquor for the recovery of TiO Titanium can be extracted over iron and aluminium by bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid. Cyanex 272, diluted in toluene, could extract titanium Ti at pH The loaded with titanium Cyanex 272can be stripped with diluted hydrochloric acid (3 High grade titanium oxide white precipitate, was recovered from the strip liquor by hydrolytic precipitation at pH
