Libyan Desert Glass is a silica-rich natural glass, found strewn over an area of

                  Since its discovery, allocation and mapping as early as 1932, the origin of the high silica Libyan Desert Glass still represents an unanswered enigma to all scientists and researchers. Different hypotheses have been proposed by many workers over the last seventy five years as to its origin and way of formation. It seems that modern, rather sophisticated science and technology means, including satellite imaging and supercomputer simulation have eventually been utilized to provide enough materialized support for the long suspected high temperature fusion process as being the responsible mechanism for the glass formation. Some of the recently obtained data on the subject is being elaborated herein.
