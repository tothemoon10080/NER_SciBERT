An analytical study of the forced convection of an elastoviscoplastic fluid in tubes of arbitrary cross section is presented. The constitutive structure of the fluid is described by a frame indifferent linear combination of the Modified Phan-Thien-Tanner model of non-linear viscoelastic fluids and the Bingham model of non-linear plastic fluids. Arbitrary tube cross sections are modeled by a continuous one-to-one mapping of the circular base contour into a wide spectrum family of non-circular tube contours. Field variables are expanded into double asymptotic series in terms of the elasticity measure Weissenberg number

The general algorithm developed is applied to the study of forced convection in tubes with exact equilateral triangular and approximately square cross sections. The analysis also yields the solution of the forced convection of linear (Newtonian) fluids in non-circular tubes and the forced convection in circular tubes of the family of non-linear fluids (viscoplastic, viscoelastic, elastoviscoplastic) described by the constitutive structure under consideration thereby providing as well validation for the computations carried out for non-linear fluids in non-circular cross-sections. A thorough comparison of the velocity and thermal fields of the Newtonian, viscoplastic, viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic fluids in tubes of equilateral triangular and pseudo square cross-sectional tubes is presented as specific cases.material parameter material parameter second invariant of the rate of deformation tensor velocity vector extra-stress tensor total stress tensor yield stress deformation gradient tensor material derivative gradient operator Laplacian biharmonic operator transpose operator trace operator time cylindrical coordinates radial, azimuthal and axial velocity components unit vectors in the cylindrical coordinate directions mapping parameters density specific heat thermal conductivity heat flux vector Newtonian viscosity viscosity of the Newtonian solvent molecular contributed viscosity relaxation time pressure gravitational acceleration heat transfer coefficient characteristic length temperature field average temperature wall temperature temperature difference stream function Reynolds number Nusselt number PÃ©clet number Weissenberg number Bingham number Forced convection of non-linear fluids in pipes of non-circular cross-section is commonly encountered in many industries. Some examples are pastes in food processing industry, concrete and mud in construction and mining industries, cosmetics and emulsions, extrusion processes in particular in food and polymer processing. To the best knowledge of the authors there are no studies in the published literature on the forced convection of elastoviscoplastic fluids. Yield stress of viscoplastic fluids is likely to induce plug and stagnant zones in the non-circular cross-section requiring larger pressure gradients to drive the flow, The last decades saw a sustained effort to search for an adequate elastoviscoplastic constitutive equation to describe the behavior of complex fluids under stress. For example It is well known that secondary flows trigger heat transfer enhancement in all non-circular cross-sectional tubes. The discovery of heat transfer enhancement with viscoelastic fluids in tubes with non-circular cross-section is due to The present paper addresses the forced convection in tube flow of elastoviscoplastic fluids characterized by a frame indifferent constitutive structure a linear combination of the viscoelastic non-linear Modified Phan-Thien-Tanner (MPTT) model and the non-linear viscoplastic Bingham model. Arbitrary tube cross-sections are defined through a continuous, one-to-one mapping. The circular base contour is mapped onto families of shapes characterized by two mapping parameters, It is not uncommon nowadays for researchers in many fields across the scientific research spectrum to claim that exact as well as approximate analytical approaches have now been superseded by direct numerical simulations. Indeed these claims will undoubtedly become more frequent with the ever increasing ability of computational methods and computers to tackle large systems of equations and complex geometries. However, it is of paramount importance to be cognizant of the fact that computational studies should be guided by a theoretical framework in order to gain more comprehensive insight. That is computational studies do not set the way forward theoretical framework does. The contribution of exact solutions and asymptotics is to provide this theoretical framework for understanding, interpreting, developing and solving mathematical models. For instance the singular perturbation theory is an excellent tool to explore and reveal regions of qualitatively different behaviour in the flow field not to mention the additional benefit of asymptotics in providing explicit parameter dependencies and simplified governing equations, The paper is arranged as follows. The theoretical framework for the asymptotic solution is presented in The continuous and one-to-one mapping to map the base circular contour into a spectrum of axially symmetric closed contours with The existence of a limiting value The continuous, one-to-one mapping  For regularity at Linear momentum conservation in dimensional form for steady flow reads as:   The dimensional energy equation for an incompressible fluid has the form:  Under steady state conditions the dimensional equation assumes in cylindrical coordinates the following form: And the dimensionless equation reads as:   The components of the stress tensor of a Bingham fluid in parallel tube flow can be written as:   Modified Phan-Thien-Tanner (MPTT) constitutive structure reads,  Defining The function In this work we use the linearized form. To non-dimensionalize the constitutive equation we introduce the following scale factors, For the description of the flow behavior of an elastoviscoplastic fluid a frame indifferent combination of the two previous models obtained by substituting The non-dimensional scalar linear momentum balance equations in the radial, azimuthal and axial directions in cylindrical coordinates read as: A generic field variable Setting The transversal field is given shape by the streamfunction The non-homogeneous biharmonic equation which defines the streamfunction derived from the linear momentum balance reads as: If the working fluid is Newtonian the governing Eq. At this order the linear momentum conservation reads as: The first superscript indicates the order in the Weissenberg number The governing linear momentum conservation equation at this order written in terms of the components of the shear stress tensor  Consequently:  As  Thus yielding for the non-zero stress components: Substituting the stress components in The solution is of the following form: Substituting The solution for The full expression of The constant And the complete velocity profile at this order in the non-circular tube characterized by the mapping parameters For the case of the triangular cross-section ( This is the velocity profile up to and including order The non-dimensional thermal energy equation at this order reads as:  The equation governing the thermal field at this order reads as: The solution of which is: Eq.

That subject will be discussed in the next Newtonian fluids do not display a secondary flow structure regardless of the contour of the cross section and the flow is unidirectional as long as flow stays laminar. Thus there is no transversal component of the velocity to push the particles in a helical path in the axial direction as it is the case for the purely viscoelastic fluids. Purely viscoplastic fluids follow suit. This is because the constitutive structures of both the linear (Newtonian) and purely viscoplastic non-linear fluids do not generate unbalanced normal stress components in the non-circular cross-section to drive the particles in the cross-section. In short they do not have normal stress differences first and second normal stress differences alike. The existence of the second normal stress differences are an essential requirement for the secondary field to exist although even if they exist the fulfilment of additional conditions may produce a null secondary field,  Besides the magnitude of the strength of the vortices in the cross-section an important feature of the The plots of the axial velocity as well as of the temperature field up to and including order The transversal velocity field plots for the viscoelastic Nusselt number is defined as the ratio of heat transfer by convection to heat transfer by conduction  The bottommost curve in  The overall analysis of The value of At this point a remark concerning the power of the analytical approach developed in this paper is in order. The one-to-one mapping (1) introduced to represent the contour of the tube imparts to the asymptotics the flexibility of computing the heat transfer rates for intermediate contour shapes such as that of the approximately square contour represented in The pressure gradient driven tube flow of a class of elastoviscoplastic fluids in tubes of non-circular contours has been investigated in this paper via an asymptotical solution methodology involving double expansion of the field variables into asymptotic series in terms of the elasticity measure Weissenberg number The class of viscoplastic fluids and the family of viscoelastic fluids together with Newtonian fluids form subclasses of the general family of elastoviscoplastic materials. The analytical method presented yields the solution for the velocity field and the forced convection of non-linear fluids (viscoelastic, viscoplastic and elastoviscoplastic) Two cross-sections equilateral triangular and an approximately square cross-section with rounded corners are investigated as specific examples. The velocity and temperature fields are computed for the case of constant heat flux at the wall for Newtonian, and the non-linear classes of viscoplastic, viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic fluids. Heat transfer rates with constant heat flux on the boundary represented by the Nusselt number are calculated for these fluids. The method and the results are validated by reproducing existing Nusselt numbers in the literature for Newtonian fluids. In round tubes the rate of increase of the Nusselt number Viscoelasticity slows down and viscoplasticity increases the heat transfer rates.
