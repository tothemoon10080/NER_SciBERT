Gas dispersion parameters (air holdup-ɛg, superficial air velocity-Jg and bubble surface area flux-Sb) and especially the concentration of formed nanobubbles in a hydrodynamic cavitation tube were measured. Best results were obtained at 30% air/liquid volume ratio; 49 mN m−1 air/liquid interfacial tension resulting in an air holdup of 16%, a Jg of 0.87 cm s−1, a Sb of 85 s−1 and a nanobubbles (230–280 nm) concentration of 6.4 × 108 NBs mL−1. The lower the air/liquid interfacial tension, the higher the air holdup; this proceed by assisting cavitation and formation of micro and nano-sized bubbles. Data obtained are discussed in terms of solution, hydrodynamics and interfacial phenomena. Main mechanisms involving the role of the nanobubbles and their interactions with solids and bigger bubbles were envisaged. It is believed that these findings are important because of the need for techniques and devices producing nanobubbles at low cost and high rate. This work shows that the cavitation tube studied has a high potential, due to the wide size of bubbles formed, high bubble surface flux obtained and especially the generation of a high concentration of nanobubbles. These bubbles are very important in modern flotation of mineral fines and in pollutant separation in wastewater treatment and some examples are shown and discussed.Flotation with fine bubbles is today an efficient process in the recovery of mineral fines (<13 µm diameter) and in water/wastewater treatment ( Nanobubbles are gas cavities with diameters less than 1 µm, generated jointly with bigger bubbles following hydrodynamic cavitation phenomena ( The CavTube® is an Eriez’s patented sparger employed for slurry aeration and mineral flotation processes that generate fine bubbles ( Deionized (DI) water having an air/liquid interfacial tension (γ) of 72.5 ± 0.2 mN m The experimental rig ( Bubbles were measured employing nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA-Zeta View®, Particle Metrix, Germany) as described in The air holdup (εg) was calculated by measuring the differential pressure (ΔP) between two points of the column, using hydrostatic pressure sensors (Pressure Transmitter SP98, Sitron®). The superficial air velocity (Jg) was considered to be the ratio of air volume passing through the column cross section and the and bubble surface area flux (Sb) is related to ɛg and was estimated according to Experiments were performed with 40 L of solution, a liquid flow of 1.6 m The concentrations of nanobubbles ranged between 4.2 and 6.4 × 10 Best results were obtained with 100 mg.L The properties of bubbles (gas) dispersion or hydrodynamic conditions clearly play an important role in froth flotation and applied flotation to effluent treatment ( Herein, the bulk nanobubbles, in the absence of solids, remain dispersed (and stable for weeks) and as such do not contribute to any of gas dispersion parameters including the Sb, the bubble surface area flux. Thus, there is no bubbling flux with nanobubbles, because they do not have rising movement ( In fact, a method of separation of the nanobubbles by leaving the bigger bubbles to abandon the system after their rising, has been reported. Thus, the dispersed nanobubbles may be counted ( Accordingly, we simply used the measured gas holdup (εg) values to calculate the Sb values using Finch’s approach, which suggests that bubble surface area flux and gas holdup, are related by Sb ∼ 5.5 × εg. This calculation is due to the rising (bigger) bubbles, but nanobubbles, and the values obtained are fairly close to those reported in the literature. Recent studies reported that these nano-sized bubbles highly improve the mineral flotation efficiency, rate and enrichment ratio ( Further, the nanobubbles assist the removal of pollutants (colloids, nanoparticles, organic/inorganic precipitates or emulsified oil) from water ( This work shows the results of bubble (air) dispersion parameters and highlights the potential for nanobubbles generation, in a fully controlled hydrodynamic cavitation tube (CavTube®). This device produced bubbles in a bimodal distribution, with a wide size range at the nano and micro scales, providing air holdup values as high as 16%, a Sb of 85 s The authors thank the Brazilian Institutes, namely,
