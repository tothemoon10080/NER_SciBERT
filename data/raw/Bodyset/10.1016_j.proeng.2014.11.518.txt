This paper presents a new methodology for optimal staged development of water supply systems that ensures robust and sustainable solutions. This problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem under uncertainty with objectives being the minimisation of average present value of intervention costs and greenhouse gas emissions, and the maximisation of supply robustness. The above methodology was validated and demonstrated on southern portion of the regional water supply system of Adelaide. The results obtained illustrate the importance of identifying optimal staged solutions to ensure robustness and sustainability of water supply into uncertain long-term future.
