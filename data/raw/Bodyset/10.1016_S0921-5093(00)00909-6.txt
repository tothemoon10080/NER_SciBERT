The hardness variations with the volume fraction of the hard particle in the particle reinforced composite have been analysed using several models for a rule of mixtures and finite element method. The stress states are found to be nearly iso-strain at high volume fraction of the hard particle and iso-stress at low volume fraction of the particle.The concept of mixtures or composites with homogeneously distributed particles in the matrix can be applied to not only conventional composites and nanocomposites, such as SiC reinforced nanocrystalline Al alloys Predicting the overall mechanical properties of the composite is very important for material design and applications. There have been many attempts to correlate the overall mechanical properties of the composite and the properties of its constitutes: for example, the self-consistent variation methods For the ROM, Voigt model The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effective hardness of the particle distributed composite by means of the ROM and to explain the experimental phenomenon that little variation of hardness of the particle reinforced composites.  In order to assess the validity of the above ROMs, the calculated effective hardness values using The elasto-plastic finite element analysis (FEA) for the conventional unit cell model of the uniaxial compression of the composites with homogeneously distributed second particles has been carried out for the current purpose. The details of the finite element calculation can be found elsewhere   It can be found from  In order to investigate the effect of the relative hardness values between the matrix and the particle on the effective hardness of the composite, a parametric study was accomplished based on the iso-stress condition ( In conclusion, the hardness variations with the volume fraction of the hard particle in the particle reinforced composite have been analysed using several models for a rule of mixtures and the calculated results are compared with those of the finite element analysis. Comparison between the results from ROMs and FEA shows the stress states are nearly iso-strain at high volume fraction of the hard particle and iso-stress at low volume fraction of the particle. A model which demonstrates the iso-stress condition is dominant during the indenting process is proposed. An explanation for the experimental results and interpretation that the hardness of the particle reinforced composite is similar to that of the soft matrix, especially at high volume fraction of the particle, is presented using the iso-stress model.
