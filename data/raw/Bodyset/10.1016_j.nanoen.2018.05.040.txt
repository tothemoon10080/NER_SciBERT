Strain engineering is one of the most promising and effective routes towards continuously tuning thermal transport due to the flexibility and robustness. However, previous studies mainly focused on quantifying how the thermal conductivity (
                        κ
                     ) is modulated by strain, while the fundamental understanding on the electronic origin has yet to be explored. In this paper, we establish a microscopic picture of the lone-pair electrons driving strong phonon anharmonicity in two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond the traditional three-dimensional (3D) systems. We provide solid explanation for the unexpectedly up to one order of magnitude enlarged 
                        κ
                      of a class of planar monolayers with bilateral tensile strain applied, which is in sharp contrast to the strain induced 
                        κ
                      reduction in graphene despite their similar planar structures. The anomalous positive response of 
                        κ
                      to tensile strain is attributed to the attenuated interaction between the lone-pair electrons and the bonding electrons of neighboring atoms, which reduces phonon anharmonicity and leads to the enlarged

                     . Our study uncovers the electronic origin of the strain modulated thermal transport, which would have great impact on future investigations related to energy nanotechnologies and applications.Effective manipulation of heat conduction plays a key role in high-performance thermal management for future nano energy technologies. Phonons play the dominant role in thermal transport in semiconductors Two-dimensional (2D) materials with graphene as a representative have been intensively studied for many years for their promising applications in lots of fields In this paper, we performed a comparative study of thermal transport in 2D group III-nitrides ( The effect of bilateral tensile strain on the We start with comparison of the intrinsic thermal transport properties between these planar monolayer group III-nitrides (taking Since for the first glance the main difference between However, only the mass difference cannot induce so large opening of the phonon Dirac cone. By artificially introducing the mass difference of To this end, we conduct detailed study based on the deep analysis of orbital projected electronic structure. We will show that the strong phonon anharmonicity in We further establish a microscopic picture of direct connection between phonon anharmonicity and the lone-pair electrons, by showing how the nonlinear restoring forces arise from the asymmetric change of the electronic structure induced by the atoms' motion. As analyzed above, the N- Note that there exists difference in the electronegativity between B and N atoms, which leads to polarization for the B-N bonds as revealed by the ELF [ Finally, we would like to bring back the attention to the anomalous strain enlarged In summary, we have performed a comparative study of thermal transport in graphene and monolayer group III-nitrides combining with other similar representative 2D compounds. All these 2D materials share similar planar honeycomb structure.
