This paper reports on the development of a polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) for the selective separation of Sc(III) from other REM ions. A comparison is made of the performance of cellulose triacetate (CTA) based PIMs containing 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA), 2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC-88A), N-[N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl) aminocarbonylmethyl]glycine (D2EHAG) or N-[N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)aminocarbonylmethyl]phenylalanine (D2EHAF) as the carrier in the extraction of Sc(III) from its sulfuric acid/ammonium sulfate buffer solutions. The potential of the PIM containing D2EHAF for the selective separation of Sc(III) from a feed solution containing similar concentrations of Y(III), La(III), Nd(III), and Dy(III) into a 0.5 mol L−1 sulfuric acid receiving solution has been demonstrated. In addition, the newly developed PIM containing D2EHAF exhibited excellent stability in 5 cycles of extraction and back-extraction of Sc(III) with insignificant deterioration in its performance. The results obtained in this study indicate that the molecular structure of the carrier has a strong influence on membrane stability, and that the introduction of a phenyl group into the carrier molecule results in a significant stability improvement.Rare earth metals (REMs) are one of a set of 17 chemical elements, and include 15 lanthanides, as well as scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y). REMs have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic and magnetic properties, and the demand for REMs has been increasing in cutting-edge industries Polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) have attracted attention in recent years in the separation of metal ions and small organic compounds from their aqueous solutions In spite of the superior stability of PIMs compared to that of SLMs, the permeability of PIMs generally decreases after several successive transport cycles. The reason for this undesirable effect is considered to be the dissolution of the carrier and plasticizer or modifier (if present) into the feed and receiving aqueous solutions because of their finite water solubility In our previous study we synthesized the novel extractant D2EHAG and D2EHAF were synthesized according to the procedure described previously The values of the acidity constants (p PIMs consisting of CTA as the base polymer, 2NPOE or DOP as the plasticizer, and D2EHAG, D2EHAF, HTTA, PC-88A, or Versatic 10 as the carrier were prepared in accordance with a previous study The membrane extraction experiments were performed by immersing a circular segment of a PIM (0.10 ± 0.01 g), which was cut into small pieces, into a flask containing 50 mL of 0.1 mmol L The kinetics of the PIM extraction was described by Eq. For the back-extraction of the metal ions from a loaded PIM, the PIM was dried and immersed into a flask filled with 50 mL of a receiving solution (0.5 mol L The degree of back-extraction Membrane transport experiments were carried out using a transport system consisting of two jacketed glass compartments. A PIM segment was sandwiched between the flange surfaces of the two compartments of the transport cell (PERMCELL KH-55P, Vidrex) with clips, so that it separated the feed and the receiving solutions (50 mL each) located in the corresponding compartments of the transport cell. The diameter of the circular membrane surface area exposed to the solutions was 25.0 mm, corresponding to an effective surface area of 4.9 × 10 As in the extraction experiments, it was assumed that the transport kinetics was first-order (Eq. The effective diffusion coefficient The p The suitability of a CTA-based PIM containing each of the four carriers studied for the extraction of Sc(III) was investigated in an extraction experiment. Each extraction experiment was carried out using a PIM containing 40 wt% HTTA, D2EHAG or D2EHAF or 30 wt% PC-88A (detailed compositions are listed in The normalized transient concentrations of Sc(III) in the feed solution during the membrane extraction experiments at pH 3 for each PIM are presented in In previous solvent extraction studies using the carriers HTTA The back-extraction of Sc(III) from loaded PIMs was conducted in a 0.5 mol L One of the key factors determining the compatibility of PIMs in analytical, environmental and industrial separation is the membrane stability and hence its reusability  The mass change of the PIMs studied after each extraction and back-extraction step is shown in Contact angle measurements were made for a membrane composed of CTA only (i.e., blank membrane), a CTA+2NPOE membrane and PIMs containing D2EHAG or D2EHAF in order to investigate the hydrophilicity of the membrane surfaces ( PIM transport experiments were conducted to examine the possibility of using the PIMs containing D2EHAG or D2EHAF for the separation of Sc(III) from the other REM ions studied (i.e., Y(III), La(III), Nd(III), and Dy(III)). Based on the plot of ln( The effective PIM diffusion coefficients ( The effect of the membrane thickness on the transport rate was studied by using PIMs of the same chemical composition (40 wt% D2EHAF, 30 wt% CTA and 30 wt% 2NPOE) but with thicknesses ranging from 23 ± 5–54 ± 4 µm. The membrane thickness was varied by using different masses of the casting solution. Kinetic plots of the transport of Sc(III) through PIMs of various membrane thicknesses (ln( On the basis of the results obtained in this study it can be concluded that the newly developed PIMs containing the amic acid extractants D2EHAG or D2EHAF as carriers exhibited significantly better extraction and back-extraction efficiency in comparison with PIMs containing the commercial extractants HTTA or PC-88A. The D2EHAF-based PIM allowed quantitative and selective transport of Sc(III) from a feed solution of pH 3 and containing Y(III), La(III), Nd(III), and Dy(III) ions to a receiving solution containing 0.5 mol L The results outlined above demonstrate that the PIM containing D2EHAF offers considerable promise for the selective separation and preconcentration of Sc(III) from solutions containing other REM ions in applications such as hydrometallurgical processing of Sc(III) solutions of waste materials. It can be expected that the results obtained in this study will also be helpful in designing PIMs with improved stability which will be suitable for industrial and analytical separation applications.
