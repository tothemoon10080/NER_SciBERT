Electrochemical noise (EN) and fuzzy sets were used to predict the corrosion behavior of titanium alloys. Ti-15Mo was analyzed to understand the trend of titanium alloyed with another material. This study employs an adaptive fuzzy set to approach and predict behavior of titanium alloys. A fuzzy set prediction model has been employed to establish the relationship between electrochemical noise signals and properties of Tiâ€“15Mo alloy. The predicted results obtained with fuzzy sets showed a better agreement with the experimental results, having a less maximum relative error.
