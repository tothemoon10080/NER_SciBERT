The effects of the supporting electrolytes (SEs) Na2SO4, NaCl, Na2CO3, NaNO3, and Na3PO4 on the anodic oxidation of norfloxacin (NOR) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), assessed by the respective degradation kinetics and byproducts and electrolyzed solution antimicrobial activity, are compared. Galvanostatic anodic oxidations were performed in a filter-press flow cell fitted with a boron-doped diamond anode. Removal rates higher than the theoretical one for a process purely controlled by mass transfer were found for all SEs, indicative of contribution by indirect oxidation processes. However, the removal rates for NaCl were about tenfold higher, with the lowest energy consumption per order (EC
                     O) of targeted pollutant removal rate (ca. 0.7 kW h m–3 order–1), a very competitive performance. The TOC removal rates were also affected by the SE, but not as markedly. The antimicrobial activity of the electrolyzed solutions against Escherichia coli showed distinct temporal profiles, depending on the fluoroquinolone and SE. For instance, when Na3PO4 was used, the antimicrobial activity was completely removed for NOR, but none for CIPRO; conversely, when NaCl was used, complete removal was attained only for CIPRO. From LC-MS/MS analyses of Na3PO4 electrolyzed solutions, rupture of the fluoroquinolone ring leading to byproducts with no toxicity against E. coli occurred only for NOR, whereas exactly the opposite occurred for the NaCl solutions. Clearly, the nature of both the SE and the fluoroquinolone influence the oxidation steps of the respective molecule; this was also evidenced by the distinct short-chain carboxylic acids identified in the degradation of NOR and CIPRO.Fluoroquinolones (FQs), one of the most important classes of antibacterial agents [ New advanced oxidation processes based on electrochemical technology, the so-called electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) [ Despite the fact that most of the published studies on the anodic oxidation of organics employed Na Although a large number of studies reported on the effect of operational parameters on the removal rates of organics using EAOPs, further investigations regarding the influence of distinct supporting electrolytes on the toxicity of the electrolyzed solutions are still needed. Hence, the goal of the present work is to compare the effect of distinct supporting electrolytes – SEs (Na All chemicals, including norfloxacin (99.9% Vita Nova), ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Vita Nova), Na The BDD electrode, purchased from NeoCoat (Switzerland), was a BDD film (thickness of 2.9 μm, boron doping of 100 ppm, and sp The electrochemical degradation experiments were carried out in a one-compartment filter-press flow cell, with a BDD anode and a plate of AISI 304 stainless steel as cathode (the exposed area of each electrode was 3.54 cm × 6.71 cm). More details on the setup of the assembled recirculating electrochemical system and flow cell are found elsewhere - see the supplementary material of [ The evolution of [NOR] and [CIPRO] was monitored by LC with an UV/Vis absorbance detector (at 280 nm) as described in detail elsewhere [ The evolution of each electrolyzed solution TOC was monitored using a GE Analytical Instruments Sievers Innovox TOC analyzer, as described in detail elsewhere [ The energy consumption per unit mass of removed TOC ( The initial oxidation intermediates formed during the fluoroquinolones AO were determined by LC-MS/MS. The analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system coupled to a SCIEX 3200 QTRAP LC-MS/MS system, operating in a positive mode and TurboIonSpray ionization. The special software LightSight 2.3 (Nominal Mass Metabolite ID Software, AB SCIEX) was used to investigate all possibilities of metabolites. The application of the software was performed for all ionization and fragmentation parameters optimized for the initial compound. The parameters were obtained using direct infusion of a solution containing NOR or CIPRO (1 mg L Terminal oxidation intermediates (short-chain carboxylic acids) were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to UV/Vis detection at 210 nm (LC-UV/Vis) using a Phenomenex Rezek ROA-H Finally, the antimicrobial activity of the NOR and CIPRO electrolyzed solutions against The decays of the relative concentration of NOR and CIPRO as a function of electrolysis time using the distinct SEs at the ionic strength of 0.1 mol L For all the investigated SE solutions, a linear regression was obtained for the ln( The applied charge per unit volume of electrolyzed solution ( The contribution of indirect, mediated oxidation processes for the increased removal rates of the FQs can be assessed by comparing the respective experimental data with the theoretical ones for a process purely controlled by mass transfer. In this context, the theoretical exponential concentration decay lines presented in Since electric energy significantly contributes to the operating costs of an EAOP, the energy consumption per order of targeted pollutant removed ( As can be inferred from the data in The contribution of indirect oxidation processes for the TOC removal was also assessed by comparing the experimental data with the theoretical ones based on a process purely controlled by mass transfer (see As can be seen in the insets of A comparison of the attained MCE values for NOR mineralization from the Na The organic load that remains as the electrolysis progresses (reflected as TOC) can be due to the presence of recalcitrant degradation intermediates, some of which may retain the antibiotic activity of the original FQ molecules. Thus, the toxicity of the electrolyzed solutions should be investigated to assess whether the electrochemical degradation process yields nontoxic (or less toxic) solutions. Consequently, the inhibition growth index ( In the present work, the persistence of the antimicrobial activity in some conditions might be related to two factors. First, traces of the original FQ may have remained in the electrolyzed solution at a concentration that could not be detected by LC–UV/Vis but was higher than the so-called minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC [ The initial intermediates were assessed by LC-MS/MS analyses only for electrolyzed solutions of the FQs in which Na During the degradation of NOR using NaCl as the SE, initial oxidation and hydroxylation reactions were also observed in the ethyl and piperazinyl groups of the molecule as well as in the fluoroquinolone ring, resulting in the rupture of these last two structures (see The proposed fragmentation routes for all the initial intermediates detected during the electrochemical degradation of NOR and CIPRO using Na Regarding their specific molecular structures, NOR has an ethyl group bonded to the nitrogen of the fluoroquinolone moiety, whereas CIPRO has a cyclopropyl group in that same position. Considering that only the piperazine ring is oxidized during the degradation of CIPRO using Na Summarizing the results of the LC/MS-MS analyses, all the detected initial degradation intermediates resulted from three main electrooxidation pathways in the FQ molecules, without defluorination: The terminal intermediates (short-chain carboxylic acids) were investigated by LC-UV/Vis for electrolyzed solutions of the FQs in the different SEs, as described in section As can be seen in The significant number of short-chain carboxylic acids detected, resulting from consecutive oxidation steps of the FQs, may be due to the low applied value of the current density, which is close to the limiting one [ Total removal of NOR and CIPRO was attained in the electrooxidation of these drugs using a flow cell with a BDD anode and distinct supporting electrolyte solutions (NaCl, Na The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
