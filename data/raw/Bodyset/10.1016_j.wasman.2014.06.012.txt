Batch tests and diffusion tests were performed to analyze the efficiency of a protective barrier in a landfill consisting of compacted soil with 10% bentonite compared to the results obtained for only compacted soil and for compacted soil covered with a 1-mm-thick HDPE geomembrane; the soil and leachate were collected from the Rio das Ostras Landfill in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The diffusion tests were performed for periods of 3, 10 and 60days. After the test period, the soil pore water was analyzed and the profiles for chloride, potassium and ammonium were determined along a 6-cm soil depth. The results of the batch tests performed to define sorption parameters were used to adjust the profiles obtained in the diffusion cell experiment by applying an ion transfer model between the interstitial solution and the soil particles. The MPHMTP model (Multi Phase Heat and Mass Transfer Program), which is based upon the solution of the transport equations of the ionic contaminants, was used to solve the inverse problem of simultaneously determining the effective diffusion coefficients. The results of the experimental tests and of the model simulation confirmed that the compacted soil with 10% bentonite was moderately efficient in the retention of chloride, potassium and ammonium ions compared to the configurations of compacted soil with a geomembrane and compacted soil alone, representing a solution that is technically feasible and requires potentially lower costs for implementation in landfills.Landfills have been increasingly used in developing countries for the disposal of urban solid wastes. Liners at the base of landfills serve as a protective barrier and can be constructed of low-permeability clay soils (CCL) either alone or in composite liners with geomembranes (GM) and geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). Natural materials are typically used to form a protective base with compacted soil. The addition of bentonite to these materials improves the performance of the protective layer, reducing the hydraulic conductivity and increasing the cation exchange capacity of the soil. Ideally, these materials should meet the specifications of permeability and minimum thickness that are required to form a barrier to the migration of contaminants contained in the leachate ( There is substantial concern about the presence of heavy metals in leachate; however, a number of inorganic ions are present at significant concentrations in the leachate of MSW landfills, including chloride, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron and ammonium ( The effective diffusion coefficients for chloride in different clay soils range from 1.5 Seeking to analyze a technically feasible alternative for the construction of protective barriers in landfills, the objective of the present study was to investigate and compare the migration of some inorganic ions present in landfill leachate through laboratory testing. Local soil and leachate were used from the Rio das Ostras landfill (ROL), located in the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). The aim was to define sorption parameters for ammonium and potassium and diffusion coefficients for chloride, ammonium and potassium, which are present in landfill leachate, through laboratory testing using three different liner configurations: a compacted mixture of local soil with 10% bentonite (CCBL) ( The ROL soil (CCL) is composed of a sandy clay with light-yellow-colored rocks, with a 37% clay (<5 The chemical characterization of the leachate from the ROL is shown twice in Batch tests were conducted to determine the parameters of the interaction between the soil and the contaminants ( The diffusion test cell was adapted from The CCL and CCBL tests lasted 3 and 10 In this study, the system defined by the soil, leachate and air is assumed to be a continuous medium in which the volume fractions represent the relative contribution of each phase to the full control volume defined by the diffusion cell. In this context, a multiphase multicomponent formulation for the ionic contaminants is used to account for the soil and leachate interactions, assuming that gas fills the remaining void space of the soil column in the diffusion cell. Thus, a general ion balance equation can be written as follows:         The first term of the equation, the transient term, corresponds to the accumulation rate of the ion mass fraction              Eqs. MPHMTP was interactively used to obtain the model parameters representing the behavior of each individual ion by using the diffusion profiles measured in the diffusion cell experiments. For each molecular ion studied, its effective diffusion coefficient in the leachate (   On the whole, upon comparing the chloride, potassium, and ammonium profiles, the most advanced ion proves to be chloride, whereas the ammonium is slightly more retarded than potassium. The presence of the geomembrane appears to be important because it minimized the migration of ions at a depth from 6 to 9   In terms of sorption, the presence of bentonite in the CCBL (soil with 20% bentonite) yielded a higher cation exchange capacity (7.1 In terms of diffusion, comparing the profiles of chloride, potassium and ammonium, the most advanced ion is chloride, as expected. The ammonium retardation is slightly greater than that of potassium. However, the chloride is present at significant concentrations at the bottom of the cell: 150 Upon comparing the three barriers, it was concluded that the presence of bentonite was very effective. Especially for ammonium, the profile for CCBL is very similar to that obtained in the presence of a geomembrane. Therefore, when a geomembrane cannot be used due to high costs or operational problems, a mixture of bentonite and soil is an alternative solution; this combination is more effective than compacted soil alone in minimizing the migration of chloride, potassium and ammonium ions.
