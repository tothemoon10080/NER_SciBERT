Radial nerve palsy after humeral shaft fractures can be secondary to manipulation. Incorrect diagnosis of soft tissue entrapment can lead to repetitive manipulation, putting the radial nerve at risk. We present a case of humeral shaft fracture with soft tissue entrapment and secondary nerve palsy that was successfully managed with open reduction and percutaneous fixation. We discuss the correct management in these cases.
