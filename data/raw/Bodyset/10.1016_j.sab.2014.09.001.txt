Pellets of sieved plant materials (150, 106, 75, 53 and 20μm sieve apertures) were prepared and analyzed by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and the results for Ca, K, Mg, P, B and Mn were discussed as a function of particle size distribution. This parameter is of key importance for appropriate test sample presentation in the form of pressed pellets for quantitative analysis by LIBS. Experiments were carried out with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064nm, and a spectrometer with Echelle optics and an intensified charge-coupled device. Results indicated that smaller particles yielded up to 50% emission signal intensities' enhancement and attained better measurements' precision (site-to-site variation). Moreover, matrix effects were reduced by analyzing pellets prepared from <75μm sieved fractions (mean particle size=32μm; d95
                     =102μm) and by using a 50Jcm−2 laser fluence (220mJ per pulse; 750μm laser spot size). The preparation of pellets from laboratory samples with monomodal particle size distributions, where most particles were smaller than 100μm, was decisive for improving analyte micro-homogeneity within the test samples and for attaining lower coefficients of variation of measurements, typically lower than 10% (n=10 sites per pellet; 20 laser pulses per site).Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is an attractive and powerful tool for direct solid analysis of agricultural, environmental and industrial samples due to its inherent analytical capabilities for fast and simultaneous multielemental determinations Particle size distribution of ground leaves is a key parameter for appropriate test sample presentation in the form of pressed pellets The effect of particle size on the analysis of aerosol by LIBS has been exploited elsewhere Particle size distribution critically affects the performance of microanalytical methods Plant materials usually contain particles of different compositions, which are intrinsically inhomogeneous at a microscopic scale The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of particle size distribution on the analysis of pellets of plant materials by LIBS. The variations in Ca, K, Mg, P, B and Mn emission signal intensities and measurement precision were evaluated by analyzing pellets prepared with different particle size distributions. Boldo ( Pellets were prepared in a Spex model 3624B X-Press by transferring 0.5 Experiments were carried out with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Brilliant, Quantel, France) at 1064 The lens-to-sample distance was adjusted at 175 The sieved fractions were microwave-assisted acid digested and the resulting solutions were analyzed by ICP OES in order to investigate the possible occurrence of contamination and elemental fractionation through sieving (i.e. chemical segregation). A two-tailed Student's Microwave-assisted acid digestions were carried out in closed TFM® vessels (ETHOS 1600, Milestone, Italy) in triplicate. A 250 Four certified reference materials (CRMs) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, USA) were used to check the accuracy of the results related to the acid digests analyzed by ICP OES: Apple Leaves (NIST SRM 1515), Peach Leaves (NIST SRM 1547), Trace Elements in Spinach Leaves (NIST SRM 1570a) and Tomato Leaves (NIST SRM 1573a). The particle size distributions were obtained by laser diffraction using a MicroTec Plus Analysette 22 (Fritsch, Germany) analyzer. The sieved fractions of the comminuted laboratory samples (50–100 The morphological characteristics of the pellet surface were investigated with a LEO scanning electron microscope (StereoScan 440, United Kingdom). Pellets were covered with a thin Pt layer during 80 Among the elements selected in the present contribution, potassium was chosen for micro-energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-EDXRF) mapping due to appropriate limit of quantification (ca. 0.9 The spatial distribution of potassium in pellets of different fractions of Boldo leaves was assessed by μ-EDXRF. To this end, a benchtop instrument (μEDX-1300, Shimadzu, Japan) furnished with a Rh X-ray tube and a Si(Li) semiconductor detector was used. A 1.0-mm Semi-quantitative data were estimated by dividing the potassium mass fraction in the bulk sample by the averaged K Kα 3.31 Regarding particle size distributions of the sieved fractions ( Regarding the investigation of possible elemental fractionation, no significant differences in the P, K, Ca, Mg, B and Mn mass fractions were found in all sieved fractions, at 95% confidence level. On the other hand, by taking into account the reference composition of the bulk laboratory sample, higher mass fraction of Zn (4.5-fold increase) was observed when the comminuted laboratory sample was sieved through 53 When test samples were prepared in the form of pressed pellets the structure of packed particles depended mainly on the particle size distribution Preparation of pellets from laboratory samples with monomodal particle size distribution, with most of the particles smaller than 102 In general, an average 1.6-fold increase was observed in the LIBS emission signal intensities of Ca I 442.544, K I 404.414, P I 213.618, Mg I 277.983 and B I 249.773 When the same pellets were interrogated by 50 The observed variations in signal emission intensities as a function of particle sizes are probably caused by physical matrix effects, as the incomplete decomposition of larger particles increases the number of atoms in the laser-induced plasma that remain in a non-emitting phase bound within the solid particulate, resulting in lower emission signal intensities There was a significant improvement on measurement precision as particle size decreased ( This effect was confirmed with the aid of μ-EDXRF potassium mapping, which showed that pellets presenting smaller particles had a more homogeneous distribution ( The comminution strategies for producing particles smaller than 100 The observation that up to 3-fold improvement in measurement precision found in the analysis of pellets prepared with < The authors are thankful to
