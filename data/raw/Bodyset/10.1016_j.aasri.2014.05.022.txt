Optimized study to the ratio of primeval ball loading in 4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball Mill of Yingezhuang gold mine, the research results showed that it pertains to low hard and brittle ores, the accurate size ball should be used rather than big size ball due to mainly fines mineral are produced in the process of comminution. As the yield of intermediate granularity between 8 to 0.45mm reach up to 50.34%,the intermediate particles should be strengthened in grinding, -400 mesh content is about 40% and -10um content accounts for a quarter of the grind products what showed that particles size are not satisfied and unfavorable to subsequent separation. The optimum scheme of primeval ball loading is that: φ70: φ60: φ50: φ40= 15: 15: 30: 40 for φ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill, the separate sizes contents is 64.19% between 0.15∼0.019mm which increasing by 19.14% compare with 44.78% and the mill -200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 12.6 percents compare with 0.14 about original program when φ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill work itself alone, in addition, the mill -200mesh utilization coefficient increasing 11.71 percents compare with 0.1503 about original program when φ4.0 × 6.0m overflow ball mill and φ3.6 × 6.0m grate ball mill are working together.
