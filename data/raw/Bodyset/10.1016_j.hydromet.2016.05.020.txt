The complexation of copper(I) by cyanide ions (CN−) in aqueous solution has been studied by glass electrode potentiometry at 25°C and ionic strengths (I) of 1, 3 and 5M in NaCl media. Overall formation constants, β

Such an understanding is typically expressed in the form of speciation models; or (graphically) as Pourbaix (Eh-pH) or species distribution (% Cu species-pH) diagrams, all of which rely on quantitative knowledge of the formation constants of relevant species. A typical Pourbaix diagram for the copper-cyanide system at 25 Given the importance of Cu(I)/CN The limitations of the existing stability constant database for the Cu(I)/CN This paper reports results obtained from two independent experimental studies made in our laboratories of the Cu(I)/CN  The solubility product of CuCN(s), corresponding to the equilibrium: However, the solubility equilibria most easily determined, at reasonably low pH and total cyanide levels, are: It should be noted that, because of the instability of uncomplexed Cu Analytical grade reagents and calibrated A-grade glassware were used throughout. All solutions were prepared using high purity water (Millipore Milli-Q system) that had been boiled for ~ Commercial glass electrodes (Metrohm, Switzerland, Model 6.0101.000) were used throughout. The electrodes were stored in 10 Potentiometric titrations were performed in air-tight Pyrex-glass cells that were either tall-form (Solis) or squat 20 For cyanide protonation titrations, the initial cell solutions consisted of (5 to 20) mM NaCN in 10 The solubility of CuCN(s) was measured at (25 Because HCN is a very weak acid (p Formation constants for the Cu(I)/CN  All the data points lie close to a single line, indicating their excellent reproducibility.

The stated uncertainties reflect the (small) inconsistencies between the experimental data sets and their limited precision. The small uncertainty in log * As noted in the Introduction, reliable and relevant thermodynamic data are becoming increasingly important in the modelling of complex hydrometallurgical systems. The software currently used in most simulations almost invariably attempts to convert constants obtained under standard conditions (25 From these data, it is clear that the changes in ionic strength can alter significantly the species-distribution and Pourbaix diagrams for this system. For example, under the alkaline conditions that apply in gold leaching (pH In addition, there are a number of processes for the recovery of cyanide from copper(I) cyanide solutions (e.g., the Sceresini, AVR and SART processes) that rely on acidification to increase the concentrations of the di-cyano complex and even to precipitate the copper as CuCN(s) (
