2Â½-D pocketing is a frequent operation in aeronautic and automotive industries. The path that must be followed by the tool during the milling process can be generated using different strategies. In the present paper, the influence of strategy and pocket geometry in parameters as machining time, cutting forces generated and surface roughness is studied. The pocketing tests have been performed on UNS A96063, an increasingly important alloy in such industries.
