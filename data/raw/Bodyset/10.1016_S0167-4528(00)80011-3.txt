In a fuzzy controller, the control strategy is expressed as a rule base, a set of linguistic rules that express the interrelations between controlled and manipulated variables. When the rule base is based on heuristics, and when the process to be controlled is complex, a certain degree of freedom exists, allowing the formulation of several rule bases with different control strategies.
                  In this paper, the performance of five different fuzzy control strategies developed to control a flotation column are compared. The controller, working in real time, is based on fuzzy logic inference with Mamdani-type rules. It's aim is stabilization (regulation) of the air holdup in the collection zone, and the command and stabilization of pulp height and bias water-flow rate by manipulation of the underflow, washing water and air-flow rates.
                  The strategies formulated were all developed heuristically and were: a rule base expressing the equivalent in fuzzy control of the column flotation classical-control strategy (three independent SISO loops), one rule base with only 11 rules, two more complex rule bases, and another, which considers dynamic compensation.
                  The exprimental work was performed on a fully monitored laboratory scale column 9 cm in diameter and 4 m in height. A two-phase system (air and water) was tested.
                  The main conclusion of this study is that it is possible to adequately control a flotation column using a fuzzy controller with a heuristically developed rule base. The controlled-system performance, using a simple rule base with 11 rules, is comparable to the performance achieved with more complex rule bases. In fact, operators can drive the process based on only a few simple rules.
