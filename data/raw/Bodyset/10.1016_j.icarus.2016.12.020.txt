Although the mass distribution of planetesimals during the early stages of planetary formation has been discussed in various studies, this is not the case for their temperature distribution. Mass and temperature distributions are closely linked, since the ability of planetesimals to dissipate the heat produced by both radioactive decay and impacts is related to their size and hence mass. Here, we propose a simple model of the evolution of the joint mass-temperature distribution through a formalism that encompasses the classic statistical approach of Wetherill (1990). We compute the statistical distribution of planetesimals by using simple rules for aggregation. Although melting temperatures can be easily reached, the formation of molten planetary embryos requires that they be formed in only a few 100 kyr. Our aggregation model, which even ignores fragmentation during collision, predicts that planetesimals with radii less than approximately 20  km will not melt during their formation.During the earlier stages of planetary accretion, the mass distribution of planetesimals evolved through collisions (i.e., merging of planetesimals). This process of planetary accretion has been initially described analytically with conceptual and statistical models ( Although the distribution of planetesimal sizes has been addressed, this is not the case for their thermal evolution and distribution in temperatures. In between collisions, the internal temperature of the planetesimals varied by radioactive heat release, mostly the decay of Various studies have produced models of accretion for a planetesimal by imposing a given history of formation (e.g., There are various domains of science where large bodies are produced by a discontinuous coalescence of smaller units. Such processes occur in chemistry (e.g., in polymer production; Contrary to the “discontinuous” processes of coalescence/fragmentation that change the number of objects that are interacting, “continuous” processes can modify the mass distribution of a collection of objects without changing their number. For example, in material sciences, the size distribution of solid grains solidifying from a melt and their coarsening through time has been the subject of research for many decades (e.g., Of course, both continuous and discontinuous processes can occur simultaneously, controlled by an equation of the general form We proposed a model for the grain size evolution of planetary mantle material based on this equation where grain coarsening occurs continuously but where grain comminution (recrystallization, fragmentation) occurs discontinuously ( We now add the thermal energy as a new variable and identify a planetesimal in mass and energy space with the notation “( The histogram of planetesimal properties This is akin to We define the thermal energy of each planetesimal To solve the differential In deriving this model of heat transfer we make various assumptions. First, we considered that the characteristic length of thermal diffusion is the planetesimal radius We also considered that planetesimal accretion occurs at constant background temperature At last we assume that the surface temperature remains equal to Assuming that two planetesimals of masses The importance of impact heating depends of the rate of collision, however, a simple numerical estimate using Although we are far from having discussed the necessary properties of Jump: in the mass-energy distribution, we consider the planetesimals ( Drift: during a time step d The numerical code corresponding to this process, generalizes in the We call The number of collisions during the time step d During the time d Although this redistribution of the planetesimals in the ( Finally, because of the exponential nature of the aggregation process, we use an exponential distribution of the bins for the mass (i.e., the mass bin We write Although the numerical implementation of the equations that we have discussed may suffice, a few useful properties can be derived by using a continuous representation of the mass and energy distribution. This representation will also make the connection with the classic Smoluchovski formalism ( A new planetesimal ( Of course, in this merging process, the number of planetesimals in the bin [ The total rate of planetesimal exchange through discontinuous process is therefore the sum The integral of the three Dirac delta-functions of Although no analytic solutions for a mass-energy distribution These solutions assume that all the planetesimals are formed by the successive coalescence of planetesimals of initial, identical masses In a physical problem with no intrinsic length scale, solutions can be searched on the form of self similar expressions and therefore assuming The existence of self similar solutions for As the formation of planets occurred in a runaway process, it involved a coagulation kernel where masses appeared with a power We choose as a benchmark test, Starting from a distribution where all planetesimals have the same mass, our test simulation must lead to a distribution In The novelty of our model is in the joint evolution of mass and temperature distributions, which describes the mixing and aggregation of the two original populations (See As our code has now been benchmarked we can use it for more realistic simulations. Terrestrial planets were formed by settling of dust toward the mid-plane of a solar nebula. Before km-size planetesimals were formed, the gravitational attraction of the planetesimals themselves was negligible. Gas was present in the nebula and there was a mass-dependent difference between the velocities of refractory nebular masses ( A planetesimal of radius During this initial phase, radioactivity is very inefficient at warming up planetesimals. A 1-km body has a diffusion time As a large planetesimal orbits the proto-Sun, it sweeps through a volume dominated by its effective gravitational cross-section, which is a function of relative and escape velocities – i.e., The use of coagulation kernels with masses to the powers 2/3 or 4/3 is a relatively crude approximation of the real physics of accretion. The relative velocity In the last phase of oligarchic growth, the successive collisions and merging of planetary embryos leads to the formation of planets like our solar-system’s current planets via giant impacts. This late stage is accessible to models, wherein the trajectories can be computed exactly ( Assuming that a We perform simulations with the same non dimensional aggregation kernels but using shorter and shorter time constants In all cases, planetesimals have a negligible temperature until they reach a significant average size (average mass ≈ 10  To simulate the runaway formation of planetesimals in which gravitational self attraction becomes important, we performed further simulations with the aggregation kernel The joint mass and temperature evolutions for the composite kernel The distribution of temperatures and sizes of the planetesimal swarms at different times using the kernel We can summarize the findings of our model by considering three different accretion cases, in particular, fast accretion (wherein a planet embryo appears in 40 kyr), intermediate accretion (the embryo forms in 400 kyr) and slow accretion (the embryo appears in 4 Myr); see The time and the mass of the largest planetesimal are directly related to each other for a given aggregation kernel, thus we can consider the embryo temperatures as a function of maximum planetesimal mass ( Overall, the role of intense, short-lived radiogenic heating With our relatively simple accretion model, we have shown that the temperature distribution of planetesimals during their formation is feasible with a limited number of assumptions. Our approach is therefore significantly different to previous ones that only discuss the thermal evolution of a single accreting body assumed to be typical of a planetesimal swarm (e.g., Our model suggests that melting of asteroids or minor planets (say masses ≈ 10 This work is supported by the Pallas program (ANR-14-CE33-0006-03). For any quantity This expression can be used to compute the rate of change of the total number, the total mass and the total energy of the planetesimal swarm.
