The ideal motion characteristics for the vibrating screen was presented according to the principle of screening process with constant bed thickness. A new vibrating screen with variable elliptical trace was proposed. An accurate mechanical model was constructed according to the required structural motion features. Applying multi-degree-of-freedom vibration theory, characteristics of the vibrating screen was analyzed. Kinematics parameters of the vibrating screen which motion traces were linear, circular or elliptical were obtained. The stable solutions of the dynamic equations gave the motions of the vibrating screen by means of computer simulations. Technological parameters, including amplitude, movement velocity and throwing index, of five specific points along the screen surface were gained by theoretical calculation. The results show that the traces of the new designed vibrating screen follow the ideal screening motion. The screening efficiency and processing capacity may thus be effectively improved.
