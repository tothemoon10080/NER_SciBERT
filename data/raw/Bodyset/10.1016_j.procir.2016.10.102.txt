The separation process of eddy current separator is effected by the structure parameters of magnetic roller, the working parameters of the separator and some parameters of the scrap metal, such as the material, the shape, the size and so on. This is a complex process of electric field and magnetic field coupling. During this process, the sorting function of separator is powered by the existence of the eddy current power in waste particles, and the separation effect is directly determined by the flying distance of the scrap metal in the separation process. This paper armed for studying the eddy current power and the flying distance of the waste particles in separation to realize the simulation of the separation process. The eddy current force was obtained by the finite element analysis of the magnetic roller based on COMSOL, and the flying distance was got by the joint simulation of COMSOL and MATLAB.
