It should be possible to optimize discrete filters applied in an electronic circuit of a radiometric density meter monitoring coal separation processes in a jig. The signal from the meter can be used to (1) evaluate the degree in which coal grains loosen during cyclic water pulsations and (2) to determine the density of the separation layer in the jig. The signal transmitted by the radiation detector is variable due to stochastic decay of the radiation source and changes in media density. The authors present a simulation model of the radiometric meter and discuss results of optimization procedures based on industrial tests.
