Magnetite thin film with a predominant (110) texture has been deposited by pulsed laser ablation of α-Fe2O3 target onto fused quartz substrate. Spontaneous magnetization of 5400G and room temperature electrical resistivity of 4.2×10−3
                     Ωcm were measured for an annealed magnetite thin film. Zero-field-cooled magnetization data clearly show the Verwey transition near 120K through an abrupt change, and is consistent with the resistivity measurement.Recently, there have been several papers on the deposition of magnetite thin films on amorphous substrates using a variety of deposition techniques. Most of these films do not show any orientation, unless a buffer crystalline layer is used in between. Diverse magnetic and electrical properties of the films have been reported in them. Even the Verwey transition, which is characteristic of magnetite, is not discernible from most reported resistivity measurements Magnetite films were grown on fused quartz substrate by pulsed laser deposition, with the substrate kept at room temperature. The third harmonic (355 The XRD of the as-deposited and annealed thin films are shown in There have been reports of deposition of oriented thin films on quartz substrates and also by using buffer layers In The temperature dependence of the resistivity for the annealed film is shown in In conclusion, magnetite thin film has been pulsed laser ablated with a predominant (1
