The effects of Y and Ti on the microstructure stability and tensile properties of the reduced activation ferritic/martensitic steel have been investigated. The addition of Y and Ti affected the prior austenite grain size due to the pinning of the inclusions. Ti addition of 0.008 wt% to the steel was intended to promote the precipitation of nano-sized carbides with a high resistance to coarsening. 8Ti14Y exhibited a higher yield strength and a lower DBTT than the other alloys due to the fine grain size and additional precipitation hardening by (Ti, Ta)-rich MX. After thermal exposure at 550 °C for 1500 h, yield strength was dropped significantly in exposed 0Ti13Y. On the contrary, a lower reduction of YS was observed in 8Ti14Y. The M23C6 in 0Ti13Y and 8Ti14Y and MX in 25Ti14Y and 39Ti15Y coarsened seriously during ageing, which could be responsible for the reduction of the tensile properties of alloys.Due to their better thermo-physical, thermomechanical and swelling resistance properties, the reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels have been considered as a strong candidate structural material for the fusion reactor So far rare-earth elements (RE) have been widely used in steels In this study, four types of alloys were designed with varying yttrium (Y) and titanium (Ti) contents based on the CLAM alloy. The alloy was melted in a 25 kg vacuum induction furnace with magnesia crucibles. The ingot was first forged into 50 mm × 35 mm billets and then rolled into a 12 mm thick plate at temperatures between 1100 °C and 950 °C. The nitrogen contents in the steels were approximately 29 ppm, and the total oxygen contents in steels were 24, 17, 12 and 10 ppm, respectively. Based on their individual Y and Ti contents, the alloys were designated as 0Ti13Y (Fe-0.11C-9.2Cr-1.51W-0.22V-0.15Ta-0.44Mn-0.05Si-0.013Y (in wt.%)), 8Ti14Y (Fe-0.11C-9.3Cr-1.51W-0.21V-0.15Ta-0.45Mn-0.06Si-0.008Ti-0.014Y (in wt.%)), 25Ti14Y (Fe-0.10C-9.2Cr-1.50W-0.22V-0.15Ta-0.44Mn-0.05Si-0.025Ti-0.014Y (in wt.%)) and 39Ti15Y (Fe-0.11C-9.2Cr-1.51W-0.22V-0.15Ta-0.45Mn-0.06Si-0.039Ti- 0.015Y (in wt.%)). The hot-rolled plates were normalized at 1050 °C for 0.5 h with air-cooled and then tempered at 650 °C for 1.5 h with air-cooled. In order to investigate the thermal stability of the alloys, the tempered plates were exposure at 550 °C (the upper limit temperature of the CLAM steel) for 1500 h under air atmosphere in a tube furnace. In order to achieve better contrast between the inclusions and matrix, the samples cut from the ingots were normalized at 1050 °C for 0.5 h with water-cooled. Then the normalized samples were mechanically polished. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometer (EDS) was employed to observe inclusions in the steels. An image analysis software (Image pro-Plus6.0) was used to count the number (n), average equivalent diameter ( Specimens for optical microscopy (OM), SEM and mechanical property tests were spark machined from the heat-treated and aging treated plates respectively, which were parallel to the rolling direction. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were made with a Zeiss Ultra Plus operated at 30 kV and a FEI Tecnai G20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The samples for average grain size estimation were etched using a 1% picral solution (5 ml HCl＋1 g picric acid＋100 ml ethyl alcohol). Thin foil specimens for TEM mechanically polished to 40–50 μm in thickness and prepared as a φ 3 mm discs. Then the discs electrochemically polished in a twin-jet polishing apparatus using a solution of 5% perchloric acid and 95% acetic acid at room temperature. Tensile test was conducted at room temperature (RT) with a gauge section of φ5 mm × 25 mm in the air at a cross head speed of 2 mm/min. Tensile tests at high temperature (300 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C and 650 °C) were performed on dog bone shaped and subsized flat specimens with a nominal gauge section of 6.0 × 2.0 × 30 mm  The structures of the four steels were typical martensitic and almost no delta-ferrite is observed in these alloys. The average prior austenite grain sizes of the four steels are 9.65 μm, 9.31 μm, 10.23 μm and 10.59 μm respectively, measured by linear intercept method, which are much smaller than the grain size of CLAM (20–30 μm) Typical TEM micrographs of the initial microstructures and precipitates in the tempered steels are shown in More details of the MX precipitates in the alloys are shown in Tensile properties of the alloys with different Y and Ti contents at different test temperatures is shown in   The typical TEM micrographs of the RAFM steels aged at 550 °C for 1500 h are presented in  The upper shelf energy and DBTT temperatures of the aged alloys are presented in Microstructure stability and tensile properties of RAFM steels with Y and Ti have been investigated in this study. The main results can be drawn as follows: The inclusions with Y/Y-Ti could play a role in pinning the austenite grain boundaries. When 0.008% Ti was added, the average austenite grain sizes of the alloy decreases from 9.65 μm to 9.31 μm. Excessive Ti results in a large number of carbides along the grain boundary, which could cause the weakening of grain boundaries and reduce the tensile properties of alloy. The growth of MX precipitates could be accelerated by Ti element, leading to the coarsening of carbides during tempering. The higher the content of Ti in MX carbide is, the bigger the MX precipitates is. After thermal exposure at 550 °C/1500 h, significant coarsening of blocks was observed in the 8Ti14Y alloy. The blocks width increased by 89.5% (0.19 → 0.36 μm) in the aged 8Ti14Y alloy while the aged 0Ti13Y alloy showed only 4.5% increase (0.43 → 0.45 μm). However, the grain sizes of 8Ti14Y alloy was more stable after thermal exposure (9.31 → 10.5 μm). There is a significant YS drop in the aged 0Ti13Y alloy (666.4 → 546.5 MPa, 18.0% YS drop). On the contrary, a lower YS drop was observed in 8Ti14Y alloy (749.5 → 652.5 MPa, 12.9% YS drop). It indicates that the degradation of RAFM steel with Y is faster than that of RAFM steel with Y and Ti. After aging for 1500 h, the M The authors are grateful for the support from the
