Crystal-size distribution (CSD) theory was initially developed in material engineering to understand crystallization processes of chemical compounds ( Over the past few years, the application of high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT), the automated analysis of thin-sections and the availability of supercomputing facilities allowed the measurement of large populations (>1000) of crystals in both 2D and 3D ( The ‘CSDToolbox’ 1.0 software is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) written and compiled in MATLAB Detailed descriptions of the input parameters, available features and tutorials with examples of step-by-step processing of 2D and 3D datasets are described in the user manual provided with the software and hence are not repeated here. We used ‘CSDToolbox 1.0’ software to calculate the crystal-size distribution and crystal shape characteristics of chromite grains in a sample from Fly Bore komatiite (Godel, unpublished data). The 3D distribution of chromite in the sample was determined using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (HRXCT). The HRXCT data were processed following the method described in The ‘CSDToolbox’ 1.0 executable file (CSD.exe) and tutorial examples can be downloaded free of charge from the CSIRO website ( This work was supported by the Western Australian Geothermal Centre of Excellence (WAGCOE) and CSIRO.
