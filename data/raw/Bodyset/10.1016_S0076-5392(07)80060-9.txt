This chapter describes stochastic models for processes wherein the size of solid particles changes either spontaneously or by being manipulated in some way. By far the most used modeling technique for this type of process is Population Balance Modeling (PBM), and the chapter discusses PBM in general and subsequently gives an example of a PBM analysis of an agglomeration process. The chapter gives an account of work aimed at linking traditional PBM analysis of a grinding, also called “comminution,” process to a stochastic model based on discrete Markov chains. It discusses the processes of crystallization, agglomeration, and comminution and mentions some of the most important physical aspects and methods for carrying out the processes. Comminution, or grinding, which is particle size reduction by shredding or crushing, is a ubiquitous process, for instance, in the energy, cement, and mining industries. Coal may be crushed to control the particle size in a coal-fired furnace, or a large rock consisting of a non-homogeneous mixture of valuable ore and value-less gangue may be crushed to create smaller stones rich in ore or gangue, respectively, which can be separated from each other.
