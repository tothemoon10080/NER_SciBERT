Precision medicine and molecular therapeutics offer significant potential in vascular patients because of the chronicity and heterogeneity of disease. Currently, there is no established, targeted molecular therapeutic intervention for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. The work on using metalloproteinase as a biomarker and targeting its activity as a therapeutic option continues on the basis of earlier work, in whole and in part, in murine models. Initial studies in humans have not come to fruition. The current study sheds more light on receptor activator of nuclear factor ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclastogenic differentiation of macrophages in a phenotypically unique model of AAA formation. Several studies have demonstrated that there is a balanced mineralization process within the wall of diseased arteries mediated by monocyte-macrophage-derived osteoblast-like and osteoclast-like cells.
