                      nanosheets with a uniform morphology and a thickness of about 180 ​nm were synthesized by carbonization precipitation under the pH ​= ​5.0 and cerium chloride concentration of 0.3 ​mol/L. It is shown that Oriented attachment (OA) and Ostwald ripening (OR) mechanism coexist during the growth of cerium carbonate nanosheets. And highly uniform ceria nanosheets with cubic phase fluorite structure which composed of 50–100 ​nm crystal grains and has a particle size distribution of 0.59 can be obtained by calcining cerium carbonate at 400 ​°C for 2 ​h. The preparation of ceria nanosheets by carbon dioxide carbonization has the advantages of simple operation, mild conditions and low cost, which would provide a effective reference for preparing other kinds of nano rare earth compounds.A uniform morphology of flaky ceria precursor, whose chemical composition is As an important rare-earth oxide nanopowder, nano-CeO The synthesis of nano-ceria has received increasing attention because nano-ceria with special morphologies exhibits excellent properties and has many potential applications. At present, ceria nanopowders can be prepared by three methods: the gas-phase method, the solid-phase method, and the liquid-phase method [ In the field of hydrometallurgy and material preparation, carbon dioxide carbonization technology is often used to generate soluble or insoluble bicarbonate or carbonate, which can be post processed to obtain the ideal materials. So far, this technology has been applied in scientific research and industrial production to prepare a variety of nano-materials with small particle size and narrow particle size distribution, such as nano-calcium carbonate [ On the basis of the above, this study prepared highly uniform cerium carbonate nanosheets by carbon dioxide carbonization method with cerium chloride as the raw material and using sodium hydroxide solution to control the pH. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy(TEM) were used to analyze the carbonization products obtained at different reaction times to explore the growth mechanism of cerium carbonate nanosheets. Finally, ceria nanosheets with uniform morphology and homogeneous distribution were obtained after the calcinations of cerium carbonate. The carbon dioxide carbonization method for preparing nano-ceria has the advantages of mild conditions, a wide selection of raw materials, low cost, and low pollution. This simple synthetic route provides an effective reference for preparing other rare-earth compounds with different morphologies and properties. Materials: 1.43 ​mol/L CeCl Apparatus: pH meter (FE20), muffle furnace (sx2-4-10/12), drying oven(101-3AB), suction filtration equipment(SHB-B95), carbonization reaction device (shown as Three experiments have been carried out under different conditions, shown in Experiment 1#: 200 ​mL of 0.90 ​mol/L CeCl Experiment 2#: 200 ​mL of 0.90 ​mol/L CeCl Experiment 3#: the reaction process was the same as that of experiment 2#, but the concentration of the cerium chloride solution was 0.30 ​mol/L, the volume was 200 ​mL, and the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution was 0.30 ​mol/L. The morphology and growth mechanism of powders was tested by Field scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TM3000, Hitachi high-tech co., LTD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2000FX, JEOL co., LTD). The particle size (D  FT-IR analysis The ceria precursors obtained at 60 ​min carbonization in experiments 1#, 2#, and 3# were characterized with FT-IR to determine the phase compositions. As shown in XRD analysis To further determine the phase composition of the ceria precursors, XRD analysis was performed on the three precursors (  Carbonization process analysis of experiment 1#: The morphology of the carbonization products obtained at different times was characterized to investigate the growth process of cerium carbonate in different carbonization experiments. In 1#-20min shows some aggregates with small particles and a certain amount of flaky crystals with irregular shapes. This was because as the carbonization reaction proceeded, the large cerium hydroxide aggregates gradually dissolved and shrunk, releasing Ce Carbonization process analysis of experiment 2#: 2# in In the early stage of carbonization, the system had no crystallization centers, and the concentrations of cerium ions and sodium hydroxide were high. Therefore, many cerium carbonate crystal nuclei were formed with the introduction of carbon dioxide. The crystal nuclei exhibited Brownian motion and collided with each other to form the primary nanograins. The primary nanograins had high surface energy and thus a tendency to aggregate to reduce their surface energy. Therefore, many football-shaped aggregates were observed(2#-10min in Carbonization process analysis of experiment 3#: 3# in To select appropriate carbonization conditions and obtain well-dispersed cerium carbonates, the particle size of the cerium carbonates obtained in the three experiments was analyzed, shown in From the above analysis, it can be seen that the ceria precursor obtained in experiment 3# was   TEM images further provided structural information about the cerium carbonate ( Generally, the traditional crystal growth process is explained by the Ostwald ripening (OR) theory characterized by surface dissolution deposition. However, as the understanding of nano materials has deepened, an increasing number of studies have found that the growth mechanism cannot be explained by the OR theory when the particle size is small. Therefore, the oriented attachment (OA) mechanism was proposed to explain the growth of many anisotropic nanostructures [ However, OA and OR mechanisms usually coexist during crystal growth. The former forms new crystals through the collision and coalescence of nanograins; internal defects such as dislocations and stacking faults can be produced due to the imperfect collision of nanograins [ Therefore, the carbonization crystallization process under acidic conditions was a process in which the OA and OR mechanisms coexisted. Ce Ceria powder was obtained after dehydration, oxidation, and decomposition of cerium carbonate. The thermal decomposition behavior of the highly uniform 180 ​nm cerium carbonate sheets obtained in experiment 3# was analyzed by thermogravimetry (TG)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the decomposition temperature, prevent aggregation during the calcination process, maintain morphology and particle size during the calcination process, and obtain ceria with nanosheet morphology. The results are shown in Based on the above TG/DSC data, the  The precipitation of cerium chloride solution by carbon dioxide carbonization is closely related to the concentration and the system pH. A uniform morphology of flaky ceria precursor is obtained by carbon dioxide carbonization method under the pH ​= ​5.0 and cerium chloride concentration of 0.3 ​mol/L. The chemical composition of the precursor is The growth of Highly uniform ceria nanosheets with cubic phase fluorite structure which composed of 50–100 ​nm crystal grains and has a particle size distribution of 0.59 can be obtained by calcining  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
