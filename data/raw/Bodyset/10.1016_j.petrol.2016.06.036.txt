Shale rock formations often contain calcite, which is a mineral that plays an important role in the failure of shale and in fracturing the reservoir volume. This study uses digital images to characterise the mesoscopic-scale non-uniformity of shale resulting from the shape, size and distribution of calcite in the shale. The geometry of the calcite is mapped to a finite element mesh based on the meso-scale structure of the rock. The numerical failure analysis model RFPA2D-DIP, which can accurately represent the meso-scale structure of shale, is used to simulate uniaxial compression. The influence of the meso-scale structure on the compressive strength and the failure process under various loading conditions are studied. The simulation results show that the meso-scale structure has an important influence on the compressive strength and the ultimate failure mode of samples loaded in various directions 
                        α
                     . Furthermore, the results show that the compressive strength varies significantly with the direction of the load, indicating anisotropy. Depending on the direction, the failure mode can take the form of an inverted V (
                        α
                     =0°, 30°, 45°), an inverted Z (
                        α
                     =15°), a line (
                        α
                     =75°), or a V (
                        α
                     =60°, 90°). The spatial distribution of the acoustic emissions (AE) we observed is similar to those observed in macroscopic failure modes. The fractal dimension (D) of the shale fractures under various loading conditions is calculated using the box-counting method. The fractal dimension is an effective indicator of the failure mode. The value of D corresponding to the various failure modes is as follows: for the inverted Z the maximum value is 1.688016, for the line the minimum value is 1.481904, and for both the inverted V and the V, the value is between 1.688016 and 1.481904. Therefore, the failure mode is more complex for larger values of D.As the production of oil and gas from conventional resources has decreased in recent years, the exploitation of shale gas has become more attractive. Shale gas is present in many locations and is plentiful ( Compared with other oil and gas reservoirs, shale reservoirs have extremely low matrix porosity and permeability, and large-scale fracturing is required to produce significant capacity ( Various studies have examined the mechanical properties of shale. Hydrostatic and tri-axial compression tests have been conducted to study anisotropy in Tournemire shale ( Various studies have investigated the compressive strength, the deformation, and the failure modes of shale under various loads applied at various angles. Although these studies of shale deformation and failure provide useful information, they investigated only the macroscopic-scale failure of shale and rarely considered mesoscopic-scale behaviour such as non-uniform induced stress distributions and local failure effects. Therefore, the exact nature of the failure mechanism of shale remains unclear. Shale is a heterogeneous material, and its overall, macro-scale mechanical properties and fracture process depend on the microscopic-scale behaviour and the mesoscopic-scale structure of the material. This study used digital images processing techniques to determine the spatial distribution of the minerals in shale, which often contains calcite veins. The non-uniformity of the calcite in the shale was described by statistical methods. In a previous study by Digital image processing was used to develop the numerical model of the shale. Digital images were used to distinguish the calcite in the shale and establish a finite element model. The method of threshold segmentation, or edge detection, was used to partition the image into regions with different characteristics, and colours were selected according to the image features. Shale is mostly grey in colour, so the HSI colour space, or model, was chosen for image segmentation. The HSI (hue-saturation-intensity) colour space is based on human perception of colour. Hue represents colours as an angle that ranges from 0 to 360°, where 0° is red, 120° is green, and 240° is blue. Saturation is a percentage, where zero saturation is grey regardless of the hue, medium saturation represents a lighter shade, and high saturation (100%) represents deep, pure colours. Intensity represents the brightness of colour and ranges from 0 (black) to 100% (brightest). To facilitate the conversion of the RGB colour space used on computer monitors, the HSI values in this study were transformed to a scale of 0–255. Distinct regions of shale and calcite were identified by colour in digital images of the rock. Specifically, the I value was used for threshold segmentation.  According to the strain equivalence principle, the constitutive relation for damaged material can be obtained from the nominal stress in the material ( Because the tensile strength of shale is much lower than the compressive strength, we used a modified Mohr-Coulomb criterion (the Mohr-Coulomb equation with a tensile criterion) as the limit for failure ( According to the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, when the element is under uniaxial compression the damage variable In the finite element method, the domain is divided into many small elements via a grid, or mesh. A digital image is a rectangular array of pixels, where each pixel is a small square. Therefore, each pixel can be viewed as a quadrilateral element in a finite element mesh. The each unit of four node coordinates by the proportional relationship between the actual image size and pixel size, conversion for the physical coordinates of the corresponding vector space, the entire image can be converted square finite element mesh, then according to each pixel the colour category, to each element gives the corresponding material parameters, thus the digital image representation of non-uniform is introduced in the numerical model. Simulations were performed using the rock failure process analysis software RFPA2D. The rock failure process analysis code RFPA2D ( It was assumed that the elastic modulus and the strength of the meso-scale elements in the shale and the calcite followed the Weibull distribution ( An example of a finite element model obtained from a digital image is shown in To research the effect the meso-scale structure of the rock, we used a 50    The yellow regions in Fractal theory can be used to identify inherent patterns in objects or behaviours that initially appear irregular. This theory has applications in many fields, including biology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, economics, geotechnical engineering, and computer graphics ( The failure process in rock begins with the development of internal microscopic cracks, which grow until failure. The generation and the propagation of micro-cracks are accompanied by elastic waves, that is, acoustic emissions, in the rock. The fractal dimension is one of the basic principles of fractal theory. The fractional dimension replaces the integer dimensions of traditional Euclidean space and can quantitatively characterise with non-integer values mathematical entities such as Cantor sets and Koch curves. The term “fractal dimension” has a variety of definitions, but in this study we chose the self-similar fractal dimension, also known as the box-counting dimension, which is expressed as ( The fractal dimension of a shale sample undergoing uniaxial compression was computed using custom software. The main steps of the algorithm are as follows. First, the image is scaled to a resolution of 512×512 pixels, a grey-scale image is obtained, and a binary image is created and stored. The second step is to solve, to the side size of the square box cover binary image, statistical sample damage area square box number N(ε) and save data. Among them, ε=2   From  Samples of Niutitang shale showed significant anisotropy in compressive strength. As the azimuth angle increased, the compressive strength of the specimens initially increased and then decreased, and then increased. The lowest compressive strength was observed for an azimuth angle of 75°, and the maximum compressive strength was approximately 1.45 times that of the minimum value. The failure mode of the shale differed significantly with the azimuth angle. The failure modes for the various azimuth angles were as follows: an inverted V for Because the spatial distribution of acoustic emissions is of a fractal nature, the fractal dimension can reflect the failure mode of a specimen. In this study, the linear failure mode had a fractal dimension of 1.481904, the lowest, and the fractal dimension of the inverted Z failure mode was 1.688016, the highest. The fractal dimension for the V mode and the inverted V mode were between these two values. The fractal dimension can be used to effectively characterise the shale failure characteristics. Specifically, the greater the value of the fractal dimension D is, the greater the complexity of the failure mode. Future research will include simulations of triaxial compression, analysing the fractal characteristics of the failure process on a smaller scale, establishing the evolution of the fractal dimension for damage in shale, and mapping the relations between the model parameters and the mechanical properties of the rock.
