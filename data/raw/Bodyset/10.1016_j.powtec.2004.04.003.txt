It is indisputable that particle breakage is an important issue for a number of industries involving processing, crystallisation, granulation, transportation or storage of particulate materials. Breakage arises as a consequence of particle–particle or particle–equipment interactions and can be undesirable or intentional depending on the nature of an application. For instance, attrition of particulate products during storage and transportation is undesirable as it leads to product quality degradation. On the other hand, different comminution techniques such as grinding and milling have been developed for the purpose of intentional particle size reduction. In all these cases, better understanding of particle failure is essential in order to control breakage as desired. This special issue of Powder Technology attempts to provide a selection of papers which illustrate the current state of activities. This is from the small scale of a single particle, to the study of whole processes for breakage; both by experimental study and mathematical modelling. The quality of the papers show that despite a long history, particle breakage is still a lively technical field. The papers presented here are divided into four themes: Fundamentals, Granulation, Milling/Grinding; Crystallization and Pneumatic Conveying. We think it is particularly important that two of the sections are related directly to product formation, rather than simple size reduction, showing that studies of breakage can be found at the heart of modern particle technology. We would like to thank all contributors and reviewers for the quality of their work and speed of response.
