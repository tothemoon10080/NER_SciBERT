Metrian [3-mercapto-5-(2′-hydroxynaphtylazo-1′)-1,2,4-triazole]; Metriap [3-mercapto-5-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenylazo-1′)-1,2,4-triazole]; Metriarez-γ [3-mercapto-5-(2′,4′-dihydroxy-3′-caroboxyphenylazo-1′)-1,2,4-triazole] and Metidarez-β [2-mercapto-5-(2′,4′-dihydroxy-5′-carboxyphenylazo-1′)-1,3,4-thiadiazole]-reagents were synthesized on Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lublin and used for the determination by different analytical methods of milligram quantities of Fe(II) and Zn(II) occurring together in pharmaceutical preparations, both multivitamin preparations and those containing microelements. The determination results of classical spectrophotometry (D0), spectrophotometry of derivatives (D1 and D2), atomic absorption spectrometric (AAS) and ions chromatography (IC) were analyzed statistically and compared with declared amount. The advantages of the proposed method of Fe(II) and Zn(II) determination include it's excellent precision and reproducibility of results.Fe(II) Zn(II) 18.000 15.000 ± μ (P 95%, 17.547 14.796 0.25314 0.27238 0.35389 0.38079 2.02 2.57 17.547 14.796 – – D I ↔ II I ↔ III II ↔ III Determined Zn(II) by Metrian I, Metriap II, Metriarez-γ III, Metidarez-β IV           Determined Zn(II) by classical spectrophotometry I Spectrophotometry of derivatives II I ↔ II AAS III I ↔ III IC IV I ↔ IV II ↔ III II ↔ IV III ↔ IV             D I ↔ II I ↔ III II ↔ III       D I ↔ II I ↔ III I ↔ IV II ↔ III II ↔ IV III ↔ IV Determined Fe(II) by Metrian I, Metriap II, Metriarez-γ III, Metidarez-β IV                 Determined Fe(II) by classical spectrophotometry I Spectrophotometry of derivatives II I ↔ II AAS III I ↔ III IC IV I ↔ IV II ↔ III II ↔ IV III ↔ IV             D I ↔ II I ↔ III I ↔ IV II ↔ III II ↔ IV III ↔ IV                 In latest years, a lot of multivitamin preparations with microelements have been for sell. There has been a considerable increase in the application of it in cases of mental and physical over-exertion, convalescence, anemia, trace element deficiency and vitamin deficiency. Both the lack of vitamins and microelements and the surplus there of may lead to complicated disorders not to mention deaths. The common usage of preparations containing microelements requires the development of quick and reliable methods of ion determination in such preparations, especially those with heavy metals. Fe(II) and Zn(II) are the most common components of multivitamin preprations with microelements. The Iron in pharmaceutical preparations was determined using tiosalycylic acid The choice of dyes for the determination of Fe(II) (Metidarez-β) and Zn(II) (Metriarez-γ) in the presence of other elements resulted from the high stability constants of the complexes, namely log – Vitrum Stock dye solutions of 2 × 10 Type λ 15, Perkin–Elmer UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Germany) with Epson LQ 850 Twelve milliliters samples of Metrian, Metriap, Metidarez-β or Metriarez-γ dye in methanol of 2 × 10 One tablet of Vitrum Twenty-five-milliliters measuring flasks were filled with 12 ml of methanol solutions of: Metrian, Metriap, Metriarez-γ and Metidarez-β of 2 × 10 Absorbance was measured after 30 min., at the analytical wavelength against the reference agent (12 ml of an adequate dye of 2 × 10 In a water–methanol solution, Fe(II) ions together with Metidarez-β from violet-colored chelate bonds with a L/M composition of 3/1 (the ligand is orange under these conditions) The following values were recorded for the chosen parameters typical of the IC and AAS methods: RSD (%) for Fe(II) methodical error (%) for Fe(II) RSD (%) for Fe(II) methodical error (%) for Fe(II) The advantages of the method outlined for Fe(II) and Zn(II) determination in multivitamin preparations with microelements such as Vitrum
