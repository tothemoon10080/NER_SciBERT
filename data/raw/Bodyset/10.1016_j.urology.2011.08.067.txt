This is an important population-based study that attempts to further examine questions about shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)-associated injury. Presumably, this is the same group that reported in 2006 an increased risk of hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with 19 years of follow-up. The present report examines a stable and unique resource, the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The value of this information is notable because not many places have the ability or resources to obtain such data, which dates back to 1935. It would seem to put the question of the risk of DM with SWL to rest. However, the concerns about SWL are founded in scientific rigor and do have merit.
