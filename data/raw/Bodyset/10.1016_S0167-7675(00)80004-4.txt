This chapter discusses the kinetics of pentose formation from pentosan. The rate of pentose formation from pentosan is proportional to the pentosan concentration, but is diminished by the sequence reaction of pentose to furfural. Inasmuch as this hydrolysis involves a solid (pentosan), it is obvious that the degree of comminution of this solid plays a role and may change pentosan to some extent. It is equally probable that the nature of the raw material have some effect on pentosan in that pentosan firmly embedded in cellulose or resin would react more slowly than pentosan readily accessible. All of these effects are only of minor significance as at equal hydrogen ion concentration the hydrolysis of pentosan to pentose is very much faster than the subsequent dehydration of pentose to furfural. Consequently, in any appraisals of furfural reactors the period of time required for the pentosan hydrolysis to pentose is usually disregarded.
