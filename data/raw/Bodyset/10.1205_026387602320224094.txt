The phase equilibria of α-phenylglycine in sodium hydroxide solutions at pH=11 and 12 with the extractant trialkylmethylammoniumchloride (Tomac) dissolved in kerosene and toluene and with Amberlite XAD-4 resin coated with Tomac at 30°C is reported.The extraction of α-phenylglycine and co-extraction of hydroxyl ions take place simultaneously by ion exchange reactions with the extractant. Phase equilibria are discussed as a function of α-phenylglycine concentration, pH of the aqueous phase and Tomac concentration either in the organic phase or in resin phase. An equilibrium model, which considers the hydroxyl ion co-extraction, has been used for the correlation of the equilibrium data.
