The influence of several additives such as CaO, Y2O3, SrO, ZnO, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 to MgO on the discharge characteristics of AC plasma display panels was investigated as a function of the additives’ content. Among the various additives, the titanium oxide was the most efficient in lowering the discharge voltages of panels which exhibited 13V lower firing voltages and 19V lower sustaining voltages than the conventional MgO. The discharge voltages were found to have minimum points at the additives’ content of 0.1 or 0.2 regardless of which additive. Above this point, the discharge voltages gradually increased according to the additive’s content, which resulted from exceeding the solid solution limit of MgO with the appearance of a cracked film surface. The packing density of the evaporated films was increased by addition of the additives in the range of the additives’ content that did not exceed the solid solution limit of the MgO. There was a nearly linear relationship between the refractive index and the discharge voltages. The densification effect by the additives was thought to be the main reason for the decrease in the discharge voltages.The discharge voltage of an AC plasma display panel (AC PDP) is largely affected by a protective layer since the operation mechanism of the AC PDP is based on the gas discharge phenomenon occurring around the protective layer that covers the dielectric layer The process to fabricate evaporation sources was reported elsewhere The microstructure of the protective layers was obtained by a thin film X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Rint 2000) with the Cu target at 40  To investigate the reason why all additives reduce the voltage for discharge to some extent, and why the inflection points are seen at all the curves of  The surface morphology of the films with the CaO content of 0.1 in The packing density of the films can be evaluated indirectly from the refractive index of the films. The relationship between the packing density and refractive index of films is described with the Bragg–Pippard formula  Based on the measured and the equivalent refractive index of the mixed films, the packing density of the films was calculated, which is shown in To generalize the relationship between the discharge voltage and the refractive index, we plotted the firing voltages and the sustaining voltages versus the refractive index of mixed protective materials, respectively, not considering the kind and content of additives ( Various mixed films based on MgO were prepared as protective layers on dielectric materials by an e-beam evaporation method in order to lower the The authors wish to thank the PDP Research Division (G7 project) in KOREA for financial support.
