With a view to developing a sound basis for the design and scale-up of ball mills, a large amount of data available in the literature were analyzed for variation of the two key mill performance parameters: power specific values of the ‘absolute breakage rate of the coarsest size fraction’, S
                     *, and ‘absolute rate of production of fines’, F
                     *, with some of the important operating and design variables such as the mill speed, ball load, particle load, ball diameter and mill diameter. In general, values of both the mill performance parameters were found to vary significantly with the mill operating conditions. The nature and relative magnitude of variation for the two parameters also differed significantly. Moreover, the effect of any particular variable on the S
                     * and F
                     * values was found to be significantly different for different sets of operating conditions. It has been emphasized that, as the purpose of grinding is to produce fine particles, the mill design and scale-up work should be based mainly on the F
                     * parameters. Moreover, it is not correct to regard the S
                     * values to be independent of the mill design and operating variables as a general rule, especially for a fine analysis of the performance of the grinding systems.weight fraction of the material breaking out of sieve size interval fraction of broken product that is finer than lower size limit of the size interval energy input to the mill per unit mass of the particulate charge rate of production of fines relative to the value for the first time interval absolute rate of production of fine material per unit power input power specific absolute rate of production of fine material relative to the corresponding value for some chosen value of the operating condition under consideration mass fraction of particulate solids finer than sieve total mass of the particulate charge in the mill fraction of mill volume filled by static ball charge mass fraction of the particulate solids in the sieve size interval fraction of critical speed of mill net power drawn by mill grinding rate relative to the grinding rate for the first time interval absolute rate of breakage per unit power input power specific absolute grinding rate relative to the power specific absolute grinding rate for some chosen value of the operating condition under consideration specific breakage rate for particles of size class grinding time fraction of void volume of the static ball charge occupied by the particulate solids The world over, every year several billion tons of metallic ores, minerals, cement and various other solids used in the ceramic and chemical industries are subjected to size reduction in ball mills. The specific energy consumption value for grinding of these materials typically ranges from 5 to 50 Another important task associated with the ball mill grinding operation is to establish a sound basis for carrying out scale-up of ball mills based on laboratory or pilot scale test work. This requires studies related to the influence of mill diameter on production rate of particles of a desired size distribution. During the last four decades, considerable amount of work has been done pertaining to the above mentioned two tasks using a phenomenological grinding kinetics mathematical model derived from population balance considerations. This model is based on two sets of parameters: specific breakage rate and breakage distribution parameters for various size fractions of particles Herbst and Fuerstenau Incorporation of Eqs. This ‘energy-size reduction relationship’ predicts that for a given material and feed size distribution a necessary condition for identical product size distribution in different batch mills is identical specific energy inputs into each mill – independent of mill dimensions and mill operating variables in the normal operating range Besides the grinding rate of the coarser size fractions, the rate of production of the desired size fine product is also an equally important parameter for characterization of the mill performance. Let the weight fraction of material finer than size From Eq. As the main purpose of grinding operation is to produce fine particles of desired size and size distribution, a study of variations in the The technique commonly used for determination of the From this equation we obtain: Generally, the product obtained from the first test is ground sequentially several times and, in accordance with Eq. Gupta Gupta Further, a close examination of the published data on batch grinding of single size feeds showed that during the initial 0.5 Estimation of the values of grinding rate parameters and rate of production of fines was a straight forward job while analysing our own data as the test material was pre-ground in the ball mill and, therefore, both the sets of parameters exhibited only very small and systematic variation with grinding time. However, it became necessary to establish proper guidelines for obtaining most likely estimates of the desired parameters from the data of other investigators. Based on a comparative study of the results obtained by us for the crushed and pre-ground feed charges, it was decided to ignore the initial abnormal values and take the average value for the time interval during which the values were observed to be more or less constant. To illustrate the proposed methodology of estimation of the values of model parameters, two examples are presented in With a view to facilitating a direct visualization of the percentage change in the The Kim Fuerstenau Gupta Kim Results for the coarse size distribution regime are given in  For the fine size distribution regime, the trend of variation for the two Berlioz We carried out a detailed study on the effect of particle load and ball load on grinding kinetics by carrying out experiments at two different mill speeds (55% and 70% critical) and four levels of ball load (  At present, it is not possible to properly explain the different patterns of results obtained in the two studies. Though, there are small differences in the mill speed ( For 70% critical mill speed, Thus, a small ball load and a low mill speed are preferable from the point of view of variation in the specific energy consumption with particle load. However, in doing so one has to take in to account the mill production rate also. Reasonably high levels of ball load and mill speed are required to maintain a high production rate. Therefore, a practical compromise has to be made between the mill production rate and variation in the specific energy consumption with particle load due to changes in the feed rate and hardness of the feed solids. Several researchers   The effect of ball diameter on grinding kinetics has been studied by several researchers Malghan Siddique In view of the fact that Siddique used a mixture of balls of different size and mills of relatively bigger diameter, his results should be considered to be more relevant to the actual operating conditions. However, it is felt that the available data is not adequate for arriving at any definite conclusions. A 12.5 It has been demonstrated above that the basic assumptions made by Herbst and Fuerstenau An important result obtained is that the effect of any particular operating variable on the parameters, Further, the effect of any particular variable on the Attention needs to be drawn to the fact that no significant data is available in the literature on the wet mode of operation. In the mineral processing plants, most of the grinding is carried out in the wet mode. And, as shown above in Section It is proposed that the results presented in this paper should be verified through simulation of the ball mill grinding operation under different sets of operating conditions using the discrete element method Analysis of a large amount of batch ball mill grinding data available in the literature has shown that the values of the power specific absolute rate of grinding of the topmost size fraction, The effect of any particular operating variable on the Finally, as the purpose of grinding is to produce fine particles, it is recommended that the mill design and scale-up work should be based mainly on the
