The analytical steps of sample preparation have varying significance relative to their effect on the precision and accuracy of the results of the analysis. Comminution of sample materials is one of the most essential, yet the most error-prone steps in the course of all chemical laboratory analysis tasks. Comminution usually refers to the conversion of solid samples with large particles mostly into powdery constituent substances of smaller particle size. The term is also infrequently used in conjunction with operations designed to convert liquids into droplets or gases into bubbles, the details of which will not be discussed further. The aggregate state of the material to be homogenized does not undergo any change during these processes, whereas the physical and chemical characteristics of the sample may well change. When comminuting crystalline substances, triboluminescence – a special form of luminescence – may be observed, so that the process can be made evident by way of adding triboluminescent substances. The reasons for homogenizing sample material prior to performing the actual chemical/physical analysis are based on a great variety of requirements. The idea is usually to obtain a representative, i.e., evenly powdered sample for subsequent chemical/physical analysis. One of the problems encountered in sampling, especially in the field of ecological analysis, is the huge parent mass – anything between kilograms and tons – in the form of integral parts of a refuse dump, rock, debris of a specific stratum, etc. From this, a sample of only a few hundred milligrams may go into the measuring equipment for the actual analyses. In other words, the original sample is subjected to considerable decrease in bulk on its way to representing a proper analytical sample. It is important, however, to ensure that the make-up of this analytical sample represents the average chemical composition of the original sample. Another major problem frequently encountered, specifically in the trace and ultratrace domains of ecological analysis, is the risk of contamination and/or volatization of individual components. The risk of contamination is always present if the grinding elements themselves contain a high percentage of the substance to be determined (for example, iron and chromium in steel mills), or when certain readily volatilized combinations escape from the sample as a result of overheating. The comminution process to be used normally depends on the following parameters: Total quantity and number of samples of the material to be homogenized. Initial particle size of the original sample. Ultimate fineness of the sample after comminution. Chemical/physical properties of the original sample and of the grinding elements (contamination/volatization). Hardness of the material to be homogenized. There are three general comminution regimes: Coarse: grinding down to a particle size of ∼5 Fine: grinding down to a particle size of 63 Ultrafine: grinding down to a particle size of <63 The basic operation of dividing solids into fractions by application of mechanical forces results in an increase of surface area, the magnitude of which depends primarily on the particle size, as is demonstrated in The term particle (or grain) size refers to the structural make-up of such substances as granulates, powders, dusts, granular mixes, and suspensions. Knowledge of the particle size, in conjunction with the comminution process, determines such details as grinding efficiency and ultimate product fineness. To establish particle sizes and their distribution within powdered systems, the user can have recourse to a number of different measuring processes designed to indicate, with appropriate particle definition, details of the probable equivalent diameter of a particle. It follows that individual measuring methods depend upon particle definition. Particle definitions might include such details as number, length, surface area, mass, and volume, as a result of which one has the choice of using various counting methods – microscopy, image analyzers, laser diffraction, as well as sieving and air classification methods. The details of a particle-size analysis are presented in tabular and diagrammatic form covering quantitative mass fractions, and cumulative and/or frequency density as a function of the equivalent diameter. The following classification into millimeter ranges can be applied as a quantitative definition of particle/grain sizes: Giganto grained >300 Giant grained 30–300 Large grained 10–30 Coarse grained 3–10 Medium grained 1–3 Small grained 0.3–1 Fine grained 0.1–0.3 Dense grained 0.03–0.1 Microcrystalline 1–30 Cryptocrystalline 0.1–1 X-ray crystalline <0.1 An important factor governing the efficiency of any comminution process is the fracturing behavior of a sample.        Another important criterion for the quality of a comminution process is the subsequent homogeneity of the sample material, i.e., the distribution of the substance to be analyzed within the sample. A high degree of homogeneity may be obtained by blending the sample material, after comminution, in a suitable machine. This method counteracts the segregation tendencies of the sample material that result from variations in the distribution of particle sizes and is of particular importance whenever homogenized samples are bottled to serve as, for example, reference material (i.e., substances with a defined chemical composition) for quality control in chemical analysis. It must be ensured that each bottle of the total charge has exactly the same content (‘between-bottle homogeneity’) and that the contents of the single bottles represent the same average chemical composition (‘within-bottle homogeneity’). To this end the material is analyzed for the component, with an appropriate number of repeat analyses. Once it has been established that the standard deviation is within tolerable limits, the sample material can be looked upon as being homogeneous. Every comminution process involving solid surfaces in combination with kinetic energy input is likely to be accompanied by corresponding abrasion of the grinding assembly components. The resulting abrasive effect tends to increase grinding tool wear and to decrease tool life and grinding efficiency. More critically, the abrasion fines contaminate the sample stock during the grinding process. To minimize this risk of contamination, it is recommended practice to ensure that the abrasion resistance of the grinding assembly components is always higher than the hardness of the sample stock. Hardness refers to the resistance offered by a solid body, i.e., the sample (glass, ceramics, minerals, etc.), when exposed to mechanical stress loads. High hardness ratings are typical for minerals, some of which are therefore well suited for use in lubricants and grinding and polishing compounds. Friedrich Mohs, an Austrian mineralogist, compiled an empirical scale of scratch hardness ratings in 1812 that is still applicable and is used to determine the hardness of minerals (see The risk of contamination by individual process abrasives is particularly high in trace and ultratrace element analysis and is, therefore, primarily responsible for falsification of analytical results. Remembering that abrasion fines originating from grinding assembly components are always likely to contaminate sample material, the risk is best avoided by making sure that the component to be analyzed is not present in the grinding tools. The major components of individual grinding elements are listed in Grinding equipment used for comminution operations in chemical analysis varies in design and layout with application requirements, i.e., sample make-up, desired degree of particle size decrease, etc. The selection of the grinding kit to be used depends on the problem and the requirements with respect to the desired sample fineness and freedom from contamination. In view of the extremely wide range of grinding kits available on the market, it is best to concentrate on their major objectives. In general, the complexity of the enormous variety of comminution problems and requirements rules out any hope for a single, ideal comminution process. It happens quite frequently that processing of one sample involves the combined use of different grinding processes; for example, coarse grinding followed by fine grinding. Given the multitude of existing comminution processes, we shall discuss two coarse, two fine, and three ultrafine grinding methods. There are many cases where the initial particle size of the sample requires preliminary reduction. Classical machines for this purpose are jaw crushers, normally used with samples of medium to extreme hardness as well as brittle to hard-tenacious samples, and cutting mills, used with samples of soft and tough make-up. These are used to break up substances with medium to extreme hardness ratings as well as brittle to tough materials, such as bakelite, bauxite, concrete, dolomite, ores, feldspar, ferroalloys, granite, glass, limestone, gravel, coal, coke, corundum, synthetic resins, quartz, salts, slag, silicates, sintered products, and many other substances. Jaw crushers are normally upright floor models used for preliminary purposes in laboratories and at production plant level. They are designed for continuous operation and are therefore suitable for inclusion in fully automated and semiautomatic processing systems in production plants and laboratories. The efficiency and performance data (throughput rate, feed particle sizes, and ultimate fineness) of jaw crushers depend upon the disintegrating behavior and hardness rating of the material to be handled and on the size of the machine. These are designed to disintegrate bulky, soft, medium-hard, as well as fibrous and cellulosic materials, and are used in agricultural research institutes and the plastics and pulp industries. Cutting mills are suitable for use with foliage, fibers, floor covering material, feedstuff, spices and herbs, rubber, grasses, hay, hops, wood, cardboard, plastics, leather, malt, Indian corn, paper, straw, tobacco, peat, paste products, roots, and twigs. These are designed for rapid, efficient, and lossless fine-grinding of medium-hard, hard-brittle, as well as tough materials in dry and wet conditions. They are specifically suitable for use with such substances as soil samples, ores, coal, coke, corundum, metal oxides, minerals, dry plant samples, slag, silicates, cement, cement clinker. These are designed for work with soft, hard, and brittle materials with hardness ratings of up to 8.5 These are designed to comminute soft and fibrous, medium to extremely hard, and brittle materials such as ashes, bauxite, soil samples, chemicals, chamotte, fireclay, diamonds, drugs, fertilizers, enamels, earth, ores, coloring substances, rock and debris, glass, domestic and industrial waste, wood chippings, cocoa beans, sewage sludge, coal, coke, plant constituents, pigments, quartz, salts, sands, slag, silicates, cement, cement clinker, and sugar. Planetary ball mills incorporate a high-speed transmission system generating extreme centrifugal acceleration rates, thus providing for ultimate finenesses well into the submicrometer particle size range. A multitude of grinding tools made of a great variety of materials provides for the processing of trace analysis samples, often without contamination. These mills comminute and homogenize soft, fibrous, hard, and brittle substances in both dry and wet conditions. They are particularly suitable for processing basalt, building material, dolomite, earth, cereals, organic tissue samples, hair, cocoa, rubber, ceramics, bones, synthetic resins, alloys, minerals, plant constituents, salts, tablets, pills, peat, and wool. The terms cold grinding, freeze grinding, or cryogenic grinding refer to comminution methods employing mechanical and thermal energies to break down solids. This method is often the only means of obtaining sufficient comminution results with acceptable homogenizing efficiency, which is particularly important when handling materials with low melting points, high grease and/or moisture contents, as well as resilient or tough consistencies. The disintegrating behavior of substances with any such characteristics can be substantially improved by addition of carbon dioxide ‘ice’ or by embrittlement with liquid nitrogen. The use of direct or indirect cooling, in combination with mechanical comminution techniques, facilitates adequate processing of many types and grades of plastic, rubber, organic tissue, pharmaceutical products, spice, herbs, and food samples. The greatest care must be taken when handling coolants, especially liquid nitrogen, and the use of protective gloves, safety goggles, etc., in keeping with the safety instructions of grinding equipment manufacturers is most important. Laboratory staff are always exposed to risk when undertaking their duties, comminution procedures included. Manufacturers have made great efforts to make their equipment foolproof against handling errors: mills, for example, cannot be unloaded until the machine has come to a dead stop. Comminution of explosive materials represents a particularly high hazard and must, therefore, be left to qualified laboratory staff with special training in this area. Included in explosion hazard is the risk of dust explosions, always likely to be present in grinding operations involving high degrees of sample comminution.
