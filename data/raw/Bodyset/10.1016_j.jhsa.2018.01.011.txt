In spite of the more popular volar approach for plating of distal radius fractures (DRFs), there are still indications for dorsal plating and even combined dorsovolar plating in complex DRFs. Dorsal plating carries a concern for complications such as tenosynovitis, extensor tendon adhesions, and delayed extensor tendon ruptures. These risks can be minimized by use of modern low-profile plates and the use of an extensor retinaculum flap to cover the distal plate and screws. We describe the technique of the dorsal retinaculum flap for dorsal plating of DRFs.
