Infiltrated particle reinforced composites combine a dense matrix with particles that are in mutual contact and can therefore transfer compressive stress directly from one particle to the next. As a result, these composites may combine characteristics of the plasticity of their matrix with those of granular matter plasticity. We measure here the influence of a 200 MPa superimposed fluid hydrostatic pressure on the flow stress of high volume fraction (56–62 vol pct) particulate Al2O3
                     Al composites produced by infiltration and show that the yield response of such composites is indeed pressure-sensitive. A simple analysis that transposes to metal matrix composites the theory of fluid-saturated granular media mechanics explains the phenomenon quantitatively.In metals, and also in some ceramics, plastic shear is produced by the multiplication and motion of crystal dislocations, or by the nucleation and growth of twins. Deformation then preserves volume and yield is insensitive to hydrostatic stress. The simplest laws governing metal plasticity are the von Mises yield criterion, which corresponds in principal stress space to a circular cylinder having the bissectrix (i.e. the hydrostatic axis) as its axis, and the associated flow rule. Disordered or granular materials can also yield under stress to undergo permanent plastic deformation. In such materials, irreversible shear is caused by the relative sliding, along discrete surfaces, of elements making the solid in question: atoms in glasses, molecules in polymers, or particles in granular aggregates such as soil or packed powder. Here, relative sliding occurs along non-planar surfaces and hence does not preserve volume; yield is therefore pressure-sensitive in such materials. Granular media Consider now a composite combining both material types, namely a close-packed particle bed fully infiltrated with metal In work to date, the influence of superimposed pressure on yield, deformation and ductility in metals reinforced with ceramic particles has been investigated in metals reinforced with non-touching ceramic particles, using high-pressure testing rigs that immerse samples within a fluid-filled pressure vessel through which uniaxial stress can additionally be applied We explore here the deformation of such composite materials under high Composites of densely packed alumina particles embedded within a matrix of dense aluminium, Specifically, we employ a matrix of 99.99% pure Al and use two types of particulate reinforcement, namely (i) polygonal- and (ii) angular-shaped Al The reinforcement volume fraction, Since testing of the matrix-free particle beds under elevated hydrostatic pressure was not practical, composites with identical particulate reinforcements but with a highly compliant epoxy matrix were also made. The two-component epoxy that was used is named LME10435/LME10346 by its producer, Huntsman (Basel, Switzerland); it is mostly employed to produce aerospace composites. This resin was selected for its low mixed viscosity (which makes it easy to inject) and low tensile modulus (≈2 MPa) and also for its good bonding properties with alumina. Alumina-epoxy composite ingots were made by gas-driven pressure infiltration of ceramic preforms prepared similarly as were corresponding metal matrix composites. Before injection of the epoxy under vacuum, air was evacuated from the preforms placed in a crucible and vacuum was maintained for 3 h. The crucible assembly was then enclosed within an infiltration apparatus and argon pressurized to 5 MPa was injected, reaching peak pressure in approximately 5 min. Pressure was maintained overnight until complete polymerization of the epoxy matrix. The Al A summary of all composites produced for this study is presented in A dedicated apparatus was built to apply simultaneously a variable axial load and a controlled hydrostatic pressure to a test specimen enclosed and immersed in a fluid within a pressure chamber. During a test, the specimen gauge section is subjected to an axisymmetric triaxial stress state defined by (i) the axial stress (itself defined by both the fluid pressure and the uniaxial load applied outside the pressure vessel by a universal testing machine) and (ii) the lateral stress, uniformly equal to the negative of the fluid pressure (counting stress as positive when it is tensile). The pressure chamber is designed to withstand a maximum fluid pressure A vertical load-train is assembled within the pressure vessel, which is fixed on the static lower platen of the uniaxial testing apparatus frame and connected on its lower surface to the pipe linking the outlet of the pressurization unit to the chamber. A schematic of the force-train in the apparatus is shown in Load and strain are both measured by means of electrical resistance strain gauges (SGs) situated inside the pressure chamber. A high-pressure feed-through for electrical wires is employed to duct signals through the vessel walls (see The vessel has a feed-through for the piston, which passes through a custom-designed seal where it exits the vessel (see Electrical resistance strain gauges (SGs) with small measuring grids were used to fit within the limited space available inside the pressure chamber; several studies have indicated that the pressure sensitivity of commercial metal foil SGs is less than 1με/MPa The composites were either tested in ambient pressure or under a constant superimposed hydrostatic fluid pressure In what follows, the conventional form of invariants for axisymmetric compression triaxial testing is used to represent engineering macroscopic stress and strain, namely: Stress-strain curves for Composites Al-A61, Al-P62 and Al-P56 tested under elevated fluid pressure Volume changes during triaxial testing of the composites could be computed when T-rosette strain gauges were used. measured plastic volume changes are small for all Al-matrix composites tested in this study; values are of the same order as the scatter between similar measurements, this said, a tendency for the volume to increase slightly with plastic deformation can be discerned at there is evidence of the onset of dilation (if any is present) being delayed at high pressure for Composite Al-A61 (compare dashed blue and solid red curves in within the range of strain explored (less than 2.5%) and within the scatter of data, compressive deformation of Composites Al-P62 and Al-P56 occurs without measurable plastic volume change at atmospheric pressure, while there is a slight tendency for the composite volume to increase when it is deformed at Results of tests conducted with epoxy matrix composites at Hydrostatic pressure increases the composite flow stress: for all three composites, The observed tendency for volume to increase upon plastic deformation in the metal matrix composites at The influence of applied hydrostatic pressure on the flow stress of the present composites can have two complementary origins, namely (i) a reduced level of damage accumulation, or (ii) an increased contribution of the packed particle bed to the composite flow stress at high That damage is not the cause for the observed flow stress increment is shown by the observation that, when a composite is deformed under That damage is not the cause for the flow stress increment observed under elevated hydrostatic pressure is corroborated, for composites reinforced with the stronger polygonal particles, by the measured effect of hydrostatic pressure on deforming metal composite dilation, The increase in composite flow stress that is brought by superimposed fluid pressure is, thus, caused by an increased contribution of the particles to the load borne by the composite. This is easily rationalized as follows: since in the present composites ceramic particles are in mutual contact, friction between touching particles at their contact points will cause the composite to dissipate additional energy when it deforms under pressure, exactly as a dense granular aggregate does. This will in turn cause the composite flow stress to be raised when it is deformed under elevated hydrostatic pressure. In this light, two of the trends observed are easily rationalized: that the pressure-enhancement of the flow stress is greater when that the flow stress increase caused by the superimposed pressure increases with the extent of composite prior deformation is to be expected, since this behaviour is generally observed in granular materials The particle shape exerts, at equal Assume that, when the composite is deformed, the particles move in roughly similar manner, one with regard to the other, whatever the value of In Eq. Now, it is unlikely that the frictional contact law at the interparticle contact points is significantly altered in the metal matrix composite compared to the epoxy matrix composite, or compared to the dry particle bed. There is indeed no chemical interaction between Al In “poromechanics of fluid-saturated media”, as the field is often called, the role of a pore-filling fluid pressure on the deformation and strength of granular media (often unconsolidated rock, soil or sand) is taken into account by introducing an “effective stress law” which reduces the constitutive response of the porous elastic solid, saturated with a pressurized fluid and subjected to a given applied stress, to that of the same granular material subjected to an “effective” stress. The most general formulation of the effective stress Let us now assume that the constitutive law provided by Eq. With this assumption, the amount of applied hydrostatic stress shielded by the matrix can be quantified and the effect of particle-to-particle contacts on the increment in composite flow stress, In Eqs. Unlike the SC approximation, which yields an implicit expression of the effective bulk modulus For the epoxy matrix composites, using both models, the values of Comparing now the experimental flow stress curves with theoretical predictions from the present simple analysis (using again the average of measured composite stress-strain curves for all samples that were tested for each composite material at atmospheric pressure) shows that the agreement with data for the two composites containing ≈ 61% ceramic particles, Our simple analysis thus explains the data. Note also how little the predicted composite flow stress increment varies with the mean-field approximation (Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound or self-consistent) used. This suggests that, in practice, the simpler Hashin-Shtrikman equation should suffice to predict the composite flow stress increment brought by applied pressure knowing the packed particle bed behaviour - even though it might not be a precise predictor of the actual composite compressive modulus. We probe the mechanical response of high volume fraction (namely 56–62 vol pct) ceramic particle reinforced metal matrix composites under triaxial axisymmetric compressive stress to investigate whether particle interlocking and mutual friction raise the composite flow stress when high superimposed fluid pressure squeezes particles against one another. To this end, we have constructed and calibrated a fluid-immersion triaxial testing apparatus capable of withstanding a maximum fluid pressure of 200 MPa and have used it to test composites produced by infiltrating closely-packed Al An additional finding is that when a composite of this class is deformed under To link the flow properties of the composites with those of their packed particulate reinforcement, we have also tested composites that are similar to the infiltrated metal composites but have instead a matrix of epoxy. These show a greater flow stress increment, a fact that we explain using an analogy between the metal-infiltrated densely packed powder bed and a densely packed granular medium saturated with a pressurized fluid. The model shows good agreement with data, giving a simple predictive expression that quantifies the effect of superimposed pressure on the flow stress of composites reinforced with hard close-packed particles.
