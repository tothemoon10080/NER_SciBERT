A new method (gas-based separation plus melt separation) has been proposed to remove phosphorus of the high phosphorus iron ore which was 1.25% of phosphorus content and 50.0% of iron content. HSC chemistry package and the coexistence theory of slag structure were adopted for theoretical analysis. The gas-based reduction was carried out using a lixed bed reactor and the ore sample of 80 g with an average particle size of 2 mm were reduced using CO or H2 at temperature of 1073 K for 5 hours. 50 g of the reduced sample with 3.0% CaO as additive was then subjected to melt separation in an electric furnace at temperature of 1873 K under Ar atmosphere. In each run, SEM, EDS, optical microscopic examination and chemical analysis of the reduced ore sample, the metal sample and the slag sample were conducted. Results of all gas-based reduction experiments showed that iron metallization ratios were some 65% and the phosphorus compounds in the ore remained unchanged. It was agreed well with the simulations except for the iron metallization rate being less than predicted value; this difference was attributed to kinetics. Results of melt separation experiments showed that P content in metal samples is 0.33% (metal sample from H2 reduction product) and 0.27% (metal sample from CO reduction product). The phosphorus partition ratios of both cases were less than predicted values. Some P in the metal samples existed as slag inclusion was considered to be the reason for this discrepancy.
