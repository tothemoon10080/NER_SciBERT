ZnO thin films on (001) sapphire substrates have been deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique using a Nd:YAG laser with the wavelength of 355nm at an oxygen pressure of 350mTorr. In order to investigate the effect of the deposition conditions on the properties of ZnO thin films, the experiment has been performed at various substrate temperatures in the range of 200–700°C. According to XRD, (002) textured ZnO films of high crystalline quality have been obtained by pulsed laser deposition technique. However, the intensity of UV emission is mostly dependent upon the stoichiometry of ZnO films, rather than the crystalline quality.ZnO is a wide-bandgap II–VI semiconductor and might be a good candidate for an electroluminescence device like a UV laser diode. ZnO films also have potential applications for surface acoustic wave devices (SAW) The PLD technique has been used for the deposition of ZnO films. The chamber was evacuated by a turbomolecular pump to a base pressure of 1×10 XRD spectra of ZnO films deposited by PLD at the substrate temperatures of 200–700°C at the fixed 350 Electrical properties were measured by van der Pauw Hall measurements. The ZnO films grown under conditions of substrate temperature of 200–700°C at the fixed 350  Besides the UV emission, earlier work by Studeninkin et al.
