Abstract
                  A bi-component fluidized bed system of glass ballotini and beach sand ilmenite of d
                     50 values 124 and 179 Î¼m and particle densities of 2500 and 4500 kg/m3, respectively, was examined, with the concentration of ilmenite above 50%. The results were compared with Rowe and Nienow's empirical correlation for flotsam-rich systems to assess the potential difficulties in using existing correlations for the system examined. The empirical relationship between the mixing ratio and the normalized fluidizing velocity for this specific system was found to be a modified version of the existing correlation. It was also found that segregation also occurred within the jetsam component, with some fine jetsam particles behaving as flotsam whilst the jetsam at the bottom of the bed was coarser than the original sample.
