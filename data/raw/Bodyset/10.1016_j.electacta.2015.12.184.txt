Research efforts on the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolyzer would greatly benefit from the ability to quantify the dissipative processes that undesirably increase the cell’s applied potential, E
                     cell, which decreases its efficiency. To date, little is known about what impact further improvements to active surface area, extent of CuCl(aq) conversion and ohmic resistance would exactly have on the electrolyzer performance. To better understand how this electrolyzer can be improved, a model was developed to quantify and separate the effects of electrochemical kinetics, membrane transport and open circuit potential, E
                     OCP, on E
                     cell for a given current density. By employing data obtained from previous studies with electrochemical cells into the developed model, it was possible to calculate E
                     cell values that agreed with data collected from a lab scale electrolyzer using just one adjustable parameter, the Nernst diffusion layer at limiting current. The model was then used to identify the predicted E
                     cell contributions as a function of CuCl(aq) conversion, active electrode area and ohmic resistance. It was found that the extent of CuCl(aq) conversion can dramatically impact the electrolyzer electrode kinetics and E
                     OCP. More importantly, as CuCl(aq) conversion increased, the E
                     cell values needed consistently increased to keep the same current density. Overall, E
                     cell could be most readily reduced by improving R
                     ohm, whereas improvements to electrode kinetics have limited impacts.As the complexity of matching power production to power consumption increases, the pursuit of a viable energy storage solution that is capable of storing both thermal and electric energy will continue. One option for storing harnessed thermal and electric energy is the hybrid Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle to efficiently produce hydrogen Though research and development progress have made large strides in understanding this cycle In this work we present a model based on equilibrium thermodynamics and electrochemical kinetics to provide insight into trends expected of the open circuit potential values, membrane transport limitations, and electrode overpotentials for the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolyzer. The advantage of this model over other models is that it uses fundamental thermodynamic, kinetic and transport coefficients in non-equilibrium thermodynamic relations, making extrapolations more reliable. The model parameters were obtained through experimental methods using single cells where each coefficient can be isolated and conveniently quantified. As such, the parameters used in the model presented here provide an easy path to extending the applicability of this model into higher temperatures, pressures, concentrations, etc. With this model, for the first time, In the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolyzer, the positive electrode, or the anode when the cell is operating in electrolytic mode, oxidizes aqueous Cu The half-reaction occuring at the negative electrode, or the cathode when the cell is operating in electrolytic mode, is the hydrogen reaction: The two compartments where these reactions take place are separated by a proton conductive membrane, typically Nafion where the concentration of CuCl(aq) and CuCl To understand the electric power requirements needed to operate the electrolyzer, the cell current, The goal of this model was to simulate how The equilibrium potential contributions, In short, the CuCl(aq) complexes considered were Cu The next contribution considered from the positive electrode was Resulting in Some models use a simplified current density – overpotential, In an earlier study, a rotating disc electrode (RDE) was used to collect the information needed to quantify The approach to quantifying the potential contributions of the positive electrode was repeated for the negative electrode with some modifications. The equilibrium potential of the negative electrode was defined by the Nernst equation: Like the positive electrode, Now the potential contributions of the negative electrode can be simulated as a function of As the membrane used here has no equilibrium potential contributions, only non-equilibrium processes were considered. The potential losses from the cell due to Using the phenomenological equation relating, The expressions above can be converted into a system of equations relating For the system of equations, the first key relation is Equation 4 Relations and values for Now that relations between the electrochemical reaction fluxes and forces that require electric potential are defined, simulations of A lab scale electrolyzer with supporting systems developed and described previously was used to collect the polarization data to estimate the model parameter With Using the experimental points collected, the average The focus of this work is to use the system of equations presented in the earlier sections to determine the relative sensitivity of the The baseline case with a fixed value of Though most previous full cell studies focus on the starting concentrations, it is important to determine how As expected, the The trends of In the figure, it can be seen that the role of the electrochemical overpotential changes dramatically when This presents an interesting issue about the impact of available surface area on the significance of the overpotential contributions to A number of possibilities exist for the 110 m As can be seen from When considering the non-equilibrium processes, the previous case studies provide strong evidence that membrane transport has the significant influence on the performance of the electrolytic cells. As such, small changes in Despite that the changes to A model using principles of equilibrium thermodynamics as well as electrochemical kinetics was formulated for the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolyzer, which is a key component of the Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle to efficiently produce hydrogen. Equations relating the positive and negative electrode overpotentials to their respective reaction rates were used to represent the impact of electrochemical kinetics on cell performance. Linear relations using phenomenological coefficients were used to describe the impact of the potential losses due to the flux of charged species across the membrane. It was found that the presence of a Cu(aq) gradient decreased Case studies of hypothetical modifications to key parameters of the electrolytic cell were carried out to determine the order of significance for the potential contributions to The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of this work by
