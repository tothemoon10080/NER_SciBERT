Control of the concentrate quality is usually one of the main targets in the operation of mineral concentrator processes. Availability of the estimates of end product properties in advance – based on upstream process measurements – offers an opportunity to develop higher level control strategies for the unit processes. Here, the recursive PLS and adaptive neural network models are compared in the prediction of the concentrate grade at a gravity separation plant. The methods are applied in the Outokumpu Tornio Works Kemi Mine plant data. The chromite concentrate grade can be predicted relatively accurately based on the slurry properties measured in the grinding circuit. Accordingly, the predicted chromite grade decreases about 0.2 %-units when the slurry D50 passing size is increased by 10 %. This enables further development of the grinding control, especially the control of the slurry particle size, to meet the concentrate specifications.
