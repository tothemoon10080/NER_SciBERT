Using symbolic computation, we apply the Exp-function method to construct new kinds of solutions to the foam drainage equation. We demonstrate that the Exp-function method provides a powerful mathematical tool for solving nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.Considerable attention has been directed towards exact solutions including solitary solutions, periodic solutions and compacton-like solutions for nonlinear equations. Many new approaches with advantages, and disadvantages, have been suggested to solve various nonlinear equations. The variational iteration method The basic idea of the exp-function was proposed in J.H. Heâ€™s monograph Because of the everyday occurrence of foams, they are very well known to scientists as well as to common people We consider a general nonlinear partial differential equation as follows According to the Exp-function method We are intending to find a solitary wave solution of Using We can freely choose the values of Using If we set When As mentioned in the previous subsection the values of We consider the case We consider the case For the case In this study, we applied the Exp-function method to the foam drainage equation using symbolic computation to find new types of solutions including generalized solitary solutions and periodic solutions. The solution procedure is very simple, and the obtained solution is very concise. Furthermore, the method leads to both generalized solitary solution and periodic solutions.
