This paper reports investigation and characterization of selected Nigerian clays for Foundry Crucible production. Samples of Clay were obtained from two different sites, namely: Ipinsa in Akure Local Government area in Ondo State and Tsaragi in Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State. The chemical composition and the refractory properties of the samples were carried out. The specimens from the Clay sample were prepared using ASTM standard specification, they were subjected to selected refractory, physical, thermal and mechanical properties. The results obtained showed that the refractoriness of Tsaragi clay was 1600°C and that of Ipinsa clay was 1370°C. The overall results showed that both samples can be used for crucible production but it was discovered that samples from Tsaragi were found to be more suitable with reference to the value obtained in terms of Refractoriness, thermal conductivity (2.32 W/m/k) and cold crushing strength (7.5mPa) than Ipinsa sample, these values when compared with the standard specification as reported in literature, this can, therefore, be recommended for the production of foundry crucibles
