These two volumes are the Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Hydrometallurgy Division of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum held in Montreal in October 2002. The first conference on this topic was held in Brussels in 1977 and was entitled “Chloride Hydrometallurgy” followed by another in 1982 in Dallas, Texas and was entitled “Chloride Electrometallurgy”. The present conference is much larger in scope. It provides a theoretical and an engineering approach to topics such as lixiviant regeneration through pyrohydrolosis or (membrane) electrolysis, fluid bed and spray roaster, energy recovery, formation and handling of dioxins and furans, chlorination of sulphides, autoclave leaching of sulphide and oxide ores (laterites), solvent extraction, electrowinning in chloride solutions and molten salts, materials of construction, and recycling of a number of metal-containing waste material. Author and subject indexes are provided together with a historical introduction on the discovery of chlorine and a couple of excellent review papers. The two volumes contain a wealth of information that are not only useful to hydrometallurgists but to pyro- and electrometallurgists as well. Hence the title of the volume is quite appropriate. A large number of the authors are well known metallurgists with extensive experience, thus their contributions are certainly authoritative. A number of new and some old processes have been reported at this conference. For example:          There are also a number of new un-named processes: Recovery of high purity silver from AgCl by ammonia leaching followed by boiling to decompose the complex and precipitate pure AgCl crystals for reduction to metal (pp. 55–68). Heap leaching of cobaltic oxide ore with HCl followed by precipitation of cobalt hydroxide by MgO. Hydrochloric acid is then regenerated from the MgCl Electrowinning of zinc from molten chloride salt (pp. 615–628). Up-grading titanium slag by selective chlorination of the impurities in molten salts and their removal from the slag (pp. 449–462). In addition there is a number of useful basic studies on: Scale formation during leaching of laterite in HCl (pp. 373–388). Solubility of CaSO Physico-chemical data of metal ions and HCl in solutions (pp. 759–791). A few and minor typographical errors have been spotted: Re Editor Edgar Peek is with Falconbridge and editor Gus Van Weert is with the Consulting firm Oretome, both in Canada. The volumes are well produced and represent an important contribution to the literature of extractive metallurgy. They are an essential addition to the library. The editors and the organizing committee are to be congratulated for this fine effort.
