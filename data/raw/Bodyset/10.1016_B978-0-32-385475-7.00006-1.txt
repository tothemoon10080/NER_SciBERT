The foot can be divided into three segments: hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. The most concerning traumatic injuries to the hindfoot are calcaneus articular fractures that can lead to severe functional impairment. They are usually the consequences of falls directly on the heel of the foot. Isolated fractures of the midfoot bones are relatively rare, and most midfoot injuries involve midtarsal (Chopart) and tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joints that can dislocate with or without associated fractures. Most Chopart and Lisfranc injuries result from forced inversion or eversion of the foot. Their diagnosis requires a cautious evaluation of midfoot bones alignment. Forefoot injuries, especially of distal phalanges, are frequent and almost always due to direct blow. They are generally obvious on radiographs. In contrast, metatarsals fatigue fractures remain invisible for a long time, and their diagnosis may require follow-up radiographs or MR.Two primary fracture lines, sagittal and coronal Two secondary fracture lines around thalamus with tongue-type or depression-type fractures Assessment of articular collapse by the Boehler angle CT with volume rendering reformats Neck and body fractures = high energy trauma Fracture of the lateral process of the talus may mimic lateral ankle sprain Osteochondral injury of talar dome is frequent Two mechanisms of injury: foot inversion and eversion Bony flakes represent ligament avulsions in keeping with Chopart sprains Alignment of the medial aspects of C2 and M2 Alignment of the dorsal aspects of C2 and M2 C1-M2 gap < 2 mm Mechanism of injury: axial compression along metatarsals with dorsal dislocation of M2 Absence of M1-M2 intermetatarsal ligament with inherent instability Signs of injury: abnormal alignment of C2-M2 and increase in C1-M2 gap “Fleck sign”: avulsion of C1-M2 ligament Fracture of the base of metatarsals: associated Lisfranc injuries Fracture of the base of M5: avulsion, Jones Subtle periosteal reaction: fatigue fracture Usually injuries from direct blow Fatigue fractures are long non-visible on radiographs, are only present subtle periosteal reaction Fracture of the base of metatarsals: potential associated Lisfranc injury Specific injuries to the fifth metatarsal: Jones fracture, peroneal brevis avulsion Introduction Anatomy Imaging Fractures of the calcaneus Anatomy Subtalar joint Radiological anatomy Boehler angle Articular fractures Extraarticular fractures Stress fractures Fractures of the talus Anatomy of the talus Os trigonum Fractures of talar neck Fractures of talar body Osteochondral lesions of the talus Fractures of lateral process Fractures of talar head Fractures of the posterior process Stress fractures of the talus Peritalar and subtalar dislocations Midfoot injuries Anatomy Chopart joint injuries Navicular fractures Cuboid and cuneiform bone fractures Tarsometatarsal joint (Lisfranc) injuries Forefoot injuries Fracture of the first and central metatarsals (M1-4) Fracture of the fifth metatarsal (M5) Stress fractures of the metatarsals Fractures of the toes Dislocation of the metatarsophalangeal joints and turf toes References The foot can be divided into three segments: hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. The most concerning traumatic injuries to the hindfoot are calcaneus articular fractures that can lead to severe functional impairment. They are usually the consequences of fall with reception directly on the heel of the foot. Isolated fractures of the midfoot bones are relatively rare, and most midfoot injuries involve intermetatarsal (Chopart) and tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joints that can dislocate with or without associated fractures. Their diagnosis requires a cautious evaluation of midfoot bones alignment. Forefoot injuries, especially of distal phalanges, are frequent and generally evident on radiographs. In contrast, metatarsals fatigue fractures remain invisible for a long time, and their diagnosis may require repeated follow-up, ultrasound or MR. The foot is composed of 26 bones ( tarsus (7): talus, calcaneus, navicular, cuneiforms (medial or C1, middle or C2, lateral or C3) and cuboid metatarsus: metatarsals (M) (5) phalanges (14) The foot is usually subdivided into: hindfoot: calcaneus and talus midfoot: navicular, cuneiforms (lateral, middle, medial) and cuboid forefoot: metatarsals and phalanges The hindfoot connects the foot to the leg and transmits the weight load. The midfoot forms the two arches of the foot (transverse and longitudinal) thanks to the trapezoidal shape of the bones. Radiographs remain the first-line imaging modality in the evaluation of the traumatic foot The hindfoot is usually explored with the standard ankle views set (AP and lateral). A dedicated view can be added: the retrocalcaneal view, performed with an oblique beam, that reproduces a coronal CT reformat. The analysis of the midfoot and forefoot required dedicated views ( AP view of the foot: the patient lies on the back, with the knee flexed and the sole of the foot placed against the table oblique view: obtained the foot slightly pronated (about 30–40°) lateral view: with a beam perpendicular to the third metatarsal If available, weight-bearing AP and lateral views are particularly useful, as they sensibilize the detection of subtle malalignments CT best evaluates hindfoot and midfoot fractures, in which multiplanar and volume rendering reformats allow an easier and faster assessment of the type and extent of the injury MR is the preferred modality to detect occult or stress fractures or ligamentous injuries The calcaneus is the most frequently fractured tarsal bone (60%) and calcaneal fractures represent about 2% of all fractures [ They affect young adults in a high-energy motor vehicle crash or fall from a height. They are frequently associated with spine fractures (10%) and other extremity injuries (26%) Most fractures of the calcaneus are intraarticular and affect the subtalar joint at the level of the posterior facet (60%–75%). The calcaneus is the larger bone of the foot. Remarkable structures are ( calcaneal tuberosity: the posterior half of the bone that forms the relief of the heel sustentaculum tali: a horizontal eminence on the medial aspect of the calcaneus, it bears the middle articular facet that articulates with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus anterior process of the calcaneus: presents a facet for the navicular and the anterior facet of the subtalar joint peroneal eminence (or calcaneal tubercle) on the lateral side posterior facet, also called thalamus, that receives most of the load of the body weight transmitted by the talus The calcaneus resistance to load is ensured by the particular distribution of its bony trabeculae. The repartition of tensile and compressive trabeculae leaves a “force-neutral triangle” under the level of the crucial angle of Gissane, which is an area more vulnerable to compression and shear injuries ( The subtalar joint may be defined from a functional point of view as an osteoligamentous complex formed by the talus, the calcaneus and the navicular firmly tied together by ligaments The subtalar joint is divided into three portions: ( anterior part: the talocalcaneonavicular (TCN) joint (also called coxa pedis) that connects: the distal head of the talus with the navicular the corresponding anterior and middle facets of the talus and calcaneus (the middle being supported by the sustentaculum tali) posterior part: the talocalcaneal joint that connects the posterior facets of the talus and calcaneus (thalamus) middle part: separated by a conical interosseous tunnel consisting of the canalis and sinus tarsi where lies the strong interosseous talocalcaneal ligament The interosseous talocalcaneal ligament is the main ligament of the subtalar joint. It runs across the sinus tarsi and strongly binds the talus and calcaneus The TCN joint is mostly stabilized by the spring ligament (plantar calcaneonavicular ligament) that forms a hammock for the talar head Radiological appearance of the most remarkable structures of the calcaneus is illustrated in Besides those anatomical landmarks, some angles and soft tissue appearance can be assessed on radiographs The Boehler angle reflects the position of the posterior facet relative to the level of the calcaneal body ( It represents the intersection of two lines on a lateral radiograph: line 1 between: the most cephalic part of the tuberosity of the calcaneus the highest point of the posterior facet (thalamus) line 2 between: the highest point of the posterior facet (thalamus) the highest point of the calcaneus that forms the articular surface for the cuboid bone The Boehler angle reflects the prominence of the posterior facet relative to the body of the calcaneus. In normal conditions, the Boehler angle ranges from 20 to 40°. An angle lower than 20° reveals a calcaneal articular fracture: the angle is flattened as the vertex of the angle (the highest point of the thalamus) is impacted into the calcaneal body. The crucial angle of Gissane evaluates the slope of the posterior facet ( It represents the intersection of two lines on a lateral radiograph: line 1: from the lowest to the highest point of the posterior facet line 2: from the lowest point of the posterior facet to the upper aspect of the anterior process The normal values of the Gissane angle are highly variable, and ranges from 120 to 140°. On a lateral view of the foot, an angle of Gissane over 140° indicates a depression of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint Kager fat pad (or Kager triangle or precalcaneal fat pad) is a triangular fat-containing space delimited by the flexor muscles, the Achilles tendon and the superior aspect of the calcaneus ( In normal conditions, the triangle appears radiolucent, of a fatty density and well-defined on radiographs. Hematoma from fractures affecting the superior calcaneal cortical can blur the triangle normal margins and increase its density ( Articular fractures are fractures that involve the posterior articular facet of the calcaneus (thalamus). They represent approximately two-thirds of all calcaneal fractures Articular fractures result from a forced downward motion of the talus into the calcaneus [ Two primary fractures lines irradiate from the crucial angle ( A A About those lines: the sagittal and coronal extent of the lines depends on the amplitude of injury. only one of the two primary lines can be present in the cases of minor trauma. The sagittal fracture line divides the calcaneus into The anteromedial fragment consists of: the anterior and middle facets the sustentaculum variable part of the thalamus The posterolateral fragment comprises: the calcaneal tuberosity the lateral wall variable part of the thalamus The anteromedial fragment is considered as the “constant fragment”, it keeps its relationship with the talus thanks to the interosseous and deltoid ligaments. The posterolateral fragment can displace laterally and proximally due to the pull of the Achilles tendon. In addition, both fragments can be splitted by the coronal primary fracture. If the load is not dissipated into the primary fractures, the talus keeps its motion into the posterolateral fragment and drives the remaining part of the thalamus into the calcaneal body. Two secondary fracture lines can then be seen ( depression-type: the fracture runs under the thalamus and exits at its posterior aspect tongue-type: the fracture starts at the anterior aspect of the thalamus and propagates into the calcaneal tuberosity Several classifications of calcaneal fractures have been proposed. The Sanders classification is a CT-based classification, defining the fracture pattern (number of lines and their location) of the posterior facet as seen on coronal CT reformats ( The classification combines: the numbers of fracture lines: type 1 : nondisplaced fractures type 2 : two-part fractures type 3 : three-part fractures type 4 : highly comminuted fractures with four or more fragments their location: a: lateral aspect of the posterior facet b: central aspect of the posterior facet c: medial aspect of the posterior facet Calcaneal fractures can be first assessed using radiographs with the routine ankle set (AP and lateral views). A dedicated calcaneal view called the retrocalcaneal view can be added; this view reproduces a coronal view of the posterior facet ( Nevertheless, CT is the imaging modality of choice, notably because multiplanar and volume rendering reformats allow an easier and faster assessment of the type and extent of the injury [ Extraarticular fractures include all fractures that do not involve the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. They represent 30% of all calcaneal fractures, the anterior process fractures being involved in 10–15% of the cases Three types of extraarticular fractures can be recognized type A: anterior process of the calcaneus type B: middle calcaneus (sustentaculum tali) type C: posterior calcaneus (posterior tuberosity and tubercle) Fractures of the anterior process of the calcaneus almost exclusively result from an excessive motion within the Chopart joint: avulsion fracture from the bifurcate ligament during a foot forced inversion and plantarflexion injury impaction fracture of the calcaneocuboid joint articular surfaces during forced abduction Fractures of the upper aspect of the calcaneal tuberosity are the consequences of a sudden pull by the Achille tendon (rapid dorsiflexion). Two forms can be seen ( an open beak-type fracture, with a horizontal fracture line that irradiates proximally up to the thalamus an avulsion fracture that pulls the entire Achilles tendon from its insertion The displaced fragment can severely damage the surrounding skin, any breach realizing an open fracture. Fractures of the posterior processes are generally undisplaced fractures resulting from a direct impact to the posterior aspect of the heel ( Calcaneal stress fractures are the second most common tarsal stress injuries (after the navicular) Radiographs can remain normal for several weeks, and then show either a diffuse area of increased density or a distinct sclerotic line ( On MR, stress fracture is classically seen as a hypointense line within a diffuse surrounding edema The talus is the second most commonly fractured tarsal bone after the calcaneus, but fractures of the talus remain relatively uncommon According to the AO classification, talus fractures are divided into three types type A: avulsion, process or head fractures type B: neck fractures type C: body fractures The talus is a truncated cone, wider anteriorly than posteriorly, without direct muscle attachment. The bone is divided into three parts: body, neck and head [ It has two remarkable processes ( the lateral process, a triangular-shaped prominence vulnerable to fracture the posterior process, subdivided into posterolateral and posteromedial tubercles The talus presents several articular surfaces: superior: the trochlea (or dome) of the talus that articulates with the distal tibia and supports the body weight lateral: that articulates with the fibula (lateral malleolus) inferoposterior: a posterior facet that articulates with the thalamus of the calcaneum inferoanterior: two facets for articulation with the calcaneus anterior and middle facets anterior: at the level of the talar head, to articulate with the navicular bone The os trigonum is a large accessory bone located posterior to the lateral tubercle of the posterior process ( It has to be differentiated from the Stieda process, which is an elongated variant of the posterolateral tubercle of the talus. The neck is the weakest portion of the talus and fractures of the talar neck represent 50% of talar fractures [ Fractures of the talar neck are usually the result of a forced dorsiflexion of the foot and injuries occur sequentially fracture of the talar neck forward dislocation of the calcaneus with the rest of the foot medial (or lateral) foot dislocation if there is a concomitant inversion (or eversion) is present The most widely used classification of talar neck fractures was described by Hawkins ( type 1: nondisplaced fracture of the talar neck type 2: fracture with associated dislocation of the talocalcaneal (subtalar) joint type 3: fracture with associated dislocation of subtalar and talocrural joints type 4: associated talonavicular dislocation Fractures of the talar body are high-energy injuries (motor vehicle collisions and falls from a height), resulting from an axial compression of the talus between the tibial pilon and the calcaneus [ Fractures are usually classified upon the AO system ( type 1: fracture of the talar body in any plane (transverse, sagittal, coronal) type 2: fracture of the talar processes type 3: compression (impaction) fractures Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) are injuries of the talus articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone [ Traumatic OLT happen in approximately 50% of ankle sprains and 70% of ankle fractures [ On radiographs, displaced fracture fragments are typically identified by a “fleck sign” as they look like chips of bone torn off from the talus Undisplaced OLT can be overlooked on initial radiographs, and the presence of OLT should be suspected in all ankle sprains that do not significantly improve over 4 to 6 weeks’ time. Radiographs can be repeated, but CT and MR are more sensitive to diagnose subtle OLT ( Osteochondritis dissecans (OD) is a focal, idiopathic lesion of the cartilage and subchondral bone classified with the group of osteochondrosis [ On radiographs, OD can be identified as a round-shaped or oval-shaped fragment outlined by a radiolucent fibrocartilage The particular anatomy of the lateral process makes it prone to fracture. Fractures of the lateral process of the talus can be easily overlooked as it is often misdiagnosed as a lateral ankle sprain [ The mechanism of injury is thought to be a combination of dorsiflexion, axial load and ankle inversion where the pression of the fibula leads to fracture When using radiographs, the AP view is most suited to detect the fracture, as the lateral process lies just beneath the tip of the fibula and its contour can be assessed Fractures of the head of the talus are very uncommon injury ( compression applied through the navicular bone during an adduction of the forefoot avulsion of talonavicular ligaments during an abduction of the forefoot. Fractures of the posterior process (or Shepherd fractures) are rare injuries and involve almost exclusively the lateral tubercle They may occur as a result of: avulsion via the posterior talofibular ligament direct compression between the calcaneus and the posterior tibia with the ankle in extreme equinus ("nutcracker" mechanism) ( Stress fractures of the talus are rare but serious injuries, they are considered as “high-risk” stress fractures and require specific intensive management Peritalar dislocations (PTD) are simultaneous dislocation of the subtalar (ST) and the talonavicular (TN) joints with an intact calcaneocuboidal joint (CC), while the combined dislocation of both TN and CC joints is called a Chopart transverse dislocation [ PTD are rare, they represent approximately 1% of all dislocations and occur during high-energy trauma PTD can be either medial (the head of the talus being lateral to the navicular) or lateral ( The midfoot is the portion of the foot between the Chopart and the Lisfranc joints ( The Chopart (or transverse tarsal or midtarsal) joint unites: the head of the talus with the navicular (talocalcaneonavicular or talonavicular joint) the calcaneum with the cuboid (calcaneocuboid joint) The Lisfranc (or tarsometatarsal) joint unites: the cuneiforms bone with the base of M1 to M3 the cuboid with the base of M4 and M5 Two anatomical and functional columns can be individualized: the medial column with the navicular as the medial keystone the lateral column with the cuboid as the lateral keystone As for the ankle, Ottawa rules are guidelines to select patients with traumatic midfoot pain in which radiographs are required Radiographs are indicated if patients have any of the following: point tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal point tenderness at the navicular inability to weight bear (four steps) immediately after the injury and in the emergency department A correct alignment (no step-off) should be assessed by evaluating the position of the metatarsals relative to the corresponding the tarsal bones. The C2–M2 alignment should be particularly checked, as a lateral step-off at the medial margin of M2 is a reliable finding of Lisfranc joint injuries The normal relationships that should be respected are ( on the AP view alignment of the medial aspects of the base of M2 and C2, and of the base of M3 with C3 alignment of the lateral aspects of M1 and C1 gap between the medial aspect of the base of M2 and the lateral aspect of C1 less than 2 mm on the oblique view alignment of the lateral aspect of M2 and C2, and of M3 and C3 alignment of M4 and M5 and the cuboid on the lateral view alignment of the dorsal aspects of C2 and M2 plantar projection of the inferior aspect of the base of M5 relative to the base of M1 The Chopart joint (also called transverse talar or midtarsal joint) consists in the talocalcaneonavicular (or talonavicular or coxa pedis) (TCN) and the calcaneocuboid (CC) joints ( The TCN is stabilized by: the dorsal talonavicular ligament the spring ligament the bifurcate ligament by its calcaneonavicular component (lateral calcaneonavicular ligament) The CC is stabilized by: the dorsal calcaneocuboid ligament the bifurcate ligament by its calcaneocuboid component (medial calcaneocuboid ligament) the short and long plantar ligaments The bifurcate ligament is a V-shaped ligament that arises from the anterior process of the calcaneus, and reaches by two different bundles the dorsal aspects of the cuboid and navicular. Most of fractures of the anterior process are in reality proximal avulsion of the bifurcate ligament in the setting of a complex Chopart joint injury Chopart joint injuries are secondary to forced foot inversion (e.g. sprain with high-heeled shoes) or, less commonly, eversion with some degree of plantar flexion ( In inversion injuries, the lateral side of the Chopart joint is distracted and the medial side is impacted, and vice versa in eversion injuries. Distraction leads to ligament tear or bony avulsion (notably of the calcaneus anterior process). Impaction leads to fractures by a “nutcracker" mechanism ( Findings of inversion injuries are ( avulsion of the bifurcate ligament from the calcaneal anterior process avulsion of the dorsal calcaneocuboid ligament avulsion of the dorsal talonavicular ligament (if plantarflexion is associated) impaction injury of the navicular (fracture) Findings of eversion injuries are ( avulsion fractures of the navicular tuberosity impaction injury of the cuboid ("nutcracker" mechanism) avulsion of the dorsal talonavicular (if plantarflexion is associated) Acute navicular fractures are classified into three types avulsion fractures, associated to a more diffuse Chopart injury (50% of the cases) body fractures fractures of the navicular tuberosity Body fractures are caused by nutcracker injuries of the navicular stuck between the talus and cuneiforms in high-energy trauma with forced foot eversion or axial loading ( Fractures of the navicular tuberosity result from forced acute eversion of the foot, with strain of the posterior tibial tendon and the deltoid ligament insertion ( As the talus, fatigue fractures of the navicular are rare but serious injury, they are considered as “high risk” fatigue fractures and require specific intensive management The accessory navicular bone is an accessory bone of the posteromedial aspect of the navicular bone, at the level of the navicular tuberosity Three types are distinguished ( type 1: sesamoid bone in the distal posterior tibialis tendon type 2: triangular or heart-shaped ossicle connected to the navicular tuberosity by a layer of fibrocartilage type 3: enlarged navicular tuberosity called cornuate navicular bone (fused type 2 accessory bone) Type 2 accessory navicular bone can simulate an avulsion of the navicular tuberosity Injuries to the cuboid and cuneiforms are rare, and generally associated with other midfoot injuries ( The os peroneum is a very common accessory bone of the lateral aspect of the foot that should not be mistaken for an avulsion fracture The articulations between the tarsus and the metatarsals (tarsometatarsal joint, TMTJ), also called Lisfranc joint, are organized in three columns ( medial: medial cuneiform (C1) with the first metatarsal (M1) central: middle (C2) and lateral (C3) cuneiforms with M2 and M3 lateral: cuboid with M4 and M5 The 2° TMTJ, between the base of M2 and C2, is the main stabilizer of the complex because of: a mortise configuration with the 2° TMTJ joint proximally recessed relative to the other TMT articulations, providing resistance to medial or lateral shear forces the trapezoidal shape of the metatarsal bases and corresponding cuneiforms forming a roman arch with the 2° TMTJ as keystone, providing stability in the coronal plane TMTJ stability is improved by a strong network of ligaments between cuneiforms and metatarsals, but there is no intermetatarsal ligament between M1 and M2 ( This absence of M1–M2 ligament seems to be a remnant from the time the human foot evolved into bipedal gait, with the initially abducted M1 becoming parallel to M2. The stability between the medial and the central columns is instead ensured by the “Lisfranc ligament” obliquely running from C1 to the base of M2 (C1–M2 ligament) [ The Lisfranc ligament has three bundles ( plantar, extending to the base of M2 and M3 interosseous, the strongest bundle dorsal The anatomic configuration of the TMT complex provides a strong resistance to shearing forces, but only poor protection to axial compression. Any load longitudinally applied to M2 tends to dorsally separate the M2 base from C2 [ The most common circumstance of injury is, therefore, an axial compression applied to a plantar-flexed and rotated foot, such as during a misstepping on stair, or a fall by one player on the heel of another player ( Lisfranc dissociations are classified as ( homolateral disruption (lateral translation) of all rays poartial disruption (of the first ray only or of other rays) divergent disruption with an opposed translation of the first and the other rays The key finding of Lisfranc joint injury is the malalignment of the 2° TMTJ ( lateral displacement of M2 base with a step-off along the medial margins of M2 and C2 gap over 2 mm between M1 and M2 bases dorsal step-off of M2 relative to C2 on the lateral view Fractures are present in approximately 90% of the cases, as ( avulsion fractures of the base of M1 or C2, forming the “fleck-sign”, pathognomic for a Lisfranc injury displaced fractures of metatarsal bases Fractures of M1 can be isolated but fractures of M2- are usually contiguous fractures ( M1-4 fractures can, therefore, be associated with injuries to the Lisfranc joint: any fracture of the bases of M1-4 should raise the suspicion of a concomitant midtarsal injury ( Fractures of M5 are by far the most common metatarsal fractures M5 fractures are separated into two groups: base fractures and distal spiral fractures (dancer’s fractures). Proximal M5 fractures are divided upon the location of the fracture line ( zone 1 (over 90% of cases): avulsion fracture of the peroneus brevis insertion during sudden inversion of the hindfoot zone 2: called “Jones fractures”, caused by adduction of the forefoot with fracture of the metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction and potential extension to the other adjacent metatarsals zone 3: proximal diaphyseal stress fractures A secondary ossification center (apophysis) is present within the peroneus brevis tendon insertion site on the lateral aspect of the base of M5 Repetitive microtrauma from the peroneus brevis tendon can induce a painful traction apophysitis (Iselin’s disease) M5 fractures not caused by a direct blow have been termed “dancer’s” fractures. The usual pattern is a spiral, oblique fracture of the shaft progressing from distal-lateral to proximal-medial ( Metatarsal stress fractures affect preferentially the diaphysis or the base of M2 (50%) and M3 (35%) [ Initial radiographs may be normal or demonstrate a subtle periosteal reaction ( Proximal stress fractures of M5 are injuries almost exclusively encountered in elite athletes (notably ballet dancers) and result from inversion-related muscular fatigue with loss of normal coordination [ Stress fractures of M5 typically involve the proximal metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction ( Freiberg disease is a form of osteochondrosis of the metatarsal heads, whom origins remain controversial (vascular compromise, repetitive microtrauma, etc.) Digital fractures are the most common forefoot injuries and often they are underappreciated. Stubbing injury is the most common cause of toe injury (up to 75%) Fractures can be classified as ( type A: extra-articular and simple diaphyseal fractures type B: partial articular and diaphyseal wedge fractures type C: complex articular or diaphyseal shaft fractures Dislocations of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints are uncommon. Most affect the first ray during a forced dorsiflexion of the toe, with a posterior displacement of the distal fragment. ( “Turf toe” defines a dorsiflexion-induced sprain or tear of the MTP1 plantar plate capsuloligamentous complex
