A low-cost green and reproducible microbes (Lactobacillus sp. and Sachharomyces cerevisae) mediated biosynthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles is reported. The synthesis is performed akin to room temperature in the laboratory ambience. X-ray and transmission electron microscopy analyses are performed to ascertain the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles. Individual nanoparticles as well as a few aggregate having the size of 8â€“35nm are found. Concentric Scherrer rings in the selected area electron diffraction pattern indicated that the nanoparticles are having all possible orientations. A possible involved mechanism for the biosynthesis of nano-TiO2 has also been proposed in which pH as well as partial pressure of gaseous hydrogen (rH2) or redox potential of the culture solution seems to play an important role in the process.Materials with nano-sized dimensions have attracted considerable attention of the researchers due to their exponential promises in almost all walks of life. Biological entities and inorganic materials have been in constant touch with each ever since inception of life on this planet. Due to this regular interaction, life could sustain on this planet with a well organized deposit of minerals. Titania (TiO A simple yet highly adaptable molecular organization of microbes have gifted them a unique status in continuum of life. They have touched every walk of our lives whether a prokaryote or eukaryote. In the present effort,  Yeast cells were allowed to grow as suspension culture in presence of suitable carbon and nitrogen source for 36 The formation of TiO   For For Yeast:  The membrane bound (as well as cytosolic) oxidoreductases and quinones might have played an important role in the process. The oxidoreductases are pH sensitive and work in alternative manner. At a lower value of pH, oxidase gets activated while a higher pH value activates the reductase The present biosynthetic method is truly a green cost-effective approach, capable of producing TiO
