Based upon elastic ground beam theory and structural dynamics theory, a dynamic simplified model for anchor rod(cable) frame ground beam under horizontal seismic load is built and verified with a project example using large-scale finite element software ANSYS. The results of the study show that this model is reasonable and time-saving in calculation. The bending moment of the bottom section of the ground beam is considerably larger than that of the top section but its amplitude fluctuation is small. The amplitude fluctuation of the bending moment of the ground beam increases with the distance away from the beam bottom.
