Ca–Cu chemical looping (CaL-CLC), consisting of calcination (regeneration), carbonation, and oxidation stages, is a novel process with high potential for CO2 capture. Its implementation is largely dependent on the effective matching, transferring and utilisation of the heat generated by CuO reduction, for CaCO3 decomposition, where the former is an exothermic and the latter an endothermic reaction. To better understand the calcination behaviour during CaL-CLC cycles, we developed a mathematical model coupling chemical reactions, mass and heat transfer inside a spherical particle composed of a number of uniformly distributed CuO and CaCO3 grains. Using the model, we simulated the dynamics of CuO and CaCO3 conversion, the profiles of temperature and gas concentrations, and the changes in porosity and the grain size inside the particle with time. Furthermore, the influence of several key variables on calcination behaviour within the spherical particle was numerically analysed. Results show that it is better to have an ambient temperature in the range of 1198–1223K, a similar value of the initial particle temperature, and a small CaCO3 grain size to attain a good match between reactions of CuO and CaCO3, and to avoid the onset of local superheating within the particle.CH CO equilibrium CO concentration of gas ‘ initial concentration of gas ‘ concentration of gas ‘ concentration of gas ‘ specific heat of gas mixture (J/(kg specific heat of solid within particle (J/(kg effective diffusivity of gas ‘ Knudsen diffusion coefficient of gas ‘ molecular diffusion coefficient of gas ‘ volume fraction of solid ‘ initial volume fraction of solid ‘ gas constant J/(mol external heat transfer coefficient (W/(m external mass transfer coefficient of gas ‘ reaction rate constant of CuO reduction (m reaction rate constant of CaCO molecular weight of gas ‘ molecular weight of gas ‘ Nusselt number reaction order of the reduction of CuO with CH total pressure (Pa) Prandtl number production rate of gas ‘ rate of CuO reduction (mol/(m rate of CaCO initial grain radius of solid ‘ grain radius of solid ‘ grain radius of unreacted solid ‘ initial grain radius of CuO (m) grain radius of unreacted CuO, m initial grain radius of CaCO grain radius of unreacted CaCO radial coordinate (m) initial radius of the particle (m) Reynolds number initial specific surface area of CuO (m initial specific surface area of CaCO initial specific surface area of solid reactant ‘ specific surface area of the solid (m Schmidt number Sherwood number time (s) temperature (K) initial particle temperature (K) temperature in the reactor (K) temperature of the particle surface (K) molar volume of CuO (m molar volume of CaCO molar volume of solid product (m molar volume of solid reactant (m conversion of solid reactant ‘ molar fraction of gas ‘ volume ratio for solid product to reactant initial particle porosity particle porosity thermal conductivity of the gas mixture (W/(m thermal conductivity of gas ‘ effective thermal conductivity within the particle (W/(m thermal conductivity of the solid within the particle (W/(m thermal conductivity of solid ‘ heat of CuO reduction (J/mol) heat of CaCO dynamic viscosity of gas ‘ dynamic viscosity of gas ‘ density of gas mixture (kg/m density of solid within the particle (kg/m diffusion volume for molecule ‘ The increasing concentration of CO Due to the favourable potential for CO Since the proposal of CaL-CLC, a limited number of studies has been carried out on its design for industrial application and the fabrication of Ca/Cu-based composites.

Usually, the optimum porosity is a compromise between crushing strength (maintaining low attrition rates) and reactivity (avoiding as much as possible the diffusion resistance inside the particles) The particle size significantly affects reaction rate, and mass and heat transfer inside the particle. This section investigated the particle radius, ranging from 0.5 Gas–solid reactions are well known to occur on the surface of solid reactants, and in turn, the grain size (specific surface area) is expected to be a critical parameter. Moreover, the size of grains affects the reaction process, i.e., the conversions and temperature profiles over time. In this section, the influence of grain size on calcination behaviour in the regeneration stage of the CaL-CLC system was investigated by separately varying the grain radius of CuO and CaCO The results in A mathematical model, taking into account chemical reactions, and mass and heat transfer in a spherical particle with uniformly-distributed CuO and CaCO The composite particle model developed could be a useful tool in understanding the effect of particle parameters and operating conditions of the calciner on the kinetics and heat transfer process within the particle, which largely determine the efficiency of CaL-CLC. Then, the optimum particle parameters and the operating conditions of the calciner could be determined. The authors are grateful to the financial supports from
