Development of automatic control systems of flotation process remains rather promising way of increasing effectiveness of ore concentration process. Without ore averaging systems flotation process is characterized by considerable fluctuations of all input, output and intermediate parameters. According to estimates, instability and nonoptimised parameters of flotation owe 3% to 6% of valuable component losses. Stabilising the main technological parameters allows increasing effectiveness of flotation process. One more way is optimizing the process, providing for determination and maintaining optimal parameters of the process.
                  The main reason of flotation process fluctuations is mixing ores of various properties from various sections of a deposit. Other, also important reasons are changes in parameters of facilities of technological cycle, as well as properties of reagents applied. In these conditions application of various mathematic models does not allow controlling the process by the way of action on input parameters of the process with further precise reaching required values of output parameters. More effective is to be application of flotation models for solution of questions of choose and optimizing of automatic control systems.
