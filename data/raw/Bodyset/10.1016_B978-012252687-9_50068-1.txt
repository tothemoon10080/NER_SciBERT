           Rickets is a clinical syndrome that presents in children as a result of a failure of or delay in mineralization of the growth plate of growing bones. There are numerous different causes, the majority of which can be grouped into three major categories: those which primarily result in a failure to maintain normal calcium homeostasis; those which primarily affect phosphate homeostasis; and those which directly inhibit the mineralization process. Globally, rickets due to nutritional causes (which fall into the calciopenic group) remains the most frequent form of the disease seen. However, in a number of industrialized countries, such as the U.S., the genetic forms of hypophosphatemic rickets are now probably more prevalent than the nutritional causes outside the neonatal period, as a result of the fortification of foods with vitamin D and the use of vitamin D supplements in at-risk groups. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen a resurgence of nutritional rickets in minority communities in a number of developed countries. Although nutritional rickets is often considered to be a disease of industrialization, descriptions of rickets have been attributed to both Homer (900 BC) and Soranus Ephesius (130 AD). More recently, attention was drawn to rickets by Daniel Whistler in 1645, and five years later Francis Glisson (1650) provided a classic description of the disease. It was described as a disease that occurred in young children, produced severe deformities, and was often fatal. The condition, which was known in Europe as “the English disease,” was more common in the cities than in rural areas. Prior to the industrial revolution, it was associated with affluence, as the children of well-to-do families were often completely covered by clothing and were kept indoors. With the migration of large numbers of people from rural to urban areas at the time of the industrial revolution, the disease became associated with poverty and overcrowding in the developing urban slums. A number of studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries documented the almost universal prevalence of rickets in young children in cities in northern Europe (for example in Glasgow [ In the United Kingdom, a number of foods were fortified with vitamin D during the World War II. This led to a rapid reduction in the number of children diagnosed with rickets, but in the following years the incidence of idiopathic hypercalcemia rose in infants, which at the time was thought to be due to uncontrolled fortification of various foods (especially milk and cereals) leading to daily intakes of 100 μg or more [ In the United States, the universal fortification of milk with vitamin D at 400 IU/quart from the 1930s has almost eradicated nutritional rickets except in families who exclude milk from their diets [ Vitamin D deficiency is a prerequisite for the development of nutritional rickets in the majority of children. Thus, the disease is typically associated with a lack of ultraviolet light exposure or dietary vitamin D. As commonly ingested foods are generally deficient in vitamin D (the exceptions being oily fishes or fortified foods), the normal diet contributes little to the vitamin D status of an individual [ Vitamin D deficiency rickets is most prevalent in children under two years of age, with a peak incidence between 3 and 18 months [ In the early literature, breast feeding was reported to be protective against rickets [ In the breast-fed infant not receiving vitamin D supplements, the maintenance of an adequate vitamin D status is dependent mainly on the infant's exposure to ultraviolet light [ Seasonal variations in serum 25OHD concentrations have also been documented in a number of countries in older children and adults [ In the U.S., despite the almost complete eradication of vitamin D deficiency among Caucasian children, several studies have highlighted the resurgence of the problem in specific groups [ A similar pattern has also been documented in a number of European countries [ The majority of clinical signs in children with rickets results from the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the mineralization process at the growth plate or on calcium homeostasis. Fraser and coworkers [ The early clinical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency (stage I) are related to hypocalcemia and are more commonly seen in young infants (less than 6 months of age). They may present with convulsions [ As the deficiency progresses, the classical features of rickets become apparent. Typically, the infant or young child presents with a delay in motor milestones, hypotonia, and progressive deformities of the long bones. The deformities are most noticeable at the distal forearm with enlargement of the wrist and bowing of the distal radius and ulna, and in the legs with progressive lateral bowing of the femur and tibia. The site and type of deformity are dependent on the age of the child and the weight bearing patterns in the limbs. Thus, in the small infant, deformities of the forearms and anterior bowing of the distal tibias are more common, while in the toddler who has started to walk an exaggeration of the normal physiological bowing of the legs (genu varum) is characteristic. In the older child, valgus deformities of the legs or a windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg and varus deformity of the other) may be apparent. The characteristic feature in the ribs is enlargement of the costochondral junctions leading to visible beading along the anterolateral aspects of the chest (the rachitic rosary). In the infant or young child with severe rickets, the muscular pull of the diaphragmatic attachments to the lower ribs Other skeletal abnormalities include a delay in the closure of the fontanelles, parietal and frontal bossing, and the presence of craniotabes [ A delay in tooth eruption is a feature of rickets in the young child and enamel hypoplasia of teeth may occur if rickets develops prior to the completion of enamel deposition. The latter has been reported in the primary dentition of infants born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient [ Hypotonia, decreased activity, and a protuberant abdomen are characteristic features of advanced vitamin D deficiency rickets in the infant and young child. These signs are probably analogous to the proximal muscle weakness described in vitamin D deficient adolescents and adults [ Dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure [ Infants and young children with rickets are prone to an increased number and severity of infections [ A possibly associated abnormality is anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, myelocytosis, erythro-blastosis, myelofibrosis [ The hallmark of vitamin D deficiency is a low circulating level of 25OHD. In children, a normal range of approximately 12 to 50 ng/ml (30–125 nmol/liter) has been found in the majority of studies [ The classical biochemical changes in vitamin D–deficient children who have radiological changes of rickets are a combination of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone concentrations. In the early phase of vitamin D deficiency before the development of radiological signs (stage I), hypocalcemia may be the only biochemical abnormality [ The elegant studies conducted by Fraser and coworkers [ Evidence of end-organ resistance to PTH has been found in the young children with both mild and more severe radiological rickets [ Markers of bone turnover are typically elevated in nutritional rickets in response to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Urinary hydroxyproline Osteocalcin is a noncollagenous bone matrix protein that binds to hydroxyapatite and is secreted by osteoblasts during mineralization [ In patients with vitamin D deficiency, serum 1,25(OH) A possible pathophysiological progression of vitamin D deficiency rickets in children may be described as follows [ It is during this phase that serum 1,25(OH) As 25OHD concentrations fall further, 1,25(OH) The typical radiologic changes associated with vitamin D deficiency rickets have been well described and are discussed in The early signs of rickets include widening of the epiphyseal plate and a loss of definition of the provisional zone of calcification at the metaphysis [ The shafts of the long bones show features of both hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Osteopenia is a characteristic feature which in the so called “atrophic” form of the disease may be very severe [ Enlargement and splaying of the costochondral junctions on the lateral radiographs of the chest have been used as a sign of rickets; however, in one study, mild changes were found to be unreliable as their presence did not correlate with serum 25OHD concentrations or with other features of rickets at the distal radius and ulna [ Rickets during adolescence may be difficult to detect using the conventional radiographic sites of the wrist and knees as the epiphyseal plates narrow and epiphyses fuse. A radiograph of the pelvis may be useful in this situation as the secondary iliac and ischial ossification centres may be abnormally wide [ The sign of early healing of rickets is described as broadened bands of increased density replacing the normal sharp metaphyseal lines ( Vitamin D deficiency rickets can be effectively treated by the oral administration of small doses of either vitamin D More generally, however, doses of vitamin D between 5,000 and 15,000 IU/day for three to four weeks are used in the management of rickets. Normalization of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations occur within 1 and 3 weeks [ In Central Europe, a single dose of 600,000 IU vitamin D (either orally or intramuscularly) has been found to be effective, resulting in a rapid improvement in biochemical abnormalities within a few days and radiologic evidence of healing within two weeks [ Besides ensuring an adequate vitamin D intake, the calcium content of the diet should be optimized (between 600 and 1000 mg/day) during the initial stages of management. This is particularly true for children who are on vegetarian or low calcium containing diets [ As discussed in section III of this chapter, vitamin D deficiency rickets remains a problem in a number of at-risk groups despite readily available methods of preventing the disease. A number of studies in several countries have been conducted prospectively in breastfed infants to assess vitamin D status. Several have shown a fall in serum 25OHD concentrations in those infants who were not vitamin D–supplemented, to levels in the vitamin D–deficient range [ Preventive strategies should be directed not only at breast-fed infants but also at pregnant and breast-feeding women [ The North American and United Kingdom groups recommend dietary intakes of between 200 and 350 IU vitamin D for the breast-fed infant [ Infants fed milk formulas or cow's milk fortified with vitamin D do not require vitamin D supplements, as their intake of milk generally provides sufficient vitamin D to prevent deficiency [ As discussed earlier, high single dose therapy (stosstherapie) has been used with success in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency rickets in a number of countries. A similar dose has also been used on a regular intermittent basis of every 3 to 5 months for the first 18 months of life as a means of prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Little data is available on the efficacy of such prophylaxis. However, in a study to assess the effect of these high doses of vitamin D (600,000 IU) on calcium and vitamin D metabolism in infants [ Following these results, a study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of vitamin D (600,000 IU or 15 mg) at 15 days of life, compared to 200,000 IU (5 mg) at birth or 100,000 IU (2.5 mg) at birth and three monthly for nine months was undertaken [ Vitamin D supplementation should be considered for all breast-fed infants living in temperate climates until they are ambulatory and are able to play outside [ In a number of countries, vitamin D deficiency is not just a disease of breast-fed infants and their mothers. Rickets has been described in adolescents of Indian and Pakistani descent in the United Kingdom and in the Middle East [ Although the untargeted fortification of foods other than milk and infant milk formulas has been used in the past as a means of addressing the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in countries where the risk of vitamin D deficiency is high, the problems experienced in the United Kingdom after World War II have led to it falling into disfavor (see Conventional wisdom has been that nutritional rickets is primarily due to vitamin D deficiency, although dietary calcium intake modulates the severity and rapidity of onset of the disease [ Isolated case reports of rickets developing in infants and toddlers, who were placed on very low calcium diets, have been published [ More convincing evidence of dietary calcium deficiency as a cause for rickets in children comes from studies in South Africa [ In South Africa, the children typically come from rural areas and present with signs and symptoms of rickets between the ages of 4 and 15 years [ Radiologically, the features are typical of calciopenic rickets with osteopenia and features of hyperparathyroidism being frequent findings ( The biochemical features are similar to those of other causes of calciopenic rickets. Hypocalcemia, low urinary calcium excretion, and elevated serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are characteristic, while serum phosphorus values are variable and often within the reference range for age [ Iliac crest bone biopsies reveal evidence of osteomalacia and hyperparathyroidism in those children who have radiologic features of rickets [ In both the Nigerian and South African studies, clinical, biochemical, and radiologic healing has been achieved through increasing the calcium intake of the children to between 800 and 1500 mg/day without the administration of vitamin D supplements [ More recently, a study using a calcium supplement of only 350 mg/day, reported complete healing within six months [ The data available from epidemiologic studies conducted in a rural area in South Africa in which a number of the affected children live, suggest that asymptomatic dietary calcium deficiency is prevalent in schoolchildren living in the area. Some 13% of children between the ages of 7 and 12 years were hypocalcemic, 41.5% had elevated alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and 76% had low urinary calcium excretion [ Although dietary calcium intakes in children with biochemical changes suggestive of dietary calcium deficiency are very low, it is unclear what role the high phytate or oxalate contents of the diet play in aggravating the symptoms. Nevertheless, biochemical improvement can be achieved by supplementing the children with 500 mg calcium daily [ Nutritional rickets has been viewed for some time as being due to an inadequate supply of vitamin D through either an inadequate dietary intake or insufficient skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or more recently due to low dietary calcium intake in the face of a normal vitamin D status. However, these pathogenetic concepts are too simplistic. Early studies by Mellanby [ The resurgence of rickets and osteomalacia in the Asian community in Great Britain has provided the impetus for detailed studies into the pathogenesis of vitamin D deficiency, and bone disease in that community. Although vitamin D deficiency as assessed by circulating 25OHD concentrations, is the hallmark of the disease in Asians [ Over the past fifteen years, research has shown that both high fiber diets and intestinal malabsorption reduce the serum half-life of 25OHD by approximately one-third [ In the light of the above studies, Clements [  A number of recent studies have highlighted the complex interaction between vitamin D and calcium intakes in the pathogenesis of nutritional rickets in children. A review of 43 patients diagnosed as having nutritional rickets in New Haven, Connecticut, found low 25OHD levels in only 22%, and the majority of infants had been weaned onto diets with minimal dairy content [ Despite readily accessible and effective means to eradicate rickets globally, the disease remains a major public health problem in many countries, not only in temperate regions of the world but also in tropical and subtropical countries. In many developed countries, the promotion of exclusive breast-feeding during the first six months of life and the concerns about the long-term effect of sunlight exposure during this period have exacerbated the risks of vitamin D deficiency in the young infant. In some subtropical countries, social customs play an important role in preventing adequate vitamin D status not only in the young infant but also in the pregnant and lactating mother. In a number of developing countries, low dietary calcium intakes appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of rickets in older children. Recent studies have helped to provide an all embracing concept of the interaction of vitamin D and calcium intakes in the pathogenesis of rickets. There remains a need for international agencies to place the eradication of vitamin D deficiency among young children in many parts of the world as a priority. Nutritional rickets not only leads to an increase in infant mortality but also has serious long-term health sequelae.
