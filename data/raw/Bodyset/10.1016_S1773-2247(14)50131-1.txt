Meloxicam (Mel) is a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug belonging to BCS class II category. Hence, its pharmacological effect is affected by its low water solubility. The aim of this study was to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of meloxicam. Mel was recrystallized into spherical agglomerates (SA) with or without different polymers (PEG 4000, Inutec SP1, PVP k30, Pluronic F127 and HPÃŸCD) at three different concentrations (0.0125, 0. 025 and 0.05 % w/v) using quasi emulsion solvent diffusion (QESD) and neutralization techniques (NT). Mel SA containing low concentration level of polymer (0.0125 % w/v) showed highest solubility and dissolution rate enhancement compared to pure Mel. DSC and IR outcome showed no chemical alteration in the recrystallized drug. DSC and PXRD studies showed that crystallinity of Mel was retained in all of the prepared SA (although slightly reduced compared to pure Mel). The anti-nociceptive effect of F2 (QESD) and F29 (NT) (showing highest dissolution in simulated gastric fluid) was assessed in mice using acetic acid induced abdominal writhing in comparison to pure drug. The selected formulae showed significantly higher analgesic activity in comparison to the pure drug and the control.
