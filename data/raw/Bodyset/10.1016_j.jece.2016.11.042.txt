In the present research work, a characterization of a bottom ash derived from olive plants trimmings combustion was carried out in order to examine its suitability as a substitute in the production of composite cements. For that purpose six different mixtures were prepared: a reference one, containing only ordinary raw materials and five others, substituting Portland cement for 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10wt%. The woody bottom ash (WBA) characterization was carried out by using particle size distribution analysis, chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD), whereas its microstructure and morphological characteristics were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The physicochemical and mechanical properties of the produced cements mixtures were examined by means of their initial and final setting times, standard consistency, flow of normal mortar, soundness and compressive strength at 1, 2, 7 and 28 days. Their hydration progress was attested by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTG), whereas the microstructure of the hardened cement pastes was examined by SEM. According to the results, the WBA could be used as a substitute for Portland cement, in the production of composite cements of the strength classes 42.5 and 32.5 of EN 197-1.In recent years, an increased demand on alternative renewable energy resources has been raised, due to the strict environmental laws and the corresponding energy preservation strategies. An alternative non-fossil source, today used in co-combustion with hard coal power plants for electrical energy and heat generation, is woody biomass, whose valorization presents not only the benefit of the economical cost decrement but also reduces the environmental impact However, the use of such energy substitutes could also lead to a relative increase of the bottom and fly ash produced, during the incineration process, in relation with traditional energy resources and therefore they should be treated according to federal and local legislation. Bottom ash, which is often mixed with other impurities, such as sand or stone, is produced in the boiler first combustion chamber, whereas fly ash is collected primarily in cyclones, which are located behind the combustion unit, and in electrostatic and bag filters, which are usually placed behind the cyclones The main part of the ash generated in fixed-bed furnaces is the bottom ash, which comprises about the 80% of the total. Its quantity and chemical composition may vary considerably according to the biomass quality used and the technology applied, especially the temperatures to which the source is subjected during the combustion process Today, the increasing number of environmental regulations has led the waste producers in Europe to the choice of recycling and reuse, as the disposal cost is very high and in some cases it may require controlled landfills, especially for fly ashes, which may be rich in heavy metal contaminants, such as Cd As biomass ashes contain significant amounts of nutritious ingredients (calcium, potassium, phosphorus), traditionally they have been used in agriculture as mineral soil supplement and fertilizer, aiming to the improvement of soil qualitative characteristics and to the consequent crop performance Wood ashes valorization has been also examined as raw material in ceramic industry Portland cement is one of the most widely used construction material and it accounts for approximately 4–5 The aim of the present research work was to investigate the possibility of using WBA as a constituent of composite cements blends. For that reason different mixtures were prepared substituting Portland cement up to 10 The cement used in all mixtures was a CEM I 52.5N Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), produced by Titan Cement Company of Greece. The bottom ash under investigation had been generated after the combustion of olive plants trimmings in a fixed-bed combustion system, with underfeed stokers. Its particle size distribution was determined by a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern) after dispersion treatment with ultrasonic. Chemical analyses were carried out with X-ray Fluorescence (Spectro–Xepos) and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (Perkin Elmer 4100). The crystalline phases of both WBA and CEM I 52.5N were determined by XRD analysis, using a Bruker D8-Focus diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuKa radiation (λ The cements mixtures were produced by mixing the WBA and Portland cement, in a laboratory ball mill with further grinding, in order to the final blended cement present homogenous particle size distribution. The mixing ratios, as well as the physical characteristics of the final cements produced are presented in Vicat apparatus was used for the determination of the cement pastes standard consistency and setting times, according to the European Standard EN 196-3 The hydration products were mineralogically determined by X-ray diffraction, using a Bruker D8-Focus diffractometer. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was carried out to evaluate hydration rate using a Mettler-Toledo TGA 851 instrument (25–900  The results of chemical analyses, obtained using X-ray fluorescence, for both WBA and cement used, are given in The loss on ignition (LOI) was found to be high, reaching 42 Except calcite (CaCO As Ca, Si and K are the most important macronutrients after nitrogen, calcite and fairchildite (and dolomite) derived from the reaction of the corresponding elements with the produced carbon dioxide during combustion in the strong oxidative conditions. Typically, olive wood trimmings present higher concentrations of calcium and lower concentrations of silica, while the alkali concentrations (both K and Na) are also quite high. SiO Except fairchildite, potassium was also chemically bound with sulphur in the form of arcanite, whereas calcium was also detected with the form of bassanite, probably due to the partial hydration of previously formed anhydrite. Finally, the presence of calcium silicate phases such as Ca The above observations were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). As it is shown in Calcite is the most abundant phase. It was detected with the form of larger grains with wrinkled surface, whereas fairchildite (K Sulphates (potassium and calcium), were detected as elongated plates or fibrous crystals. In most cases larger aggregates had been formed, but also separate nano particles could frequently be distinguished. The presence of CaO, due to calcite decomposition, was confirmed mainly with the form of pseudo-hexagonal plates with rounded sides, whereas the high temperature sintered calcium silicate-aluminate phases appeared to form high density plates. Water demand and setting times of the tested cement mixtures are presented in The above observation should be mainly attributed to the WBA mineralogy and to the carboaluminates formation, during the hydration of C On the other hand this decrease in setting times, together with the corresponding increase in water demand for standard consistency could be also attributed to the WBA fine particle size distribution, which acted as a filler material, reducing the rheology of cement paste and thus lowering the final workability. The carbonate nanoparticles accelerate cement hydration, because of the number and the nature of contacts achieved in cement-filler interface, creating coagulation contacts on which nuclei of hydration products are generated The blended cements under investigation were tested for compressive strengths after 1, 2, 7 and 28  However, after 28 According to the results, the amount of carbonated ettringite crystals formed during the hydration of CEM I 52.5N – WBA cement mixtures seemed to be higher especially at higher levels of cement substitution. The carbonate nanoparticles of the WBA were acted as nucleation sites, where further reaction with Ca(OH) TG/DTG results of the examined cement mixtures, hydrated for 28 days, are presented in In the range of 100–150  However, the hydration evolution in the presence of fine carbonate particles led to the creation of carboaluminates, even after 2 Woody bottom ash (WBA), a combustion by-product of olive plants trimmings in fixed-bed combustion system, is a carbonate fine grained material, consisting mainly of calcite (CaCO
