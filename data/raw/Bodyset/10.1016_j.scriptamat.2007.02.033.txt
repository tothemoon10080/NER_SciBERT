The present study investigates the effect of aluminide (Fe3Al and Ni3Al) addition and sintering temperature on the densification, hardness, wear and electrochemical behavior of austenitic (316L) stainless steels. As compared to solid-state sintering (1200°C), supersolidus sintering (1400°C) improves the overall performance of both straight 316L as well as 316L–aluminide composites. The addition of Ni3Al and Fe3Al to 316L stainless steels improve the mechanical and wear properties without any significant degradation of corrosion resistance. In recent years, the use of prealloyed stainless steel powders has lent itself to consolidation at higher temperatures through supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) The prealloyed 316L (C: 0.025; Si: 0.93; Mn: 0.21; Ni: 12.97; Cr: 16.5; Mo: 2.48; S: 0.008; P: 0.01; Fe: bal.) stainless steel powders (Ametek Speciality Metal Products, Eighty Four, PA) were mixed with 5  The bulk hardness of the polished surfaces was measured using a Vickers Hardness Tester (HPO-250, Fritz Heckert, Leipzig, Germany) at 5 For electrochemical evaluation, the potentiodynamic polarization studies were conducted in freely aerated 0.1 From the potentiodynamic polarization curves ( The slight increase in In summary, densification of straight as well as aluminide-reinforced 316L stainless steels increases with increasing sintering temperature. Irrespective of the aluminide reinforcement and its content, supersolidus sintering enhances both wear and corrosion resistance. As compared to straight 316L compacts, 5
