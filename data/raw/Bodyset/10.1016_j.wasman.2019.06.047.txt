The chemical composition and leachability of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash are important parameters determining its suitability for utilisation. The objective of the present study is to investigate the chemical composition of individual size and material fractions and their contribution to the total elemental contents of bottom ash. Nine bottom ash samples with a mass of 3000 kg each were sieved to eight size fractions and sorted into different materials. The materials (mineral material, glass, batteries) were separately analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry after acid digestion. Additionally, x-ray fluorescence measurements and leaching tests were performed. Metals were further analysed by sorting analysis. The chemical analysis revealed that large particles have higher contents of Fe and Si, but lower contents of Ca and S compared to smaller particles. All mineral fractions exceed the legal limit values for utilisation in Austria mainly because of the total contents of Pb and Tl and the leachate contents of Cr and Sb. Glass from bottom ash is enriched in As, Na, Si and Tl compared to the mineral material. Although battery contents contribute only 0.2% to the total mass of bottom ash, they contribute at least 30% to the total content of Cd. Most previous studies neglected large metallic pieces and batteries, which contain most of the Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni present in bottom ash. This practice can result in an underestimation of the total contents of these elements by up to about 70%.The incineration of municipal solid waste with energy recovery represents a key element for sustainable waste management ( Metals can be separated from MSWI bottom ash during bottom ash treatment and subsequently utilised as a secondary raw material in metal industry ( Several studies have shown that the composition of different size fractions of bottom ash can differ significantly ( What are the total contents of selected elements in different materials (mineral material, glass, metals, batteries) present in different MSWI bottom ash size fractions? What is the composition of the leachate from mineral material in different size fractions? Which size fractions of mineral material from MSWI bottom ash are suitable for utilisation in accordance to the legal requirements? What are the contributions of different materials and different size fractions to the total contents of selected elements in MSWI bottom ash? Nine samples with a mass of 3000 kg each from three different MSWI plants located in the city of Vienna in Austria were collected. The size fractions >50 mm, 16–50 mm, 12–16 mm, 8–12 mm, 4–8 mm, 2–4 mm, 0.5–2 mm and <0.5 mm were generated and sorted into mineral material, glass, unburnt organic matter, magnetic iron, non-magnetic iron (i.e. mainly stainless steel), brass, copper, coins, silver, gold and batteries. The MSWI plants, the sampling of MSWI bottom ash and the sieving, washing and sorting steps applied are described in detail in The total contents of selected elements were measured in material milled to a particle size of <0.5 mm (mineral material, glass, battery contents). The total contents of Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, P, Pb, S, Si and Ti were analysed by a handheld x-ray fluorescence device (NITON XL3t Air). All measurements were carried out in a sample lead chamber using the analysation-mode ‘‘TestAll Geo”. For the total content analysis of Ag, As, Au, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Sb, Se, Sn, Tl, V, W and Zn, the samples were digested in PTFE vessels with a mixture of 6 mL HNO Leachates were prepared from the sorted materials of each size fractions without any comminution using a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 L/kg according to The mass fractions (e.g. kg of Cu per kg of metals) in the metal fractions is based on the results of the sorting analysis described by The information about the particle size distribution of MSWI bottom ash and the mass fractions of different materials present in each size fraction provided by The total content (i.e. mass fraction) in MSWI bottom ash was calculated for each element according to Eq.           The total contents of the elements Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Na, S and Si in the mineral material and glass in different size fractions are shown in The total contents of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb and Tl in the mineral material and glass in different size fractions are shown in The comparison of mineral bottom ash material with the limit values for clinker production in Austria shows that none of the size fractions complies with all limit values with frequent exceedance for Pb and Tl. Nevertheless, utilisation in clinker production is still possible, if the cement produced complies with the legal requirements and not >10% of the raw meal is substituted (  Only total contents are relevant for the utilisation of bottom ash as a raw material in clinker production in Austria. However, leachate contents are an important parameter for assessing the suitability of MSWI bottom ash with regard to the utilisation in road construction. The leachate parameters, for which limit values were established in Austria, are pH value, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, chloride and sulphate. The analysis results for the above mentioned parameters of the mineral materials in different size fractions are shown in No correlation between the particle size and the leachate contents could be observed. Glass has lower leachate contents of chloride, sulphate, Cu and Mo, but a higher leachate content of As. This corresponds to the high total content of As in glass. The total contents of all elements analysed in the present study as calculated by Eq.  Although washing of bottom ash prior to a sorting analysis is described extensively in previous literature ( A detailed investigation of the total and leachate contents of 31 chemical elements in different size and material fractions of MSWI bottom ash was performed. The information on the composition of different bottom ash fractions can be used to model the effect of bottom ash treatment on the composition of the output fractions of a treatment plant. For example, the separation of glass from the mineral fraction could increase the contents of Ca and Fe in the mineral fraction, which would then be more suitable as a replacement for limestone or iron ore in clinker production. The mineral material in bottom ash of all size fractions analysed does not comply with the Austrian limit values for unlimited utilisation in clinker production and utilisation in road construction. Nevertheless, the utilisation of a limited amount of MSWI bottom ash in clinker production might be possible. For the utilisation in road construction, advanced bottom ash treatment is necessary. The leachate contents could for example be decreased by intense washing procedures or by stabilisation of the environmentally relevant elements present in MSWI bottom ash (e.g. by weathering). In contrast, the total contents of mineral material from bottom ash can only be decreased by separating particles, which carry environmentally relevant elements in high concentrations. With regard to Austria, the reduction of the total elemental contents should focus on Cd, Cr, Pb and Tl, but in other countries other elements might be relevant depending on the limit values. This reduction of total contents could for example be achieved by sensor-based sorting or density separation. Contrary to other studies that neglected pieces of MSWI bottom ash above a certain particle size either directly or indirectly by choosing a small increment size during sampling, particles of all sizes and materials were considered in the present study. This approached revealed that the total contents of certain elements like Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni is underestimated in MSWI bottom ash by up to about 70% if large pieces and material fractions that contribute only little to the total bottom ash mass like batteries are neglected. On the one hand, this means that all bottom ash fractions have to be considered, if accurate information about the total elemental contents in MSWI bottom ash are desired. On the other hand, the results presented highlight the importance of metal separation for the utilisation of the MSWI bottom ash. Consequently, advanced metal separation not only generates a higher amount of recyclable metal fractions from bottom ash, but also increases the quality of the remaining substantially mineral material compared to simple bottom ash treatment plants with a low separation efficiency.
