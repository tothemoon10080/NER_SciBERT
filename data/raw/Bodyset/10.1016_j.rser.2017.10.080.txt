The research in the field of nanofluids has experienced considerable advances from their discovery two decades ago. These liquid mixtures with tiny quantities (< 10% in volume) of nanometric size solid particles (< 100nm) in suspension have a great potential for thermal management applications due to their excellent thermophysical properties. The so-called traditional nanofluids (based on water or industrial oils) have been extensively studied so far with a special focus on the enhancement observed in their thermal conductivity. Experimental results, mechanisms and models regarding these materials have been published and reviewed on a large number of articles. A new kind of nanofluids based on inorganic salts has been developed in the last few years with the aim of storing and transferring thermal energy at high temperatures. These Molten Salt-Based Nanofluids (MSBNFs) are characterized by a considerable increase of their specific heat due to the presence of particles at the nanometric scale. On the contrary, the specific heat of the traditional nanofluids is lower compared to that of the base fluid. This surprising behaviour has caused an opened debate in the scientific community, which is currently dealing with these controversial results and the lack of theories and models for these materials. This article reviews the published scientific contributions on MSBNFs. The influence of several facts on the specific heat is deeply analysed, as well as the synthesis methods. Other important aspects related to the behaviour and development of the MSBNFs such as the stability of the NanoParticles (NPs) in the molten salt, their latent heat, viscosity and thermal conductivity, have also been reviewed in this article. Finally, the difficulties and challenges concerning the further development of these materials have been summarized and the main conclusions have been listed.specific heat at constant pressure (J thermal conductivity (W by weight (%) by volume (%) by mol (%) Nanotechnology has become a worldwide revolution in the last decades. The possibility of manipulating materials at the atomic and molecular level has led to achieve extraordinary attributes and features unimagined before. In the framework of this broad field of research, nanofluids emerged recently as a promising material for thermal transfer and storage. They are composed of a base fluid where nanometric sized solid particles (less than 100 The increment of the thermal conductivity has been also accomplished by many other researchers on a wide diversity of nanofluids. Carbon-based nanostructures and/or ceramic and metallic NPs have been used as additives to the base fluids. A large number of publications has been devoted to the research of water-based nanofluids However, several industrial processes require the application of fluids which operate at temperatures higher than those suitable for the above mentioned fluids. They are of special importance in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants because their production depends on the efficient conversion of the thermal energy coming from the sun into electricity at temperatures higher than 300 With the aim of fulfilling this need, a new kind of nanofluid was developed six years ago by Shin and Banerjee at the University of Texas at Arlington As mentioned before, the main purpose of MSBNFs is the TES and heat transfer in CSP plants. This material can be used on three different ways for this application: 1) as sensible storage media 2) as HTF and 3) as latent heat storage media (also known as Nano-enhanced Phase Change Materials, NePCMs). The desirable features of MSBNFs are listed below: Enhanced heat transfer properties compared to the base fluid: higher thermal conductivity, higher specific heat and higher latent heat. Stability of the NPs dispersion in the molten salt during long periods of time. Stability and no degradation of the nanostructured material under thermal cycling. Small or negligible increment of the viscosity due to the presence of NPs to allow an efficient pumping of the nanofluid. Chemical compatibility and absence of physical erosion with the container materials. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the materials, the synthesis procedures and the thermal and rheological properties of MSBNFs according to the scientific publications up to date. The theoretical models which explain the increment of specific heat and the molecular simulation results are also described. Finally, the main challenges of these novel nanostructured materials are listed. The present study complements and enriches the information published in recent reviews The study of MSBNFs is a relatively recent field of research, which is on its infancy. Until now, the major efforts of the research works have been focused on obtaining empirical results ( The prediction of the specific heat of traditional nanofluids is usually made through the assumption of a thermal equilibrium between the NPs and the surrounding fluid. The model proposed in the Eq. Most of the experimental results of conventional nanofluids are in agreement with the Eq. Nevertheless, in the MSBNFs the disparity between the experimental results and those predicted by the Eq. Shin and Banerjee There are both theoretical The existence of a great interfacial thermal resistance between NPs and the ions of the molten salt may increase the thermal storage potential of the nanofluid. This interfacial thermal resistance (known as Kapitza resistance) is due to the high surface area per unit mass, distinctive of NPs, and negligible at the macroscale The ions of the molten salt surrounding the NPs surface are ordered forming a special “semi-solid” liquid layer. It has superior thermal properties compared to the bulk liquid. Their thickness has been estimated by Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) to be around 2–5 M. Thoms In addition Shin, Tiznobaik and Banerjee They theorized that these special nanostructures have a substantial effect on the specific heat of the whole material and must be considered in the model predictions. Hence, they proposed the inclusion of a new term on the Eq. On the other hand, Lu and Huang They observed experimentally a reduction of the specific heat of the nanofluid compared to the base fluid. This diminution was more pronounced for a nanofluid containing smaller NPs. There is a higher contribution of the nanolayer as the NPs size is reduced for a certain NPs concentration. Their experimental results fit perfectly with the Eq. All these models were recently gathered and studied in detail by Khanafer and colleagues Ho and Pan Riazi and his colleagues MDS is a powerful tool which provides information about the movement of atoms and molecules in a certain system. This is of special interest to compute some properties in MSBNFs which cannot be experimentally determined such as the heat transport at molecular level or the features of the nanolayer. In spite of its utility, a small number of studies have applied this technique to MSBNFs up to this date. Shin The interfacial thermal resistance of the eutectic mixture of carbonates (Li The effect of the solvent composition on the specific heat of MSBNFs was also studied by Jo and Banerjee The eutectic mixture of carbonates (Li MDS was performed for SiO In the doctoral dissertation of Nagaraj Miliozzi and colleagues Nanofluids are composed of a base fluid and a nanoadditive which is intended to improve its thermal properties. The range of potential combinations of additives and fluids is enormous. Nanofluids are usually categorized by the kind of nanomaterial employed Theoretically, any solid nanostructure with suitable features can be used as an additive to the base fluid The base fluids that have been traditionally employed are water, engine oil, silicon oil, acetone, decene and ethylene glycol Because of the high melting temperatures of inorganic salts and their aggressive nature, the requirements of the potential NPs are more severe than those needed for traditional nanofluids. The key requisites are a small average diameter, stability at high temperatures, and a strong affinity to the adsorbate In view of the mentioned conditions, only some candidate materials can be employed in molten salts systems. Ceramic nanoparticles, specifically metal oxides, have focused the attention of the majority of the researchers working on MSBNFs. In fact, these were the first materials to be mixed and evaluated in the traditional nanofluids, primarily because of their ease of fabrication, low cost and chemical stability in solution The manufacturing process of MSBNFs is of critical importance since it has a direct impact on the subsequent properties of the material To obtain a homogenous dispersion of NPs into the salt matrix. To maintain the NPs size in the nanometric range, avoiding agglomeration and clustering through every synthesis step. This section presents the procedures commonly used to prepare the traditional nanofluids; their usual stabilization techniques and their evaluation. The aim is to provide a general knowledge on the subject. Afterwards, the specific methods for the synthesis of MSBNFs are detailed and reviewed. There are two different methods which have been commonly used to produce the traditional nanofluids: the single-step and the two-step method. The two-step method for preparing nanofluids is a step-by-step method which separates the nanofluids synthesis from the preparation of the NPs To produce nanofluids with improved stability, the one-step methods have been developed In the one-step method the process stages of drying, storage, transportation and dispersion of the NPs are avoided. Consequently, the agglomeration is minimized and the nanofluid stability is increased. The main disadvantage of this method is that only fluids with low vapour pressure are suitable for the process, which limits its application The corrosive nature of the molten salts makes difficult the synthesis of the MSBNFs by the single-step method. In addition, the manipulation of the liquid salts at high temperatures is expensive and involves health risks. Therefore, the two-step procedure is generally used as described later in One of the major challenges during the nanofluid preparation is to assure that the NPs remain dispersed into the base fluid. The stability of a nanofluid depends mainly on the characteristics of the suspended NPs, such as the particle morphology or its chemical structure. The base fluids and the NPs should be chosen properly to achieve a long-time stable suspension The Stokes law (Eq. According to this expression, some strategies are effective on reducing the velocity of sedimentation and preventing the NPs agglomeration: maintain the NPs size as small as possible, increase the fluid viscosity and diminish the density difference between the NPs and the fluid. In addition, there are several experimental techniques which successfully increase the NPs stability along the time. The most common methods used in conventional nanofluids are: Addition of surfactants. These substances improve the wettability between the nanostructures and the fluid. A good dispersion of the NPs is achieved with a tiny quantity of surfactants, making this option simply and economical Surface modification techniques. The NPs can be functionalized by adding chemical groups attached to their surface, avoiding the use of surfactants. These functional groups are selected according to the chemical nature of the components of the suspension pH control. The nanofluid stability is directly related to its electrokinetic properties. Stability can be achieved by a suitable surface charge density in the NPs (the electrical potential difference between the inner and outer surface of the dispersed phase in a colloid). The concepts of the IsoElectric Point (IEP) and the zeta potential play a crucial role in this stability strategy, as addressed by the international research community Ultrasonic vibration. In this technique, the stability is gained by breaking the agglomerates with a physical stimulus rather than using a steric or electrostatic stabilization. UltraSound (US) energy is able to disaggregate the agglomerated NPs. This disaggregation has not been achieved by other physical methods like magnetic or high shear stirring Almost all of the analysed studies about the MSBNFs use the aforementioned two-step method. In general terms, four basic steps are followed to complete the synthesis process:     The principal concern on the production of MSBNFs is the scalability of the process. The described procedure is mainly conceived at a laboratory level. The large energy consumption required for removing this huge quantity of water and for the stabilization through ultrasonic waves is the main barrier to its industrial implementation. In addition, there are many variables which are difficult to control regarding the reproducibility of the method such as the power of sonication, the drying temperature and time and the solution concentration. Fortunately, some authors Commercial NPs in the form of dry powder are of common use Ultrasonic stirring is employed to obtain and stabilize a good dispersion of the NPs into the fluid. This technique has demonstrated to be suitable to break the possible NPs clusters, generated and stabilized by the strong Van der Waals forces existing between them The sonication step is not required if a water-based nanofluid is employed as a source of the NPs instead of the NPs in the form of a solid powder The last stage in the synthesis procedure consists of removing the water by simple evaporation. The aqueous solution is typically poured into a Petri dish and then heated on a hot plate. The solid sample is removed after by mechanical scrapping. Different drying times (from 2 Some authors have investigated other alternative mixing methods. The possibility of a direct blending of the NPs with the salts on their molten state has been evaluated Ho and Pan An extrusion machine for polymers was employed by Chieruzzi and coworkers to synthesize nanofluids based on Solar Salt (NaNO The process followed by Seo and Shin Schuller Finally, a pioneering work with the one-step synthesis method has been recently published The characterization of MSBNFs has been mainly focused on the study of the specific heat and the influence of several factors on this property. Besides, the stability of the NPs dispersion in the molten salt, their latent heat (to act as NePCMs), the viscosity, the thermal conductivity and the material costs have also been studied by several researchers and reviewed in the following sections. The influence of NPs on the specific heat of molten salts has been analysed in most articles dealing with MSBNFs. According to the models described on The subsequent paragraphs examine in detail the influence of the most relevant factors on the enhancement of the specific heat of MSBNFs. The change on the specific heat caused by the addition of NPs to the base salt in different quantities is the aspect most widely analysed through the reviewed literature. The aim of these studies is to find out the percentage which maximizes the specific heat for a certain combination of inorganic salt and NPs. This “magic” amount of NPs is highly variable depending on the analysed research, probably due to the differences on the NPs size among the materials. This detail is not usually found on the literature. The combination of Solar Salt (NaNO The mixture of alumina NPs and the Solar Salt (NaNO The discrepancies between the results obtained by different authors were also observed in nanofluids composed of the Solar Salt (NaNO The Solar Salt (NaNO Lasfargues The eutectic mixture of Li Other nanofluids were synthetized by adding MWCNT in concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% wt to the eutectic mixture of carbonates (Li Several studies have dealt with the effect of the NPs nominal size on the specific heat of MSBNFs. The results reported on the analysed articles have been gathered in An interesting investigation was performed by Lu and Huang with Solar Salt (NaNO Two nanofluids made of LiNO The works carried out with silica NPs of several sizes showed an increment of the salt specific heat with the addition of the NPs. Dudda and Shin The salt Hitec XL, composed of NaNO S. Changla When silica NPs (5, 10, 30 and 60 Riazi and colleagues As detailed on the previous paragraphs, the relationship between the nominal NPs size and the nanofluid specific heat is controversial. Most of the analysed publications Several methods have been employed to produce the MSBNFs. The hot plate method has been the most widely used procedure, but other manufacturing methods were tried. The synthesis procedure has a strong influence on the NPs dispersion inside the salt matrix. It also has a crucial influence on the agglomeration or clustering of the particles, and therefore on the final effective NP sizes in the final material. These two factors greatly determine the specific heat of the nanofluid. The impact of minor modifications on the traditional hot plate-method was analysed by Shin and Jo Jo and coworkers Modifications on the drying stage were also evaluated by Schuller and coworkers With the aim of reducing the amount of the water employed to dissolve the salts and to disperse the NPs, the influence of this parameter was studied Riazi and his coworkers analysed the effect of the sonication power on the NPs agglomeration The work by Chieruzzi and colleagues Some studies analysed the specific heat of MSBNFs containing the same NPs but changing the base salts. Solar Salt (NaNO In other approach, Jo and Banerjee In a different approach, Tiznobaik and Shin The thermophysical characterization of MSBNFs to be used as NePCMs is still scarce. The Solar Salt (NaNO The reason of this behaviour is still unclear. Chieruzzi and coworkers The thermal properties of the MSBNFs must be invariant over time. Otherwise, the potential applications of these materials would be highly reduced due to the impossibility of maintaining these improved thermal characteristics. Some authors have carried out stability tests to verify the behaviour of MSBNFs along the time, both as a fluid In the first case, the material is always in the liquid state. As a consequence, the NPs embedded in the molten salt may collide between them due to their characteristic Brownian motion. If these impacts have enough energy, they will led to the generation of agglomerates of different sizes. If these aggregates reach a certain size, they will settle down and NPs will no longer be present in the bulk of the molten salt, except of a negligible quantity. This sample will lose its extraordinary heat transfer properties because of the high heterogeneity caused by the agglomeration and settling of the NPs. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain the unique attributes of these materials in the long time, preventing their agglomeration. The process of agglomeration and settling of the NPs is modelled by the Eq. If the material is analysed as NePCMs, in addition to the required stability on the liquid stage, the nucleation and crystallization stages should also be taken into account. These processes may change the settling mechanism of the NPs since their Brownian motion is physically limited by the nucleation and subsequent growth of the salt crystals. The stability evaluation is usually studied by comparing the initial and the final specific heat of the nanofluid. The salt is maintained in the liquid state for some hours A nanofluid of Solar Salt (NaNO The study performed by Andreu-Cabedo and her colleagues Contradictory results were found by Schuller and Betts The stability test of the Solar Salt (NaNO The stability of a nanofluid made of the eutectic mixture of carbonates (Li Lasfargues Turbidity measurements were used in an exhaustive study The research on MSBNFs has been mainly focused on the increase of the specific heat, as reported in the precedent sections. However, the expected increase on the thermal conductivity has also been studied, although in much shorter depth. The high melting temperature and the corrosive nature of the molten salts and MSBNFs hinder the measurement of this thermophysical property. Nevertheless, several studies have determined the thermal conductivity of MSBNFs in the solid state. Their values have been compared with those of the pure inorganic salts. D. Shin A significant enhancement of this property was achieved with independency of the test temperature, achieving an increment of 47%, 36% and 37% above that of the pure carbonate, as shown in On the contrary, no increase of the thermal conductivity was found in the nanofluids constituted by Solar Salt (NaNO As explained in To confirm the presence of the nanostructures generated in the surroundings of the NPs. They are presumably constituted by ions of the base salt which are aligned and ordered around the NPs surface acting as nucleation sites for crystallization. These nanostructures look like long needles or networks over the amorphous salt crystals. They have been observed through SEM To have an approximate measurement of the individual NPs and the clusters size into the molten salt. This information is relevant to know the available surface of interaction and thus, the likelihood to generate the mentioned nanostructures. The analysis of this parameter has been usually carried out with SEM images To evaluate the dispersion of NPs into the molten salt matrix. A homogeneous distribution is highly desirable, to avoid great differences of thermal transfer between different regions of the material. SEM with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) mapping has been used to know the elemental composition of a certain area of the material The knowledge of the rheological properties of MSBNFs is of high importance for their industrial operation. The ideal nanofluid is expected to possess improved thermal characteristics as well as a low viscosity to avoid an increase of the pressure drop and the required pumping power Jung Jo and Banerjee The Solar Salt (NaNO To summarize, the works of Jo, Banerjee The influence of the NPs on the corrosive behaviour of molten salts was studied by Schuller and coworkers The further industrial implementation of the MSBNFs in CSP is currently remote and a wider and deeper characterization of these materials is needed first. Although this research topic is still on its first steps, the industrial interest can be boosted by demonstrating the cost reduction of the new material in comparison to the currently employed thermal storage solutions. A few brief economic evaluations have been found through the scientific literature. The material costs as well as the savings produced by its improved thermal properties are considered. The researchers from Texas A&M University An economic simulation was performed with the Solar Salt (NaNO Miliozzi and coworkers This paper reviews the information available of MSBNFs in the literature with a special focus on the results of the specific heat, aiming to provide the reader a broad overview of the factors affecting this property. The results on other important properties such as the stability of the NPs, the rheology or the chemical compatibility of these new materials have also been gathered and analysed. The researchers working on MSBNFs must still face several issues to create a solid knowledge and establish the future research topics on the field. In line with the features analysed through this review, the main barriers of MSBNFs and their possible solutions are laid out in the following paragraphs:           In spite of these challenges, the MSBNFs present a great potential and opportunities to improve the heat transfer and storage of the molten salts. The solar thermal power industry will be the main favoured by the development and progress of this technology. In addition, molten salts are also of high importance on the nuclear industry, so there is an excellent chance to apply the current knowledge of MSBNFs to this sector. It is worth mentioning the growing interest generated by this research topic from many research groups worldwide. The study and comprehension of this nanostructured material is still at an early stage but considerable advances have been made so far from the pioneering studies in 2010. We consider that in the medium term, the coordinate efforts of researchers of the MSBNFs will allow broaden the knowledge of these materials and undoubtedly impact on the CSP technology.
