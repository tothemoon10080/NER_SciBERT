The iron powder Ancorsteel 1000B was used to manufacture some pieces (IPAS), by pressing at 400 MPa, followed by sintering at 1150 oC. In order to improve their corrosion resistance in 1.0 % NaCl solution, certain specimens were submitted to protection with cadmium and zinc coatings. The corrosion behaviour of unprotected and protected IPAS samples was discussed according to electrochemical measurements such as: potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in association with Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) technique. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated the barrier properties of cadmium coating and the sacrificial protection of zinc deposit. SEM/EDS showed the same trend, meaning that the cadmium coating is more persistent, after corrosion, than zinc deposit.
