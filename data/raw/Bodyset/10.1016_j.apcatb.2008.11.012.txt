Hydrothermally produced TiO2 powders with different phase composition (anatase, rutile and mixed phase) were immobilized on glass fibers and tested in the phenol mineralization process. Both H2O2 and O2 were used as oxygen donors, and their performances were compared with those of the same TiO2 samples as slurries.
                  The catalytic properties of the immobilized different crystalline phases, rutile and anatase, show the same trend as the slurry samples: pure rutile displays the highest catalytic efficiency in the presence of H2O2, while samples containing anatase improve the photodegradation efficacy with O2. It was suggested that the stability of the photogenerated electron–hole couple allows high activity of rutile in the presence of H2O2, while the relevant oxygen chemisorption on anatase causes high catalytic activity in the presence of O2. A four parameters kinetics model shows that both reaction steps, the phenol degradation and the mineralization of the intermediates, are photoactivated by TiO2.
                  Photoactivity of the coated glass fibers is generally lower than that of slurries, even if their efficiencies are almost comparable when the oxidation is performed by H2O2, while much lower when the oxygen donor is O2. As a matter of fact, the morphology of immobilized catalysts shows the presence of chestnut burr aggregates of large rutile crystalline rods on the glass fiber, which are much less compact than the aggregates of small anatase particles. This preserves rutile surface area from the coarsening effects; thus, when rutile is the more active species, as in the presence of H2O2, the photocatalytic activity is less affected by immobilization.Recent literature reports about several attempts to immobilize TiO TiO In spite of the different TiO Very recently we demonstrated that the catalytic activity of TiO The present paper reports about the immobilization on glass fibers, of a number of hydrothermal titania samples with different phase composition and, as a consequence, with different average particle size. Catalysts were characterized both as pure and supported powders. The catalytic activity of the samples as slurry was compared with that of the immobilized ones in the PhOH degradation reaction, using both H Nanocrystalline TiO The suspension was aged for 2 TiO Hereafter, TiO The X-ray diffraction patterns of the TiO The diffraction peaks were indexed as pure rutile TiO The average crystallite size of TiO TiO Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed by a LEO 1450VP instrument both on powders and on supported catalysts. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED) were performed using a Jeol 3010 apparatus operated at 300 Photodegradation experiments were carried out in a 600 In the former case the glass fiber was placed inside the batch reactor, sticked to the inner cylindrical walls at 4 Photodegradation was performed by using H TEM micrographs of R100 and R0 powders are reported in Sizes and shapes of rutile and anatase crystals in mixed phase samples (not shown in figure) reflect those observed in the corresponding pure phases.

The photocatalytic data allow to conclude that the reaction mechanism of immobilized and slurry catalysts is the same and, therefore, the stabilization of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the determining step. In particular, in the case of oxidation with H In order to obtain deeper insight into the catalytic mechanism of the PhOH photodegradation catalyzed both by TiO According to this model, it was assumed that the PhOH mineralization to CO A system of first order differential equations describes the variation of PhOH, I and CO When the photodegradation begins, At the beginning of the process, when the term Considering that at the very early stages of reaction the total organic carbon concentration may be assumed On the other hand, at a time When By integrating between By considering that when In It results that at the beginning of PhOH degradation, the kinetic is of apparent zero order ( The values of The fitting of the experimental data by the use of the equations above discussed, demonstrates that the kinetic hypotheses are correctly formulated. Moreover the results show that both The paper reports on the photoactivity of hydrothermal TiO The photocatalytic tests show that immobilized catalysts are active both in partly homogenous (use of H Nevertheless, the immobilization process does not modify the specific catalytic properties of rutile and anatase, investigated in our previous papers Analogously to the slurry catalytic experiments, the very high catalytic activity of rutile when H The morphology of the hydrothermal TiO Authors thank the Cariplo Foundation for the financial support.
