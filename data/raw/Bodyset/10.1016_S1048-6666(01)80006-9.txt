Metaphyseal fractures of the tibia have traditionally been challenging for the treating orthopaedist. The short periarticular fracture segment and tenuous soft-tissue envelope has made internal fixation using traditional open approaches difficult and often fraught with complications. Emphasis on the principle of preservation of the blood supply and atraumatic surgical technique is evolving. The concept of biological fixation can best be illustrated in the use of the intramedullary (IM) nail. Unfortunately, periarticular and intra-articular fractures are difficult to treat with IM nailing. By combining the advantages of the percutaneous techniques of IM nailing with indirect reduction techniques and plating, the concept of percutaneous plating or minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis was developed. The operative technique of percutaneous plating of the tibia, its indications, and a review of the current literature are presented.
