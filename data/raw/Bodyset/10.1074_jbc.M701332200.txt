Mineral crystal nucleation in UMR 106-01 osteoblastic cultures occurs within 15–25-μm extracellular vesicle-containing biomineralization foci (BMF) structures. We show here that BAG-75 and BSP, biomarkers for these foci, are specifically enriched in laser capture microscope-isolated mineralized BMF as compared with the total cell layer. Unexpectedly, fragments of each protein (45–50 kDa in apparent size) were also enriched within captured BMF. When a series of inhibitors against different protease classes were screened, serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl (AEBSF) was the only one that completely blocked mineral nucleation within BMF in UMR cultures. AEBSF appeared to act on an osteoblast-derived protease at a late differentiation stage in this culture model just prior to mineral deposition. Similarly, mineralization of bone nodules in primary mouse calvarial osteoblastic cultures was completely blocked by AEBSF. Cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP was also inhibited at the minimum dosage of AEBSF sufficient to completely block mineralization of BMF. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE comparisons of AEBSF-treated and untreated UMR cultures showed that fragmentation/activation of a limited number of other mineralization-related proteins was also blocked. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP by an AEBSF-sensitive, osteoblast-derived serine protease is associated with mineral crystal nucleation in BMF and suggest that such proteolytic events are a permissive step for mineralization to proceed.Bone is a vascularized tissue that uniquely becomes mineralized as part of its developmental program ( The question of whether bone mineralization is under direct osteoblastic control or whether it is purely a passive chemical process is under active investigation. Schinke A second view focuses on the active role of local extracellular nucleation complexes such as biomineralization foci ( biomineralization foci 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl fetal bovine serum bone sialoprotein bone acidic glycoprotein-75 β-glycerol phosphate bovine serum albumin total cell layer extract from BGP-treated cultures total cell layer extract from cultures not treated with BGP  tandem mass spectrometry liquid chromatography subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 laser capture microscope 1,25-vitamin D 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide minimal essential medium  Bone osteoid is enriched in phosphoproteins, acidic glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, some of which like BSP or its fragments are nucleators of hydroxyapatite crystals ( To better understand the role of BMF in bone mineral nucleation, we have begun to characterize the proteome of mineralized BMF isolated by laser capture microscopy. Our results show that isolated BMF are not only physically enriched in BAG-75 and BSP but also fragments of each. Screening inhibitors of the different classes of proteases revealed for the first time that serine protease inhibitor AEBSF completely blocked cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP, as well as mineral crystal nucleation within BMF. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE comparisons of AEBSF-treated and control cultures suggested that activation of procollagen processing may also be inhibited. Taken together, our results demonstrate an association between serine protease cleavage of mineral nucleator BSP and mineral crystal nucleation within biomineralization foci and mineralization nodules. Antibodies were from several sources as follows: nonimmune rabbit IgG (EMD Biosciences), anti-BAG-75 (number 503) (anti-peptide antibody) rabbit serum (  Primary mouse osteoblasts were isolated from calvaria of 5–7-day-old mice using a modification of the method described previously (             Following capture, ∼6200 pooled BMF were extracted by mixing with 0.1 SDS-PAGE results show substantial enrichment of 75-kDa glycoproteins and phosphoproteins in the BMF extract when compared directly with the +CL control ( Immunoblotting studies ( Results with whole animals indicate that BAG-75 and BSP are two major glycoproteins in rat bone. Specifically, total 4  Only one inhibitor, AEBSF, blocked mineral nucleation in BMF ( To exclude the possibility that the effects of AEBSF were because of cell toxicity, AEBSF-treated and nontreated control cultures were analyzed using the MTT assay, a widely accepted assay for cell viability that measures vital mitochondria ( Previously, we have shown that mineralization of MC3T3 osteoblastic cells and of primary calvarial osteoblasts also occurred at sites enriched in BAG-75 (  Following mineralization, the cell layer was extracted with either a 50 m The 75-kDa glycoprotein band is likely composed of BAG-75 and BSP because they are the only two proteins of this molecular weight in total bone extracts shown to react with digoxygenin-labeled MAA lectin (see As an alternative, a two-step sequential extraction protocol was used. To dissolve mineral crystals and release bound proteins, the cell layer was first extracted for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.05  Consideration of these blots revealed several interesting points. First, full-length BAG-75 and BSP are taken up by the cell layer only in the presence of BGP ( In view of the known affinity of BSP and BAG-75 for hydroxyapatite crystals (  There were no major differences detected between the +BGP and the +BGP + AEBSF-treated cultures for either the urea/CHAPS extract or the media fraction (  The data presented here support the following conclusions about the mechanism of mineral crystal nucleation within spherical extracellular BMF structures. First, UMR cells mineralize equally well in the presence or absence of fetal bovine serum. Second, glycophosphoproteins BAG-75 and BSP are specifically enriched in LCM-captured mineralized BMF as compared with the total cell layer. Fragments of each protein (45–50 kDa in apparent size) were also substantially enriched within BMF. Third, a functional survey of different protease inhibitors showed that AEBSF, a covalent serine protease inhibitor, was able to specifically block mineral nucleation within BMF in UMR 106 cultures and in mineralization nodules in primary calvarial osteoblastic cultures. In the UMR model, the inhibitor was 10-fold more effective if present during the mineralization phase (64–88 h after plating) rather than during the proliferation/differentiation phase (44–64 h after plating). Similarly, in primary osteoblastic cultures, AEBSF appeared to block a step just prior to mineral crystal nucleation. Fourth, when mineralization was blocked by AEBSF, cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP was also inhibited. Furthermore, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE comparisons of UMR culture fractions in the presence and absence of AEBSF identified three other proteins (procollagen C proteinase enhancer protein, membrane-associated rapid-response steroid receptor, and nascent polypeptide associated complex α chain) whose cleavage was also blocked by this inhibitor. Fifth, although BSP and BAG-75 become enriched within BMF during their mineralization, they originally are also present in the media compartment. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that cleavage of BAG-75, BSP, procollagen C proteinase enhancer protein, 1,25-vitamin D Selective proteolysis or fragmentation plays a critical role in many biological processes, Because the identity of the protease responsible for endogenous fragmentation of BSP and BAG-75 in bone is presently unknown, we surveyed a wide range of competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors against serine and cysteine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases. Of all the inhibitors tested, AEBSF was the only one that had a specific effect on mineralization. Some like Pefabloc urokinase-type plasminogen activator were found to block mineralization nonspecifically because of their associated toxicity. This was identified by separate, parallel assays of cell viability. For AEBSF, toxicity was observed only at concentrations 100-fold above those found to completely block mineral nucleation in BMF, In addition to full-length forms, EDTA extracts of the cell layer contained a 50-kDa fragment of BAG-75 and a 45-kDa fragment of BSP under mineralizing conditions only. A major source of BAG-75 and BSP was the conditioned media, because in the absence of BGP, full-length proteins were localized predominantly to the media. We have previously shown that addition of a phosphate source to 64-h cultures (mineralization-competent) is necessary to induce BSP uptake by BMF and their subsequent mineralization ( Protein uptake into the cell layer (and BMF) is a selective process because comparative one-dimensional gel analyses revealed +BGP This is the first report of a serine protease requirement for bone mineral nucleation. Capable of diffusing through bilayer membranes, AEBSF is a covalent serine protease inhibitor. It has been used previously to block trypsin activation of protease-activated receptor in A-549 epithelial cultures ( All five proteins whose cleavage is inhibited by AEBSF are associated directly or indirectly in the process of bone mineralization. BSP is associated with mineralization in bone, teeth, and breast cancer ( 1,25D3-MARRS is a membrane-associated vitamin D-binding protein necessary for calcium and phosphate uptake into the cell for support of bone development ( Finally, nascent polypeptide-associated complex α chain is a large 220-kDa cytosolic protein that translocates newly synthesized polypeptides to the nucleus. A C-terminal fragment of this protein was previously identified in an epithelial cell line ( In summary, the results indicate that cleavage of BAG-75, BSP, 1,25D3-MARRS protein, nascent polypeptide associated complex α chain, and procollagen propeptidase enhancer by an unidentified osteoblast-derived serine protease is associated with mineral nucleation. The fact that both BAG-75 and BSP and their fragments are preferentially localized to mineralizing BMF sites and that inhibition of their cleavage blocks mineral nucleation within BMF suggests that each plays a functional role in this process. Future studies will address the identity of the protease and effect of cleavage on the structure/function of these proteins. J. P.
