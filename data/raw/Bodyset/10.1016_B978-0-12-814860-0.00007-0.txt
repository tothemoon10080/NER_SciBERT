Academia traditionally focuses on the chemical process industries (CPI). This chapter considers some of the industries, processes, and unit operations which fall outside the traditional CPI definition but are still important for the chemical engineer, such as water-based processes, biochemical engineering, solids handling, batch processing, and separation processes. I have spent almost my entire career in water and wastewater process plant design, but many in academia still seem to think this is done by the civil/environmental engineers who predominated in this sector 30 years ago. Teaching methods and materials hardly ever reflect the key role played by process engineers in the design and operation of mineral processing, cement and energy from waste plants, nuclear reactors (including decommissioning and nuclear waste management), power generation (including gas, coal, renewables, etc.), military and defense, automotive and transport, health care, food and drink, semiconductors, and other plants which do not produce “chemicals.” Curiously, both academics and many practitioners in the traditional CPI seem to share the definition of “chemicals” used by green pressure groups, one which excludes “natural” things like food and drink. The consequence of this is that chemical engineering curricula are long on processes important to the CPI of the past, and academic research about a speculative future, but very short on entire industries, processes, and unit operations which have been important employers of chemical engineers as process designers and operations support for many decades. Many of the same academics who think that research, teaching, and 3D printing are kinds of chemical engineering seem to think that the traditional CPI are all there is to “industrial chemical engineering.” So “non-CPI” process engineering doesn’t get so much airtime in most chemical engineering curricula, which are still focused on traditional CPI, even in countries whose CPI moved south-east decades ago. Perhaps this is because lecturers—mostly with no industrial experience—are delivering lectures It is notable that many of the neglected industries operate in the aqueous phase. There is a disconnect between the “green chemistry” initiatives of academic chemistry and chemistry engineering departments; and the process chemistry which they teach; which are still mostly organic chemistry carried out in organic solvents (and which safety and environmental legislation is making harder and harder to use as the basis of industrial process chemistry). In summary, the effect of the academic focus on the “CPI” tends to mean that water, biochemical, solids handling, and batch process engineering are absent from many curricula. These four deficiencies come together in the food/pharmaceutical/bioprocess industries, as they do in the water, food, and drink sectors, but they are still present even in traditional CPI. Water is nonflammable, nonexplosive, and practically nontoxic. Water-based processes therefore tend to support inherent safety, when water replaces an organic solvent. Chemists have become aware of this, and academics promote a kind of “green chemistry,” the parts of which they borrowed from chemical engineering making good process sense. The three principles of “green chemistry” which unambiguously make sense to engineers are:    The others are perhaps more questionable, especially in the hands of academics. (Look up the idea of “green engineering” to see why.) Anyway, water is a great solvent, sometimes called the universal solvent. I’m still learning new things about water and water-based processes after almost 30 years of working with it, as I found when researching my third book (see Further Reading). I was originally a biochemical engineer. When I design biological wastewater treatment plants I still am a biochemical engineer. Dealing with water chemistry and the constraints of a biologically based process are therefore reasonably straightforward for me. I have however trained many chemical engineers, from first-year undergraduates to experienced professionals, and biology is almost always their weakest science. I think this is ultimately to do with the way we select entrants to chemical engineering courses. Based on the distances between subject areas in That is a pity, because biology has a lot to show us about how complex, self-regulating systems can be made to work. It is also a handicap from the point of view of the budding water process engineer, because engineered biological systems are used in both clean and dirty water treatment. You can’t just assume that the biological part of a process plant is like a traditional chemical catalyst. It is alive, and if it dies it will stop working. A fellow engineer commented that the same is true for many chemical catalysts, but there is a key difference. If you treat biology nicely, it will replicate itself so efficiently that you will be The organisms we use in water treatment are many kinds of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and also some higher organisms. The relative importance of these groups varies between types of treatment processes, but it is nearly always bacteria that are responsible for most of the work. All bacteria belong to the group known as prokaryotes, “simpler” organisms without a cell nucleus. Eukaryotic organisms by contrast have a nucleus in the cell. Representatives of this group (colloquially known as higher organisms) important in wastewater treatment include protozoa and rotifers, algae, fungi, worms, snails, and insect larvae in some circumstances. Wastewater treatment might be viewed as “dirty” biological treatment plant design. A mixed culture of all kinds of organisms (including pathogens) is present. This makes it practically impossible to analyze it rigorously from the point of view of first-principles approaches. A cleaner version of biological design is important in drinking water treatment, but the hygienic design of food and drink/biopharma starts from a sterile set of kit and introduces just one type of organism or even a single component of an organism such as an enzyme. Obtaining sterility requires an understanding of how to kill organisms in a controlled and reliable fashion, whilst growing them requires the related knowledge of how to promote their survival and reproduction (see Further Reading). We can further split solids handling into dry and wet solids handling. Graduates tend to know little about either. Wet solids are often physically hard to handle as it is hard to predict rheology from their water/solids content, especially for biological solids. They commonly form variable, non-Newtonian fluids. Dry solids (especially when finely divided) often present toxic, fire, and explosion risks, with the potential for major incidents with multiple fatalities. They also tend to not flow when and how we want them to. Making consistent homogeneous mixtures of powders is also very challenging. Traditionally, much process design was based on batch processes, but equipment tends to be better utilized in a continuous design, so there has long been a general trend toward continuous plant. Batch processing is still, however, very common in low-volume/high-value applications. I have made this section unusually long (with kind assistance from Keith Plumb from IChemE’s Pharma subject group). Although continuous processing is used to make the high tonnage materials produced by the oil and gas, bulk chemical, and water sectors, a far greater volume of materials is produced in batch processes than in continuous ones. In a recent survey carried out in a food ingredient factory, the company was using over 5000 different raw materials. All the small chemical plants using batch processes outnumber the total number of plants running continuous process many times over. Specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food are nearly always made batchwise. Around 25% of chemical engineers work in these sectors, so batch processing is important to chemical engineers. For some process sectors it is critically important. It is not easy to say why batch processing seems to be the poor relation of continuous processes with respect to design textbooks but this is undoubtedly the case. A quick scan of the index of Sinnott and Towler or Perry’s Handbook shows how little space is given to this topic. Sinnott and Towler have three entries in the index, two paragraphs on batch distillation, and nothing on batch heat transfer. Perry does a little better with 14 entries in the index and several pages on some topics. However, this amounts to considerably less than 1% of the content of the handbook (as does this section of my book!). On the face of it, batch processes appear to be simply a scaled-up version of the process that a chemist would use on a laboratory bench. This makes batch processes attractive if you do not want to spend too much time and money on development work. It is easy to get from bench to commercial scale cheaply and quickly if all you are doing is making the kit bigger. For some sectors, such as specialty chemicals and food processing, the huge number of products and, in some cases, the short product life cycle means that getting to commercial scale cheaply and quickly is very important. For pharmaceuticals, getting a product on the market quickly is important because of the limited patent life. In general, at least half of the patent life is lost during clinical trials and process scale-up. Batch processes that can be scaled up quickly are at a distinct advantage. However, once you look at a batch process in detail, it soon becomes clear that in practice it is not as simple as it first appears. The chemistry is frequently poorly understood and the nonsteady-state regime of batch processes makes them difficult to model. Batch processes are therefore quick to scale up but difficult to optimize; and their efficiency is consequently usually far below that of continuous processes. But without substantial investment to understand the process (good old R&D), a company is trapped here. Flexibility is a great advantage of batch processes. If you have a generic set of batch processing equipment then it is often possible to make a wide range of products. Some batch plants make hundreds of different products using similar processing methods and plant. Multipurpose plants can be designed for a generic group of products and are frequently designed without any knowledge of the actual products to be made. This is achieved by using a facility equipped to work with temperatures in the range −100°C to 250°C, pressures from high vacuum to 6 Such plants are often made from highly corrosion-resistant materials such as glass, graphite, and tantalum, to allow them to handle a wide range of chemicals, unknown at the design stage. This great flexibility is the reason why multipurpose plants are subject to close monitoring—they could be used to make illicit drugs or chemical weapons as well as more benign products. Many products in specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and cosmetics are solids or semisolids. These products can be difficult and expensive to handle safely and economically in continuous processes, particularly at a small scale, though the required handling of bulk volumes of solids in batch would tend to make it inherently less safe. In the case of pharmaceuticals, even the smallest scale commercially available continuous solids handling equipment may be of the order of 10 times larger than required. Small-scale batch solids handling equipment is generally much cheaper, less complex, and easier to maintain than continuous equipment. The major advantage of batch processing is that it is possible to identify when the processing of a given sample started and stopped. This means that if the material manufactured does not meet the specifications, it is possible to reject only the particular batch which failed without needing to reject other material. This used to be a highly important part of quality assurance when we depended on end-of-batch analysis and testing for quality assurance. As online analysis becomes increasingly available, batch integrity is becoming a less important part of quality assurance and many products are released based purely on the online analysis. We will require a greater understanding of key performance indicators and how variation in them is likely to affect the end product before this is widely applicable. However, there remains a business risk in relying solely on online analysis and many companies still like to retain batch integrity to minimize their exposure to the consequences of release to market of out-of-specification material. There are two major differences between continuous and batch processes; the nonsteady-state nature of unit operations and the importance of time-related sequences of operations. One of the major differences is that it is not possible to summarize the details of a process using a piping and instrumentation diagram, as you would with a continuous process. It is necessary to have other documents such as PERT or Gantt charts to indicate how the process changes with time. The nonsteady-state nature of batch processing impacts on all unit operations. To illustrate the point, the most important aspects are examined in the next section. If you heat or cool a batch of liquid in a vessel, the temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the batch of material changes with time and so does the outlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid. If you have the simplified case of cooling a homogeneous batch of material with an internal cooling coil then the heat transfer equation becomes:           Even for this relatively simply case, the equation is quite complex and, as can be seen, includes a time parameter. For the fairly common case of using an external heat exchanger and a liquid being fed into the vessel, the equation becomes very complex. In the case of batch distillation, the concentration of the liquid in the reboiler (the batch) will be changing with respect to time as the more volatile components are driven off. This means that the temperature in the reboiler will rise over time and the concentration of components in the fractionating column will change with time. To maintain the required product concentration at the top of the column, the reflux ratio has to be increased over time. A point will be reached where it is no longer possible to maintain the top concentration, and distillation will have to stop or the top product be diverted to a separate receiver. Batch distillation can be used to produce multiple fractions, but instead of the flows being taken off at different points in the fractionating column, as they would be in a continuous process, the fractions are determined by time. In a steady-state continuous-stirred tank reactor the conditions remain constant within the reactor, but in a batch reactor, concentration, temperature, pressure, viscosity, density, etc. can change with time. An agitator which was appropriate at the start of the process may be much less suitable at its end. The contents of the vessel may be more heterogeneous than in a continuous process, and different parts of the batch will consequently see different reaction conditions during the period of the reaction. This is one of the reasons why apparently simple batch reactions are in fact very complex. This lack of homogeneity usually becomes more of a problem as the scale increases and it is increasingly likely that unexpected reactions occur that have a serious impact on product quality. To be able to calculate the capacity of a batch plant it is necessary to consider the sequence of operations and whether these operations take place in series or in parallel. Most batch processing plants have a number of parallel streams of the same series of operations. The plant capacity is usually based on marketing demand forecasts for the products that the plant is being designed to manufacture. Keith Plumb tells me that the only thing that you can know with absolute certainty about such forecasts is that they will be wrong. The design tools for batch sequencing and capacity calculations are similar to those used for engineering project management, that is, a combination of Gantt and PERT charts. However, instead of basing the charts on flows of resources, they are based on mass flows and document the mass and energy balance. The energy balance will be based on the heating and cooling requirements for reactions, distillation, and other unit operations, as is the case for continuous plants. However, the process sequence will determine where and when energy needs to be input to or removed from the system. The input and removal of energy will be time-dependent and nonsteady-state, which makes energy recovery difficult. Heat integration techniques are even less appropriate to batch process plant design than continuous process design. Even working out accurate predictions of working utility requirements is impossible, as the system is too poorly characterized for these to have any certainty. The simplest (and least wrong) approach is to calculate the maximum utility requirements for the worst-case scenario of process steps coinciding and then apply a “diversity factor,” basically a guess of how much of the maximum possible load will occur in practice based on practical experience of batch processes. This is not always done well, and some plants are consequently constrained by lack of utility supply, requiring additional capacity to be retrofitted. In other cases, too large a capacity with insufficient turndown is supplied, leading to controllability and efficiency problems requiring remedy. Despite there being many remaining problems in the field of batch design, it is still very popular in certain sectors, and there are a multitude of successful batch processes in operation today. Many students leave university with knowledge of only six to ten separation processes, usually those most important in oil refining, and the knowledge they have of these processes is mostly at best engineering science. Processes based in chemistry are overrepresented in university courses, as are liquid/liquid separations. The consequent lack of knowledge of options impoverishes the designer’s imagination, and a lack of understanding of engineering design practice prevents practical use of technologies.  For a more extensive and exhaustive treatment of all unit operations, I recommend Couper (see Further Reading) as a first port of call.
