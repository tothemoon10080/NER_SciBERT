                     N layers grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The misfit dislocations in the highly mismatched In0.33Ga0.66N/GaN system are generated not only at the InGaN/GaN interface but also within an InGaN layer. It indicates that the InGaN layer in the interface is partially relaxed and the considerable residual strain is relaxed within the InGaN layer. In addition, we observed that stacking faults formed by stacking order mismatch between sub-grains play the role of a seed in the formation of misfit dislocations within a high indium content In

The mechanically polished samples were finally ion-milled. We used a Gatan DuoMill 660 DIF with sector speed control at an acceleration voltage of 5 As shown in the HRXRD curve of  For analysis of the formation and arrangement of the misfit dislocations due to the lattice mismatch, the HRTEM image was studied.
