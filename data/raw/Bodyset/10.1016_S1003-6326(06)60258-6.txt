Computer simulation for materials processing needs a huge database containing a great deal of various physical properties of materials. In order to employ the accumulated large data on materials heat treatment in the past years, it is significant to develop an intelligent database system. Based on the data mining technology for data analysis, an intelligent database web tool system of computer simulation for heat treatment process named as IndBASEweb-HT was built up. The architecture and the arithmetic of this system as well as its application were introduced.
