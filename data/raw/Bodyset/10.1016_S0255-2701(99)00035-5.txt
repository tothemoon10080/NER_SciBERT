In the preface to his book, Martin Rhodes writes: The textbook meets these objectives very well and the target readership will be well satisfied. The book is organised into 12 chapters starting with a chapter on the principal tools needed in particle technology Single particles in a fluid Multiple particle systems Particle size analysis Fluid flow through a packed bed of particles Fluidisation Pneumatic transport and standpipes Separation of particles from a gas: gas cyclones Storage and flow of powdersâ€”hopper design Mixing and segregation Particle size reduction Size enlargement Fire and explosion hazards of fine powders All chapters of the book are didactically organised in the same way. After deriving and presenting the facts, each chapter contains a number of worked examples which are instructive and which demonstrate the application of the presented facts to technologically relevant design problems. A number of exercises concludes each chapter. The book as a whole contains 37 worked examples and the student will definitely appreciate this wealth. Above that, his collection of worked examples may be a good source of ideas for teachers who are preparing instructive examples for lectures in the field of particle technology. In addition to worked examples, Rhodes includes in total 80 exercises in the book. The correct answers to these exercises are given, but not the path to their solution. I am convinced that this book will be welcomed not only by students, but also by practising engineers who are not specialised in particle technology, but who have to solve engineering problems in this field.
