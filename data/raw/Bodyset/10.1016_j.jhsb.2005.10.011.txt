Re: A randomised comparison of locking and non-locking palmar plating for unstable Colles’ fractures in the elderly, Koshimune et al., Journal of Hand Surgery, 2005, 30B: 499–503. I read with interest this article: the authors are to be congratulated for their admirable attempt to introduce scientific evidence into our practice by undertaking a randomized study of distal radial fracture fixation. I found the title confusing. Abraham Colles described a fracture of the distal radius “which takes place about an inch and a half above the carpal extremity of the radius” ( It was not clear to me what is implied by the inclusion criterion “failure of closed reduction”. This could be due to failure of initial reduction, re-displacement or both. Quite often, failure is because of a poorly attempted initial reduction, performed by a relatively inexperienced junior doctor, or a poorly moulded cast. It would have been useful if a statement had been made indicating how quality control was ensured. I would also appreciate some information regarding the follow-up protocol following initial closed reduction, including the radiological criteria employed for success, or failure, of closed reduction. AO type C1 and 2 (complete articular – simple and multifragmentary metaphysis) fractures were also treated initially by closed reduction and were only recruited into the series because of “failed closed reduction”. I had understood that instability of distal radial fractures can be predicted on presentation – age and metaphyseal comminution being the most important criteria ( Finally, were the patients blinded? I do not think this would have been difficult to achieve.
