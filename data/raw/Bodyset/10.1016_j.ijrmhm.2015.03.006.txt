The Mo–Si–B alloy has been in the spotlight as a promising alternative to Ni-based superalloys due to its superior thermal resistance and mechanical properties. In particular, the mechanical properties of the Mo–Si–B alloy are sensitively influenced by the mutual distribution of the ductile α-Mo phase and brittle intermetallic compound phases such as Mo5SiB2 (T2) and Mo3Si (A15). For the Mo–Si–B alloy to possess an excellent fracture toughness, ductile α-Mo phase should form a continuous phase with the uniformly distributed intermetallic compound phases.
                  In this study, a core–shell intermetallic powder composed of nano-sized α-Mo particles surrounding intermetallic compound particles was fabricated using Mo–Si–B intermetallic compound powders prepared through the mechano-chemical method and the chemical vapor transport (CVT) process of Mo oxide powder. Also, the Mo–Si–B alloy, which has a continuous α-Mo phase uniformly embedded by intermetallic compound phases, was fabricated by the pressureless sintering of the core–shell intermetallic powder.Since the 1930s, Ni-based superalloys have been used for gas turbine components such as the blade and vane because of their outstanding oxidation resistance and mechanical properties at high temperatures. However, the temperatures available for Ni-based superalloys are restricted to those less than 1150 In order to address these problems, many researchers have studied various materials to replace Ni-based superalloys. Research has been conducted using refractory metals that have melting points exceeding 2000 In recent research, a Mo–Si–B alloy comprised of three phases (Mo However, these intermetallic compound phases have a critical problem in that brittle fracture is likely to occur because of their low fracture toughness. On the other hand, the α-Mo phase is very vulnerable to oxidation at high temperature, but it has a high ductility, which contributes to the fracture toughness. Therefore, in order to simultaneously obtain the desired oxidation resistance and mechanical properties, a microstructure of fine intermetallic compound phases uniformly distributed in a continuous matrix of α-Mo phase is required Various studies on the control of microstructure have been carried out to date. Currently, techniques used to fabricate Mo–Si–B alloys are mainly divided into casting methods and powder metallurgy methods. However, in the case of casting methods such as arc melting, the fracture toughness of the fabricated alloy is low because it is difficult to form a microstructure with a continuous matrix phase of α-Mo. Further, there is the possibility of forming a non-equilibrium phase. In order to maintain an equilibrium phase, constant heat must be applied. However, when applying the heat, it is difficult to control the microstructure due to grain coarsening Also, it is easier to control the microstructure when using the powder metallurgy method than it is when using the casting method. However, there is a limit to forming a continuous α-Mo phase and oxidation can occur in the process To fabricate a Mo–Si–B alloy with an ideal microstructure, we prepared Mo–Si–B intermetallic compound powders (Mo Starting powders of MoO For the fabrication of the core–shell intermetallic powder, synthesized Mo–Si–B intermetallic compound powders and MoO After the ball-milling process, the MoO The phases of the sintered body and reduction of MoO A ball-milling process was carried out to fabricate the core–shell intermetallic powder with Mo–Si–B intermetallic compound powders and MoO In order to fabricate a core–shell intermetallic powder with α-Mo particles surrounding the surface of the intermetallic compound particles via reduction of MoO As a result of conducting the hydrogen reduction, as shown in XRD peak of  However, the CVT process represented by the reactions shown below occurs when MoO In these reactions, the vapor phase of MoO  In order to investigate the effect of sintering temperature on the sintering behavior, pressureless sintering was carried out at temperatures of 1200 Furthermore, as a result of image analysis using additional SEM image from the same sintered body, evaluated volume fraction of α-Mo phase was about 58  In previous research In this study, to fabricate a Mo–Si–B alloy with enhanced mechanical properties, a core–shell intermetallic powder consisting of α-Mo particles surrounding the intermetallic compound particles was prepared by a mechano-chemical process and a CVT process.
