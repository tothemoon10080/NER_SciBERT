TiB2 powder, with different binders (Ni and Ni/Mn), after milling were cold compacted (300MPa) and sintered in H2 at 1300 and 1350°C for 1h. To improve the sintering behaviour, TiC/Mo2C alloy carbide was added and the milled charge along with the same binders (Ni and Ni/Mn) was cold compacted and sintered under similar conditions. Sintered density, porosity, transverse rupture strength (TRS), grain size and lattice parameter of binder and hard phases were measured. Better densification was observed with Ni/Mn binder as compared to Ni binder for either hard phase based systems. Maximum value of TRS was noted for TiB2–TiC–Mo2C–40wt.% Ni/Mn cermet. Melt exudation was observed for either hard phase based systems with Ni binder.TiB During liquid phase sintering of TiB Since TiB The starting material used to fabricate green bodies were commercially available TiB Sintering was performed in a silicon carbide resistance heated tubular furnace in dry H The transverse rupture strength (TRS) of sintered specimens was evaluated in the three point bending test using a fixture containing 5  The difference between sintering behaviour of TiB   A typical X-ray diffraction scan for TiB The effect of Ni binder content on sintered density of 50TiB   Grain size of boride phase for some of the cermets with Ni and Ni/Mn binders are given in Lattice parameter variation of TiB The results on the effect of different binder addition on both types of ceramic systems are schematically summarized in Though the exudation of nickel occurs in both TiB The replacement of nickel binder with nickel–manganese enhances densification due to its better wetting and solubility ratio compared to nickel. Because of lower melting point of nickel–manganese alloy (1020°C) compared to nickel (1453°C), a significant reduction in viscosity results in a better densification. Due to the above stated facts, there is not much difference in the densification and microstructure characteristics of cermets containing Ni/Mn binder. Increasing the binder content enhances the amount of liquid phase which facilitates in grain growth of TiB In case of TiB Considering the results and discussion of the present investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn.
