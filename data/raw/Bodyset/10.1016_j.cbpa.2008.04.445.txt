Calcareous skeletons are produced in a complex mineralization process which is biologically controlled and genetically programmed. Bivalves are ideal candidates for climate change induced effect studies due to their incremental shell deposition and their potential for high temporal resolution reconstructions. In order to assess climatic influences on ecosystems, evaluation of thermal limits of certain species and their ability to cope with thermal stress is required. This allows to better estimate effects such as the predicted global decrease of biological CaCO
