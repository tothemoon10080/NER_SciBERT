The quality of the state estimation of a process and consequently its safety and control are conditioned by the number and the distribution of its measurements. The availability and reliability of a process can be increased if the latter can work even during the failure of the sensors. In this paper, we present and we formalise the multiple redundancy notion which permits the toleration of sensor failure without harming the observability of a given variable. We shall propose a sensor placement to obtain a given redundancy degree at the lowest cost. So, we can analyse the influence of the redundancy degree of a variable on the reliability of the process.
