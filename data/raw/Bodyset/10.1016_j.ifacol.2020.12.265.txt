The authors discuss the problem of how to monitor the coal/water pulsating bed in a jig with the use of a radiation density meter. The dynamic measurement error of changes in density depends on the time of measurement; its optimal value can be found for a given shape of density changes. An alternative method of the signal filtration is proposed using variable time of measurement during a cycle of pulsations as a function of the time derivative of the density changes. The shape of the density changes during one cycle varies slowly from a cycle to a cycle. This is why the time derivative of the density determined during one cycle can be used in the subsequent cycle to adapt periodically the algorithm generating the variable times of measurement during each cycle. The above time derivative can be calculated from the polynomial fit of stochastic data measured during the previous cycle. In this case, the dynamic error of the measurement MSE can be reduced significantly compared to the optimal constant time of the measurement. This methodology of signal filtration was applied in the simulation model and the results of simulation were compared with field measurements taken with the use of a conventional radiometric density meter.
