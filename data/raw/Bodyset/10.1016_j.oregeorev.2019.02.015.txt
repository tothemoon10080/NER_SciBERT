The Highland Valley Copper porphyry Cu-(Mo) centers compose Canada’s largest porphyry Cu mining district, and are hosted in plutonic rocks of the Late Triassic Guichon Creek batholith in the Quesnel terrane, British Columbia. Here we evaluate the relationship between variations in magnetic susceptibility and alteration in order to define a footprint around the porphyry Cu centers using a district-scale dataset of 1610 minimally weathered outcrops and 11,432 magnetic susceptibility measurements. Statistical analysis of the outcrop-based measurements revealed changes in outcrop geometric mean magnetic susceptibility and the coefficient of variation (extent of variability in relation to the mean) are proportional to vein frequency and altered rock volume estimates. At a confidence interval of 95% and 9 degrees of freedom, the average standard error (uncertainty) of the geometric mean and coefficient of variation from 10 magnetic susceptibility outcrop measurements is 7.3% and 13.2%, respectively. Modeling of outcrop magnetic susceptibility data shows that domains of coefficient of variation of >0.3 extend 1–4 km away from the porphyry centers, whereas pronounced susceptibility lows of <10 × 10−3 SI have a smaller footprint centered on the Cu-mineralization. The magnitude of change of magnetic susceptibility coefficient of variation between protolith and altered rocks in the porphyry Cu footprint is greater than the corresponding change in susceptibility geometric means. Thus, with some caveats, variability in magnetic susceptibility provides a good signal that corresponds to vein and alteration intensity, and can potentially be used to map ore-forming processes and to vector to porphyry Cu centers.Ground and airborne magnetic methods have long been used in porphyry Cu exploration at a wide range of scales ( The volume of hydrothermally altered rocks around Cu-Fe-sulfide mineralization in porphyry deposits is termed “the footprint”. An understanding of how veins and alteration relate to changes in host-rock magnetic susceptibility in the porphyry Cu footprint is critical to developing better exploration tools, and models for ore-forming processes. Four major porphyry Cu-(Mo) systems, hosted in the Late Triassic Guichon Creek batholith (GCB), occur in the Highland Valley Copper (HVC) district in British Columbia; which collectively are Canada’s largest and longest operating porphyry Cu mining district ( The host-rocks to porphyry Cu systems are commonly andesitic volcanic rocks and/or intermediate composition intrusions that are magnetite-bearing ( Physical property analysis of drill core from calc-alkalic porphyry Cu systems in British Columbia show that quartz-sericite-bearing alteration assemblages have lower magnetic susceptibilities when compared to their intrusive and volcanic host-rocks ( We hypothesize that hydrothermal alteration around porphyry Cu systems can be characterized by not only lower susceptibilities, but also by a higher degree of magnetic variation than is normal for the typical porphyry Cu system host-rocks (volcanic and intrusive). At HVC we test whether the variation in magnetic susceptibility readings at individual outcrops can be related to vein and alteration intensity, and critically, whether a measure of susceptibility variation forms a district-scale footprint that is spatially associated with mapped alteration and the porphyry Cu centers. An underlying caveat, however, is that a set of outcrop susceptibility measurements is taken within a single rock type, and that vein fill and altered rock halos have a different response than the host-rock. A second and important caveat is that surface measurements of provide meaningful, and representative, estimates of rock magnetic susceptibility. In Canada surface weathering of outcrops is minimal and insignificant primarily because most rock surfaces were scoured during the most recent glacial period (<15,000 years). For localities with deep weathering profiles, rock susceptibility measurements should be collected on fresh drill-core samples. A detailed investigation of the link between alteration mineralogy and changes in the protolith magnetic properties is beyond the scope of this contribution. The allochthonous Quesnel terrane in the Canadian Cordillera is characterized by Mesozoic island-arc assemblages comprised of volcanic and sedimentary rocks and associated intrusions ( In the HVC porphyry centers, chalcopyrite, bornite, and localized molybdenite occurs with 1) veinlets and discontinuous fracture fill of quartz with K-feldspar halos (potassic alteration); 2) quartz with coarse-grained muscovite halos (coarse-muscovite early-halo veins; potassic-sericitic transition); and with 3) pervasive and fracture-controlled fine-grained sericite–chlorite (sericitic) alteration ( Magnetic susceptibility measurements were collected using KT-10 magnetic susceptibility meters at outcrops adjacent to the Bethlehem pit, and throughout the district. Teck Resources Limited provided district-scale outcrop susceptibility measurements from its property, which was augmented by data collected by the Canadian Mining Innovation Council (CMIC) Footprints Project researchers ( To permit direct comparison of the lithology, vein and alteration features, unobscured flat and minimally weathered outcrops adjacent with Bethlehem pit were chosen as the study site ( Bulk magnetic susceptibility in igneous rocks has a lognormal distribution and the geometric mean is a more meaningful term for assessing the population differences between rocks than using the arithmetic mean ( Two interpolant methods in The IDW interpolant is a deterministic model which assumes that each measured point has a local influence that diminishes with distance ( The interpolant raster products were converted to polygons for ease of symbolizing and to display with additional data sets. The coefficient of variation values are symbolized using the percentiles intervals: 0-60th, 60-65th, 65-70th, 70-75th, 75-80th, 80-85th, 85-90th, 90-95th, 95-97th, and >97th. The rationale for the chosen intervals is presented below. The outcrop magnetic susceptibility interpolant was symbolized using geometric intervals. The host-rock at the Bethlehem study site is the Guichon granodiorite, a homogenous, equigranular, hornblende, biotite and magnetite bearing granodiorite ( Magnetic susceptibility values at the Bethlehem study site range between 0.6 × 10 The cumulative frequency of the magnetic susceptibilities from each map zone was calculated to assess at which values the zones differ ( The changes in magnetic susceptibility response correlate with changes in vein frequency and estimated altered rock volume. Based on the magnetic susceptibility geometric mean per map zone ( By comparing the magnetic susceptibility geometric data of each zone to the corresponding values for map zone 1, an absolute relative change term (ARC%) can be used to measure the relative change as a function of distance from the pit margin. The ARC% of the magnetic susceptibility means between zone 1 and 4 is ∼34%, however, the ARC% of their coefficient of variation is ∼154%, a considerably stronger signal. The ARC% of the magnetic susceptibility mean and coefficient of variation values for zones 2 and 3 lie between that of zones 1 and 4 ( Repeatability of measurements refers to the variation in repeat measurements made on the same subject under identical conditions. Individual magnetic susceptibility measurements were collected from the same outcrop but were not taken in exactly the same location. Subsequently, this analysis of uncertainty refers to reproducibility; the variation in measurements made on a subject under changing conditions. By collecting ten sets of ten magnetic susceptibility measurements for each of the mapped zones ( At a confidence interval of 95% and 9 (n-1) degrees of freedom, the average standard error of the geometric mean from 10 magnetic susceptibility measurements from the 4 map zones is 7.3% ( An alternative and visual way to evaluate the reproducibility of magnetic susceptibility measurements, and subsequent mean and coefficient of variation, is to test the data on minimum–maximum plots ( The orientation, vein fill width, alteration halo width, vein frequency per meter, and mineralogy are recorded for vein sets exposed in 743 outcrops in the Guichon Creek batholith. The vein fill and alteration halo widths were added and then multiplied by their corresponding frequency per meter. This product was then summed for each vein set, independent of mineralogy and orientation, to estimate the altered rock volume percentage (%) at each individual outcrop. The frequency distribution of altered rock volume % for outcrops in the Guichon Creek batholith has a log normal distribution ( Results from the outcrop study site at Bethlehem demonstrate that as the altered rock volume % increases the magnetic susceptibility variability also increases. There is a similar relationship between the altered rock volume % and the corresponding magnetic susceptibility geometric mean and coefficient of variation in the district outcrop data set ( Hand samples of the least altered host-rocks in the GCB show a wide range of magnetic susceptibilities from the oldest peripheral more mafic rocks (units 1–3; fresh rocks with geometric mean >50 × 10 a mix of fresh and altered rocks with susceptibilities between ∼15 and 50 × 10 altered rocks and aplite, or leucocratic dikes, that have a low magnetic susceptibility geometric mean <∼15 × 10 Magnetite replacement of primary hornblende or biotite, or as a vein precipitate, associated with potassic alteration is very rare at Highland Valley ( A total of 1160 outcrops with an average of 7.2 magnetic susceptibility measurements per outcrop are included in histogram and cumulative frequency plots ( The data points on a cross-plot of the district outcrop geometric mean and coefficient of variation values form an approximate inverted U-shape ( fresh and weakly altered outcrops that have susceptibilities >15 × 10 outcrops with high variability and susceptibilities >15 × 10 outcrops with high variability and low susceptibilities <15 × 10 outcrops that have both low variability and <15 × 10 A high density of outcrops with a coefficient of variation >0.395 occur around the Valley, Lornex, Highmont, and, to a lesser extent, Bethlehem porphyry centers compared to elsewhere in the district (green and orange symbols; There is a paucity of data from in the Valley and Lornex porphyry centers themselves, however, outcrop susceptibility domains less than ∼10 × 10 Anomaly 1, apparent in both coefficient of variation interpolants ( The mean and coefficient of variation of outcrop magnetic susceptibility measurements can be used to assess alteration intensity in the HVC porphyry Cu footprints. Outcrops with a coefficient of variation greater than ∼0.4 and susceptibilities below ∼15 × 10 Domains of outcrops with elevated coefficient of variation are interpreted to be primarily caused by alteration focused in fractures sets related to cooling in the pluton and permeability generated by the porphyry Cu systems. Hydrothermal alteration processes, focused in and adjacent to fractures, are interpreted to have decreased host-rock susceptibilities by either oxidation of primary magnetite or metasomatic removal of Fe-Ti oxides, or a combination of these processes (e.g., incipient fracturing, vein fill, and development of alteration halos initially increases outcrop magnetic heterogeneity and coefficient of variation without a significant reduction in mean susceptibility; higher fracture density and interconnectivity further increases coefficient of variation but also causes a distinct reduction in mean susceptibility; a sufficient volume of rock is altered to further reduce the mean susceptibility, but also begin to re-homogenize the magnetic response causing a decrease in coefficient of variation (downward inflection in the arrow in at very high fracture density and when fracture halos overlap (pervasive alteration), the outcrop has a homogenously low mean susceptibility, and subsequent low coefficient of variation. In the GCB, the coefficient of variation of outcrop-scale magnetic susceptibility measurements is a proxy for abundance of fracture-controlled magnetite destructive alteration. When modeled, the coefficient of variation increases towards Cu mineralization and generally corresponds with higher altered rock volume % estimated from mapping. A larger and more coherent domain of >75th percentile coefficient of variation is present east of the Lornex and Highmont porphyry centers compared to the area directly west of Valley ( Northwest and northeast trending coefficient of variation anomalies are evident in the IDW and EBK interpolants. These trends are consistent with the orientation of Cu mineralization and porphyry dikes in the Highland Valley district ( The generation of permeability is critical for ore formation in porphyry systems ( Domains of outcrops that exhibit coefficient of variation >0.3 extend 1–4 km away from the porphyry centers at HVC and form a larger footprint than magnetic susceptibility lows. Measuring outcrop magnetic susceptibility coefficient of variation and mapping the anomalies is a valid method to delineate high variability magnetic signal around porphyry Cu systems caused by alteration ( Mapping outcrop magnetic susceptibility coefficient of variation could be useful data to accompany, and be a proxy for, vein density and mineral assemblage mapping. Susceptibility variation anomalies should be reviewed in conjunction with lithological and alteration information in order to differentiate those associated with 1) favorable alteration facies and 2) mineral vectors towards porphyry mineralization, from 3) less prospective regional alteration features ( Uncertainty in the mean and coefficient of variation values from 10 susceptibility measurements per ∼10 m Funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council of Canada ( None   μ = arithmetic mean or average. σ = arithmetic standard deviation. μ σ Simple CV = Simple coefficient of variation (relative standard deviation) = CV Geometric CV = CV Geometric CV Standard error of the mean = ARC = absolute relative change = (x-reference value/reference value)*100.
