The electrochemical behavior of palladium (II) in nitric acid was studied using various electrochemical techniques. The cyclic voltammogram of palladium (II) recorded at Pt electrode presented a series of electrochemical reactions corresponding to the redox behavior of palladium. SEM images of palladium obtained by electrolysis revealed the dendrite growth, which was uniform all over the entire surface of Pt electrode. The recovery ratios of palladium at different nitric acid concentrations were high, and the Faradic efficiency decreased as the nitric acid concentration was increased, which might be due to the reduction of nitric or H+ ions. The reduction of palladium (II) was irreversible and stirring during electrolysis could improve the electrodeposition rate.
