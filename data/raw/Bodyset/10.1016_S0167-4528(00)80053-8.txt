Magnetic separation is a very well developed area. However the conventional magnetic separation methods do not have the ability to classify the particles as they are being separated. We have designed a new magnetic separator and classifier, which (besides the new magnetic separation process) enables the classification of the magnetic particles as they are being separated. In this paper, this new magnetic separator and classifier is presented, and its operation principles are described. As the mode of operation depends on the goal selected, two typical cases are analysed: separation and classification of paramagnetic materials of the same nature (constitution) but with different degrees of purity, and separation-classification of paramagnetic materials by material constitution. Finally, some of the economical advantages of using the new magnetic separator and classifier, and the two different case studies, are pointed out.
