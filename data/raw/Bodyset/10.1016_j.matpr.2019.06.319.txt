Metal matrix composites are bringing extremely good thermal energy associated with high impact, ductility and toughness at higher temperature. These characteristic features of MMCs are most desirable for design, aerospace and automobile applications. The aim of this investigation is to study about the microstructures and mechanical properties of aluminium 7075 with tungsten carbide (WC) reinforced matrix composite. In this varying of WC content (1.5, 3, 4.5 and 6 wt. %) with aluminium 7075 and composites were prepared by stir casting process. Prepared composites were tested Microstructures, hardness, tensile strength and impact strength. when there is increasing wc reinforcements in aluminium(Al)7075 matrix it was found that hardness, tensile strength were increased and Decreased Impact strength. at 6wt% of wc. Microstructure observations are carried out non-homogeneous distribution of wc particles in the Al matrix and also Porosities were observed in microstructures
