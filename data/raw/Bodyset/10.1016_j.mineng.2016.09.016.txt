The effects of independent variables such as, temperature, concentration of ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hydrogen sulphate, [bmim][HSO4]), chloride and sulphuric acid on copper extraction from chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) ore were studied by surface optimization methodology. The Central Composite Face approach and a quadratic model were applied to the experimental design. The optimal copper extraction conditions given by the above methodology were 20% (v/v) of [bmim][HSO4] in water, 100gL−1 chloride, and 90°C. The concentration of chloride and the temperature together exert a synergistic effect in enhancing chalcopyrite dissolution. Experimental data were fitted by multiple regression analysis to a quadratic equation and analyzed statistically. A model was developed for predicting copper extraction from CuFeS2 ore with variables such as Cl−, [bmim][HSO4], H2SO4 concentrations and temperature in the range studied. The activation energy was calculated to be 60.4kJ/mol (temperature range 30–90°C), indicative of chemical control of the reaction and [bmim][HSO4] acts as an acid in the reaction.CuFeS Ionic liquids (ILs) are receiving considerable attention due to their potential uses in, for example, synthesis, separations, catalysis, electrochemistry, and extraction and separation of nonferrous metals ( More specifically, it has been reported that imidazolium-based ILs have lower surface tension than water. Surface tension influences the adsorption of liquids by porous solids and decreases the “solid-solution hydrophobic resistance to electron transfer, thus enabling continuous acid leaching of the solid surface” ( For this study, the IL [bmim][HSO The CuFeS The IL selected for study, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulphate, ([bmim][HSO Leaching tests were conducted in glass reactors of 50 In addition to the XRD mineralogical analysis, leached residues and the CuFeS The effect of independent variables such as: concentration of [bmim][HSO The general form of the model is:       b The variable values are codified in the model. The following equation is used for transforming a real value (z The statistical values of R Kinetic studies were undertaken with a mixed [bmim][HSO The results showed that the stirring speed impacts on Cu extraction from CuFeS One of the goals of this study was to determine the effects of temperature, [bmim][HSO Based on the data obtained and ANOVA analysis, it was shown that H The ANOVA test indicated that the quadratic model derived from RSM is adequate for describing the Cu extraction under the range of operating conditions used. No lack of fit was obtained in any case and values of R  In response surface plots, Higher leaching kinetics were measured for solutions containing chloride, compared with those for solutions without chloride, that is containing only [bmim][HSO When the leaching residues were analyzed by SEM-EDS, it was found that the sulphide was oxidized to elemental sulphur when chloride was added ( Due to the presence of elemental sulphur as a reaction product as well as the dissolved oxygen in the solution which is reported to act as an oxidant, a possible reaction of leaching of CuFeS The pH values of IL 20% v/v solutions are similar to H In comparison with the unleached CuFeS The kinetic studies were carried out at different temperatures, in the range of 30–90 Experimental data for Cu extraction from CuFeS At atmospheric pressure, the variables chloride concentration and temperature together exert a synergistic effect in enhancing Cu extraction from CuFeS The ionic liquid studied acts as an acid in chalcopyrite leaching where chloride ions enhanced its proton activity from [HSO Experimental results from the CuFeS The authors thank INNOVA CORFO Projects CSIRO-Chile 10 CEII-9007 and the Australian Government through
