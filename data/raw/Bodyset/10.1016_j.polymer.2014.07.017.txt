A versatile gas phase mineralization process affords nanosheets containing a functionalized graphene (FG) core and a thin silica shell. The number of cycles, exposing FG to sequenced tetrachlorosilane and water vapors, controls the silica content and the silica shell thickness. The resulting high surface area core/shell nanosheets, containing 22 to 34 wt.-% silica, are used to immobilize single-site catalysts. During polymerization, the FG/silica nanosheets are uniformly dispersed in ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene. This catalytic polymerization filling process, exploiting the encapsulation of graphene in a silica shell, is of interest to prepare electrically insulating carbon/polyolefin composite materials with high thermal conductivity useful in lightweight engineering.Functionalized Graphene (FG) consists of a single carbon layer of the graphite lattice with honeycomb-like arrangement of sp Herein we report on a facile gas phase mineralization of FG to produce FG/silica hybrids as core/shell nanosheet catalyst support for olefin polymerization which enables the All reactions involving air- and/or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out under a dry argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques and a glove box (MBraun MB 150B-G-II). Tetrachlorosilane (99%), divinylbenzene (80%), vinylbenzyl trimethylammonium chloride (99%), methylaluminoxane (MAO, 10 wt.-% in toluene), triisobutylaluminum (TiBAl, 1 M in hexane) and 2,6-di- The silica content of the mineralized functionalized graphene (FG-SiO Synthesis of the silica nanofoam was performed according to a modified literature procedure FG was obtained by thermal reduction of graphite oxide (GO) at 750 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere as described elsewhere For the synthesis of the FG/Silica core/shell nanosheets (FG-SiO The glass reactor was evacuated to ∼20 mbar and the connection to the Schlenk line was closed. The valve to the SiCl Typically, 40 mg of the support was dried Polymerizations were carried out in a 200 ml steel reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a thermostat. The reactor was filled with While conventional sol/gel processes afford spherical nanoparticles, the mineralization of FG nanosheets, serving as templates for the sol/gel reaction, forms high surface area anisotropic core/shell nanosheets containing a graphene core and a silica shell (see On increasing the number of mineralization cycles from 5 to 20, the silica content increased from 22 to 33wt.-% (see Following the synthetic strategy displayed in In conclusion, the gas phase mineralization by sequenced exposure of FG to tetrachlorosilane and water enables the shape replication of FG, thus forming high surface area silica nanosheets containing a graphene core. The number of the mineralization cycles governs both silica content and silica layer thickness. These FG/silica hybrids form highly active catalysts for ethylene polymerization when the surface is treated with MAO prior to immobilization of The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support by the The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
