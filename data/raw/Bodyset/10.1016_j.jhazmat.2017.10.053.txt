Recalcitrant dyes present in effluents constitute a major environmental concern due to their hazardous properties that may cause deleterious effects on aquatic organisms. Tartrazine is a widely-used dye, and it is known to be resistant to biological and chemical degradation processes and by its carcinogenic and mutagenic nature. This study presents the use of TiO2 (P25) nanoparticles immobilized into a poly(vinylidenefluoride–trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF–TrFE)) membrane to assess the photocatalytic degradation of this dye in a solar photoreactor. The nanocomposite morphological properties were analyzed, confirming an interconnected porous microstructure and the homogeneous distribution of the TiO2 nanoparticles within the membrane pores. It is shown that the nanocomposite with 8wt% TiO2 exhibits a remarkable sunlight photocatalytic activity over five hours, with 78% of the pollutant being degraded. It was also demonstrated that the degradation follows pseudo-first-order kinetics model at low initial tartrazine concentration. Finally, the effective reusability of the produced nanocomposite was also assessed.Water pollution caused by organic chemicals from textile, paper, plastic, leather, food, and mineral processing industries is a growing problem In this context, the development of low-cost and efficient advanced water treatment technologies are urgently needed. There has been significant research on applying photocatalysis for water treatment due to their efficient degradation of organic compounds Further, together with photocatalytic treatments, membrane processes have also been increasingly applied to treat waste effluents from industry. Membrane separation processes have shown to be competitive with other separation processes regarding energy costs, material recovery, environmental friendliness, and for being simple to integrate into processes for selective removal of impurities Many of the most used membranes are based on polymeric materials, mostly for being mechanically stable, chemically inert, inexpensive and easily accessible The principal goal of this work is to demonstrate the suitability and reusability of photocatalytic TiO Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene), (P(VDFTrFE)) 70/30 was purchased to Solvay (Belgium). Titanium dioxide (TiO The poly(vinylidene difluoride)-co-trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) membranes containing titanium dioxide P25 were prepared by solvent casting according to After complete evaporation of the solvent, a membrane with the same dimensions of the photoreactor tank surface (38 The microstructure of the produced nanocomposite membranes was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were coated during 30 The photocatalytic degradation of tartrazine was carried out in a solar photoreactor located in northern Algeria (latitude 36°.39′; longitude 2°.42′ at sea level), from August to September, using natural solar irradiation. The intensity of solar UV radiation was measured with a Pyranometer CMP 11 (Kipp & Zonen) with a spectral range between 285 and 2800 The reactor was developed at the Solar Equipment Development Unit (UDES) in Algeria. The effective volume of the photoreactor is 1 For the photocatalytic assays, one liter of tartrazine solution was added to the photoreactor tank containing the 8 To assess the reusability of the produced 8 Different UV intensities were used in the photocatalytic process; it was used a UV lamp from Phillips (PL-L 24W/10/4P) − with a maximum wavelength peak at 365 All the withdrawn samples were analyzed with a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu-1800), and the peak at 427 The TiO Furthermore, as reported in The photocatalytic activity of the 8% TiO As a control, the same experiment was carried out without the 8% TiO As previously mentioned, few works have reported on tartrazine degradation in immobilized systems Other works, where the UV lamps were used instead of sunlight radiation also serve as a reference but not for straightforward comparison; for instance, nanocomposites based on TiO The effect of initial tartrazine concentration on the photocatalytic activity was studied by degrading tartrazine solutions of 10, 20 and 30 The rate of degradation is related to the available catalyst surface for the generation of electron-hole pairs, which in turn generates hydroxyl radicals. In this case, the amount of catalyst is kept constant, and the number of hydroxyl radicals generated remains the same, while dye concentration increases. Therefore, the ratio of The kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of tartrazine can be described by the first-order equation (Eq. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood model has also been used to evaluate the heterogeneous photocatalytic reaction of organic compounds in aqueous solutions The linear relationship between 1/K The effect of tartrazine solution flow rate in the photocatalytic degradation was investigated by testing two different flow rates: 9.78 The increase in degradation efficiency at a higher flow rate is ascribed to a larger turbulence in the solution, which promotes the external mass transfer from the bulk solution to TiO The reusability of the nanocomposite was also assessed, and two uses were performed. Between the first and the second uses the nanocomposite membrane was rinsed with distilled water and dried at room temperature. Afterward, a new tartrazine solution was added to the photoreactor and a second use performed, under the same experimental conditions. The results presented in This loss of photocatalytic efficiency is explained by the washing out of TiO The influence of irradiation intensity on the degradation efficiency of the 8 As mentioned before, during 5 The degradation of persistent and hazardous organic chemicals such as tartrazine is urgent to avoid environmental impacts.
