 Our objective was to analyze the effect of different anteromedial coronoid fracture patterns with different combinations of ligamentous repairs on elbow kinematics in anatomic computational multibody elbow joint models. We hypothesize that smaller fracture patterns would be sufficiently treated with ligamentous repair alone; however, larger fragments would require combination of ligament and bony repair versus reconstruction.  Four different conditions were simulated in this study: (1) no fracture, (2) O'Driscoll Anteromedial subtype 1 coronoid fracture (2.5 mm fragment), (3) subtype 2 (2.5 mm fragment), (4) subtype 2 (5 mm fragment). In each of these conditions, three ligament repairs were studied: LUCL only repair, posterior MCL only repair, and both LUCL and posterior MCL repair; resulting in a total of 16 conditions. For each condition; internal-external rotations, and varus-valgus angulations of the ulna relative to humerus were calculated and compared to the intact model simulation. The acceptable threshold for stability was defined as the range of laxity in an intact elbow plus or minus the individual kinematic curve for the elbow tested (represented by the shaded area of the figure).  Regardless of the fracture subtype, isolated LUCL repair increases the internal rotation, while posterior bundle of MCL repair decreases internal rotation, their rotational effects are summative when both ligaments are repaired. With a subtype 1 fracture, both pMCL and LUCL injuries, repairing the LUCL alone corrects angulation, while rotational stability is satisfactory through the arc from 0 to 90, but not in deeper flexion. In a 2.5 mm subtype 2 fracture, isolated repair of the LUCL or pMCL alone is not capable of restoring rotation nor angulation. When both repair of the LUCL and pMCL are simulated, a somewhat acceptable kinematic pattern can be obtained. For a larger Subtype 2 fracture, no combination of ligamentous repairs could restore varus and valgus angulation.
