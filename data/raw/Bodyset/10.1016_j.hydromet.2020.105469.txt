The formation and evolution of desilication products (DSPs) in synthetic sodium aluminate solution with different reaction temperatures, holding time, CaO additions and carbonate concentrations were investigated based on the Bayer process. The DSPs precipitated at 145 °C and 195 °C are mainly composed of hydrogarnet, tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate and zeolite, and the precipitation sequence is: tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate→hydrogarnet→zeolite. As the desilication temperature increases to 245 °C for 1 h, the ZEO disappears and the HG content reaches 97.8% when the mass ratio of added CaO to SiO2 in solution is 3:1. The SiO2 saturation coefficient of hydrogarnet increases from 0.79 to 1.23 when the desilication temperature rises from 145 °C to 245 °C for 1 h. The crystallinity of various DSPs is enhanced by the reaction temperature, time and CaO addition. The presence of carbonate in sodium aluminate solution promotes the formation of calcium-cancrinite, inhibits the precipitation of hydrogarnet, and decreases the crystallinity and SiO2 saturation coefficients of DSPs. The lattice constants of DSPs increase with the increasing desilication temperature and carbonate concentration.The silica-containing minerals are the most harmful impurity in bauxite ores for alumina extraction by the Bayer process, and the desilication reactions almost run through the whole production process ( For gibbsitic bauxites, both the digestion temperature (140–150 °C) and caustic alkali concentration (130–170 g·L For boehmitic or diasporic bauxites, much higher temperatures (220–280 °C) and caustic alkali concentrations (180–250 g·L During the bauxite digestion process, the desilication reactions are quite complicated because of the various minerals in bauxites and the changeable digestion conditions ( The synthetic sodium aluminate solution was prepared by dissolving NaAlO The desilication reactions were carried out in bomb reactors with 150 mL by volume either in a low-pressure group autoclave or a high-pressure group autoclave heated by silicone oil or molten salt respectively. The temperature control accuracy was ±1 °C, and the bomb was rotated at 48 rpm. The DSPs were separated from the slurry, washed by hot distilled water, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The concentration of silica in the filtrate was determined by the silicon molybdenum blue colorimetry. The desilication efficiency was used to represent the desilication reaction extent, which was calculated by the concentration ratio of silica difference before and after desilication to original silica. The phase composition and crystal structure of DSPs were analyzed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Philips X'Pert PW3040–60) using CuKα1 radiation, and the diffraction angles of 2 The desilication experiments with different durations were conducted at 145 °C in sodium aluminate solution when the CaO addition is 6 g·L The XRD patterns of DSPs precipitated for different reaction time are shown in The microstructure of DSPs precipitated at 145 °C for 1 h is shown in The precipitation behavior of DSPs with different CaO additions was then studied at 145 °C for 1 h. The SiO The XRD patterns of various DSPs precipitated different CaO additions are shown in The digestion temperatures of various types of bauxites are quite different. Thus, the desilication experiments with different temperatures for 1 h were performed when the CaO addition was 6 g·L As shown in The SEM images of DSPs precipitated at 245 °C for 1 h are shown in There are many impurity anions in industrial sodium aluminate solution, among which carbonate is the most common ( As shown in The SEM images of various DSPs precipitated when the carbonate concentration is 10 g·L The sodium aluminosilicate hydrates (Na According to the previous work, the phase type and crystallinity of DSPs can significantly affect the stability of Bayer liquor after digestion ( The DSPs can also be expressed by the formula Na According to this research, the presence of carbonate not only promotes the transformation of HG to Ca-CAN, but also greatly reduces the SiO The precipitation of DSPs with different reaction temperatures, holding time, CaO additions and carbonate concentrations in the CaO-Na None The authors greatly appreciate the financial project supports from the
