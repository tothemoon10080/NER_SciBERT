Shredders are of extraordinary importance for the comminution of scrap. With regard to their design they can be divided into horizontal shaft shredders (HS) and vertical shaft shredders (VS). This work investigates the microprocesses of comminution of metals in small-scale shredders of both types. Moreover, an impact apparatus and a modified Izod pendulum are applied. Four stages can be distinguished during the comminution of platy test bodies.
                  With five different materials the performance of the two types of shredders were compared. To produce a set product characterized by the mean fragment size, the mean fragment weight and fragment deformation the same specific energy is needed. Differences could be detected regarding the residence time of the fragments.
