Results emerging from the several studies recently performed to provide fundamental understanding of the interplay between mineral pulp chemistry, flocculation performance, particle interactions, role of applied shear and dewaterability of model colloidal kaolinite and smectite dispersions are presented and discussed. Beneficial links between pulp interfacial chemistry (particle zeta potential), particle interactions (shear yield stress) and beneficial dewatering behaviour (batch settling rate and sediment solid loading), established through the influence of hydrolyzable metal ions, pH, temperature, high molecular weight polymer structure type (anionic polyacrylamide vs non-ionic polyethylene oxide) and shear, are shown. The application of the findings and new knowledge gained for a marked improvement in clay pulp dewaterability is discussed.To date, effective dewatering of colloidally stable clay dispersions presents an intractable and environmental challenge to the mining and mineral processing industry as well as dewatering equipment manufacturers worldwide. Flocculant-assisted, gravity thickening and filtration processes are currently used by industry for dewatering but these are far from being efficient, requiring further development for dramatic improvements In the present work, the interfacial chemistry of kaolinite (Al In the tetrahedral siloxane sheets, Si The edge faces of these clay minerals, comprising reactive silanol and aluminol species, have been shown to be responsible for the adsorption of or interactions with the potential determining H Mineral pulp dewaterability is dependent upon the net interaction force operating between particles and results from various attractive and repulsive forces. The control of these interactions to a certain extent may be achieved through the manipulation of solution conditions such as pH and ionic strength, and the addition of hydrolyzable metal ions and polymeric flocculants of varying chemistry and molecular weight Colloidal size (0.1–5 μm) kaolinite (99% pure, quartz and mica 1%, Unimin, Australia) and Na-exchanged smectite (99% pure, quartz and mica 1%, Unimin, Australia) clay particles were used in this work. The particle density and BET surface area were 2.60 kg dm For flocculation and settling behaviour investigations, known volumes of 0.1 wt.% polymeric flocculant solution were added in a single step to an 8 wt.% solid slurry and well mixed by moving a perforated plunger up and down 8 times. For each test, 500 cm The pulp shear yield stress was measured by the vane technique The modification of kaolinite and smectite particle-solution interfacial chemistry by hydrolyzable metal ion adsorption strongly influences the particle zeta potential, and hence, the pulp particle interactions and dewatering behaviour. Specific adsorption of hydrolyzed Ca(II) and Mn(II) complexes leads to significant reductions of zeta-potential and a shift in iep as shown in The results of the settling tests performed with prior addition of Mn(II) and Ca(II) ions at different pH values are shown in For an adsorption and flocculation mechanism, it is believed that charge neutralization occurs between the anionic polyacrylamide polymer carboxylate (COO The pivotal role played by polymeric flocculant structure type and dosage and the application of post-sedimentation shear in pulp dewaterability is exemplified the data obtained for the model smectite dispersions ( The flocculation of smectite pulps with anionic PAM, on the other hand, produced slightly greater sediment compaction behaviour (∼ Significant variation of settling and pulp consolidation behaviour with agitation intensity is also indicated by the present work. For PEO-flocculated pulps, a dramatic improvement in consolidation was observed as depicted in The pivotal role played by pulp temperature has been investigated for flocculated kaolinite dispersions The settling rate data show that an optimum temperature exists for enhanced flocculation performance with PEO, shown to be around 30–40 °C. This observation is in good agreement with other studies of polyacrylate flocculated alumina dispersions The influence of pulp pH, hydrolyzable metal ion, temperature, polymeric flocculant structure type and shear on interfacial chemistry, flocculation performance, particle interactions and dewatering behaviour of kaolinite and smectite dispersions has been investigated. Polymeric flocculant structure type, pulp pH and hydrolyzable metal ions all had a pronounced effect on the magnitude of the particle zeta potential, which reflected in dispersion shear rheology, flocculation performance and the dewatering behaviour exemplified. Non-ionic polyethylene oxide flocculant produced better inter-particle bridging, higher settling rate and greater floc compaction behaviour upon shear than conventional polyacrylamides commonly used industry. Final sediment solid content of 40 wt.% was achieved through flocculation with polyethylene oxide under moderate shear in contrast with ∼ Financial support to the project by the Australian Research Council and Anglo Platinum, Rio Tinto and Newmont through AMIRA International is gratefully acknowledged.
