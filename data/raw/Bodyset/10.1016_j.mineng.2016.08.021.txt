In a flotation cell, bubble size is a function of both coalescence and breakup phenomena. Two phase tests, conducted in a conventional 5.5L Denver mechanical flotation cell, studied the effect of impeller speed, gas flow rate and frother concentration on bubble size in various electrolyte-frother solutions. The addition of frother to a synthetic sea salt did reduce the measured bubble size (at certain mechanical conditions); whereas the effect of frother addition to NaCl was too small (when compared to measurement errors) to make significant conclusions. This led to more detailed CCC curves (0–50ppm MIBC) for NaCl, NaCl+MgCl2, NaCl+CaSO4, and NaCl+KCl solutions, at constant electrolyte concentrations, to be conducted. They showed an increase in bubble size with the addition of MIBC. This was attributed to the saturation of frother at the air-water interface, reducing local surface tension gradients that help produce smaller bubbles. This occurrence is typically masked in traditional CCC curves due to the dominance of coalescence effects at low frother concentrations.In the extraction of a mineral from an ore body, froth flotation is one of the most common separation processes, utilising air bubbles inside of a column or mechanically agitated cell to selectively recover mineral particles. The size of the bubbles created, and the associated surface area, is paramount to efficient mineral separation. The bubble size is a function of a number of factors, including (but not limited to): frother concentration and type; air flow rate; impeller/stator design; impeller speed (power intensity); pulp temperature; and gas density ( Typically frothers will be added to facilitate the creation and preservation of fine bubbles (0.5–1.0 The majority of the research performed on bubble coalescence and breakage has been carried out in independent frother (  The purpose of this work was to study the effects of air flow rate and impeller speed, being the two main operating variables in mechanical flotation cells, on bubble size in frother-electrolyte solutions. For these tests, two industrial frothers (MIBC and Dowfroth 250) were used at various concentrations in the presence of either a sodium chloride or synthetic sea salt solution. Following this, the effect of salt type on bubble size in various frother concentrations was investigated through the development of CCC curves for a range of salt combinations (NaCl, NaCl Throughout the test work, two frothers (MIBC and DF-250), five salt types (NaCl, KCl, MgSO The conditions tested for the varying impeller speed and gas flow rate experiments are outlined in Following this an impeller speed of 1200 The two phase (solution-air) experiments were conducted using a Denver D-12 laboratory-scale mechanical flotation machine (Serial: TCS-1101-3, Size: D-1 FLOT) equipped with a 5.5 Bubbles were sampled at point X (  The results from the sodium chloride tests showed that the addition of the two frother solutions (particularly at a concentration of 10 The addition of 10 It is well known that bubble size is a function of the combination of the mechanical properties of the cell (impeller speed, diameter, design, etc.) and the chemical properties of the solution in which the bubbles are formed (frother concentration, viscosity, temperature) (  In the NaCl solution, the addition of MIBC increased the bubble size (with a statistical difference) for all values above 5 When comparing the sea salt and NaCl solutions, the results produced an interesting difference in the absence of frother. The sea salt solution with a higher ionic strength (∼0.7) had a larger bubble size than the NaCl solution (I   Bubble size measured in flotation cells are a combination of both coalescence and breakup effects. The effect of coalescence on bubble size is more prominent (80% reduction in DI water) at low frother concentrations than effects from breakup (<10% increase in 0.5 Following this, Bubble size was determined for both NaCl and sea salt solutions, along with frother dosages of 5 The authors would like to acknowledge the See
