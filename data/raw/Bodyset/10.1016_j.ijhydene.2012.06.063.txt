                     /AC prepared by ball milling could reduce the desorption temperature, e.g. differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicated that the peak desorption temperature decreased ∼40 °C, and also improve the desorption kinetics of MgH2, e.g. desorbed 6.5 wt% hydrogen within 30 min at 300 °C under an initial pressure of 1 kPa. A significant decrease of activation energy (E

                     /AC catalyst is highly efficient for MgH2 dehydrogenation, which may be ascribed to the synergistic effect of nanometric bimetals (metal oxides) and nanocarbon.The challenges of global warming and finite fossil fuel-based energy resources have made hydrogen a promising alternative candidate for the next generation of renewable and sustainable energy carrier. Realization of this perspective requires a practical hydrogen storage material. Hydrogen compression which is considered as the simplest way to store hydrogen, many of the prototype and demonstration vehicles have used compressed gas cylinders in the past decade Experimentally, many efforts have been devoted to overcome these two barriers, e.g. lowering the desorption temperature and improving the kinetics, which has involved the modification both on structure of the main material (magnesium) and its composition such as catalysts. A good example is the use of magnesium compound such as Mg In this paper, we report the synthesis of co-doped Pd and VO The microporous activated carbon (AC, 99% purity) was obtained from Calgon Carbon Company as the initial carbon support. Ammonium metavanadate (NH Before being mixed with any catalysts, MgH The porosity and structure of the catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption (Quantachrome, USA), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miliflex) with Co Kα radiation, and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Kratos Axis ULTRA). In addition, the metallic content of the as-prepared catalysts were quantified by using a Varian Vista Pro inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) instrument on samples digested with HNO The effect of carbon supported catalysts on the decomposition temperature of MgH It is well recognized that the performance of carbon supported catalyst depends on the textual properties of the support (surface area, porosity). Thus, in order to obtain a well dispersed metal catalyst, the surface of the activated carbon (AC) support must be accessible. To characterize the microstructure of the synthesized Pd–VO In order to further investigate the microstructure of this Pd–VO  A TEM bright field image of the MgH To explore the changes of thermodynamics in MgH Hydrogen desorption kinetics is further investigated for rehydrogenated MgH In our study, the hydrogen desorption from metal hydrides involves a synergistic effect of three basic steps: (a) the nucleation and growth of the metal phase at special nucleation sites in the parent hydride phase that could be adjacent to Pd–VO As we know, hydrogen desorption in a crystalline solid can either occurs as random nucleations or preferential nucleations along certain favourable “routes” due to defects or catalytic sites The different values of the JMA exponent and activation energy suggest different dimensionalities and mechanisms of MgH In conclusion, we successfully synthesized a new catalyst of activated carbon supported nanosized Pd and VO We are thankful to the financial support of UQRS scholarship from the  Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
