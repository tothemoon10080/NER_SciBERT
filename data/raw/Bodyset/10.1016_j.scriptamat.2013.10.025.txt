Zr–1Nb alloy uniaxially compressed at room temperature at 10−2 and 103
                     s−1 exhibited twinning and a three-stage strain-hardening behavior. At 103
                     s−1 the twin fraction initially increased to 0.3, decreasing to 0.02 at higher strains. Despite the difference in texture at intermediate strains, the final texture was similar at both strain rates. The increasing strain-hardening rate in the second stage was attributed to strengthening from grain boundaries and dislocations, and softening from reorientation due to twinning. An extruded rod of Zr–1 The flow stress was higher at 10  Undeformed Zr–1Nb showed a uniform misorientation angle φ distribution ( Twinning causes three specific changes in the microstructure: (i) boundary spacing reduces, thereby increasing stress (the Hall–Petch effect); (ii) dislocation density increases within the twins, referred to as Basinski hardening  As twinning stress is relatively insensitive to strain rate and temperature In conclusion, deformation of Zr–1Nb perpendicular to the A.S. would like to acknowledge DST-MPG for a Max-Planck India Fellowship.
