The direct hydrogen reduction of Cu2S in acid or basic slurry was attempted and 92% of the Cu transformation was achieved in the latter. The SEM micrographs and XRD pattern of the reaction products are given.Non-ferrous metals, such as copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc and lead, etc., exist in nature mostly in the form of sulphides. Because of deepening environmental consciousness, hydrometallurgy has made good progress since the past 50 years, although pyrometallurgy is still the main method of recovering these metals. The first commercialization was realized by Sherritt, using aqueous sulphate solutions and autoclaves for the recovery of nickel and cobalt The recovery of copper from its sulphides by hydrometallurgy seems to be wholly technologically feasible as a result of the past year's research and industrial trials, and there is an Australian company that is trying to achieve the commercial application for copper recovery from chalcocite by hydrometallurgy Hydrogen reduction experiments were carried out in a 2-l stainless steel autoclave equipped with an electric heater and an agitator having a 6-cm diameter four-blade marine type impeller. The autoclave was charged with 1000 ml of a slurry obtained by mixing distilled water and 20 g of Cu Cu In the basic slurry, the solution after the reaction showed no color, but turned black when a little CuSO Also it can be seen from Zinc oxide (ZnO) is an amphoteric oxide and is able to precipitate the S  The acid or basic slurry of Cu The authors are greatly indebted to the National Natural Science Foundation of China for supporting this study (No. 50174050).
