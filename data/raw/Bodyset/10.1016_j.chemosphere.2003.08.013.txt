The elaboration of 10 years of monitoring of leachate quality and quantity, leachate treatment and degree of contamination of soil and surface waters at the Tre Monti site––an active, 4-million-m3 landfill in Northern Italy––is presented in this study. A hydrological model of leachate production is applied, with a good match of the experimental data. The concentrations of all leachate components except sulfate are characterized by fluctuations over a constant or increasing value. Different ways of interpreting leachate quality data are discussed; the elaboration indicates that the pollutant load on the leachate treatment facility will remain basically constant as long as waste will be added to the landfill. The analysis of the data relative to 10 years of leachate pre-treatment in the adjoining, non-aerated lagoon system indicates that a significant removal is achieved for most leachate components; the operational conditions of the plant are described, and the removal mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the potential for contamination of soil and surface waters is examined by analyzing long-term quality trends of the sub-superficial waters sampled near the lagoons and by means of an analytical campaign conducted on clay cores sampled near and underneath the treatment ponds. The experimental values indicate that the clay layer located under the entire site offers an effective barrier to the migration of leachate contaminants.Although landfilling is the most common option for waste disposal worldwide, the appropriate containment and treatment of landfill leachate pose scientific and technical challenges that have not been completely overcome as of today ( The risk of groundwater contamination by landfill leachate is considered to represent the most significant environmental concern related to the landfilling of waste ( Besides containing leachate by means of an effective barrier, it is necessary to treat it so as to meet the standards for discharge in surface waters. Several factors contribute to make lagoons an interesting option for leachate treatment: they can operate in the presence of significant fluctuations of influent concentration and strength, typical of landfill leachates; they are characterized by low operational and maintenance costs; they can remove organic compounds, nitrogen, phosphorous, suspended solids and pathogenic microorganisms ( In this study, the results of 10 years of monitoring of leachate production rates and leachate quality at the Tre Monti site––an active, 4-million-m Tre Monti is a 4.16-million-m Leachate is collected by means of a network of wells and pipes, pre-treated in a non-aerated, 5-basin, 9960-m Leachate and water samples were collected according to UNICHIM N. 144. The Standard Methods ( The amount of leachate produced by the landfill has been monitored on a regular basis since 1995. Measured yearly production was compared to the estimate obtained by application of the model indicated by COD, BOD, NH pH values show a remarkably constant trend during the 10-year monitoring period, with variations between 8.3 and 8.5. This is an indication that the landfill was already characterized by methanogenic conditions at the beginning of the monitoring period. After a significant initial decrease, BOD remained relatively uniform from 1993 to 2001, ranging between 850 and 1700 mg The yearly average concentrations of ammonia fluctuate between 900 and 1900 mg The electrical conductivity of the leachate remained quite constant during the monitoring period, with variations between 18 The concentrations of heavy metals show during the entire monitoring period wide fluctuations not characterized by any clear long-term trend. The following ranges of variation were observed (μg In order to evaluate whether the observed fluctuations in leachate strength can be ascribed to the fluctuations in leachate flow, the yearly mass flows of the main leachate components were calculated by multiplying the yearly average concentrations by the corresponding leachate flow rate; the results are shown in The parameters monitored on a monthly basis at the entrance of the lagoon system were monitored with the same frequency at the exit of the last basin. Yearly means obtained from the two data sets were compared in order to obtain yearly average removal efficiencies for each parameter (reported in Rainfall, temperature and evaporation rate were monitored on a continuous basis from 1995 to 2000 in the meteorological station located next to the landfill. As an average, 12 As an average, the anaerobic section of the lagoon plant was characterized from 1992 to 2000 by a 32-day retention time (with variations between 26 and 38 days The 10-year average removals observed for COD and BOD are equal to 40% and 64%, respectively. The yearly COD removal efficiency ( A microbiological characterization conducted in the lagoons over a 10-month period provided significant indications of the presence of an active microbial community and of the important role played by biodegradation in the removal of organic compounds ( The removal of ammonia is characterized by a decreasing trend (from 95% to 60%) during the 10-year monitoring period ( The yearly removal of phosphorous is characterized by variations between 5% and 60% (with a 42% average), and can be ascribed to adsorption on Fe, Al or Ca in the sediment or to sedimentation as organic P via biological uptake ( Metals such as Fe and Mn are removed only partially (30% and 44%), whereas no removal has been observed for Al. As for the heavy metals, Se and Hg are not removed at all, whereas the following average treatment efficiencies were observed for the others: Zn 29%, Pb 65%, Ni 41%, As and Cd 25%, Cu 10% (with wide fluctuations for Cd and Cu). An average 52% removal of chlorinated solvents was observed, apparently due mainly to volatilization. In order to detect any potential release of contaminants from the landfill or from the lagoon system, monthly water samples of sub-superficial runoff waters were collected from the seven piezometers placed in the vicinity of the five basins ( The parameters listed in Overall, it can be observed that the sub-superficial run-off waters contain not negligible levels of heavy metals. To better understand the reason for this presence, the content of several metals was determined in the three cores sampled 15 m downstream from basin E, in the four control cores sampled upstream from the landfill, in a sample of sediment of basin E and in a clay core sampled 50–75 cm under the bottom of basin E. The results, reported in The elaboration of 10 years of monitoring of leachate quality and quantity at the Tre Monti site––an active, 4-million-m The 5-basin, non-aerated lagoon plant determines a significant reduction of the impact of leachate on the municipal treatment plant thanks to a considerable removal of most leachate components. The data obtained from the continuous monitoring of the sub-superficial waters sampled near the lagoons, from the analysis of the metal content of clay cores sampled near and underneath the lagoon system and from a leaching test performed on the same cores, show that the clay layer surrounding the landfill and the five basins offers an effective barrier to the migration of leachate contaminants.
