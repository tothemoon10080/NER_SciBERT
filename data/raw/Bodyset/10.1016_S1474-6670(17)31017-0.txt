The reconciliation method outlined in this paper is based on mass and energy conservation constraints for units that operate in stationary conditions. The accuracy and reliability of the method are strongly dependant upon the measurement strategy, i.e. upon the type, accuracy, number, and location of the sensors in the plant. Criteria are discussed for defining the required reconciliation performance. Examples for grinding and flotation circuits are given to illustrate the impact of the instrumentation design parameters on the accuracy of the reconciled data and the robustness of the reconciliation algorithm, and to illustrate possible compromises between instrumentation cost and data reconciliation efficiency.
