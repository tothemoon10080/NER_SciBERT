The rheological properties of dewatered tailings and cemented paste backfill have been measured and subsequently altered using polymeric dispersants. Polyphosphate and naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (NSF) were selected as potential candidates to reduce the yield stress (τ

                     ) of the two slurries. Adsorption isotherms, acoustophoresis, and rheology measurements indicate that the polymers adsorb onto the dewatered tailings, causing an increase in the particle zeta potential, accompanied by comparably low values of τ

However, the efficacy of the polymers in reducing the yield stress of the cemented paste is complicated by hydration reactions in the cement phase. Polyphosphate was found to be less effective in lowering the τ

                      of the cemented paste than NSF. Rheology measurements performed on the cement phase alone in the presence of the dispersants indicate that cement plays a major role in the adsorption of both NSF and polyphosphate in the cemented paste backfill. This is in spite of the fact that cement makes up only a small fraction of the total solids content of the paste. Adsorption isotherms determined for the cement phase alone indicate that NSF adsorbs strongly, whereas polyphosphate was seen to form a precipitate with calcium ions, released due to cement hydration. Acoustophoresis measurements mirrored this result, with NSF alone causing charge reversal and subsequently increasing the negative charge present on the surface of the cement phase.In the mining and mineral industry, the extraction of valuable minerals inevitably leads to the production of enormous quantities of tailings which must be disposed of in a cost effective and environmentally acceptable manner. For many years, disposal was achieved by conventional methods which involve solid concentration followed by pipeline transport to huge dams for consolidation to take place. For economically successful pipeline transport, it is desirable to transport the slurry at the highest solid content but using the minimal input of energy. However, the maximum solid concentration at which the slurry can be transported will depend on the flow of the slurry in the pipeline and thus, the friction losses that are incurred. Hence, a description of the rheological properties of the slurry is important in order to optimise the conditions for hydraulic transport ( In the last decade, other methods of tailings disposal have been used, which provide substantial environmental benefits compared with those which require surface impoundment. In particular, new technology such as backfilling allows the tailings to be placed underground to fill up the voids left from the mining operation ( Concentrated mineral systems such as dewatered plant tailings and cemented paste backfill are known to exhibit non-Newtonian flow behaviour due to the forces that act between particle surfaces in these physically and chemically complex systems ( In the current study, the effects of two different types of polymeric dispersants on the rheological properties and in particular, the yield stress of concentrated plant tailings and cemented paste backfill are investigated and compared. The changes in the rheological properties are correlated with changes in surface chemistry and the adsorption of these polymers onto mineral particle surfaces. Generally, a knowledge of the surface chemistry of the minerals is essential for the selection of polymers, as it will determine the mechanisms of interaction of the polymer with the mineral surface and therefore their adsorption. The polymers in this study, namely polyphosphate and naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (NSF), were selected by this criterion. Polyphosphates have specific chemical interactions with certain metal containing sites ( NSF was chosen for this study as it is expected to be effective in dispersing the cemented paste backfill. NSF is widely used as a superplastisizer in the concrete industry. It increases the fluidity of concrete by acting on cement particles. In fact, the adsorption of NSF onto cement and its effect on the rheological properties of cement and concrete is well known and has been the subject of much research over the years (for example, The tailings were a plant sample collected from a thickener underflow from an operation in Australia. The slurry solid content was 66 The cement used to prepare the paste was ordinary Portland cement used in the plant operation to formulate the paste backfill. The dry cement particles have a particle size distribution with a The polyphosphate and naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (NSF) samples were provided by Albright and Wilson (Australia). The structure of these two polymers is shown in For all polymer adsorption and zeta potential experiments, a slurry sample containing particles with diameters less than 38 Both the original plant tailings and <38 Cemented paste backfill was produced by first measuring a quantity of the original plant tailings (66 Cement slurries were prepared by mixing the dry cement particles with the required volume of water to give the desired solids content. No background electrolyte was required as hydration of the cement released calcium hydroxide into solution. The pH of the cement slurries were 12.5. A Haake CV20 Rotovisco rheometer with a Mooney-Ewart concentric cylinder sensor (45 Rheology measurements on the paste commenced 10 Zeta potential measurements were performed on the tailings (<38 Zeta potentials were calculated from the dynamic mobility spectrum using the thin double layer model of O’Brien ( The measurement of polyphosphate or NSF adsorption onto the tailings and onto the cement particles was carried out using the depletion method. Firstly, a bulk sample of the solid suspension at the desired solid content and background electrolyte was prepared. Samples consisting of different polymer concentrations were prepared by first transferring a known volume of the ‘stock’ suspension into individual vials. Sampling the solid from the same suspension was preferred to weighing a certain mass of dry solid for each individual sample, as it allows differences in surface area between samples to be minimised. This was particularly important in this case due to the polydisperse nature of the tailings and cement particles. The required volume of polymer from a stock solution was then added to each suspension. The samples were placed on a rotating wheel for 2 We are aware that the depletion method can overestimate the amount of dispersant adsorbed. This is particularly true for the case of NSF adsorption onto cement. Here the adsorbed amount more accurately refers to the total consumption of NSF as a portion of NSF is consumed by intercalation, coprecipitation or micellization, i.e. by the formation of an organo-mineral phase, before NSF can be adsorbed onto the surface of cement particles (  The zeta potential and yield stress of the tailings were also investigated as a function of pH ( One method to increase the electrostatic repulsion between particles and therefore decrease the yield stress of the system is through the addition of anionic polymers, namely polyphosphate and naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (NSF). The effect of polyphosphate and NSF on the yield stress of concentrated tailings is shown in In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which dispersion is achieved, the adsorption of these polymers onto the tailings particles and its subsequent effect on the particle zeta potential were examined.   In this study, the yield stress of cemented paste backfill made from different tailing samples varied significantly due to variations in both the mineralogy and particle size distributions. However, it was found that dispersion of the paste by polyphosphate and NSF was unaffected by the initial yield stress of the paste. This is clearly demonstrated in In the paste, cement is not an inert phase and undergoes specific hydration reactions that seemed to affect the action of polyphosphate and, to a lesser extent, NSF. To confirm that the cement phase was the major cause of the difference in performance between the two polymers, similar experiments to that performed on the tailings and paste were conducted on pure cement slurries. Rheology experiments again showed that NSF was superior in dispersing the cement slurries compared with polyphosphate when used at the same concentration ( Polymer adsorption experiments were conducted to determine if the difference observed in the rheological properties of the cement slurries in the presence of these two polymers was due to different adsorption behaviour ( Indeed, it was observed that when polyphosphate was added to the cement slurry, a white precipitate was always formed in the aqueous phase. Chemical analysis showed that the precipitate contained calcium and phosphorus ions in the ratio of 6 to 10. As the only phosphorus ions in solution came from polyphosphate, the precipitate formed must have the chemical formula: Ca  From the above results, it is clear that that polyphosphate is an effective dispersant for concentrated plant tailings whilst its reduced effectiveness for cemented paste backfill is due to its consumption by calcium ions present in solution as a result of cement hydration. The rheological properties of concentrated plant tailings were manipulated by controlling the surface chemical properties of the particles within the tailings. Altering the pH was not effective in reducing the yield stress of the plant tailings when compared with low molecular weight, anionic polymer dispersants, namely polyphosphate and naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate. These polymers were effective in reducing the yield stress of concentrated plant tailings consisting of 75–80 In contrast to the results observed for the tailings in the absence of cement, polyphosphate was found to be less effective than NSF in reducing the yield stress of the cemented paste backfill when used at the same concentration and less effective than with the tailings alone. The difference in polyphosphate performance between the two systems was attributed to the presence of the cement in the slurry. When cement is mixed with water, it hydrates and releases calcium ions into solution. When polyphosphate is added to the paste, it is consumed by the calcium ions in solution and is no longer available for adsorption onto the tailings and cement particles to effect dispersion. As the adsorption of NSF onto particles in the paste is not or less affected by the calcium ions in solution, NSF is a good dispersant for both the tailings and the cemented paste backfill systems.
