Laboratory studies on the recovery of molybdenum from acid wash liquor, reported in Part 1 of this series of papers, identified the optimum process conditions for the production of high purity molybdenum trioxide and calcium molybdate. Pilot and plant scale operations were conducted as a result of the design developed during our laboratory studies.
                  Molybdenum was selectively recovered from a wash liquor containing 10g/L Mo via a 2-stage extraction using 10%v/v Alamine diluted in Anysol 150 diluent as extractant. The use of 10%v/v isodecanol (IDA) was found to enhance the extraction of molybdate from the wash liquor. The organic extractant liquor had to be scrubbed with water to remove the ammonium sulphate crud formed when ammonium hydroxide solution (20%w/v) was used to strip the molybdate from the loaded organic. The pilot scale study (0.2m3/day) and plant operation (30m3/day) were able to be continuously operated to recover 99% Mo from the wash liquor, from which high purity MoO3 and CaMoO4 of >99.9% purity could be recovered.Several treatment processes have been proposed for recovering molybdenum from various primary and secondary sources. The generally employed process is dependent on the type of material requiring treatment, which has been widely reviewed in the literature ( Part 1 of this investigation reported the optimum conditions for the recovery of molybdenum from a wash solution containing 10–15 Various high purity Mo products, such as molybdenum trioxide (mono- or di-hydrate), calcined molybdenum trioxide (MoO The MoO During pilot tests, 100 After testing the process on a pilot scale, the optimum conditions were applied to the plant operations. The mixers-settlers were designed and built to an exact scale up ratio of 100:1 for treating 30 The organic phase used for the solvent extraction on both pilot and full-size plants was 10% A flow sheet of the pilot plant describing the major process steps used to recover Mo from the wash liquor is shown as a block diagram in A 2-stage extraction and 2-stage stripping were found to be adequate to transfer the Mo(VI) from the adjusted wash liquor (containing approximately 10 The complete extraction of molybdate from the acid wash liquor (A, at 9.1 A 20% As expected, only Mo anions were recovered from the solvent extraction circuit during the pilot operation, as shown in As shown in The initial flow conditions were optimised to obtain the best phase separation during the settling stage, which was observed with residence times of 4 The separation of the two phases in the settler could be improved with the use of 10% The variation in the Mo concentration of the organic phase leaving the extraction stage with respect to the operating temperature is also shown in The effect of the O/S ratio on the Mo concentration of flow S2 leaving the stripping stage is shown in Understanding the transient state of the pilot operation during start up is important, as is following the Mo concentration profile before a steady state is achieved. Before starting a pilot run, all compartments of E1 and E2 had to be filled with 2% sulphuric acid, which has a similar acid concentration to that of the original wash liquor prior to use (If all compartments were filled with water, precipitation of iron would take place). The variation in the Mo concentration of the aqueous phase, taken at the exit point of E1 at different times, is shown in The same trend was observed during stripping, as shown in The same measurements were conducted during full-size plant operations, which showed the same trends. As the residence times for mixing (both compartments) and settling were set at 6 During the laboratory study (reported in Part 1), shaking tests were used to determine the conditions for extraction and stripping for the production of McCabe Thiele diagrams relating to stage design. Although the transfer of minor impurities was monitored and measured, clean liquors (O and A) were used, with no precipitation observed in the organic phase, O. However, during the pilot study, with recycling of the organic phase during the test (2–4 A scrubbing stage (W in The crud forming materials collected from extraction stage E1 were analysed by ICP and ion chromatography, as shown in A solvent extraction pilot plant, consisting of 2-stage extraction, 2-stage stripping and 1-stage scrubbing processes, was successfully operated for the recovery of Mo from a wash liquor containing 10–11 The assistance for this research from the KEMCO (Korea Energy Management Corporation) is greatly appreciated.
