With the increasing of mechanization of coal mining, the fine coal content in raw coal is more and more, which makes the work of dewatering difficult. The constant voltage and constant current electro-osmosis, combined with vacuum filtration were adopted to dewater the fine coal. The dewatering efficiency can be improved and the moisture of cake can be reduced when the electric field was imposed. When the initial electric field strength is less than 40 V/cm, the precipitation rate of constant voltage electro-osmosis dewatering (EOD) higher than the constant current EOD, can reach 30%. When the initial electric field higher than 40 V/cm, the Precipitation rate of constant current EOD higher than the constant voltage EOD, can reach 55%.
