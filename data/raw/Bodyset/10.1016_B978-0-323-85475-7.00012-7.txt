Cervical spine (C-spine) traumatic injuries are frequent and range from benign sprains to catastrophic dislocations with spinal cord compromise.
               Several prediction rules exist to limit unnecessary imaging examination; the two mostly used been NEXUS and the Canadian Cervical Spine. In patients with C-spine trauma that require imaging, the initial investigation must be an unenhanced CT as it is more sensitive than radiographs to detect fractures and malalignment. A normal CT allows to conclude to the absence of any unstable injury and the removal of the cervical collar.
               Three main injuring mechanisms are identified: compression, responsible for wedge fractures, burst and tear-drop fractures; flexion-extension (distraction), responsible for distractive injuries, such as sprains and dislocations; rotation, responsible for facet fractures or dislocations.Level: C5, C6, C7 Location: lamina, lateral mass CT is more sensitive than radiographs for the detection of C spine injuries. Three main mechanisms of injury exist:  Compression: vertebral body fractures, teardrop fractures  Rotation: facet fractures, unilateral dislocations  Flexion/extension: sprains, bilateral dislocations Assessment of normal alignment is crucial. Alignment: regularity and smoothness of cervical lines Posterior structures Vertebral body height Disk height Prevertebral soft tissue Imaging strategy Prediction rules Radiographs and CT MR In conclusion Anatomy Checklist Alignment Height Soft tissue Cervical spine instability Classification Compression and compression-flexion injuries Corporeal wedge fractures Burst fractures Teardrop fractures Flexion injuries Benign strains Severe sprains Bilateral facet dislocation Whiplash Extension injuries Fractures on ankylosed spines Extension injuries on native spine Rim avulsions Rotation injuries Facet fractures Fracture separation of the lateral mass Unilateral facet dislocation Non-clinically significant cervical spine injuries References Cervical spine (C-spine) traumatic injuries are frequent and range from benign sprains to dislocations with spinal cord compromise In patients with C-spine trauma that require imaging, the initial investigation must be an unenhanced CT CT is far more sensitive to detect fractures, and malalignment compared to 4 views radiographs. A normal CT allows to conclude to the absence of any unstable injury, and the removal of the cervical collar [ A purely ligamentous injury without fractures or malalignment (that CT would have detected) appears to be extremely rare [ Dynamic radiographs (flexion/extension) add only poor complementary information [ MR is recognized as the gold standard to investigate discoligamentous disorders CT should be preferred as firs-line imaging. MRI is not recommended in routine after a prior CT considered as “normal”. Discoligamentous changes seen on MR don’t always reflect clinically significant disorders. Cervical (C3–C7) vertebrae have a relatively large body, with a more massive posterior arch than seen at the lumbar level. At the junction of the pedicle and laminar, superior and inferior facets fuse to form an articular pillar or mass Joints between cervical vertebrae are: the intervertebral joint: formed by the intervertebral disk and adjacent endplates the two facet joints: synovial joints with an articular capsule Several ligaments maintain the alignment: anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments (ALL, PLL): running along the vertebral body, they are primary C-spine stabilizers ligamentum flavum (LF): between laminae intertransverse ligaments, interspinous ligaments (ISL) and supraspinous ligament (SSL) White and Panjabi have defined the functional spinal unit (FSU) as the smallest physiological motion unit of the spine to exhibit biomechanical characteristics similar to those of the entire spine. A FSU is composed of two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc and all the ligaments bridging them Several radiological lines are seen on normal lateral radiographs or sagittal CT images ( anterior line: alignment of anterior wall of vertebral bodies, course of the ALL posterior line: alignment of posterior wall of vertebral bodies, course of the PLL spinolamar line: formed by the junction of the laminae. Their smoothness and regularity confirm the absence of spinal malalignment. Moreover, facets must be perfectly superposed, without any craniocaudal or anteroposterior translation ( anteroposterior: in case on non-neutral head position craniocaudal: in case of lateral head bending The key to differentiating this from traumatic malalignment is the identic distribution of abnormalities on each level, without a transitional level ( Trauma patients can sometimes present a change of the usual spine configuration (straightening or absence of the usual cervical lordosis), presumably due to a reactive muscle spasm ( there is no malalignment or sudden angulation, all lines remain smooth; there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling On the AP view, spinous processes must be aligned. Any abrupt malalignment should make suspected a rotation ( The reader should keep in mind that radiographs can miss lower cervical injuries, due to shoulder superimposition (  vertebrae discs: an increase of disc height might reflect a tear of anterior Sharpey fibers (extension injury) At the anterior aspect of the neck, retropharyngeal soft-tissue swelling has high specificity but a low sensitivity for the revelation of cervical bone or ALL injury Therefore, the absence of anterior soft tissue swelling doesn’t warrant the absence of injury. Thresholds commonly accepted as normal in adults are ( < 6 mm at the level of C2 < 22 mm at the level of C6 At the posterior aspect of the neck, the obliteration of the cervical fat pad is highly associated with posterior structures injury Instability is defined as “the loss of the ability of the spine under physiologic loads to maintain relationships between vertebrae in such a way that there is neither initial damage nor subsequent irritation to the spinal cord or nerve roots and, in addition, there is no development of incapacitating deformity or pain due to the structural changes” Instability can be evocated when “all anterior elements or all posterior elements are either destroyed or unstable to function” Instability can be temporary when only bones are involved, likely to heal after reduction and immobilization, or permanent when discs and ligaments are damaged, likely to yield weak scar and requiring surgical stabilization. Several authors proposed a comprehensive classification of cervical spine injury. One of the most commonly used is the Allen classification, based on 4 primary vector forces (compression, distraction, flexion, extension) and four combinations between them From this classification, 4 primary mechanisms of injury with special imaging pattern of injury can be differentiated [ compression and compression/flexion wedge fractures burst fractures teardrop fractures flexion benign strains severe strains bilateral facet dislocation extension fractures on ankylosed spine (almost exclusively) whiplash trauma rotation, corresponding to Allen’s distraction/flexion facet fractures (a lateral compression component is probably present as well) fracture-dislocation of articular mass unilateral facet dislocation Falls (including shallow dives), motor vehicle accidents (especially in case of head-windshield impact) and motorcycle/bicycle accidents are the most frequently-encountered circumstances leading to compressive injuries of the cervical spine [ The typical “footprint” of compression injuries is a horizontal fracture of the vertebral body with a variable loss of height Pure compression forces give a central compression fracture with possible comminution. If bending forces are associated, a wedge compression of the vertebral body happen. Last, if bending forces are predominant, tensile failure of the posterior elements can occur Wedge fractures are characterized by loss of vertebral body height, predominantly of its anterior aspect. No evidence of distraction or translation are seen, even if a certain amount of head flexion is probably present Burst fractures are comminuted vertebral fractures, secondary to severe axial loading Teardrop fractures occur almost exclusively at the cervical spine. They result from a severe axial loading with head bending They have a characteristic appearance that associates two fracture lines within the vertebral body: a frontal one and a sagittal one The flexion component generates distraction injuries of the posterior structures with tears of interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum, and facet capsules Those injuries represent a continuum of discoligamentous injuries (ligamentum flavum, interspinous ligaments, longitudinal ligaments, facet capsules) ranging from benign sprains to unstable disruption allowing dislocations The usual “footprint” of flexion-induced injuries is the distraction of posterior structures, such as ligamentous rupture. Horizontal fractures of lamina or spinous process can occur as well and are sometimes the only clue indicative of posterior distraction. Benign strains are the most common cervical spine injuries Severe sprains occur when discoligamentous structures are weakened, allowing vertebral translation above the physiologic ranges Commonly recognized items indicative of ligamentous insufficiency are [ vertebral body translation over 3, 5 mm endplates angulation over 10° loss of facet contact > 50% loss of facet parallelism interspinous widening It should be kept in mind that those criteria were obtained using upright radiographs; their translation to CT remains to be validated Bilateral facet dislocations are severe injuries with extensive damage to the disk (annuulus fibrosus) or ligaments (ALL, facet capsules, PLL, LF, ISL, SSL) [ Radiographs and CT show the vertebral translation and the loss of facet contact, that are either completely dislocated or perched ( C6-C7 is the most commonly affected level. Due to a spinal canal compromise, they are almost always associated with significant neurological damage to the spinal cord The term “whiplash” refers to an injury of the soft tissue of the neck caused by a sudden movement of the head backwards and forwards, with the cervical spine sustaining sudden extension followed by forced flexion Extension injuries occur generally, but not exclusively, on ankylosed spines They result from either non-contact (whiplash) or contact injuries (impact of the forehead in the windshield or airbag deployment) The fracture line can start at the level of the vertebral body or the intervertebral disc and then runs into the posterior osteoligamentous structures ( Normal alignment can spontaneously restore in the supine position (e.g. patient lying on the CT table): any trauma patient with a painful ankylosed spine must be suspected of having an extension injury. Extension injuries on non-ankylosed spines can be challenging to detected. A pure extension mechanism is rare and most injuries occur during a whiplash mechanism that combines both flexion and extension-related damages. The most common finding is an anterior widening of the disc ( Large bony fragments can be avulsed, but in contrast to flexion injuries, teardrop fractures seen in hyperextension don’t classically have a loss of vertebral body height ( In children, Sharpey fibers are inserted on vertebral rim apophysis that can be avulsed by a sudden head extension ( Excessive rotation is possible after brutal flexion with lateral bending. Due to the spine anatomy, such motion is automatically associated to a certain amount of spine rotation Facets are locks that prevent excessive cervical rotation and they are stressed during distractive/flexion strain Facet fractures can be seen in different mechanisms of injury I, but rotation-flexion motion seems to be the most commonly encountered mechanism Isolated unilateral facet fractures are generally considered as stable: instability may exist if there is [ an accompanying disk disruption a concomitant anterior longitudinal ligament injury a large fracture fragment, involving 40% of the absolute height of the intact lateral mass or of an absolute height of 1 cm Fracture-separation is a large facet fracture, with pedicle and laminar involvement Several soft tissue structures that provide stability to the lower cervical spine (ISL, LF and facet capsule) are damaged in unilateral facet dislocation (UFD), allowing a rotational displacement of facet [ C6-C7 is the most commonly involved level, and most of the patients with UFD present with neurological symptoms On radiographs, the clues for UFD are ( a vertebral body malalignment with disorganization of anterior and posterior lines. a loss of facet alignment with a transitional level with a “double facet” appearance spinous process malalignment vertebral angulation, inconstant On CT images ( facets are completely dislocated (“over the top”) or one is perched over the other (“on the top”). the inferior facet of level If isolated, some fractures require no specific treatment and failure to identify them would be unlikely to cause any harm to patients simple wedge compression fracture (height loss < 25 percent) isolated avulsion fractures (without associated ligamentous injury) isolated osteophytes fractures (not corner or teardrop) isolated transverse process fracture “Clay shoveler” fracture, a fatigue fracture of the tip of spinous process due to repeated muscle strain
