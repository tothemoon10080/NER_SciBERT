A study of the mechanochemical activation of molybdenum ore concentrate (MoS2) with sodium peroxide (Na2O2) shows that sodium molybdate dihydrate (Na2MoO4 ·2H2O) is the final crystalline product. The mechanochemical formation of sodium molybdate dihydrate is evidenced by XRD, 23Na MAS NMR and the increasing solubility of the molybdenum in water as the oxidative reaction proceeds.Molybdenite (MoS It has been noted that fine grinding accelerates the rate of molybdenite leaching in nitric acid ( The results indicate the thermodynamic feasibility of reaction The aim of the present research was to examine the feasibility of carrying out reaction The molybdenite used in these experiments was supplied by the Erdenet copper–molybdenum ore dressing factory (Mongolia) and had the average XRF chemical composition (in wt.%) of 54.1% Mo, 1.4% Fe, 1.71% Cu, 0.28% K The sodium peroxide was analytical grade Na  After 5 The solid state The sample ground for 30 Thus, solid state According to the thermodynamic calculation, reaction The formation of a soluble molybdenum compound upon grinding is also evidenced by the increasing solubility of the molybdenum in water ( The raw molybdenite concentrate shows no solubility in water, but in the sample milled for 5 Molybdenum sulphide ore can be processed to a more soluble form (sodium molybdenum oxide dihydrate) by mechanochemical reaction with sodium peroxide. During milling, some of the sodium peroxide also transforms to sodium oxide which undergoes atmospheric carbonation to form sodium carbonate. Milling for longer times increases the formation of crystalline Na The authors wish to thank Dr. N. Welham (Murdoch University, Australia) for his fruitful suggestions.
