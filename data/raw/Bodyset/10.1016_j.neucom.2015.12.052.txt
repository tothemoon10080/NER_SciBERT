                      performance level are established. Based on the conditions, an explicit expression for the desired filter is given. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the validness of the proposed scheme.During the past few years, much attention has been devoted to the study of neural networks (NNs) due to the fact that NNs can be extensively applied in a variety of areas, such as fixed-point computation, pattern recognition and associative memory In practice, some state variables of certain system cannot be measured directly. In order to cope with this gap, the filtering or state estimation problem has been gaining a remarkable momentum In addition, the packet dropouts are usually inevitable due to the limited capacity in transmission mechanism, sudden data loss of some measurements, or data inaccessibility at certain times. To overcome this shortage, a Bernoulli distributed stochastic process was proposed which can describe the data dropout phenomenon reasonably In this paper, we tackle the resilient finite-time filtering problem for discrete-time uncertain MJNNs with packet dropouts. The main contributions lie in some sufficient conditions provided to guarantee the filtering error system is finite-time bounded with a prescribed The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
