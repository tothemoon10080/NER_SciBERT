The photodegradation of an industrial azo dye C.I Basic Red 46 was examined in a fixed-bed photoreactor using UV-lamps simulated to the solar irradiation. In our photodecolorization study, the UV/TiO2 process was optimized using the Box-Behnken approach to evaluate the synergistic effects of three independent parameters (initial concentration of the dye, flow rate, and UV intensity) on mineralization effectiveness. The response surface methodology was in good promise with the prediction model (coefficients of determination of decolorization and mineralization were R2
                     Dec = 0.997 and R2
                     TOC = 0.994, respectively). The effects of the factors could be estimated from a second–order polynomial equation and student’s t-test. The optimal parameters of decolorization and mineralization were as follows: initial concentration of colorant 25 mg L−1, rate of fluid flow 0.3 L min−1, and ultraviolet light intensity 38.1 W m−2. The decolorization and mineralization removal efficiency under these optimal conditions were 100% and 57.63% respectively. These results indicate that optimization using response surface methodology, based on the Box-Behnken approach, is an excellent tool for determining the optimal conditions, and the process can be easily extrapolated for a specific treatment of real waste water containing the azo dye C.I Basic Red 46. Also, the intermediates that were produced during photodegradation process of Basic Red 46 were determined by GC/MS.The dyes have been used widely as colorants in various industries, such as textile, pharmaceutical and food. The 70% of all reactive dyes are the azo variety, whereas the others are primarily the anthraquinonic and phtalocyanine types ( The water regulations depend on the type of the matrices. The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (DEPA) has classified the azo-dye as a suspected human carcinogen. The DEPA has set a maximum concentration level of this emerging contaminant in drinking water at 3.1 μg L The dyes in wastewater are emerging contaminants and often require specific treatment. Currently, the new chemical oxidation technologies to treat wastewater contributed to the development of performing methods for elimination called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) ( In the photocatalytic UV/semiconductor process system, the photonic excitation produces electron–hole pairs in the surface of the semiconductor. The highly oxidative The photocatalysis process is strongly dependent on various operational conditions which require the development of experimental design allowing the study and the optimization of their influence during the photodegradation process. Design of experiments as a powerful tool is used to examine the effects of the selected factors on the response process. Response surface methodology (RSM) has been applied widely to solve many optimization photocatalysis process, including ZnO or TiO In this work, three independents parameters such as initial pollutant concentration, light intensity, and flow rate; using response surface methodology are examined. This methodology is based on Box-Behnken design, of photocatalytic decolorization and mineralization of an industrial cationic dye Basic Red 46 (BR46) in a fixed-bed photoreactor using immobilized catalyst TiO The experimental setup as shown schematically in ( Three UV-A lamps (PL-L 24 W/10/4P PHILIPS) with maximum peak intensity of 356 nm, set inside the stainless steel cover against the six steps of the photoreactor ( A reservoir (2.5 L) opens to the air and associated with an agitation system, insured by a magnetic stirrer to provide sufficient oxygenation (O The flow rate was controlled by GearPump Drive 75211–15 (Cole-Parmer Instrument Company) operating up to 130 L h Basic Red 46 ( The reactor was made of six regular steps of the same dimensions (depth/height/width: 6 cm/ 6 cm/ 25 cm) covered with the photocatalytic media (0.18 m The application of experimental design as a powerful statistical tool allows to reduce process variability combined with the requirement of less resources (time, reagents and experimental work), meanwhile, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) allows to solve multivariable equations and evaluate the relative significance of several affecting factors even in the presence of complex interaction. The second-order polynomial equation describe the rate of photodegradation versus the selected functional parameters, including initial dye concentration (X A second-order polynomial model provided by Box-Behnken design which relates the response Y to selected factors X MINITAB stat software (16 Minitab Institute, USA) offers full quadratic regression method to analyze responses and it was used to fit the mathematical models of the experimental data to the second-order polynomial equation. The analysis of samples at an equal interval time of 10 min were carried out using a UV–VIS spectra (Shimadzu UV-1603) to determine the absorbance which is related to the concentration by a calibration plot, based on Beer–Lambert’s law, therefore, both of decolorization and mineralization yield (Y Decolorization yield of the dye BR 46 was determined by UV absorption at λmax = 365 nm using a UV–VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1603). Total organic carbon in a sample is measured by the amount of CO The three-level matrix generated by Box-Behnken design with the responses obtained experimentally for the photodecolorization and photodegradation (mineralization) are shown in ( The experimental responses versus the predicted ones are shown in ( ANOVA ( The P-values were also used to verify the significance of each coefficient; if P-value < 0.05 the terms of model were significant, thus the coefficient is more significant in the greater magnitude of the student’s The effects of factors can be estimated from the second-order polynomial equation and student’s Pareto chart test ( The Pareto analysis ( Level plots ( In order to prove the powerful of the statistical tool used to optimize the operating conditions; the process optimum values for the maximum decolorization efficiency is easily determined by taking the derivatives with respect to each variable and solving for zero,. After verifying by a further experimental test with the predicted values, the result indicates that the maximal decolorization efficiency was obtained when the values of each parameter were set as the optimum values, the predicted and observed Y Photodegradation of the BR46 azo dye was examined by controlling the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) decreasing in the mineralization process which was much slower than decolorization process, thus the complete oxidation of BR46 indicates the total conversion of organic carbon into mineral carbon (CO The formation of uncolored by-product during the photo-conversion process which persists until 300 min in BR46 solution with the main dye molecules. The GC/MS technique was employed for identification of by-products compounds after photodegradation process. GC/MS was performed to follow up on the competitiveness of the intermediates that were generated during the destruction ( The highly oxidative Photooxidation of BR 46 mechanism can be summarized as follows: Both oxidation and reduction processes take place on the surface of the photocatalyst. The response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design, were employed for analysis the decolorization and mineralization of an industrial azo dye, C.I Basic Red 46, in a fixed bed photoreactor. This study has demonstrated the applicability of this experimental design to develop the second-order polynomial response equation and analysis of variance (ANOVA), indicating a very high coefficient of determination (R
