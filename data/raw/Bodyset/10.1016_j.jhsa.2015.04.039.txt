The treatment of terrible triad injuries of the elbow continues to evolve. Radial head fixation and arthroplasty, coronoid process fixation, and repair of the lateral collateral ligament continue to be the mainstays of treatment. In the elbow with persistent instability after repair of these elements, application of a static external fixation, hinged external fixation, ulnohumeral joint pinning, or an internal hinge may be needed. In patients who undergo treatment after the acute injury period, the coronoid may require reconstruction using radial head autograft, iliac crest autograft, olecranon autograft, or allograft.
