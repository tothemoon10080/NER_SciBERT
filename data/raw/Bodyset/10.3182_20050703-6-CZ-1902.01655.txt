Recycling of paper is typically performed in a chain of processes. An important process is the peroxide bleaching implementing the means to achieve a high brightness quality. As this process step requires consumption of various chemicals, it is quite cost intensive. This paper presents means to optimize the bleaching stage to achieve an (adaptable) trade-off between cost and brightness: First, the time-varying deadtime of the bleaching stage is estimated using a Kalman filter. Second, the bleaching stage is modelled by Gaussian processes aiming to be used for optimization of the bleaching stage by application of a model predictive controller.
