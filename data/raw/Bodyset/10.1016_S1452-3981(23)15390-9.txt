The effect different deposition regimes (constant and reversing currents), on the powdered copper electrodeposits morphology were investigated. The results obtained in constant regimes were compared with those obtained in reversing regimes. The morphology of electrodeposited copper powder were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effect of the current amplitude, cathodic-to-anodic time ratio and period of the current wave are discussed. It is shown that the parameters determining the reversing current wave determine the micromorphology of the copper powder particles deposited. On the other side, technological properties of powders depend on their granulometry and particle morphology. Very often one method is inadequate for characterization of the morphology of powder particles. This paper also studied different methods for clear describing of the copper powder granulometry and morphology.
