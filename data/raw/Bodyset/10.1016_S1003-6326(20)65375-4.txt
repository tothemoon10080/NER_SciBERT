Top ash from hot-dip galvanizing plant was investigated as a source of secondary zinc to be returned to galvanizing bath. The waste material contained 63% Zn as metallic, oxide and hydroxychloride phases. It was leached in H2SO4 solutions (20% and 25%) at various bath loadings (100−300 g/L). Leaching behaviors of zinc, manganese, iron and chloride ions were investigated. A few strategies of iron elimination from leaching liquors were examined. Flocculant addition was harmful for subsequent filtration of iron precipitates due to increased viscosity of solution, while a combination of zinc oxide and calcium carbonate for rising pH resulted in the formation of dense suspension unenforceable to separate from zinc sulphate solution. Zinc electrowinning was carried out at different pH (from −0.5 to 2.8) using a range of current densities (3−10 A/dm2). Optimal conditions for pure metal recovery were: leaching in 20% H2SO4 solution at zinc ash content 100−150 g/L, Fe2O3·xH2O precipitation using H2O2 and CaCO3, zinc electrowinning at pH of 0.1−1.0 at 3−6 A/dm2. Correlations between pH and free H2SO4 concentration in electrolyte solutions were also discussed. pH−acid concentration dependence for zinc electrolyte was between experimental and calculated curves for pure H2SO4 solutions, while the curve was shifted towards lower pH if ferric ions were in the solution.
