High amylose cross-linked to different degrees with sodium trimetaphosphate by varying base strength (2% or 4%) and contact time (0.5–4h) was evaluated as non-compacted systems for sodium diclophenac controlled release. The physical properties and the performance of these products for sodium diclophenac controlled release from non-compacted systems were related to the structures generated at each cross-linking degree. For samples at 2% until 2h the swelling ability, G′ and η* values increased with the cross-linking degree, because the longer polymer chains became progressively more entangled and linked. This increases water uptake and holding, favoring the swelling and resulting in systems with higher viscosities. Additionally, the increase of cross-linking degree should contribute for a more elastic structure. The shorter chains with more inter-linkages formed at higher cross-linking degrees (2%4h and 4%) make water caption and holding difficult, decreasing the swelling, viscosity and elasticity. For 2% samples, the longer drug release time exhibited for 2%4h sample indicates that the increase of swelling and viscosity contribute for a more sustained drug release, but the mesh size of the polymeric network seems to be determinant for the attachment of drug molecules. For the 4% samples, smaller meshes size should determine less sustained release of drug.There has been a continuous interest of the pharmaceutical industries in the research and development of sustained or controlled drug release. Polymers are almost indispensable to prepare oral drug delivery systems and among them, polysaccharides play an important role due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. In 1991, high amylose cross-linked with epichloridrin was introduced as excipient, assuring a theophylline sustained release of about 20 It was proposed that the high amylose could be properly cross-linked with the non-toxic sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) ( Following that routine, eight samples at 0.5 In the present work, these cross-linked polymers were used as excipients for the preparation of non-compacted solid systems (physical mixtures) for drug delivery purposes. This study was performed evaluating the influence of the cross-linking degrees on the physical characteristics (particle size distribution, swelling degree and rheological properties) of these systems as well as on the Acetone and hydrochloric acid (Synth, Diadema, Brazil), purified water (Milli-Q Plus System Millipore), high amylose (HYLON VII, National Starch and Chemical, 70% amylose, 30% amylopectin, New Jersey, EUA), sodium diclofenac (Henrifarma, São Paulo, Brazil), sodium hydroxide (Grupo Química, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), trisodium trimetaphosphate (Sigma–Aldrich Co., St. Louis, USA) were used as purchased. High amylose was cross-linked as described earlier ( The analyses of the size distribution of the samples at 16-fold magnification were performed with a The swelling dynamics was determined with an Enslin's device ( The viscoelastic properties of the 1% aqueous dispersions of the samples were assessed through dynamic oscillatory measures on a stress controlled cone-plate Carrie Med SLM 100 rheometer (diameter 4 For this analysis, samples were prepared by manually mixing 50 The size distribution of the samples prepared with 2% NaOH is depicted in The same principle may explain the size distribution of the 2 and 4 The samples prepared at 4% base strength (  The characterization of the rheological behavior of the cross-linked polymers was performed by the evaluation of the storage (G′) and loss ( The values of All cross-linked samples showed an increase in the water uptake in relation to native high amylose ( At the initial stages of cross-linking, the introduction of terminal phosphate groups may serve to increase the hydrophilic character of the cross-linked polymers, since the ionization of those dangling groups shall increase their water uptake ( The combined factors, which seem to accompany the phosphate cross-linking processes of high amylose, point to a maximum swelling capacity for the samples obtained at 2  The release profile of the samples cross-linked at 2% base strength ( It is also interesting to note that the release profiles for the 2% samples shows a increase of the time of drug release with the increase of the cross-linking reaction time. Although samples produced at shorter reaction times released circa 80% of the drug between 7 and 9 The particle size distribution correlated well with the cross-linking degree. The rheological behavior presented, in which
