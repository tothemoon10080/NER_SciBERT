Reflux™ Classifier (RC), one of the advance gravity separator in coal and mineral processing industries, is a combination of liquid fluidized bed, autogenous dense medium and lamella settler. In the previously published literature, the feasibility of the RC for beneficiating low ash Australian coals was analyzed. However, the sensitivity analysis of RC for various operating conditions was not critically assessed for the high ash coking coal fines (0.25–2 mm). Moreover, the clean coal ash and yield relationship is also not established. The parametric evaluation of the effects of important parameters such as feed flow rate, bed setpoint and fluidization water velocity of RC on the concentrate ash, size and yield is investigated in the current work. The separation performance of RC is described through the partition curves, in terms of separation density (

                     ) and Ecart probable error (Ep). The variation in separation density is also quantified using the slip velocity model. In the laboratory experimentation, the clean coal having ash in the range of 7.9 to 20% was produced from a feed containing around 28% ash content on dry basis. The yield obtained varied from 31 to 64%. It was also observed that the separation density (

                     ) varied from 1.34 to 1.7 and the Ecart probable error (Ep) varied from 0.07 to 0.1, depending on the operating conditions.India requires 100 million tonne per annum (mtpa) metallurgical coal to meet the steel production target of 200 mtpa from 90 mtpa by 2020 as per nee steel policy ( Reflux™ Classifier is a combination of lamella settler, autogenous dense medium separator and fluidized bed separator ( The objective of this research work is to evaluate the gravity concentration efficacy of the RC for high ash Indian coking coal fines. In the experimentation, the effect of critical operating parameters such ash feed rate, bed setpoint and fluidization water velocity on concentrate ash content and yield are investigated. The objective is also to establish yield- ash relationship with separation density ( Galvin et al ( The RC was also explored to be utilized as an alternate to traditional float and sink apparatus to establish theoretical washability curve for coal fines. It was observed that RC cannot fractionate at specific density cut points like standard sink – float method. However, the cumulative yield-ash data closely matches with the yield – ash curve ( The separation physics of RC can be explained using hindered particle settling approach. If A single spherical particle in an unbounded fluid has a density,      The particle will experience a downwards gravitational force The relative velocity, U, between the particle and the liquid will generate a drag force on the particle, given by At low Reynolds number The terminal velocities, U When a particle resides in a suspension, it is appropriate to refer to the slip velocity, U In hinder settling condition, a particle in a suspension experiences a resistance to the motion that is dependent upon the neighboring state of the suspension. At low Reynolds numbers, the drag force acting on the particle is directly proportional to the slip velocity( and hence the hindered settling factor is the ratio of the two velocities, the slip velocity of the particle species, U      The Lockett and Al-Habbooby ( However, both these models are applicable when all species are of the same density and these models are invalid for systems containing multiple component with different density and size. Hence, ( The coal sample for the experiments was collected from the feed to West Bokaro coal washery, India. Honaker and Mondal ( Sequential sink–float tests were conducted for the coal sample to evaluate the Washability characteristics of the coal. Organic liquid mixtures (Benzene, Tetrachloroethylene, and Bromoform) having a specific gravity ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 with an increment of 0.1 were used for the analysis. The float-and-sink products were washed, dried, weighed and analyzed for the ash content. The organic micro constituents of coal are termed as macerals and based on their reflectance level these can be categorized by petrographic analysis into three groups: vitrinite, liptinite and inertinite. During the carbonization stage in coke making process, only vitrinite and liptinite are reactive to become plastic, while inertinite remains inactive. Hence first two macerals are termed as reactive and later is called non-reactive macerals. In the current research work petrography analysis was carried out for one set of reflux™ classifier products (clean coal and rejects) and the corresponding feed samples. Macerals were identified, using Leica DM6000 M fully automated microscopy system, as per the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology procedure ( Small-scale laboratory Reflux™ Classifier (RC100) was employed in this experimentation. The schematic diagram of RC setup with all accessories is shown in In the coal preparation plants, the performance of any gravity separator can be quantified using partition curves. These are largely independent of the feed and in fact provides a highly effective basis for modelling the separation achieved for very different feeds. The partition curves are expressed as a function of particle density. Each product sample was fractionated using a series of dense liquid baths starting from 1.3 to 2.0 density. Particles that float in one bath but sink in the next bath have a density, nominally, at a value midway between the densities of the two baths. The objective of this exercise was to obtain information on the proportion of the feed particles of a given nominal density that report to concentrate. This proportion is described by a partition number, P, that denotes the probability of particles having a given density reporting to the concentrate. The partition curve is then formed using the product streams. The sharpness of any gravity separation can be determined by Ecart probable error, Ep, ( The Ep values indicates the sharpness of separation and less values were desirable for any gravity separation as it indicates less misplacements. The imperfection values indicate the degree of deviation from the perfect separation. The imperfection of the gravity separation can be represented by    Typically, these value in the range of 0.7 to 0.11 is satisfactory for gravity separation ( The mass balanced product streams values were used to calculate the partition number. These values were used to plot the partition curves against the specific gravity. It shows the probability of particles of a given density reporting to the product stream. Gravity concentration data was fitted to the Whitten equation     The size analysis results is shown in The effect of feed flow rate on the separation efficiency of RC was investigated by varying the feed flow rate from 5 to 8.4 lpm with an increment of 1.7lpm. During the experimentation, the other two variables, set point density (bed density) and fluidization water velocity, were kept constant at 1450 kg/m The effect of feed rate on the concentrate size is shown in Since, variation in feed rate was not showing any significant variation in the concentration ash, a washability analysis was carried out for one test to evaluate the separation efficiency of RC. Partition coefficients calculated with respect to relative density is shown in In coal preparation plants, the relationship between the separation density or gravity cut point ( The effect of bed setpoint on the concentrate size was also investigated. The results are shown in Partition curves were plotted for three bed setpoints by drawing representative samples from the corresponding products are shown in  In RC, the particles in the feed stream are settle in the decreasing order of the settling velocities against the rising fluidization water. Particles with less settling velocity report to upper layers of the autogenous bed and higher settling velocity report to the bottom layers of the bed. As per the design criteria of the RC, the dependence of settling velocity on the particle size can be suppressed by using lamella of inclined plates above the fluidization section. In the RC, the superficial velocity is directly proportional to the particle size ( The effect of fluidization water velocity on the separation efficiency of RC was investigated by varying the fluidization water flowrate from 1.7 to 4.9 lpm. The other two variables, feed rate and bed setpoint was kept constant at 6.7 lpm and 1200 kg/m The effect of fluidization water velocity on the concentrate size is shown in Washability analysis was carried out for the three test products and partition curves were plotted against the specific gravity and results are shown in The effect of fluidization water velocity on particle segregation can explained using the slip velocity model by plotting the slip velocity to the particle size as shown in Petrography analysis of the product and feed samples is shown in A comprehensive parametric (feed rate, bed setpoint and fluidization water velocity) evaluation of the Reflux™ Classifier (RC) was carried out for the beneficiation of high ash coking coal fines. It is evident that from the experimental results that the feed flow rate was not the not a significant parameter on the gravity concentration. RC produced clean coal having ash content in the range of 7.9 to 20% by adjusting the operating parameters. The clean coal ash and yield curve for high ash coking coal was established. The corresponding yields were in the range of 31 to 64% respectively. The clean coal ash content and the corresponding yield increased with the increase in the bed setpoint and fluidization water velocity. Lower ash concentrates were obtained at low level of bed setpoint and fluidization water velocity and high ash concentrates were obtained at higher levels. Both fluidization velocity and bed setpoint have substantial influence on the gravity separation in the RC. The recovery of coarse particles increased with rise in both fluidization water velocity and bed setpoint in the concentrate stream. Partition curves illustrate that separation densities ( Authors are thankful to Dr Sanjay Chandra, Chief R&D for his support and valuable suggestions during this research work.
