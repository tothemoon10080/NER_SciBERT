Abstract
                  Twenty-four unstable tibial fractures were stabilized with a narrow limited contact-dynamic compression plate inserted using a percutaneous plating technique under fluoroscopic guidance. The major indication for this technique was a tibial fracture for which intramedullary nailing would be difficult. There were 16 proximal or distal metaphyseal fractures and 5 segmental fractures in adults and 3 mid-shaft fractures in adolescents who still had an open physis. Of the 24 fractures, 22 healed without a second procedure; the two failures included one that required an early bone graft for severe comminution and another with a superficial infection that healed after early removal of the plate. There were no other infections. There were three cases of screw breakage, but they did not require a further procedure. At the final follow-up, one patient had healed with 5° varus alignment and another with 10° external rotation. All the patients had good knee or ankle function. We are confident that the percutaneous plating technique to treat unstable tibial fractures for which intramedullary nailing would be difficult will prove to be an alternative stabilization method, as it avoids the risk of infection or soft tissue compromise.
