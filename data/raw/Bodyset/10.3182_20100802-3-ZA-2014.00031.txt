Anglo Platinum's flotation circuit control solution includes a layered approach that involves base-layer, fuzzy logic rule-based and model predictive control that enables a robust approach to optimization. This paper reviews Anglo Platinum's approach to the flotation mass pull and grade control problem and describes the benefits that have been derived from a wide range of feed conditions and equipment from four industrial installations.
