Control of blast furnace (BF) ironmaking process has always been a hot and difficult issue in metallurgic engineering and automation. In this paper, a novel data-driven inverse system identification based predictive control method is proposed for multivariate molten iron quality (MIQ) indices in BF ironmaking process. First, since the widely used least-square support regression (LS-SVR) algorithm cannot cope with the multi-output problem directly, this paper uses multi-task transfer learning technology to construct a novel multi-output LS-SVR (M-LS-SVR) for multivariable nonlinear systems. Then, this M-LS-SVR is adopted to identify the inverse system model of the controlled BF ironmaking process with the help of the presented modeling performance comprehensive evaluation and NSGA II based multi-objective parameter optimization. In order to better perform the control of the MIQ indices, the identified inverse system model is used to compensate the controlled nonlinear BF system to a compounded pseudo linear system with linear transitive relation. Such an inverse system based data-driven predictive control can effectively improve the control performance of the conventional nonlinear predictive control. Data experiments using actual industrial data from a large BF show that the proposed methods are effective, advanced and practical, and provide a solution to the operational control and optimization of the BF ironmaking process.As one of the largest reactors in the iron and steel industry, the ironmaking blast furnace (BF) is a vertical metallurgical furnace used for producing hot metal from oxide ore for the subsequent steelmaking processing The principal functionality of the ironmaking BF is to continuously produce liquid hot metal of high quality with low production cost. To achieve this goal, it is important to maintain smooth and stable operation of the BF and to retain the process at its optimum steady-state operation. Therefore, real-time optimization and control of the BF process is necessary. There is no doubt that operational optimization and control of BF ironmaking process depends mainly on good measurement of the multivariate molten iron quality (MIQ) indices, namely the molten iron temperature (physical heat, MIT for short), the Si content (chemical heat, [Si] for short), the phosphorus content ([P] for short) and the sulfur content ([S] for short). Such four quality indices not only reflect the operational status and energy consumption of the whole BF ironmaking process, but also determine the subsequent steel products quality and energy consumption of the whole metallurgical production Although the MIQ indices are very important to the daily production of the BF ironmaking, adjustment of the MIQ indices still largely relies on manual operations of experienced on-site operators, who monitor the status of the process and take proper actions to control the MIQ indices It is well known that predictive control has been the dominant technology for advanced control in industrial practice because of its excellent capability in handling multivariable processes with constraints On the other hand, since the BF ironmaking process has extreme complicated nonlinear coupling dynamics, a single predictive control method is difficult to overcome the inherent serious nonlinear dynamic and coupling effects of the process, thus cannot achieve satisfied control performance. To reduce the control difficulties and improve the predictive control performance, an effective and practical method can resort to the inverse system method which linearizes and decouples the controlled nonlinear system to a pseudo linear system with linear transitive relation in advance In view of the above practical engineering control problems, and with the benefit of the developed multi-output least squares support vector regression (M-LS-SVR) algorithm, this paper proposes a novel data-driven inverse system based predictive control method for the MIQ indices in BF ironmaking. Aiming at the multivariable coupling characteristics of the studied BF ironmaking system and the single output limit of classical LS-SVR Compared to ε-SVR, the LS-SVR changes the inequality constraints into equality constraints and adopts the sum of squares error (SSE) cost function instead of ε-insensitive loss. In this way, the solution of LS-SVR directly follows from solving a linear set of equations, which remarkably reduces the computational complexity However, the standard LS-SVR cannot directly cope with the multi-output problem existing in various practical engineering applications. A widely used procedure is to train multiple independent LS-SVRs models for the multi-output system synchronously. Obviously, this will disregard the underlying coupling relationship among different outputs. To this end, the multi-output version of LS-SVR should be realized for multivariable coupling system. Several methods can be used to realize the multi-output LS-SVR, such as multi-task transfer learning method The feature-based TL is a new machine learning framework that allows the training and testing data to come from different feature spaces. The main idea behind the TL is to borrow knowledge extracted from some related domains to help a machine learning algorithm to achieve greater performance in the domain of interest Indeed, the function of Let the entire weight vector Denote To solve the optimization problem in The following linear equations can be obtained by eliminating For the proposed M-LS-SVR based modeling method, the hyperparameters Then, taking this multi-objective evaluation index as the fitness function, the NSGA II algorithm Inverse system method is a feedback linearization method which is specific, intuitionist and understandable [18–21]. In the classical inverse system method, it first uses feedback design method to get the inverse system of the controlled process, and then uses the obtained inverse system to compensate the controlled nonlinear system to a system with linear transfer relation. Then, the linear system design method can be used to complete the control and synthesis of nonlinear system. Although the inverse system method can compensate the controlled nonlinear system to a pseudo linear system with linear transitive relation, the premise of its application is that an exact mathematical model of the controlled process must be known. However it is difficult to accurately develop the model of controlled process in industrial practice. Moreover, for most of the practical industrial systems, it is difficult to identify the inverse model even if the exact mathematical model of process is established. All of these problems become a bottleneck in industrial application of the inverse system method Let the BF ironmaking process be represented as the following Now given a set of independent and identically distributed samples Here, the proposed data-driven M-LS-SVR algorithm is first used to identify the inverse system model of the controlled BF process by realizing the following mapping relationship The mapping relationship established by the M-LS-SVR based prediction model is: In a detailed description, using the M-LS-SVR algorithm, the developed P-step-ahead predictive model of the MIQ indices is as follows: Adopt the following one-order smooth model as the reference trajectory equation so that the current output In order to prevent the effects of model mismatch and external disturbance on the control performance, the prediction error is predicted and the feedback correction is carried out as follows: As the main feature of predictive control, the optimization in predictive control is a rolling optimization procedure in finite domain, which is different from the invariant global optimization objectives in traditional discrete optimal control. The performance index is shown in At each control time With the proposed M-LS-SVR and inverse system based predictive control methods, the main steps for a specific modeling and control task of BF ironmaking process are as follows:              The data experiment is done by using the running data of the #2 BF of Liuzhou Steel Co., Ltd with the proposed method. As the largest working blast furnace in Guangxi province of China, the #2 BF in Liuzhou Steel Co. Ltd. is put into operation in September 2012, its effective volume is 2650 m  During the modeling of the BF process with the proposed M-LS-SVR algorithm, the system order parameters of the prediction model and the inverse system model are all determined as Then, taking the developed M-LS-SVR based inverse system model to compensate the controlled nonlinear BF ironmaking process to a pseudo linear system with linear transitive relation, and with the developed M-LS-SVR prediction model as a predictor, the data-driven predictive control of the MIQ indices has been explored. The descriptive statistics and constraints of the process input and output variables are shown in At tapping number 3, the set-points of the MIQ indices are [Si] = 0.55%, [P] = 0.13%, [S] = 0.022% and MIT = 1505 In order to further verify the advancement and effectiveness of the proposed control method for the MIQ indices, the proposed INPC method is compared with the traditional nonlinear predictive control (NPC for short) method via industrial data based control experiment. During the control experiment, the proposed INPC method and the conventional NPC method use the same M-LS-SVR based prediction model, and the control parameters of the predictive controller adopt the same setting. That is, the control horizon and the prediction horizon are both set to 3, the feedback correction matrix and the weight matrix in the optimization performance index of Concerning improving the product quality and reducing energy consumption, the control of BF ironmaking process often means to control the final MIQ indices. In view of the disadvantages of the existing control methods for the MIQ indices in BF ironmaking, this paper has proposed a novel data-driven nonlinear inverse system identification based predictive control method for control of multivariate MIQ indices. For such a BF ironmaking process with extreme complicated nonlinear dynamics, the inverse system model as well as the prediction model is identified by the presented M-LS-SVR algorithm. And the performance of the data-driven predictive control of MIQ indices is enhanced by making the M-LS-SVR based inverse system cascade with the original nonlinear BF ironmaking system, which is equivalent to controlling a compounded pseudo linear system. Experiments using actual industrial data show that the proposed control method has obvious superiority in control of the multivariate MIQ indices, and has good practical engineering application prospects.
