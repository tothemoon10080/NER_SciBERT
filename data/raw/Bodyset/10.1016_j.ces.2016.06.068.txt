A novel process was designed for synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime using ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. Various reaction parameters were optimized such as the amount of ammonium chloride, catalyst and H2O2, reaction temperature, reaction time. Under the suitable reaction conditions, nearly 100% of conversion of cyclohexanone and 100% selectivity of cyclohexanone oxime were obtained at ambient condition. The reaction mechanism was proposed by combining experiments with density functional theory calculations.Cyclohexanone oxime is an important intermediate in chemical industry, particularly as a key precursor of Îµ-caprolactam for nylon production ( Additionally, ammonium chloride was a by-product in the production of sodium carbonate with Alkaline Hou Shi system in China. Ammonium chloride was mainly used as a nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture and also applied in the fields of food, medicine, hydrometallurgy and battery, etc. However there is still much left to do. Hence, there is a growing incentive for the development of a new environmental friendly utilization of ammonium chloride. More recently, The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of synthesizing cyclohexanone oxime efficiently using ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. Various reaction conditions including catalyst amount, reaction temperature and reaction time were investigated for optimization of the reaction. Moreover, the possible reaction pathways were also verified via experiments and density functional theory calculations. Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1), TS-2, Ti-MWW and Ti-MOR were obtained commercially and tested as catalyst. All other chemicals (AR grade) were commercially available and used without further purification. The catalytic ammoximation was carried out in a 100 The obtained organic phase contained cyclohexanone, cyclohexanone oxime and toluene, which was identified by comparison of their retention time with those of authentic samples, and by a Thermo Trace DSQ gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The concentrations of organic components were analyzed by an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography. Cyclohexanone conversion (        The compositions of catalysts were analyzed by PerkinElmer Optima 7300 During the past decades, a number of titanosilicates catalysts have been developed, such as TS-1 ( It can be seen from The effects of NaOH concentration and NH The effects of amounts of TS-1 catalyst and H The influences of reaction temperature and time were depicted in The reaction was carried out under the above optimal conditions. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was extracted with toluene. The obtained organic phase mainly contained cyclohexanone oxime and toluene. Then some white solid (5.5 Cyclohexanone oxime can be acquired from the organic phase. The obtained aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Under the above-mentioned optimal reaction conditions, some 7.0 In addition, the reusability of the TS-1 catalyst was investigated in the ammoximation. Since TS-1 was a solid catalyst in the liquid-phase reaction, it could be separated by a simple filtration, followed by drying and calcinations. Then the regenerated catalyst was tested under the same reaction conditions as for the fresh one. The results were given in Ammoximation of cyclohexanone using NH Concerning the present ammoximation using NH In addition, in order to verify ammoximation using NH Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to study the hydroxylamine mechanism and CHA mechanism ( On the basis of the above results, the present ammoximation using NH In summary, a novel process was realized for synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime using ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. For the reaction, various reaction parameters were optimized such as NaOH/cyclohexanone molar ratio, the amount of catalyst, reaction temperature and reaction time. Results showed that the optimized reaction conditions were NH The authors are grateful for the financial support of the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
