Liquidus phase equilibrium data of the present authors for the PbO-ZnO and the PbO-ZnO-SiO2 systems (as a part of multicomponent PbO-ZnO-FeO-Fe2O3-Cu2O-CaO-SiO2), combined with phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data from the literature, have been used to obtain a self-consistent set of parameters of the thermodynamic models for all phases. The modified quasichemical model is used for the liquid slag phase. From these model parameters, the optimized ternary phase diagram is back calculated.Experiments are performed to support thermodynamic database development. Thermodynamic predictions are used to identify gaps and discrepancies and to plan further experiments. A thermodynamic ‘‘optimization’’ of a system using the CALPHAD approach involves critical simultaneous evaluation of all available phase equilibria and thermodynamic data to obtain one set of model equations for the Gibbs energies of all phases as functions of temperature and composition Critical review of available data has shown that the existence of other oxidation states than Pb Properties of pure PbO, ZnO and SiO Present assessment is undertaken to improve the description of the thermochemistry of the PbO-ZnO-SiO Despite a large number of previous studies of the PbO-SiO Other experimental data, including the activities of PbO The previous model Activities of ZnO (relative to solid zincite) in liquid ZnO-SiO No experimental study has been conducted within the present research program, since the available literature data have been concluded to be sufficient for thermodynamic reoptimization of the ZnO-SiO Among all binary systems considered here, this one is the least studied. The studies available in literature are reviewed in the previous assessment by Jak Solubility of ZnO in (PbO) solid has been measured by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) in samples annealed at subsolidus temperatures by Jak A literature review and an extensive experimental study of solid-liquid phase equilibria of the PbO-ZnO-SiO The currently accepted secondary correction technique for measured PbO, ZnO, and SiO Activities of PbO in the low-ZnO and high-PbO PbO-ZnO-SiO In the present work, the Modified Quasichemical model (MQM) is used to model the liquid phase in the binary and ternary systems. The liquid oxide phase is described as an ionic liquid where Pb, Zn and Si cations mix on one sublattice, while oxygen anions occupy the other sublattice. The model has been described in detail by Pelton and co-workers All solid phases in the PbO-ZnO-SiO Optimized thermodynamic properties of the liquid slag solution and the ternary compounds are listed in The experimental results are compared to the optimized thermodynamic model calculations for the binary PbO-SiO Most primary phase field boundaries ( The solidus surface with Alkemade lines is presented in The root mean square (RMS) deviation of calculated liquidus from experimental data is chosen as a quantitative measure of the model performance. Its distribution by all phases that have liquidus points measured in the ternary system is shown in The activities of PbO in the PbO-SiO A critical evaluation of phase equilibria and thermodynamic data for the PbO-ZnO-SiO The authors would like to thank The raw/processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time due to legal or ethical reasons.
