Isothermal thermo-gravimetric analysis was applied to investigate the nitridation kinetics of manganese powder with different particle sizes at 800, 900 and 1000 Â°C. The apparent activation energy and nitridation kinetics equations of manganese powder with different particle sizes were obtained from unreacted shrinking core model and Arrhenius formula. It was found that the nitridation mechanism was controlled by interfacial chemical reaction. The apparent activation energy and the apparent rate constant of nitridation reaction were affected by particle sizes. With the decrease of particle size, the apparent activation energy decreased whilst the apparent rate constant increased. It was suggested that the refinement of the manganese powder contributed to the increase of molar surface energy, which accounted for the lower apparent activation energy.
