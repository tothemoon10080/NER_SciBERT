This book contains papers presented at the 23rd European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering, ESCAPE-23, held in Lappeenranta, Finland, June 9-12, 2013. The symposia on Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) have been supported by the Working Party on CAPE of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE) since 1968. The series of ESCAPE symposia assist in bringing together scientists, students and engineers from academia and industry, which are active in research and application of CAPE. ESCAPE 23 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners of computer- aided process engineering (CAPE) community interested in Modelling, Simulation and Optimisation Synthesis and Design Automation and Control Education The boundaries of CAPE have expanded and the research interests cover a wide range of interdisciplinary problems related to the current needs of society and industry. In order to address the existing and emerging research trends the technical themes of ESCAPE 23 are: Energy Systems Sustainability of Products and Processes Biomaterial Processing Mineral Processing Biomedical Engineering Management & Economics ESCAPE 23 has provided a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and evaluate emerging as well as established research methods and concepts, and to learn from industrial case studies. This book includes 176 papers selected from 390 submitted abstracts. All papers have been reviewed by 51 members of the international scientific committee. The selection process involved review of abstracts, manuscripts and final acceptance of the revised manuscripts. We are very grateful to the members of international programme committee for their comments and recommendations. We would like to thank the ELSEVIER editorial team as well as the memebers of local editorial group for their support. We hope that, as the previous Proceedings, this book will contribute to the progress in computer aided process and product engineering.
