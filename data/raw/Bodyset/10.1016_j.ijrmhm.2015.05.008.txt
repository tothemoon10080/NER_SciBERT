TiC–MgO composite was synthesized using mixtures of TiO2, Mg, and wood dust via a mechanochemical process. The influence of various Mg values (0–2.4mol) on the titanium carbide formation and the mechanism of reactions during the milling of TiO2–Mg–C mixture were investigated. Phase transformations, grain size, strain, lattice parameters, and morphology of the powders during the milling process were examined using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thermodynamic calculations revealed that the Mg value played a main role. Consequently, the overall reaction enthalpy and adiabatic temperature (Tad
                     ) changed with variation of the magnesium content. Experimentally, after 10h of milling, TiC was synthesized in the mixture powder with stoichiometric ratio (Mg=2mol). The type of reactions was mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR). In addition, at lower Mg content (Mg=1.5), the heat resulted from magnesiothermic reaction also activated the carbothermal reduction. Further decrease in the Mg value (Mg=0.5 and 1mol) resulted in formation of MgTiO3 as a major phase. Using the excess Mg value (Mg=2.2 and 2.4molMg) as a diluent agent led to formation of Mg2TiO4 besides the MgO and TiC phases.Titanium carbide (TiC) is a material of commercial interest due to its extremely high melting temperature 3100 At present, many processes are available for the synthesis of TiC powder and its composites, and each process varies in the characteristics of the powder produced and the processing cost. Titanium carbide can be conventionally prepared by a direct reaction between Ti and carbon at high temperatures ranging from 1900 to 2900 Mechanochemical activation as a type of in-situ method is a solid state powder process which involves inducing chemical reactions in a mixture of the as-received powders at room temperature. An increase in the kinetic energy of reactions during high energy milling can result in microstructural refinement, repeated cold deformation, and fracture of particles This research indicated that the mechanosynthesis of TiC in the TiO The precursor materials were magnesium (Merck, 99.7% purity, particles size 40 In order to investigate the influence of the Mg content on the mechanochemical behavior of mentioned Mg–TiO The precursor materials were milled in a planetary ball mill for various durations at room temperature, The amounts of the remaining C (free carbon) were calculated to understand the reaction progress.
