In previous research, it has been demonstrated that the hydrogenation kinetics of Mg–Ni alloys is significantly improved by elemental Na doping. To clarify the underlying mechanisms in terms of crystallographic phase changes during the reactions, in-situ hydrogen absorption and desorption as a function of temperature under constant hydrogen atmospheres of 2MPa and 0.2MPa, respectively, was studied. The experiments were performed at the Powder Diffraction beamline of the Australian Synchrotron facility with a gas flow cell and a hot air blower. This study showed that the hydrogenation of Na-doped Mg–Ni alloys can be identified at a temperature as low as 260°C via an interface-controlled nucleation and growth mechanism without any prior activation whilst the dehydrogenation occurred at about 370°C. The sequence of phase transformations associated with these reactions as well as associated expansion properties of individual phases during hydrogen sorption reactions as provided by the high resolution X-ray diffraction data are discussed.Magnesium and its alloys are promising materials for future solid state storage of hydrogen due to the advantages of high gravimetric capacity (7.6 Many efforts have been directed at improving the performance of magnesium alloys including the use of high energy ball milling to incorporate nanostructured sizes and defects into pristine materials  The alloy under investigation was prepared to the nominal composition using an industrial grade of pure magnesium (99.9%) and nickel (99.8%). The raw elements were melted in an electric resistance furnace and held at a melt temperature of about 750 For For calibration purpose, a LaB Representative synchrotron XRD patterns as a function of temperature are shown in Since the starting material was not previously activated, an energy barrier must be overcome for the nucleation and growth of the MgH As observed from The reaction rate increases proportionally with the temperature up to 360  In terms of reaction kinetics, complete desorption of hydrogen occurs in about 10 The expansion properties of associated phases (e.g. Mg, Mg In general, the effect of hydrogen pressure (e.g. 0.2 or 2 The lattice parameter expansion for Mg is in good agreement with that obtained from the literature In contrast to the case of Mg, Mg It can be further observed from the desorption curve in Furthermore, the mean linear CTE as calculated from one-third of the volumetric CTE, crystal density and relative volume change associated with the transformation of phase constituents (e.g. Mg In conclusion, The experiment was conducted at the Australian Synchrotron on the Powder Diffraction beamline under proposal no AS131/PD/5782.
