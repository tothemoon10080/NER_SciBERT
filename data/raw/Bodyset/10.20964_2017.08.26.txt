To address a series of problems in the hydrometallurgical process of lead recovery, such as high energy consumption (810-930 kWh ton-1), low efficiency and electrolyte pollution, we invented a novel, highly efficient and clean route for recovering high purity metallic lead via a leaching- electrodeposition process in a HClO4 solution. First, the desulfurated spent lead paste and lead plate- grids from spent lead–acid batteries were dissolved in the HClO4 solution to generate a HClO4–Pb(ClO4)2 solution, denoted as the leaching process. An electrolysis process was then conducted in this solution to obtain metallic lead with HClO
                        4
                      regenerated for reuse in the next batch, denoted as the electrodeposition process. For the leaching process, the concentration of HClO4, leaching temperature and leaching time were systematically investigated to achieve the highest leaching rate. For the electrodeposition process, the influences of Pb2+ concentration and HClO4 concentration, temperature, current density, and additives on the electrode position process were studied in detail and optimized. The results show that the invented route has a lead leaching rate of above 98.5%, an electrolytic energy consumption of only 500 kWh tonnePb
                     -1, and a purity for the electrodeposited lead product of up to 99.9991%.
