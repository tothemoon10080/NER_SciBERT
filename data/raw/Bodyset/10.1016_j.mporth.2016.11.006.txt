Pelvic and acetabular trauma often presents in the context of polytrauma and may cause life threatening haemodynamic instability. An understanding of anatomy, physiology and classification systems will help in the assessment of the stability of the fracture pattern and the patient. Patients should be managed according to agreed clinical guidelines within the trauma network. Early specialist input is required into decision making concerning the operative and non-operative management options.Stable    Rotationally unstable Vertically stable      Rotationally unstable Vertically unstable             Posterior and superior directed force Pelvic and acetabular fractures, and their management, have been described in ancient Egyptian and Chinese writings. In the 19th century, Malgaigne and Moore wrote seminal papers. The distribution of pelvic and acetabular fractures is bimodal: younger patients tend to sustain high energy pelvic ring disruptions and hip fracture dislocations whereas older patients more commonly suffer lower energy insufficiency fractures in osteoporotic bone. The incidence of pelvic fractures is estimated at 23 per 100 000 There is a male preponderance to pelvic and acetabular fractures. The pelvic ring consists of left and right innominate bones and the sacrum. The bony ring has two posterior joints (the left and right sacroiliac joints) and an anterior joint (the symphysis pubis). The following ligamentous structures provide stability: sacroiliac ligaments (anterior and posterior), the iliolumbar ligament posteriorly and the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments anteriorly. Disruption of the ring in one place causing displacement is necessarily associated with disruption elsewhere in the ring. The acetabulum found centrally in the innominate bone, which is itself formed from the ossification centres of the ilium, ischium and pubis. It provides a socket for the femoral head and is integral to the structure and function of the pelvic ring and hip joint. The innominate bone may be described has having an anterior and a posterior column, which act as struts to provide stability. On a lateral view, the innominate bone has the appearance of an inverted “Y” – with the longer vertical limb being the anterior column and the shorter limb the posterior column. The anterior column consists of the pubis and ilium and runs from iliac crest to iliac wing and through the superior pubic ramus. It includes the lateral superior pubic ramus. The posterior column is composed of the ischium and ilium and runs from posterior ilium (just below the sciatic notch) down the ischial body and to the inferior pubic ramus. It includes the quadrilateral plate/surface and the posterior wall and dome. The anterior and posterior acetabular walls project from their columns ( Plain radiography and CT are baseline imaging investigations for pelvic and acetabular fractures. Radiographic imaging is helpful in the rapid diagnosis of pelvic fractures and hip fracture dislocations, particularly in unstable patients. Baseline imaging for pelvic fractures includes an anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and inlet and outlet views. The recommended views for acetabular fractures are AP pelvis and Judet views. Plain radiographs should be reviewed for the following acetabular landmarks: iliopectineal line (anterior column), ilioischial line (posterior column), anterior rim, posterior rim and the teardrop. Judet views include the obturator oblique (which shows the profile of the obturator foramen with the anterior column and posterior wall) and iliac oblique (which shows the profile of the iliac wing with the posterior column and anterior wall). In the context of the polytrauma patient, a trauma CT will ordinarily be the baseline imaging of choice. The NICE guidelines (in England) for complex fracture management recommend CT as first line for all patients aged 16 and over. The Tile classification and the Young & Burgess classification system are both commonly used to describe fractures of the pelvic ring. Both systems show reliable intra and inter observer correlation. Tile and Pennal subdivided pelvic fractures in 1980 based upon the implied direction of causative force and proposed management strategies based on this classification system. The Young & Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures has been proposed more recently The Judet and Letournel In elderly patients, anterior column fractures are most common. Pelvic and acetabular fractures often occur in the context of polytrauma, with pelvic ring fractures present in 10–20% of patients who sustain high-energy blunt force trauma. Trauma patients should be initially assessed and managed according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles before appropriate imaging is arranged. It is important to establish early on, using a thorough patient assessment and an appropriate fracture classification system, which patients and fractures are stable and which are unstable. Acute blood loss is the major cause of death within the first 24 hours following pelvic trauma. Later mortality is usually secondary to multisystem organ failure.      The first line invasive treatment for active arterial bleeding is transarterial embolization, if a laparotomy is not needed for abdominal injuries. Embolization is, however, not available in all centres and there may be a delay to accessing specialized services when compared to pelvic packing. A study of 29 patients comparing embolization with pelvic packing found that pelvic packing has shorter time to intervention and shorter intervention time.  Pelvic and acetabular fractures are associated not only with haemorrhage but also with solid organ injuries. One series of 1545 trauma patients with pelvic fractures identified that 16.5% also had abdominal injuries, liver injuries in 6.1% and bladder and urethral injuries in 5.8%. In patients with severe pelvic fractures the rate of associated injury was higher, at 30.7%. Native hip dislocations occur most commonly in young patients, usually as a result of high energy trauma. External rotation of the hip predisposes to anterior dislocation. Internal rotation of the hip and axial forces applied to a flexed knee predispose to posterior dislocation of the hip with associated fractures of the posterior wall of the acetabulum and impaction of the femoral head. The incidence of sciatic nerve injury with posterior hip dislocations and fracture dislocations is approximately 10% in adults and 5% in children. Patients who are systemically unwell and not fit for surgery and patients with stable fracture patterns may be managed non-operatively with protected weight bearing. In stable fracture patterns (APC I, LC I pelvic fractures; stable acetabular fracture patterns with good joint congruence) this may include follow-up with repeat imaging at six weeks as well as 6–12 weeks of non-weight bearing or partial weight bearing. In some patients, stability is uncertain and repeat imaging at one or two weeks is advisable. Patients who are fit for surgery and have unstable fracture patterns warrant operative treatment. The surgical approach and fixation technique used will depend on patient factors (age, bone quality, physiological status), surgeon factors (expertise available, preferred surgeon techniques) and the fracture pattern. Surgical strategies, patient positioning and approaches are now discussed in turn.  Lateral compression fractures are surgically managed with fixation of the anterior and posterior elements of the pelvic ring. The anterior pelvic ring may be stabilized using a plate, screws, an external fixator or an internal fixator (INFIX). Vertical shear fractures are usually managed with surgical fixation of the anterior and posterior pelvic ring.  An anterior approach (ilioinguinal or Stoppa) is used for fixation of anterior wall and anterior column fractures. A posterior (Kocher Langenbeck – KL) approach is used for posterior wall and column fractures. The approach in certain fracture patterns (transverse fractures, T type fractures) will depend on the area of most displacement and some fracture patterns will require a dual approach. Fracture fragments should be reduced and held with plates and/or screws. Plates may be contoured for appropriate placement or be undercontoured to aid reduction and the buttressing of fractures. The elderly acetabular fracture cohort is a particularly difficult one to manage in general due to their poor physiological reserve and poor bone stock. A systematic review of this cohort found a mean complication rate close to 40% and a mean mortality rate of almost 20% at a mean of 64 months. The rate of conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA) following fixation was 23%.   The ilioinguinal approach The Stoppa approach has gained favour in recent years, in part because it does not involve dissection of the neurovascular bundles in the way that the ilioinguinal approach requires. The KL approach is a posterior approach and allows access to the posterior column, posterior wall and dome of the acetabulum. Pelvic and acetabular fractures are at particular risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. NICE guidelines recommend offering VTE prophylaxis (mechanical and pharmacological) to all major trauma patients; the risk of VTE and bleeding should be regularly re-assessed. The overall mortality of pelvic fractures has been reported as 13.5%. The management of pelvic and acetabular trauma can be complex and requires early specialist input. All patients should be managed using ATLS principles and appropriate imaging should be obtained at an early stage. Haemodynamic instability in the context of pelvic and acetabular fractures can be life threatening and must be managed within the multidisciplinary team using evidence based approaches. Appropriate timely transfers and specialist care should be sought within the major trauma networks.
