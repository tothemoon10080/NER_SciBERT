Nickel-alumina composite coatings were synthesized by electrodeposition technique. The co-deposition of alumina was accomplished by using magnetic stirring, variation of current density and temperature. The xrd analysis confirmed the formation of Ni-Al2O3 composites and the SEM studies revealed uniform dispersion of alumina into nickel matrix. The morphology of the alumina particles found significantly affected by the current density and temperature. The incorporation of alumina showed increased hardness and wear resistance of the coatings.
