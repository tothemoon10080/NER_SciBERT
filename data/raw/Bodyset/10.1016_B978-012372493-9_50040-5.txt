Sedimentation processes are very effective in removing suspended solids in industrial wastewater. Clarifiers, either rectangular or circular, are most commonly used in the application of sedimentation in wastewater treatment facilities. Although sedimentation is a method of treatment used in almost all domestic sewage treatment plants, it should be considered for industrial waste treatment only when the industrial waste is combined with domestic sewage or contains a high percentage of “settleable” suspended solids. The efficiency of sedimentation tanks depends on the following factors: detention period, wastewater characteristics, tank depth, floor surface area and overflow rate, operation, temperature, particle size, and inlet and outlet design. Another consideration in the design of sedimentation processes is the characteristics of the suspended solids. Small and difficult-to-settle particles in suspension can be flocculated and buoyed to the liquid surface by the lifting power of the many minute air bubbles that attach themselves to the suspended particles. Floated agglomerated sludge can be readily and continuously removed from the surface of the liquid by skimming. Screening of industrial wastes is generally practiced on wastes containing larger suspended solids of variable sizes such as from canneries, pulp and paper mills, or poultry processing plants. It is an economical and effective means of rapid separation of these larger suspended solids from the remaining waste material.
