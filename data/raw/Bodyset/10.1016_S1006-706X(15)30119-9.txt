The influence of H2O(g) content in circulating flue gas on sintering was studied by simulating the flue gas circulating sintering. The results show that the burning speed of solid fuel and the heat transfer rate during sintering process are improved when the H2O (g) content increases from 0 to 6%, which accelerates the sintering speed. However, when the H2O (g) content exceeds 6%, the over-wet zone in sinter bed is thickened, which deteriorates the permeability of sintering bed. In addition, the magnetite content in sinter increases, while the acicular calcium ferrite content decreases. Accordingly, the sinter yield and tumble index decrease with excessive H2O (g) content. To guarantee the yield and quality of sinter, the favourable H2O (g) content in circulating flue gas should be controlled to be less than 6%.
