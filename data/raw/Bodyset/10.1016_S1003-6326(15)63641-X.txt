Electronic structures of complex mineral jamesonite were studied using density functional theory method together with their flotation behavior. The flotation behavior of jamesonite is similar to that of stibnite, indicating good floatability at pH below 6 and easy depression with NaOH, especially with lime. In weak alkaline condition, the flotation behavior of jamesonite is close to that of galena. The coordination structure of Pb for jamesonite is more complex than that for galena. Sb in jamesonite possesses two coordinated modes, whereas Sb of stibnite is only 3-coordinated. Pb in galena is more active than that in jamesonite. Sb (3-coordination) in jamesonite is inactive, in contrast with that in stibnite. However, 4-coordination Sb in jamesonite is more active than 3-coordination Sb. HOMO orbitals of jamesonite and stibnite contain metal atoms, which contribute to the formation of adsorption configuration of CaOH+ when there is lime; therefore, jamesonite and stibnite are easily depressed by lime.
