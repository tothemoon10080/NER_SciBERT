Aluminium based metal matrix composites reinforced with in situ Ti-aluminide and alumina particles were prepared by reactive hot pressing a powder mix of aluminium and nanosized TiO2 powders. The reinforcements were formed in situ by exothermal reaction between the TiO2 nano crystalline powder and aluminium. The thermal characteristics of the in situ reaction were studied with the aid of Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were employed to study the microstructural architecture of the composites as a function of hot pressing temperature and volume percent reinforcement. Microhardness measurements on the as prepared in situ aluminium matrix composites exhibit significant increase in hardness with increase in hot pressing temperature and volume fraction of reinforcement.Recently metal matrix composites (MMCs) are increasingly used for critical structural and wear resistant applications because of their excellent strength to weight ratio During the last few years, new in situ processes for fabrication of MMCs have emerged with the aim of overcoming the limitation of the ex situ fabrication processes. Both liquid phase and solid phase routes are being used to produce in situ particle reinforced MMCs In the above perspective, it is to be noted that powders containing nanodimensional crystallites possess better chemical reactivity as compared to their coarser counterparts The present investigation aims at developing a mechanically stiffer and stronger in situ aluminium matrix composite containing finely dispersed Ti-aluminide and Al Nanosized TiO Aluminium powder of 99% purity with an average particle size ∼20 The powder mix, so prepared, was subsequently compacted in cylindrical (10 The thermal characteristics of the in situ reaction in the green compacts, expected to yield 100 vol% (Al XRD studies on the TiO Here, it is imperative to briefly mention about the principle of SLPA technique. The X-ray diffraction pattern of nanocrystalline materials exhibits considerable peak broadening with reduced intensity due to the combined instrumental effects and structural factors like reduced crystallite size and strain at the atomic scale, caused by the lattice distortion. Therefore, the measured line profile ‘ The contribution of The contribution of the size and strain profiles in the structurally broadened profile The subscripts C and G represent the Cauchy and Gaussian component of the respective Voigt profiles. The integral breadth ( The constituent Cauchy and Gaussian components were obtained from the ratio ‘ A Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL, JSM-840A) along with the energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) was used to study the microstructural architecture and composition of the different phases of the composite samples. Average values of hardness on different phases of the composite samples were measured with the help of a standard Vickers hardness tester (Type 3212, Zwick, Ulm Germany) using a load of 25 The XRD pattern of the as received TiO   The XRD result also reveals that AlTi Representative SEM micrographs of the in situ composite with 10 vol% and 30 vol% reinforcement content prepared by hot pressing at 700 Variations in the Vickers hardness values recorded on the bright and dark shaded microstructural areas as a function of pressing temperature and reinforcement content is shown in The present work demonstrates that Al-based composites reinforced with in situ Ti-aluminide and alumina can be prepared by the in situ reaction between molten Al and nanosized TiO Aluminium matrix composites reinforced with well-dispersed alumina and Ti-aluminide crystallites of size less than 1 The fine reinforcements in the host matrix are formed by the in situ exothermal reaction between aluminium and nanosized TiO The initiation temperature of the in situ reaction decreases significantly with the use of nanosized TiO Evolution of the reinforcements (Ti-aluminide
