The effect of steam dilution on the formation of coke and minor products in 2-methylpenatne cracking on ultra stable HY at 673 K has been studied. The results show that steam dilution suppresses the formation of coke and minor aromatic products, but enhances the H/C atomic ratio of coke and the production of di-olefins. This and other evidences suggest that steam dilution enhances the desorption of coke precursors, diolefinic ions and cyclic ions, by inhibiting the further pathological reactions to produce aromatics and polyaromatics. These insights into the chemistry underlying coke formation in hydrocarbon cracking on solid acid catalysts can potentially be applied to the development of additives which inhibit coke formation and control catalyst deactivation.
