This chapter discusses the final step in pyrometallurgical processing, which is casting of thin flat anodes for electrorefining. The anodes must be strong and smooth-surfaced for efficient electrorefining; bubbles or blisters of sulfur dioxide need to be avoided. Blister formation is prevented by removing sulfur and oxygen from the smelter's molten copper by air oxidation, followed by hydrocarbon reduction. The final product of fire refining is molten copper, which is ready for casting as anodes. Most copper anodes are cast in open molds on a large rotating wheel. The cast anodes are often straightened and flattened in automated anode preparation machines. Continuous casting of anodes in Hazelett twin belt casting machines is adopted by six smelters or refineries. The machine makes anodes of uniform size, shape, and surface quality. Fire refining is carried out in rotary refining furnaces, which resemble Peirce-Smith converters in hearth furnaces. Two chemical systems are involved in fire refining: sulfur removal and oxygen removal. The universal choice for removing sulfur from copper is air. Many different hydrocarbons are used for oxygen removal, but natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, and oil are favored.
