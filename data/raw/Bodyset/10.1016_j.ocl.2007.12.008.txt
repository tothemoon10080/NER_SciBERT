Radial head fractures are the most common type of elbow fractures. Although a consensus has emerged that favors the nonsurgical treatment of undisplaced fractures, controversy surrounds the treatment of displaced radial head fractures. Further research is necessary to provide a better scientific rationale for making treatment recommendations. Options for the treatment of displaced fractures include nonoperative management, fragment excision, whole head excision, open reduction and internal fixation, and radial head arthroplasty. The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms that result in radial head fracture, to describe important physical findings that assist in identifying injuries associated with radial head fractures, and to define the role of the various interventions described for the treatment of radial head fractures.
