Tribological behaviour of an Al–5-wt% Cu alloy, Al–10-wt% Cu alloy (hypoeutectic alloy), and an innovative composite combination of an Al–5-wt% Cu alloy as the matrix and a 5-wt% Cu powder as the reinforcement have been investigated. The metal matrix composite was prepared and fabricated by using a stir-casting process by dispersing the Cu powder (average particle size of 105 µm) in the molten base Al–5-wt% Cu alloy. The wear and frictional properties of the metal matrix composites was studied by performing dry sliding wear test using a pin-on-disc wear tester. Experiments were conducted based on the plan of experiments generated through Taguchi’s technique. A L9 Orthogonal array was selected for analysis of the data.The regression equation for each response were developed for both the alloys and composite using MiniTab-17. SEM and EDAX analysis of the wear samples were also studied for morphology changes.
