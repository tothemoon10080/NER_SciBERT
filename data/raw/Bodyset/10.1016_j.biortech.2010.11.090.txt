The sulfur oxidation activities of four pure thermophilic archaea Acidianus brierleyi (JCM 8954), Metallosphaera sedula (YN 23), Acidianus manzaensis (YN 25) and Sulfolobus metallicus (YN 24) and their mixture in bioleaching chalcopyrite were compared. Meanwhile, the relevant surface sulfur speciation of chalcopyrite leached with the mixed thermophilic archaea was investigated. The results showed that the mixed culture, with contributing significantly to the raising of leaching rate and accelerating the formation of leaching products, may have a higher sulfur oxidation activity than the pure cultures, and jarosite was the main passivation component hindering the dissolution of chalcopyrite, while elemental sulfur seemed to have no influence on the dissolution of chalcopyrite. In addition, the present results supported the former speculation, i.e., covellite might be converted from chalcocite during the leaching experiments, and the elemental sulfur may partially be the derivation of covellite and chalcocite.In contemporary era, the research and development of bioleaching have been always focused on achieving effective recovery of valuable metals by improving the efficiency of bioleaching microorganisms ( Currently, the mesophilic microorganisms are widely used in the hydrometallurgical field such as secondary metal sulfides leaching and gold ores pretreatment ( In an industrial scale, both in heaps and in tank reactors, the effective dissolution of metal sulfide is actually conducted by the cooperation of different microoganisms ( The advantages of extreme thermophiles have already intrigued great interest of researchers, with a series of literatures issued on the bioleaching kinetic and leaching mechanisms ( In bioleaching process, the sulfur in sulfide is stepwise oxidized to sulfuric acid, companied with complex sulfur species such as elemental sulfur, jarosite, etc. ( Consequently, in this study we attempt to compare the sulfur-oxidizing activities of pure and mixed thermophiles consisting of The four pure thermophilic archaea used in the present work were Basic media used in this study contains 3.0 The mineral samples used in these experiments were provided by School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, China. The main contents of mineral were (mass fraction): Cu 34.63%, Fe 25.35% and S 30.45%. The mineralogical compositions tests (XRD) indicated that chalcopyrite (CuFeS Before the leaching experiments, the strains used in the present study were initially activated in 500 The strains used in all leaching tests were previously cultivated to their exponential growth phase, and then harvested by filtration (0.45 All experiments were performed in triplicate at the same conditions. Evaporated water was compensated by additional distilled water based on weight loss. During leaching experiments, sample solutions were taken out at the same intervals to detect the cell concentration, sulfate ions, copper and iron ions, and pH and Eh values. The cell concentration was determined by direct counting with a Neubauer chamber counter. The pH and Eh values in the leaching solutions were measured with a pH-meter (SJ-4A) and a platinum electrode with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, respectively. Sulfate ions were quantified by a barium sulfate turbidimetric colorimetric method ( In order to investigate leaching products and the sulfur speciation on mineral surface, both the original mineral samples and leaching residues at different time during bioleaching process were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometry and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). All of the standard compounds for XRD, Raman spectrometry and XANES and the data calculated were obtained as described by Sulfur oxidation activities of the pure and mixed thermophilic archaea were characterized in terms of the cell concentration, pH and sulfate concentration during bioleaching, and the results are presented in As shown in In  The comparisons of the copper and total iron ions concentrations leached by the pure and mixed thermophilic archaea are shown in Bioleaching process is now considered as a mainly chemical process in which ferric irons and protons are responsible for the leaching reactions and copper, ferrous ions and elemental sulfur generation (Eqs. In the present study, the leaching rate of chalcopyrite and the recoveries of copper and iron varied in different tests, which related to the sulfur oxidation activities of thermophiles. At the first stage, the recoveries of copper and iron increased due to the acid consumption (Eqs. The XRD patterns of the original chalcopyrite and leaching residues in bioleaching with the mixed culture at day 10 are shown in As can be seen from Besides elemental sulfur detected on day 10, it is noteworthy that about 1% chalcocite and 14% covellite were detected in the leaching residues on day 6 ( At low Eh, the redox potential in mixed culture peaked at 434 The formed chalcocite is readily to convert into covellite by direct biological attack (Eq. Meanwhile, chalcocite and covellite could also be oxidized by ferric sulfate, with the results of forming sulfur, which is conducted by indirect biological oxidation ( Comparisons between four pure and mixed thermophiles in bioleaching chalcopyrite showed that the mixed culture, with contributing to the leaching rate and accelerating the formation of leaching products, may have a higher sulfur oxidation activity. According to the leaching character, it could be inferred the precipitation of jarosite hampered the leaching process, while elemental sulfur seemed to have no significant influence on it. In addition, the coexistence of covellite and chalcocite supports the former speculation that covellite might convert from chalcocite during the leaching experiments, as well as elemental sulfur may be partially the derivation of covellite and chalcocite.
