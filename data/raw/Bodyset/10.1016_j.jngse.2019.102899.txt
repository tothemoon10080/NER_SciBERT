Thermal stimulation is a key method of altering coal permeability in heat-injection-enhanced gas recovery from unconventional reservoirs. However, a criterion or index to quantitatively evaluate the stimulation efficiency to dual coal permeability is still lacking. Herein we proposed a criterion based on thermal stimulation index

The criterion and index are subsequently applied to analyze two sets of seepage experiments of N2 and CO2, and a heat-injection-enhanced gas recovery simulation.

                      to different components of coal-gas interactions is studied. The results reveal that (1) the proposed thermal stimulation criterion and index can reasonably evaluate the efficiency of thermal stimulation to dual coal permeability, (2) an increase (decrease) in thermal sorption and volatilization (expansion) improves the positive thermal stimulation, and (3) thermal fracturing improves stimulation efficiency by adjusting the consistency between fracture and matrix permeability.Temperature change leads to a variety of process that thermally stimulate coal seam gas reservoirs. These processes have a significant effect on coal characteristics and gas recovery ( Observation from design experiments in the laboratory is the most common and direct method to explore the effects of thermal stimulation on coal permeability. According to the seepage experiments of To elucidate the observed thermal stimulation processes that effect coal permeability in theory, a variety of clues and explanations for a series of coal-gas linkages and coal permeability models are proposed. Evidence that temperature change has a remarkable influence on the sorption of coal to gas has been widely reported ( Heat injection to enhance coal seam gas recovery from low-seepage reservoirs is one of the typical uses of thermal stimulation in gas production because of the improvement in gas desorption and the optimization of coal permeability. However, the stimulation efficiencies of different injection methods for coal seam gas recovery differ significantly. Herein we proposed a thermal stimulation criterion for the evaluation of the thermal stimulation efficiency for coal permeability based on a thermal stimulation index. This index is derived from our previous dual coal permeability model, which has integrated a series of coal-gas interactions. The thermal stimulation criterion and index are then validated by two sets of permeability data and our previous numerical simulation. Finally, contributions of each component to the stimulation index are investigated through a sensitivity analysis. The significance of the thermal stimulation criterion and index for heat-injection-enhanced gas recovery is explored in the evaluation guidance. Before any further derivation, the dual permeability model for coal seam gas transport under variable temperature is introduced from our previous work ( for coal matrix for fracture network Furthermore, the series of volumetric strains have the following expressions as: The complex evolution of the matrix and fracture permeability of coal depends on the effective stress-induced coal deformation, thermal expansion, thermal fracturing, thermal sorption, and thermal volatilization. To be more specific, thermal expansion stimulates coal deformation such that the coal matrix swells while the fracture aperture decreases. Meanwhile, thermal sorption shrinks the coal matrix and increases the fracture aperture, while thermal fracturing swells the coal matrix and decreases the fracture aperture because of the initiation of new micro-pores and the growth of the original pore. Lastly, thermal volatilization stimulates coal deformation by increasing the fracture aperture owing to the thinning of water film on fracture surfaces. The above factors impact the evolution of coal permeability in a complex manner, occurring at different temperature levels and varying with coals. The permeability evolution may decrease, increase, or decrease initially and then increase with temperature. To quantitatively discuss the effect of thermal stimulation on coal permeability and gas recovery, it is necessary to find an indicator for the quantitative evaluation of thermal stimulation efficiency. This is done in the following section. The derivatives of coal matrix permeability The physical meanings of For coal matrix permeability For fracture network permeability After substituting Eqs. Similarly, for the fracture network, when Thus, The observed permeability of coal sample from laboratory seepage experiments is the apparent total permeability with contributions from the fracture network and the matrix. Because the matrix permeability is usually two to three orders of magnitude lower than the fracture permeability, the laboratory-observed permeability is mainly derived from the fracture network as ( The coal seepage experiments were conducted with pure N The N A seepage experiment of CO The relationships among model prediction, thermal stimulation index, and temperature change are explored. In our recent work (  The above experimental and numerical analysis concludes that the coal and gas properties significantly affect the thermal stimulation efficiency and critical temperature. However, the contribution from each component of coal-gas interaction has not been clarified. Thus, it is necessary to carry out a sensitivity analysis to help understand the contribution and provide useful guidance to heat-injection-enhanced coal seam gas recovery. In this section, a series of sensitivity analyses for each property was conducted to reveal their impacts on the thermal stimulation. In particular, the evolution of dual permeability and thermal stimulation index with temperature was investigated. The effects of thermal expansion on coal permeability are investigated through the variable thermal expansion coefficient The effects of thermal sorption on dual coal permeability are investigated through the variable temperature correction coefficient The effects of thermal fracturing on dual permeability, characterized by thermal fracturing coefficient The effects of thermal volatilization on dual permeability, expressed by the thermal volatilization coefficient In this work, a thermal stimulation criterion based on the thermal stimulation index was proposed for the evaluation of the thermal stimulation efficiency to dual permeability of gas reservoirs. The index integrates a series of interactive effects, including thermal expansion, sorption, fracturing, and volatilization. Based on the proposed thermal stimulation criterion and index, the efficiency of thermal stimulation to coal permeability and gas recovery were well evaluated through coal permeability experiments of N The thermal stimulation criterion and index The increase in thermal expansion constrains the thermal stimulation efficiency for the enhancement of dual coal permeability. Gas reservoirs with smaller thermal expansion coefficients are more easily stimulated by temperature change. The increase in the thermal sorption improves the positive thermal stimulation efficiency, increasing the dual permeability of coal. However, the change in the temperature correction coefficient causes only a minor improvement in the thermal stimulation efficiency of matrix permeability. Thermal fracturing coordinates the matrix permeability and fracture permeability to enhance the apparent coal permeability. Increase in the fracturing coefficient greatly improves the positive thermal stimulation. The increase of thermal volatilization improves the thermal stimulation efficiency through the direct modification of the fracture network. In theory, the proposed thermal stimulation criterion and index can be used to evaluate the feasibility of heat-injection enhanced gas recovery instructively. However, heat-injection enhanced gas recovery not only triggers thermal stimulation, which complicates the engineering schemes but also gambles with the economy, as the engineering cost differs significantly with different heating means. Therefore, covering the practical engineering cost will demand a higher The authors are grateful to the financial support from the
