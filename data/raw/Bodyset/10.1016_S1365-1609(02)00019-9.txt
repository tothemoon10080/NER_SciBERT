The mechanical response of multi-jointed roof beams is investigated numerically with the aid of a two dimensional distinct element computer code. Beams of various spans to thickness ratio, that comprise a wide range of practical concern, are simulated numerically and the effect of joint frequency and compliance on their structural behaviour is determined. Numerical results are presented in graphs and useful conclusions for the critical beam parameters are derived. Comparisons of numerical results with analytical solutions define the ranges, where these solutions may be used and the cases where divergence is observed. Finally the graphs presented here may be used for preliminary practical design of pertinent multi-jointed beams.The behaviour of an underground roof composed of stratified, jointed and competent rock has been studied since 1885 Starting with Evans For a horizontal, elastic and solid laminated rock beam in the roof of an underground excavation, the distribution of compression and tension is found, according to beam theory, to be symmetrical about the horizontal centreline across all sections within it. If the beam is fixed at both ends, the maximum stress at the midspan is one half of that at the abutments. For such a uniformly loaded beam, vertical tensile fractures form in its upper part at the abutments, when the maximum tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the rock. Such a beam is, usually as an approximation, considered as simply supported. For a simply supported beam, the maximum tensile stress at midspan is larger than the maximum tensile stress at the abutments of the previous beam with fixed ends, which yielded. This leads to subsequent fracturing centred about the midspan. The latter beam is termed as a voussoir beam. Thus, transition from a continuous elastic beam with fixed ends to a voussoir beam may be assured. In For a voussoir beam (and where appropriate for any beam) the following non-dimensional parameters are defined: For small deflections of the beam, the deflection and the extreme strain have been evaluated for the three stiff joint symmetric voussoir rock beam of In the above formulae there still remain two parameters of indeterminacy, i.e. In columns 1â€“3 of In column 4 the beam considered is the voussoir beam shown in The above analytical solution for the three stiff joint voussoir beam has been derived However, the mechanical behaviour of a roof beam regularly crossed with deformable infilled joints differs from the idealized model described, as initial investigation for a limited number of computer model runs shows The response of the examined voussoir beam models is computed by UDEC Beams of four different spans, i.e. The left half of such a symmetric voussoir beam model and its descretization is shown in In the right hand discontinuity, which represents the middle section of the beam, both vertical slip and lateral separation are permitted. This is achieved by imposing zero friction angle The elastic properties of the discontinuities are varied from very stiff to relatively soft, i.e. The deformable beam is considered to behave elastically, with a Young's modulus The basic UDEC model described is suitably adjusted to include any vertical joints that cross the beam. All patterns include joints at midspan and the abutments (basic model); joints are progressively added in between, as shown in The geometry and mechanical properties of the 216 numerical models prepared for the analysis with the UDEC code may be seen in Analytic solution The actual stress distributions at these critical sections of the beam, i.e. abutment and midspan, is shown in In By assuming triangular stress distributions at the abutment and at midspan, that provides the same thrust in magnitude and position as the actual values, equivalent normalized contact lengths Furthermore, the equivalent extreme axial strains corresponding to the computed thrust and the triangular stress distribution assumption along the pertinent equivalent contact length are defined by In In An important observation from An increasing trend of In The functions of the equivalent normalized contact length In An increasing trend of The effect of joint frequency becomes significant only for the low stiffness value models, where deflection is increasing with joint frequency. Also, an increase of The deflection for the voussoir beams with three stiff joints is evaluated analytically by Statistical interpretation of beam deflection values for all model cases shows that normalized deflection This correlation may be seen in The abutment extreme axial strain In In The mean extreme strain The equivalent extreme strain for the voussoir beam with three stiff joints is evaluated analytically, by         As it may be seen from The three stiff joint symmetric beam model allows for the analytical evaluation of its mechanical response. However, increase in the frequency and compliance of the joints crossing an underground roof beam, modify its response. Examination of the structural response of multi-jointed roof beams with various span to thickness ratios, that comprise a wide range of practical concern, is performed with the distinct element code UDEC. The voussoir beams analyzed are loaded with their self weight. The modulus of deformation of the intact rock is taken to vary as 10, 30 and 100 The examined beam response includes the contact length, the deflection of the beam and the extreme strain developed at the abutment and midspan. These are presented in graphs where they are drawn as functions of the joint frequency and stiffness. The voussoir beam models, tested for relatively small deflections, indicate an increase in the deflection and a decrease in the extreme strain especially at the abutment, with the increase in the joint frequency and compliance. The contact length at the abutment increases due to the increase in the joint compliance and frequency, whereas at midspan this parameter is of minor importance. This increase in the contact length causes a reduction in the level arm. The increase in the deflection and contact length due to the joint compliance starts to be significant for low stiffness values. The graphs presented in here may be used for preliminary design purposes of multiple jointed roof beams, provided that the assumptions made are pertinent to the structure. For this purpose a series of evaluations with linear interpolation and extrapolation for the contact length is being made and sequential calculations for the various beam parameters are performed. An example is presented on how to use the aforementioned graphs for a beam case. This example shows a close fit with the actual values obtained from numerical modelling of the specific beam with the UDEC code.
