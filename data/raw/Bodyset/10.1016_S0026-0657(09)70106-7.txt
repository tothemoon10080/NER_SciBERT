 Don received his license earlier this year. He is a third generation PE: his late grandfather was a PE in Chemical Engineering and used his license in developing freeze drying technology for Nestl√©, his late father was a PE in Civil Engineering and designed and built sewage treatment plants for the iron and steel processing industry. Now he is a PE in Metallurgical Engineering, Don plans to continue his family legacy and use his PE license to expand the use of powder-processed materials in the medical, military, and automotive markets. His current areas of interest are in micro-miniature device fabrication utilising tooling fabricated by micro EDM and lithography techniques, titanium PM processing, utilisation/understanding of polymers for net shape fabrication, and alloy development for predictable fracture behaviour and process-independent strengthening.
