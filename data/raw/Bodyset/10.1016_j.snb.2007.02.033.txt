Rare earth ion doped insulators have attracted a great deal of interest due to their wide variety of applications, including phosphors. YVO4:Eu, Bi phosphor has a broad excitation band consisting of two peaks—one centered at from 260 to 320nm and the other at a weak band at wavelength of 386–406nm. Also, the emission spectrum exhibited a weak band for 5D0

                     7F1 at 595nm and strong sharp peaks at about 616 and 620nm due to the 5D0

                     7F2 transition of Eu3+. With increasing Bi3+ concentration, the band edge shifts to longer wavelengths, the band edge in the excitation spectrum moves from ∼254 to ∼328nm as the Bi3+ concentration is increased from 0 to 2mol%. Moreover, with increasing Eu3+ concentration, the intensity of the excitation spectra and the red emission increased continuously up to the Eu3+ concentration of 3mol%.Phosphors are high-purity inorganic materials that emit light when exposed to various excitation sources such as photons, electrons, or an electric field. These luminescent materials are widely used in such applications as fluorescent lamps, cathode-ray tubes. X-ray detectors, field emission displays, and plasma displays In this paper, we investigated the effect of the Eu For the synthesis of YVO The formation of YVO  Datta   With increasing Eu In this work, highly efficient YVO
