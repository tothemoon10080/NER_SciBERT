Demand side management has received increasing attention in the field of control with implementations using model predictive control. An implementation of demand side management through power load shifting using model predictive control on a run-of-mine ore milling circuit is presented in this paper. This is the first application of load shifting techniques for a run-of-mine ore milling circuit. Simulation results presented show that load shifting of a milling circuit can reduce operating costs associated with electricity consumption by up to 12%. The effect load shifting has on conventional milling circuit objectives is also presented.
