The conserved tridisulfide array of the α-defensin family imposes a common triple-stranded β-sheet topology on peptides that may have highly diverse primary structures, resulting in differential outcomes after targeted mutagenesis. In mouse cryptdin-4 (Crp4) and rhesus myeloid α-defensin-4 (RMAD4), complete substitutions of Arg with Lys affect bactericidal peptide activity very differently. Lys-for-Arg mutagenesis attenuates Crp4, but RMAD4 activity remains mostly unchanged. Here, we show that the differential biological effect of Lys-for-Arg replacements can be understood by the distinct phase behavior of the experimental peptide-lipid system. In Crp4, small-angle x-ray scattering analyses showed that Arg-to-Lys replacements shifted the induced nanoporous phases to a different range of lipid compositions compared with the Arg-rich native peptide, consistent with the attenuation of bactericidal activity by Lys-for-Arg mutations. In contrast, such phases generated by RMAD4 were largely unchanged. The concordance between small-angle x-ray scattering measurements and biological activity provides evidence that specific types of α-defensin-induced membrane curvature-generating tendencies correspond directly to bactericidal activity via membrane destabilization.Mammalian α-defensins are mediators of the host innate immune response. Their common characteristics include an ∼4.5-kDa size, a triple-stranded β-sheet secondary structure conferred by three invariant disulfide bonds, a cationic net charge, and an amphipathic character ( α-Defensin sequences destabilize bacterial cell membranes preferentially as a function of the phospholipid composition of microbial cell membranes ( cryptdin-4 rhesus myeloid α-defensin-4 small-angle x-ray scattering 1,2-dioleoyl- 1,2-dioleoyl- 1,2-dioleoyl- bicontinuous cubic inverted hexagonal lamellar. To approach this biological question, we used synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to characterize the structures and phase behavior of peptide-lipid complexes produced by wild-type and Lys-for-Arg variants of Crp4 and RMAD4 in model bacterial and eukaryotic membranes. By modifying the biophysical properties of the membranes by changing lipid composition, the curvature deformations produced by each of the four α-defensins could be probed as a function of membrane properties and as to whether cationicity is contributed by Arg or Lys side chains. In particular, we assayed for the existence of cubic phases, which require negative Gaussian (or “saddle-splay”) curvature, the curvature necessary for pore formation and other membrane destabilization mechanisms. In agreement with their Peptides were prepared as described ( Lysine-substituted variants were refolded after reduction with dithiothreitol at a molar ratio 18:1 to peptide ( The procedure was similar to that described previously ( Lipid solutions were thoroughly mixed with α-defensins at specific peptide/lipid ratios and sealed in quartz capillaries (Mark tubes, code no. 4017515, Hilgenberg GmbH). All samples were prepared in 100 m The procedure was identical to that described previously ( The solution structure of Crp4 is from Protein Data Bank code In a prior study ( Small unilamellar vesicles composed of negatively charged DOPS and zwitterionic DOPE and DOPC lipids were incubated with α-defensins. Because the intrinsic curvature of both DOPS and DOPC is approximately zero, whereas DOPE has an intrinsic curvature of <0, ternary mixtures of these lipid types allow the membrane anionic surface charge density and monolayer intrinsic curvature to be independently varied. α-Defensins are thought to target cell membranes with specific phospholipid distributions, such as elevated levels of both anionic and negative intrinsic curvature phospholipids, which model bacterial membranes compared with those of host cells ( The analogous scattering spectra for (R/K)-Crp4 showed that, in 20:80 DOPS/DOPE membranes, (R/K)-Crp4 induced a pure H When the phase diagrams ( In contrast to the behavior of Crp4 and (R/K)-Crp4, the spectra for RMAD4 closely resembled those of (R/K)-RMAD4 (  All α-defensins examined in this study induced non-lamellar Q The shift of non-lamellar phase generation by (R/K)-Crp4 to membranes with reduced negative intrinsic curvature lipid content is due to the differing membrane curvature-generating tendencies of Arg and Lys. Electrostatic interactions favor a state where the anionic membrane wraps around the peptide to maximize contact and thereby maximize counterion release ( We propose that differences between the reliance of Crp4 on arginine to generate negative Gaussian curvature and the insensitivity of RMAD4 to Arg-to-Lys substitutions can be attributed to differences in the distribution of peptide surface cationic residues when interacting with membranes ( In summary, the changes in phase behavior of the peptide-lipid system resulting from Lys-for-Arg substitutions in Crp4 and RMAD4 correspond directly and with remarkable consistency to their We thank the Aspen Center for Physics for promoting this multidisciplinary collaboration.
