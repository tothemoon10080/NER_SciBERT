Before the application of mass spectrometry–based proteomics to egg white, a mere 15 chicken egg white proteins were identified and characterized by at least partial amino acid sequences. After the publication of the chicken genome sequence and derived protein sequence databases in 2004, various proteomic surveys increased this number to 167 proteins that were identified by at least two sequence-unique peptides. Since then many comparative proteomic papers have been published describing changes in the egg white proteome upon storage at different temperatures over different time spans, changes associated with early embryonic development, differences between egg varieties, and proteome modifications induced by stress. Egg white proteins do not occur exclusively in egg white. Proteomic analysis detected major egg white proteins, such as ovalbumin and ovotransferrin, in all other compartments of the egg, including the shell. An interesting application of egg white proteomics is the analysis of food for the presence of potentially harmful egg white allergens.The avian egg contains all nutrients necessary for the development of the avian embryo ( Egg white is an easily available, relatively simple mixture of proteins that has been used frequently to test methods for the separation and characterization of proteins. Early efforts to separate egg white proteins by salt precipitation and related methods, and to characterize the separated proteins by their composition, their ability to crystallize, and/or their response to antisera were summarized by Meaningful high-throughput mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis still depends on the availability of comprehensive and well-curated sequence databases. Thus, the proteomic analysis of egg proteins started only after publication of the chicken genome sequence The first chicken egg white proteomic analyses ( The egg white proteome analysis published next ( A frequent problem in the analysis of proteomes dominated by one or a few major proteins is the limited dynamic range of mass spectrometers. Usually MS spectra produced by modern instruments contain many more peptide peaks than can be analyzed by MS/MS on a reasonable time scale in high-throughput experiments. Therefore, only the most intense peaks are chosen routinely for fragmentation. In egg white, ovalbumin represents approximately 54% of total protein and is almost ubiquitously distributed among fractions derived from chromatographic or electrophoretic separation of egg white proteins. Thus, The advent of faster high-resolution mass spectrometers has circumvented some of the issues encountered owing to protein dynamic range. The LTQ-Orbitrap Velos, which was used in the last egg white proteomic survey to be discussed in this section ( Storage of eggs is known to cause changes in egg white such as, for instance, egg white thinning or the conversion of ovalbumin to S-ovalbumin. Egg white thinning is the conversion of thick egg white to thin egg white usually ascribed to disaggregation of high molecular weight complexes of the gel-forming glycoprotein ovomucin ( Other studies have explored differences in the egg white proteome of fresh unfertilized and fertilized eggs ( During the first days of incubation of fertilized eggs, egg white predominantly loses water and ions that move to the yolk, while protein movements to other compartments of the egg seem to be very limited ( Protein compositional analysis was undertaken in egg whites from six different egg varieties, including white-shell eggs, brown-shell eggs, lutein-enriched eggs, organic eggs, omega-3–enriched eggs, and vitamin-enriched eggs by   Most of the studies described in this section (comparative egg white proteomics) relied on 2-DE for protein separation and gel densitometry for protein quantification, combined with MALDI-TOF MS for protein identification. This reliance on 2-DE, despite some disadvantages discussed earlier, stands in contrast to the general trend in proteomic studies to use either 1-D electrophoresis or gel-free sample preparation methods and LC-ESI-MS including label-free quantification for abundance estimation. Despite this, 2-DE is still considered by some to be the best choice for separation and identification of protein isoforms and modifications. However, the only modification explored in egg white studies discussed here was the partial degradation of a few major proteins and the possible formation of complexes between different forms of the same protein or, very rarely, between different proteins, such as ovalbumin and lysozyme ( Although yolk is accumulated in the ovaries before egg white components are secreted and assembled in the magnum section of the oviduct, many major egg white proteins, such as ovalbumin or ovotransferrin, were identified in early studies of the yolk ( Less surprisingly, egg white proteins were also identified in the vitelline membrane, which is in direct contact to egg white. Fifty-five of the 137 proteins identified in vitelline membrane preparations by high-throughput mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis ( The major egg white proteins ovalbumin ( Many egg white proteins were shown to bear posttranslational modifications previously, but at present there are no published proteomic surveys of egg white protein modifications. However, analysis of the phosphoproteome of the chicken eggshell matrix ( The egg white proteins ovomucoid (Gal d1), ovalbumin (Gal d2), ovotransferrin (Gal d3), and lysozyme (Gal d4) are among the most common causes of food allergy ( When a known set of proteins, such as the egg white allergens, needs to be detected and quantified accurately and reproducibly in samples of different origin and complexity, the proteomic method of choice seems to be selected reaction monitoring (SRM;
