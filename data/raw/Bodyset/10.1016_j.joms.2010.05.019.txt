Purpose
                  Diagnosis and treatment of frontal sinus fractures (FSFs) have progressed over the previous 30 years. Despite advances in computed tomography, there is no current diagnostic uniformity with regard to classification and treatment. We developed a statistically valid treatment protocol for FSFs based on injury pattern, nasofrontal outflow tract (NFOT) injury, and complication(s). These data outlined predictable injury patterns based on specific computed tomographic findings critical to the diagnosis and ultimate treatment of this potentially fatal injury.
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  A retrospective review was conducted on patients with FSF from 1979 to 2005 under institutional review board approval. All computed tomographic scans were reviewed by the authors and fractures categorized by location, displacement, comminution, and degree of NFOT injury.
               
                  Results
                  One thousand ninety-seven patients with FSF were identified, 87 expired and 153 had inadequate data, leaving a group of 857 patients. Simultaneous displacement of anterior-posterior tables constituted the largest group (38.4%). NFOT injury occurred in most patients (70.7%) and was strongly associated with anterior (92%) and posterior (88%) table involvement (comminuted 98%). Sixty-seven percent of patients with NFOT injury had obstruction. Five hundred four patients (59.6%) had surgery with 10.4% complications and 353 patients were observed with 3.1% complications. All but 1 patient with complications had NFOT injury (98.5%).
               
                  Conclusions
                  Predictable patterns of injury based on specific computed tomographic data play a pivotal role in classification and surgical management of potentially fatal frontal sinus injuries. Radiologic diagnosis of NFOT injury in FSFs, particularly obstruction, plays a decisive role in surgical planning.
