In the current generation of 3D electronic packaging, multiple reflows are often required during soldering. In addition, electronic packages may be subjected to additional solder rework or other heating processes. This paper investigates the effects of multiple reflow cycles on TiO2 reinforced Sn–0.7Cu solder fabricated by a powder metallurgy microwave sintering technique. Compared to TiO2-free equivalents, a relative suppression of the Cu6Sn5 phase, both as primary crystals and as an interfacial layer was observed. The likely mechanism relates to the TiO2 nanoparticles promoting nucleation and decreasing the amount of time that liquid is in contact with the interfacial layer. The TiO2 particles appear to stabilise the interfacial Cu6Sn5 layer and result in a more planar morphology. The suppression of Cu6Sn5 results in TiO2 reinforced solder joints having a higher shear strength after multiple reflow cycles compared to Sn–0.7Cu solder joints.Solder alloys play a crucial role in determining performance and reliability in the assembly and interconnection of electronic products and have electrical, thermal and mechanical functions It has recently been reported that additions of reinforcement to a variety of solder matrices, with compounds including silicon carbide (SiC) This paper investigates the effects of multiple reflow cycles on the TiO In this study, Sn–0.7Cu solder powders of spherical morphology with an average particle size of 45 Solder balls of approximately 600 To investigate the thermal reactions of a solder joint during soldering and multiple reflow cycles, a Mettler Toledo differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a N The real time observation experiments were performed at BL20XU beamline in the SPring-8 synchrotron using an in-situ synchrotron X-ray real time solidification observation setup developed in previous research The solder joint strength after multiple reflows was tested using a Dage 4000 high speed bond tester at 60 Thermal reactions during heating and cooling of solder joints are important in understanding the reactions of the solid-liquid-solid transition during soldering.

High speed shear tests were conducted at Nihon Superior Japan. This work was financially supported by the
