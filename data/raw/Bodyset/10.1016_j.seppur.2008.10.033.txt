Transport coefficients and correlations recently used to describe surfactant contribution to particle and water transport in a laboratory flotation column were used to simulate the impact of surfactant contamination on the flotation selectivity of industrial two-stage deinking lines. Simulation results showed that surfactants are slightly removed in the first flotation stage and are concentrated in the second one, where they induce a drop in ink flotation and in fibre entrainment. Subsequently, flotation units in the second stage displayed lower ink removal than in the first stage. In the presence of a constant water reject flow, the increase in surfactant contamination in the pulp stock gave a general decrease in the removal of suspended solids. Surfactant removal increased from 5 to 50%, however, this increase was not sufficient to prevent surfactant accumulation in the deinking line. Simulation results were compared with data collected in an industrial deinking line and particle/surfactant removal efficiencies obtained with low surfactant contamination were in line with experimental data.is the concentration of the considered particle class in the flotation cell (g/L) is the concentration of particle class is the concentration of particle class is the pulp slurry concentration (g/L) is the particle downward flow from the froth in the pulp due to drainage (g/min) residual equivalent flexo ink in the pulp (ppm) is the froth retention time (s) is the froth thickness (cm) is the gas superficial velocity (cm/s) is the water superficial velocity in the froth (cm/s) is the flotation rate constant of particle class is the experimental flotation coefficient of particle class is the water drainage rate constant (1/s) is the water drainage flow (m is the water upward flow in the froth (m is the water upward flow in the froth in the absence of drainage (m is the gas flow (m is the water flow at the inlet of the flotation unit (m is the water flow at the outlet of the flotation unit (m is the average diameter of the reference flexo ink particles (0.5 is the average diameter of ink particle (μm) is the cross-sectional area of the flotation column (m is the flotation time (min) is the flotation cell capacity (m correction coefficient used in Eq. is the particle drainage coefficient is the water volume fraction in the froth is the water volume fraction at the froth/pulp slurry interface is the particle entrainment coefficient The large diffusion of froth flotation as efficient separation technology relies on the ability of gas bubbles to collect and remove hydrophobic materials from aqueous media via the direct adsorption/adhesion of solutes/suspended particles at the air/water interface Despite its versatility and apparent simplicity, froth flotation is governed by complex physicochemical and hydrodynamic phenomena which depend on pulp slurry/process chemicals composition As for minerals flotation, research in the flotation deinking field focuses on specific sub-processes and, to the best of our knowledge, a basic mechanistic description of the flotation deinking process accounting for both physicochemical and hydrodynamic phenomena is actually missing. Recent studies investigated the contribution of fibre type and consistency on gas hold-up In previous works Particle transport in flotation cells was simulated using semi-empirical equations recently used to model deinking selectivity in a laboratory flotation column The variation in concentration due to the removal of hydrophobic materials by adsorption/adhesion at the surface of air bubbles, Particles and solutes entrainment in the wake of air bubbles was correlated to their concentration in the pulp slurry and to the water upward flow in the froth. The variation in concentration due to entrainment, Water drainage through the froth was described using water hold-up in the froth, The mass drainage flow of particles/solutes dispersed in the froth, Perfect mixing and piston flow were assumed to occur in the aerated pulp and in the froth in order to close-up Eqs. The effect of non-ionic surfactant concentration and distribution on ink removal selectivity was simulated for the conventional multistage flotation system shown in In the simulated system ( Overall mass balance calculations involving multistage systems were resolved using a process simulation software (CadSim Plus 2.4). The operating conditions of an industrial pre-flotation line with layout, pulp processing capacity, deinking chemistry and nominal pulp stock composition similar to those used to run simulations and to extract transport coefficients The distribution of surface active substances along the line was evaluated from surface tension measurements. A maximum bubble pressure tensiometre (Sita, T60) with a bubble lifetime triggered to 15 Dry pulp pads (∼400 The fibre fraction in pulp samples was determined by weighing long fibres remaining on a 200 mesh wire screen after abundant washing, whereas, the ash fraction was determined by weighing residual inorganic material after dry pulp ignition and overnight storage in an oven at 425  As shown in  Ink removal versus surfactant concentration plots illustrated in The variation of the ink mass flow in the two flotation stages is shown in Curves illustrating fibre versus surfactant concentration along the deinking line (  Fines and ash transport display an intermediate behaviour between ink and fibres. Mineral fillers (ash) have flotation rate constant similar to that of ink particles ( Simulation results show that both the variation of surfactant load in the pulp feed flow and its distribution in the two-flotation stages affect the yield of the deinking line. Except for a peak in ink removal in the second stage at 3  The variation of the surfactant concentration in the deinking mill was in good agreement with simulation results. The following general conclusions can be drawn from this investigation: Particle, water and surfactant transport coefficients and their dependence from surfactant concentration obtained in a previous study were used to simulate the impact of surfactant load in the pulp stock on the operating conditions of a conventional two-stage flotation deinking line. Surfactants are slightly removed from the pulp in the first stage and concentrated in the froth which are further processed in the second stage. The high surfactant concentration in the second stage leads to an increase in water hold-up in the froth and to a drop in the ink flotation rate and in the ink removal efficiency of the deinking line. When the water reject flow was stabilized to 5% by adjusting the froth retention time, the increase in surfactant concentration in the pulp feed flow gave a drop in suspended solids removal showing the high sensitivity of conventional flotation deinking lines to surfactant contamination in the pulp stock. Pulp composition, ink and surfactant distribution all along the deinking line and their corresponding removal efficiency obtained by simulation were in reasonable agreement with data collected in an industrial line bearing similar layout and processing a pulp stock with same nominal composition.
