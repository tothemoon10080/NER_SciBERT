The reaction kinetics for the leaching of low-grade scheelite concentrate was investigated in an autoclave with sodium hydroxide in the presence of phosphate. The effects of stirring speed (300−600 r/min), reaction temperature (353−383 K), sodium hydroxide concentration (1.69−6.76 mol/L) and phosphate concentration (0.68−1.69 mol/L) on the WO3 dissolution ratio were studied. The results showed that the WO3 dissolution ratio was practically independent of stirring speed, while it increased with increasing the reaction temperature, and the concentrations of sodium hydroxide and phosphate. The experimental data were consistent with the shrinking core model, with a surface chemical reaction as the leaching rate-determining step. The apparent activation energy was calculated as 49.56 kJ/mol, and the reaction orders with respect to the concentrations of sodium hydroxide and phosphate were determined as 0.27 and 0.67, respectively. The kinetics equation of the leaching process was established.
