A precursory stack, composed of magnetron-sputtered Al top-layer, microarc-oxidized TiO2 interlayer and pure Ti substrate as bottom-layer, was used to fabricate oxidation-resistant coatings via reactive synthesis method that involves a vacuum-diffusional annealing at 600°C and a following pre-oxidation treatment at 900°C. The compositional and structural evolution from precursory stack to oxidation-resistant coating was investigated by EDS, XRD and SEM, respectively. The anti-oxidation performance of the coating was evaluated by cyclic oxidation test at 900°C. The results indicate that a Ti–Al gradient structure preliminarily generates at coating/substrate interface for decreased thermal mismatch during vacuum-diffusional annealing, because of the controllable diffusion of Al atoms from top-layer to Ti substrate via porous TiO2 interlayer. On the other hand, in the process of subsequent pre-oxidation treatment, an Al2O3 rich outer coating is formed accompanied with the consumption of TiO2 interlayer, while the Ti–Al gradient structure is eventually achieved in the reactively synthesized coating. The oxidation resistance of Ti samples with the coating is about 12 times higher than that of bare Ti, demonstrated by a 50cycle test.In terms of low density, high specific strength, large elastic modulus and excellent creep resistance, Ti and its alloys are attractive materials for components in aerospace, marine, and biomedical engineering, and so on Commonly, the anti-oxidation performance of coating is determined by both the thermal mismatch at coating/substrate interface and the barrier performance to block oxygen diffusing into Ti substrate Taking into account above issues, in this paper, an oxidation-resistant coating was reactively synthesized on pure Ti substrate by using an Al/porous TiO Commercially pure TA2 titanium (Fe The reactive synthesis constitutes two steps. The first one was diffusional annealing at 600 The structure of samples were characterized by 7000S X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using CuK       Moreover, TEM observation was performed to further investigate the structure of Ti–Al intermetallics in the synthesized coating, as shown in   As above mentioned, the as-deposited stack is composed of Al top-layer, porous TiO And then during the pre-oxidation treatment at 900 As a result, the porous TiO A stack composed of porous TiO The authors acknowledge the financial support of the
