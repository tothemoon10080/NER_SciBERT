The wellbore stability of a vertical well through the sandstone reservoir layers of the Asmari oil-bearing formation in south-west Iran is investigated. The safe drilling-fluid density range for maintaining wellbore stability is determined and simulated using FLAC3D software and a finite volume model established with drilled strata geomechanical features. The initiation of plastic condition is used to determine the safe mud weight window (SMWW) in specific sandstone layers. The effects of rock strength parameters, major stresses around the wellbore and pore pressure on the SMWW are investigated for this wellbore. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a reduction in cohesion and internal friction angle values leads to a significant narrowing of the SMWW. On the other hand, the reduction of pore pressure and the ratio between maximum and minimum horizontal stresses causes the SMWW to widen significantly. The ability to readily quantify changes in SMWW indicates that the developed model is suitable as a well planning and monitoring tool.
