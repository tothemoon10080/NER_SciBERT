The proliferation of normal human fibroblast cells was enhanced by the addition of inorganic polyphosphate (poly(P)) into culture media. The mitogenic activities of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) were also enhanced by poly(P). A physical interaction between poly(P) and FGF-2 was observed, and FGF-2 was both physically and functionally stabilized by poly(P). Furthermore, poly(P) facilitated the FGF-2 binding to its cell surface receptors. Because poly(P) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, it may be a spontaneous modulator of FGFs.Inorganic polyphosphates (poly(P)) Because there has been no report concerning the direct effect of poly(P) on mammalian cells and because poly(P) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues and plasma (       If poly(P) does in fact modulate the mitogenic activity of FGF, cell proliferation would be enhanced by co-treatment with poly(P) and FGF rather than by single treatment with poly(P) or FGF. To examine whether the co-treatment of poly(P) and FGF is effective in stimulating mitogenic activity of FGFs, Balb/c 3T3, NHDF, and HGF whose growth could be dependent on FGF were treated with FGF-1 or FGF-2 in combination with poly(P) (   Since FGF-2 was physically stabilized by poly(P), stability of the biological activity of FGF-2 was also examined using Balb/c 3T3 cells. Since FGF-2 almost loses its mitogenic activity within 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the residual activity after preincubation (24 h at 37 °C) of FGF-2 was examined in the presence and absence of poly(P). As shown in  To rule out the possibility that stabilization of FGF-2 by poly(P) occur during incubation with binding buffer or elution buffer, stability of FGF-2 during binding assay was evaluated. FGF-2 was incubated with poly(P) or NaPO With regard to the mechanism of growth stimulation by poly(P), a similar effect has also been reported by adding heparin to culture media. Heparin and heparin-like glycosaminoglycans are well known potent modulators of FGF-1 and FGF-2, and they potentiate the mitogenic activity of both FGFs ( One hypothesis is that poly(P) has biological functions for controlling the activity of FGF
