Ore grade estimation plays an important role in recoverable resource calculations and mining projects. Classic geostatistical estimation methods are based on two-point statistics and cannot make use of multiple-point and higher-order statistics of the data. Very few studies have been conducted on determination of the possible effects of these features on the results of ore grade estimation. In view of this, the present study introduced a new multiple-point interpolation method based on the implicit Volterra series. In this regard, least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) were used to implicitly estimate the Volterra series coefficients. Regularized risk minimization in the LS-SVM can increase generalization of the Volterra series and reduce sensitivity of these series to data noise. Also, conjugate gradient iterative algorithm was used to solve the linear equations of the implicit Volterra series estimation problem. This sets the stage to solve large-scale problems for Volterra series. With the use of Volterra series, multiple-point multiplicative interactions of spatial data can be used in the ore grade estimation process. In this study, multiple point spatial templates were used to extract multiplicative features of the input data. Therefore, an algorithm was presented to search the 3D space by these templates. The applicability of the regularized implicit Volterra series in capturing the higher-order features of the spatial data is successfully evaluated in a synthetic example. Also, the generalization ability of the introduced method is successfully examined in a synthetic 2D example and one real 3D mining example at the Sarcheshmeh porphyry copper deposit. The results revealed that the introduced multiple-point method could present better results than the ordinary kriging method.Spatial interpolation techniques have attracted a great attention in different fields of geosciences. A wide range of algorithms have been developed to perform the interpolation of geospatial data ( A great number of studies have emphasized on the importance of higher-order statistics in modeling substantially complex natural phenomena ( Before the advent of classical higher-order statistics in geostatistical literature, these statistics had been the subject of many studies in signal/image processing domains ( Although, the previously mentioned studies utilized the classical higher-order statistics, Wiener estimation method ( In the present study, a multiple point spatial interpolation method was developed based on implicit Volterra series, which was implemented for grade estimation. Due to this, a new implicit method was introduced for estimation of Volterra series based on the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). Regularized risk minimization in LS-SVM ( The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: Section A system is a mathematical model of a physical process, which relates the input signal This system can be expanded by adding a series of nonlinear integral operators to a nonlinear system called “Volterra series” (Eq. According to this equation, Most system identification algorithms treat the system as a black box ( By mapping Similarly, stacking the maps In addition, an efficient solution to the problem of Volterra series estimation can be obtained by the so-called “Representer theorem”, which states the following (        The individual Regularized estimation of the Volterra series has unfavorable effects on the orthogonality condition of the individual Volterra operators. The orthogonality condition states that a pth-order Volterra operator ( On the contrary, individual operators of the non-regularized implicit Volterra series fulfill the orthogonality condition ( In this study, the value of each grid node was estimated from the values of its neighbor data points. The basic assumption is that the dependency of a data point value For example, regarding an 8- point neighborhood for samples ( Volterra series calculations in The spatial templates used in this study are slightly different from the templates used by The search process in 3D space by a first-order lag (including a central and a neighbor point) is illustrated in algorithm (1). 3D spatial search using an Steps of searching in 3D space using the first-order lag Steps of searching in 3D space using the An illustrative example of application of the new interpolation technique is provided in Maximum order of Volterra model is equal to This section presents three application examples of the proposed method. The first example inspects the applicability of the regularized implicit Volterra series in capturing the higher-order features of the spatial data. In the second example the generalization ability of the introduced implicit Volterra series is examined and the third example is used to address the applicability of the developed interpolation method on a real mine-scale example. This example inspects the capability of the introduced regularized implicit Volterra series in modeling the higher-order statistics of spatial data. Similar experiments have been conducted by In the first step of the experiment, choosing a 5 × 5 neighborhood, the central pixels are predicted by Eq. According to In the same way, higher-order components of the crack image are created using non-regularized implicit Volterra series. In the second experiment, we address the generalization ability of the introduced implicit Volterra series. In this experiment, a random sample set was obtained from the crack image, consisting of 1200 random samples (image pixels), and then was used for training the Volterra model presented in Section (2.2) which uses the multiple-point templates introduced in Section (2.4.2). The random sample set and its experimental variograms are represented in The images interpolated by implicit Volterra series with the polynomial kernel, implicit Volterra series with RBF kernel, and ordinary kriging are shown in In this experiment, introduced implicit Volterra series was used to estimate the ore grade of Sarcheshmeh porphyry copper deposit. 80% of 1587 borehole samples were considered as training data for the Volterra system, and 20% of the data were regarded as test data. Drill hole spacing and data density in the study area are adequate for modeling the variograms and tuning the hyper-parameters of the model. The scattered plot of the samples in 3D space, together with their descriptive statistics, and directional variograms of training data are shown in Due to the sensitivity of the polynomial functions to the data scale, the data were transformed to the range of [0,1] before applying the implicit Volterra series with polynomial kernel, and the final results were back-transformed to the actual range of the data. Implicit Volterra series with Gaussian kernel does not require this transformation. Therefore, original untransformed values were used in the interpolation. In the training step, an exhaustive grid search was applied to the different values of hyper-parameters of polynomial and RBF kernels ( According to the results of the grid search, lowest error rate of the implicit Volterra series with polynomial kernel were obtained for In case of the implicit Volterra series with RBF kernel, lowest error rate were obtained for In order to evaluate the results, the optimal models were applied to the test data, and its results were compared with those of the ordinary kriging method ( This study presented a new method for the multiple-point interpolation of ore grades based on the implicit Volterra series. The regularized cost function of LS-SVM is implemented for implicit estimation of Volterra series to reduce the sensitivity of these series to data noise, and to increase their generalization. Furthermore, a conjugate gradient iterative method is employed in solving linear equations of the implicit estimation. This provides advantages in terms of system sizes that can be handled by Volterra series. In the presented method, the multiple-point multiplicative interaction of spatial data is extracted by using multiple-point spatial templates and is applied to interpolate the spatial data. An applied case study in Sarcheshmeh porphyry copper deposit indicated the superiority of this method over the ordinary Kriging method. Based on the results, the statistics up to the seventh order play a fundamental role in the reduction of ore grade estimation error of the study area. The required number of parameters in the estimation of implicit Volterra Series only grows linearly with the number of data points. Whereas, estimation of high-order moments and cumulants requires the calculation of a large number of parameters and is very complex and time-consuming. Therefore, the implicit Volterra series is an efficient method for extracting multiple-point features of spatial data. A practical experiment demonstrated the capability of the introduced method in capturing the higher-order features of the spatial data. Although, the proposed method in this study is univariate, extending the introduced Volterra model into a multivariate method is straightforward and can be conducted by substituting the univariate neighboring vector Arman Mohammadi Gonbadi: Developed the ideas, implemented them, performed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.
