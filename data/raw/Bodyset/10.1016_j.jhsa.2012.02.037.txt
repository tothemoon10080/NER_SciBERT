Anterior transolecranon fracture dislocation of the elbow is relatively uncommon in children. We reviewed the experience over the past 5 years at our institution in treating this injury to identify pediatric variants and outline a rational treatment strategy. We found 2 pediatric variants to the injury pattern and determined that tension band constructs can successfully be used to treat certain pediatric transolecranon fracture dislocations. The pediatric variants identified in this report are fracture dislocations with associated medial epicondyle fracture and radial neck fracture. We recommend a heightened vigilance in looking for a fracture through the ulna when an anterior dislocation is present, as physeal injuries can be challenging to see on plain radiographs.
