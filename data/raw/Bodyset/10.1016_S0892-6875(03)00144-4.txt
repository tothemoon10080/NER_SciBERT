The Radisson SAS Royal Hotel, Helsinki, Finland, was the venue for Minerals Engineering International (MEI)’s second speciality meeting on mineralogy, Applied Mineralogy ’03. The meeting, which was organised in collaboration with the International Council for Applied Mineralogy (ICAM) and CSIRO Australia, aims to bring together mineralogists and metallurgists from all around the world to discuss aspects of applied mineralogy within the context of the international mining industry. Given the number of delegates that attended the meeting (around 50), their international diversity (15 different countries represented), and the nature of the technical papers presented, this aim was clearly fulfilled. Topics covered during the two days of poster sessions and oral presentations were extremely diverse and included papers on analytical techniques, and various aspects of copper, nickel, iron, gold, PGM, bauxite, kaolin, phosphate, chromite, zinc, and tin deposits, as well as other industrial minerals, cements, coal, and even mine waste (full details can be found at MEI Online ( MEI are to be congratulated for a wonderful two days. The unique format of their conferences (small number of participants, and lots of time for discussion), worked really well. This feature, together with the special venue (Radisson SAS Royal Hotel), in a country which has a long history of mining, together with the opportunity of having papers considered for publication in a special Applied Mineralogy issue of the journal Given the response to Applied Mineralogy ’03, the next one is scheduled for 2006 in Cape Town, South Africa.
