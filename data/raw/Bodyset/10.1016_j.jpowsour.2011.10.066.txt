                     V3O8 cathode (261.86mAhg−1 and 87.7% accordingly). Electrochemical analyses show that an appropriate dosage of Ce can significantly suppress the capacity fading arose from lithiation phenomena around 2.55 and 2.3V upon cycling. These interesting phenomena are mainly attributed to the stabilization of the microstructure of the material and the modification of their crystallinity and grain morphology, which lead to suppression of structural damage from the two-phase transformation around 2.55V upon cycling and the dissolution of active material in the electrolyte on the 2.3V phenomena.The lithium trivanadate Li Numerous researches have been devoted to improve the reversible capacity of Li Hetero-atom doping is an effective route to improve the electrochemical behaviors of cathode materials by modifying the crystal structure Cerium (Ce) has a big radius and high affinity for oxygen, and has been reported as an effective dopant for LiMn The starting materials used in the experiment were lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, SDT Q600) were performed in air at a heating rate of 10 The cathode electrodes were prepared with the active materials, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in a weight ratio of 75:15:10.
