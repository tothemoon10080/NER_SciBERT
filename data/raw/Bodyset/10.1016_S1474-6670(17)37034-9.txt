The degree of automation in process equipment is constantly increasing. In order to be competitive, process equipment manufacturers need to utilize the process knowledge embedded in the hardware solution. An advanced fault detection and diagnosis system for process equipment can yield economical benefits by mmimizing downtime and service costs. Using models and heuristic knowledge fault diagnosis can advance beyond the conventional level of detecting faults after they occur. This paper presents the fault diagnosis module of the intelligent control system for a variable volume pressure filter. The remote support module currently being designed is described, as well as the rule-based inference engine.
