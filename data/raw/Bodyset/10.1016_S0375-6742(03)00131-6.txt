Copper sulphide mineralization is intimately associated with solid bitumen (migrated hydrocarbon) within a 70-m-thick porphyritic lava horizon in a Neocomian back-arc basin near Copiapó, North Central Chile. Bitumen occurs as veins and vesicle-fill and exhibits well-developed anisotropic textures. Fluid flow paragenesis is divided into three principal stages, essentially pre-, syn- and post-metallic mineralization. Ore deposition occurred via the reduction of hot (>300 °C) mineralizing fluids by in situ labile bitumens. Comparative study between the Copiapó porphyry-hosted mineralization and the El Soldado massive Cu deposit (150 Mt Cu reserves), located further to the south, reveal striking geologic and genetic similarities.
