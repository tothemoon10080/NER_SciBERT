Purpose
                  To develop instruments that can restore the shape of a fractured calcaneus and facilitate minimally invasive primary arthrodesis of the subtalar joint in severe calcaneal intraarticular fractures.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  We studied a new osteosynthesis system for calcaneal fractures in three consecutive phases: a) system design, b) biomechanical tests and c) prototype testing in cadavers.
               
                  Results
                  The basic characteristics of the original design were validated with minimal changes. From the biomechanical point of view the implant developed has passed strength and fatigue tests and has shown itself to provide good surgical management in cadavers.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The implant designed achieves its purpose, and adapts to the mechanical conditions and dimensions of the calcaneal bone.
