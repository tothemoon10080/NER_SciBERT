Oxygenated aqueous suspensions of home-prepared (HP) and commercial TiO2 catalysts were used in a batch photoreactor for carrying out the oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (MBA) under different operative conditions. HP catalysts were synthesized from TiCl4 and underwent a hydrolysis treatment of different times under mild conditions. The textural characterization of catalysts was carried out with XRD, SEM observations, BET surface area and porosity measurements. For both alcohols the main oxidation products were the corresponding aromatic aldehydes and CO2. The HP catalysts exhibited selectivity values towards the aldehyde production up to 28% (BA conversion: 50%) and 41% (MBA conversion: 65%), about four times higher than those of commercial TiO2. The addition of an aliphatic alcohol (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or tert-butanol) in small amounts with respect to water decreased the overall oxidation rate of aromatic alcohols but enhanced the selectivity for aldehyde formation up to 1.5 times. The reactivity results suggest that: (i) the aromatic alcohol molecules interact with the TiO2 surface in different ways that eventually determine two parallel reaction pathways (partial oxidation or mineralization); (ii) the aliphatic alcohols preferentially compete with aromatic alcohols for the mineralizing pathway.The increasingly stringent environmental limitations for chemical processes are driving scientists all over the world to investigate the replacement of contaminant processes with new ones, preferably taking place in atoxic (or even no) solvents. A new branch of organic chemistry is being born in which all reactions develop in water, often with high reaction rates even for insoluble reagents The selective oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, carboxylic acids and ketones) is an essential reaction frequently encountered in the synthesis of fine chemicals The development of processes with clean oxidants and stable catalysts is of great economical and environmental concern Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation method nowadays mainly used for water and air remediation In the present investigation the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde (BAD) and of MBA to PAA has been performed in organic-free water with TiO With the aim of affecting the photoprocess selectivity, an aliphatic alcohol (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or Photoreactivity runs were carried out in aqueous suspensions of different HP nanostructured TiO XRD patterns of the powders were recorded by a diffractometer (Philips) using the Cu Kα radiation and a 2 A cylindrical batch photoreactor of Pyrex glass with immersed lamp was used for photocatalytic runs; details of the experimental set up are elsewhere reported The quantitative determination and identification of the species present in the reacting suspension were performed by means of a HPLC (Beckman Coulter, System Gold 126 Solvent Module and 168 Diode Array Detector), equipped with a Luna 5 Aliphatic alcohol concentration was measured by using a gas chromatograph (GC-17A, Shimadzu) equipped with a methyl siloxane column (30 All the used chemicals (Sigma–Aldrich) had a purity >99.0%. All the information obtained by the textural characterization of catalysts is summarized in XRD patterns of the HP catalysts indicated the presence of only anatase phase up to boiling times of 2 BET specific surface areas were found to be ca. 220 Preliminary oxidation runs of BA and MBA were carried out in the 3–11 pH range and with different amounts of catalyst, being the optimality criterion that of maximising the selectivity. The highest selectivity to aldehyde was observed at pH 7. Even if the oxidation rates increase with the catalyst amount, the highest selectivity was reached for HP catalysts with amounts of 0.4 The main intermediate products detected in the course of BA and MBA photocatalytic oxidation were the corresponding aldehydes, CO For all the used catalysts For HP0.5, the most selective photocatalyst, a specific study has been carried out to determine the influence of aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and The reactivity results obtained from representative runs of BA and MBA oxidation in the presence of methanol are reported in  All the reactivity results indicate that the aromatic alcohol disappearance occurs through two parallel reactions: partial oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde and total oxidation to CO The structural results reported in The attained selectivities point to a quite different behaviour of the two aromatic alcohols. The selectivity of BA to BAD is quite lower than that of MBA to PAA. A likely explanation is that the MBA's methoxy group (an electron donating one) increases the hydrophilicity of aromatic ring; in other words it increases the desorption capacity from the TiO As to concern the influence of aliphatic alcohol, from the data reported in The increasingly better performance of aliphatic alcohols with the decrease of molecular weight can be probably ascribed to a more significant extent of photoadsorption for methanol and ethanol, due to a low steric hindrance. This effect is not evident for the highest aliphatic alcohol concentration used in this work, owing to a saturation effect of TiO The values of BAD concentration (see In conclusion aliphatic alcohols appreciably raise the aldehyde selectivity owing to the fact that these compounds, being highly reducing species, favourably compete with the aromatic alcohols for the mineralizing pathway then lowering their overall disappearance rate. The occurrence of competition between aliphatic and aromatic alcohol molecules is also evidenced by the results reported in In order to quantitatively characterize the influence of alcohol presence on the partial oxidation and mineralization processes, a rate equation has been fitted to the experimental data of BA, BAD, MBA and PAA concentrations. A first order kinetic equation, which has only a phenomenological meaning, satisfactorily (  The photoreactivity results indicate that the aromatic alcohol molecules participate in two parallel oxidative processes on the catalyst surface: the first one is the partial oxidation giving rise to the aldehyde and the second one is the complete oxidation producing eventually CO The present investigation clearly indicates that a low-weight aliphatic alcohol such as methanol (or better the safe ethanol), added in small amounts in aqueous TiO
