In order to discuss the particle-bubble interaction during the electro-flotation of cassiterite, the recovery of cassiterite with different particle sizes was investigated, and the collision mechanism between the cassiterite particles and H2 bubbles was explored. The flotation tests were carried out in a single bubble flotation cell. The results show that cassiterite particles <10 μm, 10–20 μm, 20–38 μm and 38–74 μm match with bubbles with size of 50–150 μm, about 250 μm, 74 μm and 74 μm, respectively, and a better recovery can be obtained. It is demonstrated that the recovery of cassiterite is influenced by the size of cassiterite particles and bubbles. Furthermore, the probabilities of collision, adhesion, detachment and collection were calculated using the collision, attachment and collection models. Theoretical calculation results show that the collision probability decreases sharply with decreasing particle size and increasing bubble size (below 150 μm). The attachment probability would increase from the effective collision, leading to the increase of recovery.
