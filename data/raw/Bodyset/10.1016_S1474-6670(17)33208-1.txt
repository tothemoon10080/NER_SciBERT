Because sampling requires time, money, care and attention, sampling operations should be scrutinized. The determination of the optimum sample size by taking into account the process economics is described. When the additional costs of sampling, re-processing and extra transport are high, blending may help to improve process control and lower costs. A case study of the glass recycling industry is used to illustrate the principles described in this paper.
