Distinctive to volar fixed-angle plating of the distal radius, the optimal position of the distal fixed-angle support is in the subchondral bone immediately proximal to the articular surface. Standard intraoperative radiographic imaging of the distal radius during placement of a volar fixed-angle plate does not provide adequate visualization of the subchondral bone-distal support interface. A 45Â° pronated oblique view is described to address this specific issue of whether volar hardware placed at the immediate subchondral bone level has effectively avoided the radiocarpal joint. This is a quite important radiographic consideration when pursuing the strategy of volar fixed-angle plating of distal radius fractures.
