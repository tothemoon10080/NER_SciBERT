Several factors affecting the elution of Pt, Pd and Au cyanide complexes in a manner similar to the AARL process have been investigated. Temperature, the cyanide pre-treatment concentration and the ionic strength of the eluant have been found to affect Pt and Pd elution substantially and will be critical factors in the design of an elution process. An acid (HCl) pre-treatment step increased the elution percentage for all cases investigated while no PGMs were eluted by the acid. The presence of Cu did not have a negative effect on the elution of Pt, Pd or Au at strong pre-treatment (2% NaCN and 0.6% NaOH) conditions but at weak pre-treatment conditions (0% NaCN), the elution percentage of Pt and Pd were reduced by between 10% and 18% after five bed volumes when Cu was present. The presence of 100mg/L KSCN salt added to the leach solution during the adsorption stage reduced the elution percentage for Pt and Pd by seven and 10%. Carbon loaded to equilibrium resulted in slower elution kinetics.The leaching of Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) with cyanide, as an alternative PGM process option that is less energy intensive and better suited to the extraction of complex, lower grade ores or for the extraction of precious metals from recycled products has been the topic of several research papers in the past ( The AARL process consists of three significant steps; a hot acid wash followed by a hot (100–120 The activated carbon used for the experiments is a commercial available coconut-based granular activated carbon supplied by Marlyn chemicals (Pty) Ltd-South Africa (with a BET surface area of 1200 It has been shown that PGM cyanidation occurs in the same manner as that of gold and that the reactions follow the Elsner equation to form stable complexes with cyanide, namely [Pt(CN) Adsorption of the PGMs from the synthetic solutions containing five mg/L of Pt, Pd and Au each were conducted by means of the traditional bottle-on-rolls method for 65 Elution experiments, following the method described by The pre-treatment step was conducted outside the column by stirring the activated carbon in glass beakers for 30 The experiments involving the acid washing step consisted of stirring the loaded activated carbon with 40 Initial test results showed that effective elution of platinum and palladium cyanide with the AARL method is feasible. The elution profiles for platinum and palladium were found to be steeper and to appear earlier than the elution profile of gold (at all temperatures), indicating that platinum and palladium will elute before gold. Platinum and palladium elute from activated carbon to approximately 95% in five BV and to >99% in 10 BV’s at 80 The elution temperature is probably the most significant factor for gold elution. Two sets of experiments were completed to investigate this effect. All experiments at temperatures below 100 According to The results obtained from the stainless steel column (elution Even at the higher flow rates, temperature remains a significant factor which is evident from the ≈20% increase in elution as the temperature increases from 100 to 120 The effect of the NaCN concentration is immediately evident in Before the increase in Pt and Pd elution percentage with cyanide concentration is discussed, the well-researched gold adsorption and elution are reviewed. The exact mechanism of gold adsorption, and specifically the role of cyanide, remains a discussion point, especially as most authors have substantiated their conclusions adequately by thorough experimentation. The two opposing theories are whether partial chemical degradation of NaAu(CN)  Based on the literature on gold elution, cyanide (CN A mere change in elution kinetics was therefore considered for Pt and Pd elution by evaluating the elution profiles at various cyanide pre-treatment concentrations, which are shown in The likelihood of more than one cyanide complex for Pt and Pd with different adsorption characteristics was therefore researched secondly. PGM adsorption studies by  The formation of Pd(CN) An alternative explanation is that the presence of cyanide, and to a lesser extent NaOH, causes a change in the functional groups on the carbon surface, which makes the surface less receptive to adsorption ( Analysis of the specific cyanide complex on the activated carbon poses certain challenges. The difficulty with the analysis is both the concentration of the absorbed species and a large scattering response from the carbon which swamp the minor species. Both FTIR and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyse for the adsorbed Pt and Pd complexes on the activated carbon but no conclusions could be drawn from the results. Since the exact complexes of Pt and Pd cyanide occurring on the activated carbon surface could not be confirmed through measurement, it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion as to which of the above mentioned theories are more relevant to explain the increase in the elution kinetics and elution percentage of Pt and Pd with an increase in cyanide pre-treatment. The decrease in the elution rate of gold at higher cyanide concentrations is ascribed to the increasing ionic strength or the increase in ions such as Na Following on from the discussion on cyanide, the effect of NaOH is shown in the presence of 0% NaCN ( From  The presence of dissolved salts in the pulp generally results in an increase in the loading capacity of carbon and the magnitude has been found to depend upon the type and concentration of the cation (  These results are opposite to what This change in the elution kinetics It is therefore hypothesized that at relatively low carbon metal loadings and short adsorption times, an increase in the metal loading will result in improved or at least similar elution recoveries as found by From the elution percentage curve in The increase in the gold elution is due to the higher loading, but which did not reach an equilibrium stage and which corresponds to the findings by The slower elution of the lower Au loaded activated carbon (690 In order to verify the theory that more diffusion into the carbon pores occur with higher metal loadings, the sites where Pt prefer to adsorb onto the activated carbon (based on SEM-EDX analysis as per Surface – area between the pores on the outer surface of the activated carbon. Near pores – edge of activated carbon pores. Pores – inside the activated carbon pores. A comparison of the concentrations in these areas for a high Pt loading (16,800 To confirm the above mentioned theory and to verify whether a carbon level may exist where optimum elution occur, additional experiments were completed and the results can be seen in A similar conclusion could not be drawn for Au from the data presented here, but rather shows a elution percentage in a narrow band between five and seven percent as the Au loading increase from 300 The acid washing step is probably the step where there is the least agreement between operators. The type of acid, acid strength, time, temperature, acid treatment vessel and placement of this step are all variables that are different from the one site to the next, each with advantages and disadvantages. Primarily, the acid washing step is to remove calcium build-up and other contaminants ( Several advantages of acid washing of the loaded carbon prior to the elution are listed by The elution system’s temperature can be increased through a hot acid wash without eluting any gold or silver from the activated carbon which will increase the efficiency of the subsequent elution. Severe calcium passivation can have a negative impact on the subsequent elution of gold which will be eliminated through the acid washing step. In the case of very high loadings of nickel, iron, and silica as well as with effluent circuits operating at reduced pH levels, the acid washing step will reduce the reagent requirements. As it was not specified, the reagents referred to by Another significant advantage relates to the quality of water used for gold elution. Gold elution efficiency decreases with decreasing water quality, but a hot acid wash of the carbon prior to elution seem to de-sensitize the elution efficiency to water quality. A plausible explanation for the effect is related to the character of the gold species on the activated carbon according to the mechanism:  The effect of hydrochloric acid treatment on the elution of Pt and Pd can be seen in True to the literature references ( From all experiments completed, the highest concentration of platinum and palladium found in the pre-treatment solution was 0.69 In terms of the elution process, the PGMs reporting to the pre-treatment solution are insignificant and can therefore be neglected when the different conditions influencing the elution process are evaluated. It is, however, important to note that PGM concentration amounts found in the pre-treatment solution corresponds to the recoverable PGM concentration in the proposed initial cyanide leach ( No correlation between the pre-treatment concentrations of NaCN or NaOH and the PGM concentration could be determined and it is therefore concluded that these concentrations has no effect of on the amount of PGMs that’s desorbed during the pre-treatment step.  The temperature of the pre-treatment was definitely found to have an impact on Pt and Pd and as high as 10% of Pt and Pd was found in the pre-treatment solution when treated at 80 In a previous article, Both At weak pre-treatment conditions, As South African PGM bearing ores are often associated with large amounts of sulphides ( The formation of Pt and Pd with thiocyanate ([Pt(SCN) Factors affecting the elution of Pt and Pd from activated carbon have been investigated. Temperature are considered to be one of the most important factors with higher elution temperatures resulting in better elution recoveries as the temperature increased from 60 to 95 The authors would like to thank Lonmin Plc for their funding of this study.
