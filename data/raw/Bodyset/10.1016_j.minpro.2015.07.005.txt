An explicit theoretical equation, compared with empirical published results, is presented to calculate the terminal settling velocities of spherical particles in Power-Law non-Newtonian fluids for Reynolds Numbers less than 1000.In the last decades, many efforts have been made to determine the influence of non-Newtonian rheological properties on the relative motion of solids through fluids. Relevant examples are the flow of non-Newtonian fluids through packed and fluidized beds and the sedimentation of particle suspension. With modern methods of size reduction, size particles reaches values of just a few microns, and along with the fact that many ores have high clays contain, it is common to find slurries that behave as Pseudo-plastic fluids ( It is well-known that the most important parameter describing particles moving in fluids is its settling velocity, which is a function of the physical properties of the particles and the rheological behavior of the fluid. It is useful to express this velocity as a function of two dimensionless numbers, the drag coefficient and the Reynolds Number. Non-Newtonian fluids present a series of characteristics including plasticity, yield stress and time-dependent behavior. Models of different complexity are available to represent the relationship between shear stress and shear rate of these fluids. The most simple is the so-called power law model, which will be used in this paper. Several experimental studies have been performed to predict the settling velocities of spherical particles in non-Newtonian fluids. One of these studies, The objective of this contribution is to provide an explicit theoretical settling velocity equation based on an extension of the theory of boundary layer over a sphere for the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid. Newtonian fluids are represented by the general constitutive equation: where The drag coefficient where At low Reynolds Numbers the relation between the drag coefficient, the Reynolds Number, and the terminal settling velocity in an unbounded fluid are given by:  where where where  In the same article, If two parameters  where Substitution of the solution of which is: A plot of Non-Newtonian fluids may be represented by a variety of models, the two most commons are Bingham Plastic and Power Law models. The Bingham Plastic model is represented by the equation where where Much attention has been placed in studying the drag behavior of solid spheres in non-Newtonian fluids, consequently extensive amount of information is available. At low Reynolds Numbers, using dimensional arguments, it can be proved that the relation between the drag coefficient and the Reynolds Numbers Here, as a correction factor, we will use which was obtained by fitting the numerical solution of Experiments of settling of spheres in non-Newtonian fluids at higher Reynolds Number have been performed producing data also expressed as drag coefficient Several researchers measured terminal settling velocity of spheres at low Reynolds Number, however, the agreement between theory and experiments is not completely satisfactory ( The type of fluid, Newtonian or non Newtonian, should affect the drag coefficient and the thickness of the boundary layer, then we propose It is assumed that It must be noted that these factors are not independent each other, since in the creeping flow limit ( which corresponds to where Making  Using the same arguments presented for a Newtonian fluid, we can define the dimensionless terms Defining two parameters we obtain: Finally, defining the dimensionless diameter yields Replacing ( Notice that for n To evaluate the prediction quality of A theoretical explicit equation for the Drag Coefficient and the Settling velocities of spherical particles in Power-Law fluids was developed based on previous work of one of the authors. The effect of the non-Newtonian character of the fluid was expressed as empirical relationship obtained from publish data by defining parameters FB acknowledges support by
