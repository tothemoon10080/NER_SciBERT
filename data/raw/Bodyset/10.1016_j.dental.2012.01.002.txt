Objective
                  The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resinous monomers on the odontogenic differentiation and mineralization potential of apical papilla stem cells (SCAP).
               
                  Methods
                  Cultures were established from developing third molars of healthy donors aged 14–18 years-old and were extensively characterized for proliferation rate, colony forming unit efficiency and expression of stem cell markers (STRO-1, CD146, CD34, CD45, CD105, CD117-c-Kit, CD24, CD90, Nanog, Oct3/4), in order to select those with enhanced stem cell and odontogenic differentiation properties. SCAP enriched cultures were then induced for odontogenic differentiation in the continuous presence of low concentrations (0.05–0.5mM) of the monomers 2-hydroxy-ethyl-methacrylate-HEMA and triethylene-glycol-dimethacrylate-TEGDMA for 3 weeks (long-term exposure). Additionally, the effects of a single exposure (72h) to higher concentrations of HEMA (2mM) and TEGDMA (1mM) were evaluated.
               
                  Results
                  The results showed that both types of monomer-exposure significantly delayed the odontogenic differentiation and mineralization processes of SCAP cells. A down-regulation followed by recovery in the expression of differentiation markers, including dentin sialophosphoprotein-DSPP, bone sialoprotein-BSP, osteocalcin-OCN and alkaline phosphatase-ALP was recorded. This was accompanied by reduction of the mineralized matrix produced by monomer-treated-compared to non-treated contol cultures. Furthermore, a concentration-dependence was observed for both monomers during long-term exposure, whereas the effects of HEMA were evident at much lower concentrations compared to TEGDMA.
               
                  Significance
                  These findings suggest that resinous monomers can delay the odontogenic differentiation of SCAP cells, potentially disturbing the physiological repair and/or developmental processes of human permanent teeth.Residual substances released from resin-based dental restorative materials have been well-documented with respect to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in various cell culture systems However, there is until now only fragmentary information available on the biological effects of resinous substances released at low concentrations for extended periods of time during the long-term clinical service of these materials on primary recipient tissues, such as the dental pulp. Two previous Most recently, we have shown that two frequently and in high amounts eluted resin comonomers (HEMA and TEGDMA) at very low (non-toxic) concentrations were able to significantly disturb or completely inhibit the physiologic migration, odontogenic differentiation and mineralization processes of human pulp stem/progenitor cells derived from deciduous teeth The monomers TEGDMA and HEMA were gifts from VOCO (Cuxhaven, Germany). The culture medium (α-Modification of Eagle's Medium-α-MEM with nucleosides) and the enzyme collagenase type I were purchased from Gibco/Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany), whereas the enzyme dispase from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Trypsin/EDTA and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B were purchased from Biochrom AG (Berlin, Germany) and Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) from Lonza (Verviers, Belgium). The chemicals MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], dexamethasone disodium phosphate, monopotassium phosphate, β-glycerophosphate, The human SCAP cultures used in this study were established from the apical papilla of normal impacted third molars at the stage of root development (two thirds of the root completed). The teeth were extracted from young healthy donors aged 14–18 years for orthodontic reasons or due to lack of adequate space for eruption. The collection of the samples was performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board and all donors or their parents signed an informed consent form. Cell cultures were established using the enzymatic dissociation method, as described in previous publications by our group Before any experiment, SCAP cultures used in this study were extensively characterized with respect to growth characteristics, colony forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-F) efficiency and expression of mesenchymal, as well as embryonic stem cell markers using flow cytometry. A total number of 10 SCAP cultures ( For cell growth analysis, cells were seeded at 5 The assay was carried out by plating early passage (p.2) SCAP cells in 6-well plates at densities ranging from 100 to 200 For flow cytometric analysis cells were first harvested by trypsinization and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. For surface epitope analysis, 10 TEGDMA and HEMA were dissolved in absolute ethanol and sequentially diluted to obtain different concentrations of stock solutions. The monomers were freshly diluted in culture medium prior to each experiment. The final concentration of ethanol did not exceed 0.25% (v/v). Cells incubated with medium containing 0.25% ethanol served as control. For the assessment of cytotoxicity, SCAP cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 Before proceeding to the odontogenic differentiation experiments in the presence of the monomers, well-characterized (as described above) SCAP cultures derived from at least 3 different donors were also additionally screened with respect to their odontogenic differentiation and mineralization potential using the Alizarin Red S (AR-S) Method (see below), in order to select the most potent cells with respect to these properties for further analysis of monomer long-term cytotoxicity. For the odontogenic differentiation experiments, SCAP cells were exposed to concentrations of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 In a second series of experiments, SCAP cultures were exposed only once to higher concentrations of HEMA (2 For the assessment of One week after induction of odontogenic differentiation, cells in 6-well-plates were washed twice with PBS (−) and fixed with 10% NBF, as described in the AR-S protocol. ALP activity was visualized by incubating the cells for 2 Total RNA was extracted from cells with NucleoSpin RNA II kit at days 7 and 14 after induction of differentiation. For the RT-PCR reactions 0.5 Each experiment was performed with 3–6 replicates and repeated at least three times. Values were expressed as means Significant variability in growth patterns, CFU-F efficiency and stem cell immunophenotypic profiles could be recorded in SCAP cultures established from different healthy donors of similar age and stage of third molar root development (two thirds of the root completed). HEMA and TEGDMA caused a time- and concentration-dependent reduction of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in SCAP cells ( Overall, the results showed that both types of monomer-exposure (long-term and short-term) significantly delayed the differentiation and mineralization processes of SCAP cells. In addition, a concentration-dependence could be recorded in the long-term treated cultures. More specifically, at week 1, the mineralization was very limited and only a few sparse mineralized nodules could be observed in all types of cultures, including induced-control ( However, at week 2 after induction of differentiation a pronounced delay in mineralization process compared to the induced-control cultures could be recorded in cultures continuously treated (long-term exposure) with all non-toxic concentrations of HEMA tested (0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 Finally, at week 3 after induction of differentiation, all types of TEGDMA and HEMA-treated cultures (both short-term and long-term) showed a statistically significant reduction ( It must be noted, however, that despite the statistically significant delays observed in the differentiation/mineralization processes of monomer-treated SCAP cultures after 3 weeks, a complete inhibition could not be recorded. On the contrary, there was an overall tendency for a gradual recovery of these processes with time in almost all cases, so that at the end of the 3-week observation period a considerable amount of mineralized matrix – although statistically lower compared to control – could be observed in most types of monomer-treated cultures (  SCAP cultures induced for odontogenic differentiation progressively expressed mineralization markers, usually expressed by mature odontoblastic cells, including BSP, DSPP and OCN, as shown by RT-PCR analysis ( On day 14, there was a gradual recovery of BSP and OCN expression in monomer-treated cultures to levels comparable to the induced-control, whereas an obvious expression of DSPP could be now recorded in all types of cultures, being however lower in short-term treated cultures and in cultures continuously treated with 0.5 Pulp tissue response to dental restorative materials is a complicated process that is influenced by many factors, including the composition of the material, the chemistry and concentration of any eluted components or degradation products and the ability of the tissue to respond to these agents It is expected that this heterogeneity can be the cause of interpretational difficulties of the results received from different research groups when these systems are used as biocompatibility models and illuminates the need for a comprehensive characterization of the culture systems used in order to come to reliable results. It is already established that immortalized cells lines, such as transformed mouse fibroblasts ( For all the above reasons, we introduce in this study the use of well-characterized SCAP cultures as a study model of the effects of resinous monomers on the physiological repair processes of the dental pulp, creating the basis for more sophisticated The combined expression of both mesenchymal (STRO-1, CD146, CD34, CD105, CD24, CD90) and embryonic (Nanog, Oct3/4) stem cell markers ( Our study design of both short-term exposure to relatively higher concentrations of HEMA and TEGDMA, as well as long term-exposure to sub-toxic concentrations of these monomers closely simulates the When comparing these results with data recently published by our group on the effects of resinous monomers on dental pulp stem cell cultures established from deciduous teeth (DTSCs), we conclude that the effects on SCAP cells were not as detrimental as those observed in DTSCs cells In the present study, although there were statistically significant delays in the mineralization rate and the expression of differentiation-specific markers (BSP, ALP, OCN, DSPP) ( The data of the present study are also in accordance with those recently published by Galler et al. Significant scientific information is now available from a number of studies on the possible underlying cellular mechanisms altering basic cellular functions after exposure to resinous monomers, which have been already reviewed Although there is a significant clinical evidence that application of resinous materials into deep cavities or pulp exposure sites can be associated with slight to persistent inflammation and lack of mineralized barrier formation In conclusion, our experiments provide evidence that long-term exposure to low concentrations (0.05–0.5
