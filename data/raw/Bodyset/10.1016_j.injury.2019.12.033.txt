The aim of this article is to discuss the diagnosis, management and pitfalls of bony injuries around the skeletally immature knee. Each within their own right is a relatively uncommon injury but associated with potential complications. Distal femoral physeal fractures can result in growth arrest and vascular injury. Tibial spine avulsions can result in an unstable knee. Tibial tubercle fractures can be associated with compartment syndrome and pose a risk to the extensor mechanism of the knee. Fixation can be complicated by growth arrest and subsequent recurvatum deformity. Finally, patella sleeve injuries are often missed and this can also threaten the extensor mechanism. We discuss the approach to clinical and radiological assessment of these injuries, and evidence based recommendations as to how they are best managed to avoid complications.Pathology around the knee joint in children may be acquired or congenital. This review focuses on acquired traumatic conditions around the paediatric knee. In a British cohort study Cooper et al. The majority of bony growth in the lower limb arises from the knee. In order to understand the pathogenesis of these injuries it is important to appreciate the growth and ossification of bone in children. The injuries discussed here are often overlooked as they are relatively uncommon. However, each injury is associated with potentially serious complications if inappropriately managed. Distal femoral physeal injuries are uncommon but associated with potentially significant complications. They make up roughly 2% of all physeal injuries The distal femur has two particular features which should be considered when discussing its injury. The first is the anatomy of the physis. The second is the rate of growth at this physis. With regards to the anatomy, the shape of the physis is undulating. This leads to complex shearing forces during fracture, which in turn leads to a higher risk of bony bar formation Physeal injuries, by their nature, can be associated with an extension into the joint. As with any intraarticular fracture, the Salter Harris III and IV injuries carry an increased risk of non-union and can be associated with the development of early osteoarthritis In most cases these injuries will be visible on standard anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs ( As these injuries are usually secondary to high-energy trauma, it is important that the child is assessed for other injuries according to ATLS guidelines and local trauma protocols. The increased risk of vascular injury should reinforce the importance of a thorough neurovascular assessment. This should take the form of pulse palpation, followed by doppler assessment or ankle brachial pressure index if there is any difficulty in finding a pulse. The child must also be monitored closely for compartment syndrome. Following management of the bony injury, residual ligamentous instability must be assessed to exclude a ligamentous injury. If there is any clinical suspicion following clinical examination then an MRI scan should be obtained. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Alhammoud et al. Salter Harris I fractures are the least common and can be challenging to identify on initial imaging. They should be suspected in the child who is unable to weight bear following trauma with tenderness around the physis circumferentially Salter Harris II fractures of the distal femur are the most common grade of injury but should be managed differently to fractures of this grade at other anatomical locations Salter Harris III and IV fractures can be dealt with together as they both involve the articular surface and therefore require anatomical reduction and fixation according to standard AO principles. CT scanning is helpful for surgical planning Fixation of these injuries normally requires subsequent cast immobilisation for a period of time as fixation alone does not provide sufficient stability in the initial healing phase. Across the spectrum of distal femur physeal fractures, the high risk of physeal injury highlights the importance of long term follow up until the child is skeletally mature. Physeal injury can present as premature physeal closure, leg length discrepancy or an angular deformity Distal femur physeal injuries are uncommon but significant injuries with a high risk of growth disturbance due to both the anatomy of the distal femoral growth plate and its rate of growth. Initial assessment must include a careful neurovascular assessment. Management can be guided according to the Salter Harris grading and long-term follow up is essential to detect growth arrest early before deformity arises. Tibial spine fractures (TSF) typically occur in children aged 8 – 14 years of age Recent evidence suggests that the most common mechanism of injury is that of a non-contact sporting injury Meyers & McKeever classified TSFs using the lateral view of the knee on plain radiographs. ( Initial presentation of patients with TSFs include knee pain, joint effusion, inability to weight bear and reduced knee range of motion Following identification or suspicion of this injury on plain radiographs, cross sectional imaging will help confirm the diagnosis, assist with surgical planning and detect concurrent intra-articular injuries. Approximately 60% of patients with TSFs will have an associated soft tissue or other bony injury MRI scans have also been found to be useful in the detection of non-displaced The rate of associated meniscal tears has been found to be as high as 40% Non-operative treatment with cast immobilisation and protected weight bearing for at least 6 weeks is indicated for Type 1 TSFs The anterior horn of the medial meniscus has been found to be the most common cause of a reduction block Residual laxity, arthrofibrosis and non-union are the main complications following treatment for TSFs. Despite appropriate management, pathological laxity can be observed in up to 60% of patient following Type 3 and Type 4 TSFs Tibial spine fractures are rare bony injuries that results in knee instability. They can be associated with a concurrent meniscal injury and therefore pre-operative MRI should be obtained. They are best assessed by and managed according to the Myers and McKeever Classification. Patients with this injury are at risk of future instability despite appropriate surgical management. As such, the patient and their parents should be counselled accordingly. Tibial tubercle fractures (TTFs) typically occur in male patients approaching skeletal maturity (14–17 years) The tibial tubercle is an apophysis and acts as the attachment of the patella tendon to the proximal tibia. It develops under traction and has inferior tensile strength when compared to the patella tendon Watson-Jones classified TTFs into 3 types using lateral plain radiographs of the knee ( Whilst the aforementioned classification and modifications cover all spectrums of TTFs, they underestimate the extent of intra-articular involvement Patients typically present with pain, tenderness and significant swelling localised to the proximal tibia Pandya et al. reported a rate of associated intra-articular injury of approximately 12% It is crucial to assess patients with TTFs for compartment syndrome. Injury to the anterior tibial recurrent artery is believed to be the cause of compartment syndrome following TTFs The aim of TTF treatment is to restore extensor mechanism function. All extra-articular TTFs that can be reduced successfully with closed techniques can be managed non-operatively in a cylinder or long leg cast for a minimum of 4 weeks The literature suggests that the vast majority of TTFs can be treated successfully with ORIF techniques utilising either a cancellous or cannulated metal screw as the fixation device If treated appropriately, fracture union and return to pre-injury activity rates following TTFs is excellent Tibial tubercle fractures are rare injuries with excellent outcomes if treated appropriately. They have a high association with compartment syndrome and therefore high vigilance is required when assessing these patients on initial presentation. Advanced imaging or intra-operative visualisation of intra-articular structures is recommended to investigate for associated injuries. Residual pain owing to metalwork prominence often necessitates a secondary operation. Patients and parents should be warned of the risks of re-fracture and premature growth arrest leading to genu recurvatum. The incidence of paediatric patella fractures in the UK has been reported by Cooper et al. The patella is a sesamoid bone and it begins to ossify when the child is three years of age. Up to six small ossification centres may be present in the middle of the patella, with ossification occurring from this central point to the periphery as the child grows Forceful longitudinal stress can separate an chondro-osseous sleeve from the patella either at the proximal or distal end. Rather than a disruption of the patella tendon itself, this is due to the fact that in the paediatric skeleton there is a lack of Sharpey's fibres. Instead the cartilage directly blends with the collagen of the tendon. Therefore, a sleeve fracture can be defined as an avulsion of a small bony fragment from the distal pole of the patella along with articular cartilage, periosteum and retinaculum, which is pulled off the main body of the structure In order to minimise missing these injuries the clinician must take a detailed history and elicit the exact nature of the injury. Sleeve fractures are not a result of direct trauma to the patella but are a result of explosive eccentric contraction of the quadriceps Clinical examination may be difficult due to the level of pain and a palpable gap may be present at the site of the patella avulsion The plain radiograph ( All studies reviewed favour open reduction internal fixation as the recommended method of fixation The aim of operative fixation is to reconstruct the extensor mechanism by correcting any patella alta, restoring the normal length of the patella tendon Patella sleeve fractures are uncommon but pose an interesting challenge to the Orthopaedic surgeon with diagnosis, investigation and management. If identified and treated promptly the outcome is good but if there is delay and misdiagnosis the outcome is poor due to the risk to the extensor mechanism of the knee.            None Declared.
