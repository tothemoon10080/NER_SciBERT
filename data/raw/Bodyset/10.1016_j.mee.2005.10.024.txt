Hydrogenated amorphous silicon carbon (a-SiC:H) films were deposited by hot wire chemical vapor deposition. The evolution of microscopic properties like network bonding, disorder, density and chemical composition are studied as a function of H2 dilution. The sp2 and sp3 carbon clusters, hydrogen content and the density of the material has significant effect on the dielectric properties like the leakage current of M/a-SiC:H/〈Si〉 MIS structures made with both Cu and Al metal electrode. A higher leakage current is observed in the case of Cu electrode. These changes are important for its applicability as a low dielectric constant barrier material in microelectronic devices.With the increase of circuit density in today’s VLSI circuits the resistance and capacitance of the multilevel interconnects are increasing due to the thinner metal wires and shorter distance between the wires. Therefore, the circuit performance becomes limited by interconnect RC delay In the present paper, we report the results of our studies on the evolution of the microscopic properties of the a-SiC:H films deposited by the HWCVD technique as a function of hydrogen dilution of the source gas mixture (SiH a-SiC:H films were deposited on Si 〈1 From our FTIR and Raman spectroscopic studies The density of a-SiC:H films is calculated using the equation Porosity of the material is given by The density is plotted as a function of H We have seen that the microstructure of the HWCVD a-SiC:H films changes significantly with H
