Glucose detection plays very important roles in diagnostics and management of diabetes. The search for novel catalytic materials with appropriate architectures is the key step in the fabrication of highly sensitive glucose sensors. In this work, α-Ni(OH)2 roselike structures (Ni(OH)2-RS) assembled from nanosheet building blocks were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method through the hydrolysis of nickel chloride in the mixed solvents of water and ethanol with the assistance of polyethylene glycol (PEG). The structure and morphology of the roselike α-Ni(OH)2 were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm measurement. TEM and FE-SEM images showed that the synthesized Ni(OH)2 was roselike and the size of the leaf-shaped nanosheet was about 5nm in thickness, which leads to larger active surface areas and faster electron transfer for the detection of glucose. Compared with the bare GCE and bulk Ni(OH)2/GCE, the Ni(OH)2-RS/GCE had higher catalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose. Under the optimal conditions, the Ni(OH)2-RS/GCE offers a variety of merits, such as a wide linear response window for glucose concentrations ranging from 0.87μM to 10.53mM, short response time (3s), a lower detection limit of 0.08μM (S/N=3), as well as long term stability and repeatability.“Silent killer”, another name for diabetes mellitus, is a leading cause of death, and metabolic disorder nowadays has become a public health concern Over the past few years, considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of alternative method for the detection of glucose, such as high performance liquid chromatography method Great efforts have been put into producing non-enzymatic sensors with the aim of improving catalytic effect and stability. For example, platinum, gold and alloy have been broadly developed to detect glucose It has been shown that the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH) In our study, we proposed a facile hydrothermal route to synthesize highly ordered 3D α-Ni(OH) NiCl X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on a Rigaku D/max-TTR-III diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source ( Cyclic voltammetry and amperometric measurements were performed on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd., China). A conventional three-electrode system was used with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode.

Hence, it is critical to choose the optimal working potential for the electrochemical sensing of glucose.
