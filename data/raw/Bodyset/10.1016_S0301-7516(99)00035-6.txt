It is important to elucidate the relation between the locked cycle flotation test and the continuous flotation circuit because the locked cycled test has been traditionally the only way to experimentally simulate a continuous circuit. We analytically assessed the mass balances of the locked cycle test in a rougher–cleaner–cleaner scavenger (R–C–CS) system as a function of the iteration number of tests and provided an analytical expression of the mass balance in each separation stage. The mass of the final concentrate and flotation characteristic curves in a continuous circuit and the locked cycle test were calculated using the flotation rate constant k and flotation time T. Based on the comparison of the calculated results between the two tests, a good agreement between the locked cycle test and the continuous circuit can be obtained when the kT value for a product component with the flotation rate constant k and time T is in the range where the mass of a component does not change with kT.Traditionally, a locked cycle test, which is a small-scale repetitive batch test, has been employed to experimentally simulate a continuous circuit of grinding or other mineral separation processes ( It was reported that the locked cycle flotation tests could effectively predict the results of continuous plant circuits because of the good agreement between the locked flotation cycle test and the continuous plant circuit ( Our previous analysis ( In this paper, we try to analyze the relation between the locked cycle test and the continuous plant circuit in a rougher–cleaner–cleaner scavenger (R–C–CS) system using the analytical evaluation of the locked cycle test with the R–C–CS system.  When analyzing a locked cycle test, the following assumptions were made. (1) The flotation process in each semi-batch test is described by a first order rate equation: (2) For each component, the flotation rate constant, Considering that the mass of a new feed is equal to 1, the following material balance equations are obtained: The mass of the cleaner concentrate The mass of each component in the final concentrate at a steady state can be described by In the case of the locked cycle test, another assumption is required in addition to the previous two assumptions: (3) Each mineral component has a maximum recovery RI after infinite time. RI was originally described by In the analysis of the continuous plant circuit, the following assumptions were made: (1) Each stage consists of perfectly mixed and isolated cells with the same volume in a series. (2) The average retention time and the number of cells depend on each stage and are not consistent with the flotation time of the corresponding stage of the locked cycle tests. (3) The values of We calculated the mass of each component in the final concentrate at a steady state using the parameter listed in Flotation characteristic curves ( Based on analytically obtained mass balance equations including the flotation rate constant
