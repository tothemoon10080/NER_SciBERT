Microstructural changes in an AlMg6.8 alloy after different thermo mechanical (TMT) and sensitization treatments were investigated by electrical resistivity measurements. The electrical resistivity was most affected by the content of Mg solute atoms in the α-Al matrix, due to β-phase precipitation, while contribution of the dislocation density to the resistivity of the AlMg6.8 alloy was less pronounced. The amount and distribution of the β-phase precipitated during sensitization were found to be strongly affected by the microstructure developed under the previously applied TMTs, i.e. by the dislocation density and the primary β-phase particles in the dual (α+β) phase structure. During sensitization of the specimens with a recovered/recrystallized dual (α+β) phase structure, precipitation of randomly distributed, globular β-phase particles occurred. Sensitization of cold deformed and recrystallized single α-Al structures induced β-phase precipitation in the form of a continuous layer along the shear bands/grain boundaries.Wrought Al-Mg alloys have been considered for use in a wide variety of automotive and marine applications due to their excellent properties, such as high strength to weight ratio, good formability, corrosion resistance and weldability. It is well known This process occurs slowly during a very long time at room temperature, or in a short exposure period at slightly elevated temperatures (60–180 Understanding of the precipitation behavior in high Mg-containing Al-Mg alloys appears to be very important because of their wide range of application. The aim of this study was to follow the β-phase precipitation and variation of the concentration of Mg solute atoms in the matrix of a highly alloyed Al-6.8 The Al-Mg alloy used in this study was supplied in a fully annealed condition (O temper, YS The material was fabricated by casting and a homogenization treatment at 440 Uniaxial tensile testing was performed using a “Zwick 1484” tensile testing machine. The tensile specimens were taken in the transverse direction with respect to the rolling direction (L-T orientation), with a gauge length of 25 Samples for metallographic characterization were prepared by electrochemical polishing and etching in Barker's solution. Average grain size ( Variation in the concentration of Mg solute atoms in the matrix, due to the precipitation of the β-phase under different annealing conditions (TMTs) and during the sensitization treatment, was followed by electrical conductivity measurements. The conductivity measurements were performed using Sigmatest D2.068 equipment (operating frequency, Variations of the yield strength (YS) of the tested AlMg6.8 alloy after different TMTs are shown in The effect of sensitization treatment on the yield strength of the cold rolled and annealed samples is also shown in The variation of the yield strength with grain size for the studied AlMg6.8 alloy with a recrystallized structure and also for two commercial alloys with lower Mg contents, AA5182 (4–5% Mg, 0.2–0.5% Mn) and AA5754 (2.6–3.6% Mg, up to 0.5% Mn) are shown in Parameters of the Hall–Petch equation ( Metallographic examination of the tested AlMg6.8 alloy showed that the cold deformed structure with markedly elongated grains in the rolling direction (shown in The micrographs of the cold rolled samples after sensitization treatment clearly show β-phase precipitation along the grain boundaries and also inside the elongated grains ( Microstructural observations of the samples annealed in the temperature range from 225 A continuous network of β-phase precipitates along the grain boundaries was observed after sensitization treatment of samples with a recrystallized structure after annealing for longer times at 285 Resistivity measurements were conducted on cold rolled, annealed and sensitized specimens, in order to follow the variation of the content of Mg solute in the matrix and also to estimate the contribution of cold deformation, the dislocation density, to the electrical resistivity of the tested AlMg6.8 alloy. For solid solution hardening materials and Al alloys, the resistivity is generally defined by the following equation Since Mg is the main alloying element in Al-Mg alloys, the variation in electrical resistivity could be indirect evidence of changes in the Mg solute atoms in and out of the solid solution. Taking into account the contribution from the Mg solute level and the dislocation density, the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg alloys can be expressed by the following equation: The effects of other alloying elements, such as Mn, Si, Fe, Ni, Ti, Cu and Cr, on the resistivity of AlMg6.8 alloy was found to be negligible, since they are mainly present out of solution after annealing in the temperature range from 225 The concentration of Mg solute in/out of the solid solution can be calculated using Eq. For the fully recrystallized condition, the following equation In order to estimate the increase of electrical resistivity ( The dislocation density in the deformed, recovered and recrystallized structure of the tested AlMg6.8 alloy was calculated using Eqs. It can be seen that the highest dislocation density of 1.45 Experimental resistivity values shown in  In order to examine the effect of annealing at higher temperatures (225–450 A significant resistivity drop was observed after annealing at 225 Using the resistivity data shown in It can be seen that the lowest value of the concentration of Mg solute in the solid solution (or the highest fraction of β-phase particles) was attained after annealing at 225 The effect of sensitization treatment at 100 It is obvious that the resistivity drop was less pronounced after sensitization of the annealed samples (at temperatures between 225 Using the electrical resistivity data after sensitization treatment, the concentration of Mg solute in the solid solution was calculated by Eq. A large amount of β-phase particles was found in the cold rolled samples after sensitization and it increased from 1.0 During annealing of highly alloyed Al-Mg alloys, concurrently with recovery and recrystallization processes, a change in the concentration of Mg solute in the solid solution occurs. The variation of the amount of Mg solute in the Al-matrix of the tested AlMg6.8 alloy was followed by electrical resistivity measurement, as a very sensitive tool to detect the amount of Mg solute in/out of the solid solution Electrical resistivity values for the tested AlMg6.8 alloy clearly indicate that it increases with applied cold rolling deformation, as shown in Using the yield strength data ( In order to estimate the effect of the amount of Mg solute in Al-matrix, the contribution to the resistivity from the dislocation density and from other alloying elements was subtracted from the experimentally measured resistivity values. Thus, a resistivity drop which occurs after annealing of cold rolled specimens at 225 In accordance with resistivity variations, the highest fraction of β-phase particles (and the lowest concentration of Mg solute in solid solution) was obtained after annealing at 225 On increasing further the temperature up to 450 Concerning the yield strength level, microstructural observations and the resistivity values for the AlMg6.8 alloy, it can be concluded that the following structures were developed under primary TMTs: (i) The electrical resistivity of the cold rolled and annealed samples became lower after sensitization due to β-phase precipitation (secondary β-phase precipitates) and further decrease of the Mg solute concentration in the Al-matrix, as shown in Microstructural observations and resistivity values after sensitization showed that the distribution and the amount of the β-phase precipitates depended on the microstructure developed under the previously applied TMTs. It is supposed that the increased dislocation density in the deformed and recovered structure ( It was reported earlier Microstructure development under different TMTs and after sensitization treatment of AlMg6.8 alloy was followed through mechanical properties, optical metallography and electrical resistivity measurements. It was observed that electrical resistivity can be employed as indirect evidence of the concentration of Mg solute in the solid solution and of an increased dislocation density in the structure. The effect of the dislocation density on the electrical resistivity was less pronounced compared to that of the amount of Mg solute in the solid solution. Using metallographic observations and electrical resistivity measurements, it was found that: (i) a recovered/recrystallized dual-phase (α Microstructure evolution during sensitization treatment strongly depended on the microstructure developed under the previous TMTs. It is supposed that the presence of dislocations in the recovered structure (after annealing at 225–265 The authors are grateful to the Ministry of Science of the Republic of Serbia and IMPOL-SEVAL Aluminum Rolling Mill, Sevojno for the financial support and supplying of the material used in this investigation, respectively.
