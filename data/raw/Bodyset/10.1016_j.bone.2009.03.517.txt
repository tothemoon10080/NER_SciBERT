The degree of bone matrix mineralization plays a pivotal role in tuning stiffness, strength and toughness of bone, and is therefore an important determinant of bone quality. Once the osteoblasts have formed a new bone matrix (osteoid) its mineralization starts after a certain maturation time. During the initial phase, referred to as primary mineralization, the mineral content rapidly increases within few days, up to 70% of its final value. In the second phase, referred to as secondary mineralization, the mineral content slowly increases further, in a time scale of months to years, up to its final value. The characteristic Ca-content at the transition from fast to slow mineralization (designated as CaTurn) was obtained from bone mineralization profiles (BM-profiles) of newly forming bone packets perpendicular across the mineralization front by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI).
