The authors are grateful for the interest and contribution by the discusser who found a mistake in our paper in the International Journal of Rock Mechanics & Mining Sciences 41 (2004) 1123â€“1131. The answer to the Discussion is as follows. It is true that there is mistake related to the saw diameter in our paper. We researched the source of the error and now understand that the person who measured the performance of the circular saws in Antalya city incorrectly recorded the diameters of the circular saws. The correct diameters of the circular saws are given in Using the correct saw diameters, the multiple regression analysis was repeated and the revised equations are given below To see the difference between the previous equations and the revised equations, the plots of estimated production values against observed production values for both the previous equations and the revised equations have been compared.. As shown in
