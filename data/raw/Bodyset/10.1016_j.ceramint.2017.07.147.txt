In this paper, for the first time, we present the detailed temperature (−100 ≤ T ≤ 150°C) and frequency (1Hz ≤ f ≤ 1MHz) dependent dielectric and ac impedance studies of the single phase, T′-type, Sm2CuO4 (SCO) ceramics synthesized in nanocrystalline (particle size (

Being non-ferroelectric and centro-symmetric, display of CDC in this SCO ceramics is extraordinary. Using impedance spectroscopy, (IS) the origin of such extraordinary values were investigated; IS study revealed electrical heterogeneity of SCO samples with semiconducting grains and resistive grain boundaries. Arrhenius plots also suggested this phenomenon, with grain boundaries showing NTCR (akin to insulators) and grains showing PTCR (akin to metals/semi-metals) behavior for the electrical conductivity. This heterogeneity in electrical microstructure could give rise to internal barrier layer capacitance (IBLC) effect, ultimately resulting in CDC (>104), in these SCO ceramics.Materials exhibiting large dielectric constant have been used widely for applications where miniaturization of devices is important Recently, Tʹ-type cuprates of Ln In this paper, we present a new member of Tʹ-type cuprate, Sm Sm  These phase formed powders of SCO synthesized conventionally and Pechini process were ball milled (~ 12  The occurrence of almost similar grain sizes in SCO, obtained by two different processing techniques, could be useful in investigating the origin of giant dielectric response in this non-ferroelectric (NFE) material. For, the dielectric response in NFE materials is known to be sensitive to the grain sizes, and depends heavily on the grain (area) and grain boundary dimensions (thickness). In our study, we anticipate similar dielectric behavior from the SCO samples prepared by two different methods, as the grain sizes are almost similar. This will be discusses in the later section. Adding to the results of phase purity confirmation by powder x-ray diffraction method, the EDX analysis ( In lanthanide cuprates, at high sintering temperatures (≥ 1000 The temperature dependent dielectric response of SCO ceramics synthesized by (a) conventional and (b) Pechini process is compared in Also, as SCO in nanocrystalline form produced submicron sized grains compared to 5–10 Thus, in view of better stoichiometry (perhaps, reduced defects) and submicron sized microstructure and with almost similar dielectric responses/trend, for further investigations on electrical properties of Sm For the wet-chemical “Pechini” processed SCO sample, the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity (ε′), imaginary part of dielectric constant (ε′′), dielectric dissipation (tan δ), and ac conductivity (σ The colossal permittivity obtain here, could be due to intrinsic dipolar effect, surface charge effect/space charge effect. However, being non-ferroelectric, the colossal value of ε′ originating entirely due to intrinsic effect especially due to dipolar effect seems unlikely and possibility of extrinsic effects (surface electrode, Maxwell-Wagner Here, we have tried to explore the possibility of internal barrier layer capacitance (IBLC) effect, an extrinsic effect, to be operative in Sm  From frequency dependent ac conductivity (σ Complex specific impedance plots (−Z′′ versus Z′) are made (see Finer, submicron grain size, reduced impurity/defects have proven beneficial in improving the dielectric constant in Pechini processed Sm The Authors would like to thank Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility (SAIF) and Dr. Rajan Singh of I.I.T.
