Traumatic hand injuries are extremely common: they represent approximately 20% of all emergency department visits and about 10% of all fractures. Hand injuries result from work or sport-related activities, and a wide variety of mechanisms can be encountered, such as forced flexion or extension, axial compression, or crush.
               Carpal bones apart, fractures of the hand involve metacarpus and phalanges in about 35% and 65%, respectively. The fracture of the shaft of the fifth metacarpal (boxer fracture) is the most common fracture and accounts itself for about 10% of all hand fractures.
               Radiographs are usually sufficient to guide management, but CT can be needed for presurgical management of complex carpometacarpal injury. MR or ultrasound are indicated in the cases of sprains of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb (gamekeeper thumb) or avulsions of extensor or flexor tendons.Introduction Anatomy Bones Ligaments Muscles and tendons Imaging Radiographs CT MRI and ultrasound Distal phalanx injuries Fractures Avulsions Proximal and middle phalanx injuries Fractures Volar plate avulsion Boutonniere deformity Interphalangeal dislocation Pulley injuries Metacarpal injuries Fractures Metacarpophalangeal joint dislocations (thumb excepted) Carpometacarpal joint fracture-dislocations Thumb metacarpal fractures Shaft fractures Base fractures: Bennett’s and Rolando fracture Thumb metacarpophalangeal dislocation (“gamekeeper’s thumb” or “skier’s thumb”) References Traumatic hand injuries, especially fractures of the metacarpals and phalanges, are extremely common. They represent approximately 20% of all emergency department visits and about 10% of all fractures [ The majority of hand fractures are stable from a functional point of view, but up to 5% of them require surgical fixation [ The hand is made of five metacarpals and 14 phalanges ( The metacarpal heads form the knuckles distally, and the metacarpal bases articulate proximally with the distal carpal row. The base of the second phalanx (P2) is also called the pilon, that can be involved in articular fractures. The head of the distal phalanx (P3) forms the tuft that supports the nailbeds Vascular channels (nutrient foramen) are common pitfalls for fracture as they appear as cortical linear lucency. Their unique path allows their recognition: vessels enter the shaft externally and proximally and run obliquely to enter the medullary space internally and distally Carpometacarpal (CMCJ), metacarpophalangeal (MCPJ), proximal interphalangeal (PIPJ) and distal interphalangeal (DIPJ) joints are synovial joints with a capsule and a synovial lining The base of the second to fifth metacarpals are firmly linked to the adjacent carpal bones and to each other by a strong ligamentous network, limiting CMCJ mobility In contrast, the base of the first metacarpal (thumb) connects to the trapezium through a saddle-like joint, allowing a greater range of motion [ At the level of MCPJ, PIPJ and DIPJ, collateral ligaments unite the lateral and medial aspect of the metacarpals and phalanges to the apposed phalanges The volar stability is ensured by the volar plate, a dense fibrocartilage firmly attached to the volar base of the phalanges, but only loosely fixed proximally [ The extensor mechanism of the digits consists of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), extensor indicis proprius (EIP) and extensor digiti minimi (EDM). At the level of P1, the extensor tendon divides in three slips [ a central slip that insert on the dorsal base of P2 two lateral slips that run along the phalanx to insert on the dorsal base of P3, after receiving extension from lumbrical and interosseous muscles. The flexor mechanism is composed by [ the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) that inserts on the volar base of P2 the flexor digitorum profondus (FDP) that runs deep to the FDS, perforates it at the level of the PIPJ and inserts on the volar base of P3 The courses of the tendons are kept parallel to the phalanges by the pulleys, that are bands of fibrous tissue that enfold the tendons sheath. The initial radiographic examination of the traumatic hand includes at least three views: PA, lateral and 45° pronation oblique [ Due to its anatomical configuration, specific views exist for the thumb. The direct PA view allows proper analysis of phalanges and distal metacarpals [ CT is only rarely needed in hand trauma. It’s generally ordered for the preoperative planning of injuries such as metacarpal articular fractures, P2 base fractures or CMC dislocations MRI and ultrasound are generally ordered besides radiographs to evaluate tendon and ligament injuries, notably of the MCPJ of the thumb [ Fractures of the distal phalanx are the most common hand fractures. The mechanisms of injury are crush injuries or sudden axial loads (impact in ball sports) In children, Seymour fractures are displaced P3 physeal fracture with nearly always a transverse laceration of the nail matrix Mallet finger is a deformation in which the DIDJ is passively flexed As the extensor mechanism is unbalanced, the PIPJ may become hyperextended, realizing the “swan-neck” deformity, which is the reverse of the boutonnière deformity (see section below) “Jersey finger” refers to an avulsion injury of the FDP from its insertion at the base of P3 A classification (from Leddy and Packer) of jersey finger injuries exists, based on the level of tendon retraction and the presence of fracture, with types I and II being purely ligamentous injury (without radiographic evidence) while types III, IV and V refer to P3 bony avulsion/comminution P1 and P2 fractures are classified as articular fractures of the base, articular fractures of the head or extraarticular fractures of the shaft ( Injuries of the volar base of P2 are of particular interest due to their specific management and their functional consequences if inappropriately treated (the PIPJ makes up to 40% of the total finger flexion) ( The volar plate is a fibrocartilagenous structure lying between the flexor tendons and the PIPJ capsule, that inserts distally on the volar base of P2 A sudden P2 hyperextension can result in a partial or complete volar plate rupture with a possible avulsion fracture, most commonly of the volar base of the middle phalanx ( Boutonniere deformity results from a flexion of the PIPJ and an extension of the DIPJ Interphalangeal dislocations are very common hand injuries, and involve mostly the PIPJ DIPJ dislocations are less common than PIPJ ones and are usually associated with more severe/soft tissue injuries ( Pulleys ensure the apposition of the tendons relative to the phalanges, allowing their proper motion on respective digit. If a pulley is torn, the tendon won’t flex the finger, but instead will bowstring. A gap is then present between the tendon and adjacent phalanges. Radiographs are usually useless for the diagnosis of pulley injuries, they can sometimes reveal palmar soft tissue swelling Metacarpal fractures represent up to 30% of hand fractures The fracture of the metacarpal neck is also known as the “boxer’s fracture” as it results from an axial blow through the knuckle (flexed MCPJ) ( Fractures of the metacarpal shaft can be transverse (produced by axial loading or direct blow), oblique/spiral (usually resulting from torsional forces with resulting rotational malalignment) or comminuted (crush) ( Isolated fractures of metacarpal base are uncommon, such fractures occurring generally in the setting of a CMCJ dislocation ( MCPJ dislocations of the second to fifth digits are relatively uncommon injuries due to the shape, the reinforcing ligaments and volar plates and the protected situation of those joints in the hand Traumatic CMCJ fracture-dislocations are rare (less than 1% of hand and wrist injuries) and high-energy injuries, seen in motorcyclists and boxers [ CMCJ dislocations can be easily missed on radiographs due to overlapping of bones. Features suggestive of CMCJ dislocations that have to be looked for are ( loss of normal CMCJ space overriding of metacarpal bases over carpal bones CMC step-off on lateral view Nevertheless, this configuration can be encountered in normal conditions when the PA view is done with a partially flexed hand, leading to a superposition of the carpus with the metacarpus ( The axis of the second to fifth metacarpals should converge to an unique point approximatively at the level of the distal radius. In the case of a CMC dislocation, the axes are not converging anymore ( Most of CMCJ dislocations are dorsal, the volar ones being less common Sometimes, the dislocation is also seen in the frontal plane, with an intermetacarpal diastasis ( Fracture-dislocations of the fifth CMCJ are considered as “mirrored” Bennett fractures, in an analogy with thumb injuries, with a proximal pulling of the metacarpal by the EMD ( Extraarticular fractures of the shaft of the thumb metacarpal typically occur at the level of the diaphyseal/metaphyseal junction Bennett’s fractures are fractures of the base of the thumb metacarpal that separates an unique volar-ulnar bony fragment Rolando’s fractures refer to any comminuted articular fracture of the base of the thumb metacarpal ( The MCPJ of the thumb has little intrinsic stability and relies mostly on the volar plate and ligaments action [ The mechanism of UCL injury is a forced thumb abduction, caused by a fall with a reception on the tip of the thumb (“skier’s thumb”) or by a ball reception on the ulnar aspect of the P2 (“gamekeeper’s thumb”) ( The ligament can tear in its mid-substance or avulse a bone fragment, generally at the level of the ulnar base of P1 ( Prompt detection of UCL tear is mandatory to avoid long term functional thumb disability. The diagnosis is generally made on historical and clinical findings Radiographs can show [ a normal MCPJ, in the vast majority of the cases a bone avulsion of the lateral aspect of the P1 or, less commonly, of the metacarpal ( a static instability with a P1 radial deviation at rest, exceptionally seen ( a complete dislocation, usually dorsal ( Comparative stress radiographs can be realized a few weeks after the trauma Direct visualization of the injured UCL requires sectional imaging (ultrasound or MRI) Injuries of the lateral collateral are much uncommon, and usually revealed by a small bony fragment avulsed on the radial aspect of the base of P2 (
