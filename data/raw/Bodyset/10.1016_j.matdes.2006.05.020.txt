In this work aluminum–alumina composite material was first produced by mechanical alloying method and then physical and mechanical properties of the products were investigated. For this purpose the aluminum and alumina powders were charged in horizontal ball mill and milled at different times. In order to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of the processed powders, powder metallurgy samples were produced by single action compaction of the powders. The compacted green samples were sintered by an inert atmosphere furnace. Mechanical tests such as compression, microhardness, wear resistance besides physical tests such as dimensional stability and electrical resistivity were done on the milled composites. The results show that mechanical and physical properties of the milled aluminum base composites depend strongly on milling time so that increasing milling time causes to change the values of the mentioned properties. But in steady-state stage increasing milling time has not significant effect on the properties.Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are under attention for many applications in aerospace, defense, and automobile industries. These materials have been considered for using in automobile brake rotors and various components in internal combustion engines because of its high strength/weight ratio The most commonly used types of Al MMCs are Al–graphite, Al–SiC and Al–Al Nowadays, the use of Al–Al In fact, there are several fabrication techniques available to manufacture Al–Al It has been reported in our earlier works To produce Al–Al Horizontal ball mill with 135 To obtain hardness of milled powders microhardness test was performed. Since the main goal of this test was to understand the role of both work hardening and alumina particles on microhardness, thus the milled powders at different times were tested before sintering process to avoid omitting plastic deformation effect. To find out the role of milling time on compression properties of Al–5 For doing this test firstly some series of mixed Al–5 To obtain wear resistance of milled Al–5 The samples weighted before testing. The samples placed on the rotary grinding paper with grid size 600. The applied load 5 Since the performance of grinding paper decreases gradually the paper changed after 2 The sample weight was measured at different abrasion times, i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 Dilatometry is one of the oldest methods for measuring the volume change due to phase transformation and even temperature changes. To find out the role of milling time on thermal expansion of Al–5 To understand the difference between electrical resistivity of milled and un-milled Al/5         The results of the study of physical and mechanical properties of the Al–5 Increasing milling time causes a raise in micro hardness of powders. Weight loss depends strongly on milling time. The conventional composite not only has lower hardness than that of milled composite but also its hardness drop is significant due to increasing temperature. Unlike strength, the strain at break decreases as milling time increases. The dimensional stability of milled composite with respect to temperature is better than that of un-milled composite. The magnitude of specific electrical resistivity of milled Al/Al
