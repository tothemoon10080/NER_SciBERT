Designs of different types of jaw crushers such as Blake, Dodge with single and double toggles used for initial comminution of minerals, as received from mines, are described in detail. The method of calculating operating variables such as the critical speed, toggle frequency and throw and power consumptions are explained and illustrated with practical examples with solutions. Further, inter-related mathematical relations between variables such as critical speed, toggle throw, frequencies of operation and crusher power and throughput, as derived by different workers, are indicated.The first stage of size reduction of hard and large lumps of run-of-mine (ROM) ore is to crush and reduce their size. Softer ores, such as placer deposits of tin, gold, mineral sands, etc., do not require such a treatment. Large-scale crushing operations are generally performed by mechanically operated equipment such as jaw crushers, gyratory crusher and roll crushers. For very large ore pieces that are too big for receiving hoppers of mechanically driven crushers, percussion rock breakers or similar tools are used to break them down to size. The mechanism of crushing is either by applying impact force, pressure or a combination of both. The jaw crusher is primarily a compression crusher, while the others operate primarily by the application of impact. Jaw crushers are designed to impart an impact on a rock particle placed between a fixed and a moving plate (jaw). The faces of the plates are made of hardened steel. Both plates could be flat or the fixed plate flat and the moving plate convex. The surfaces of both plates could be plain or corrugated. The moving plate applies the force of impact on the particles held against the stationary plate. Both plates are bolted onto a heavy block. The moving plate is pivoted at the top end (Blake crusher) or at the bottom end (Dodge-type crusher) and connected to an eccentric shaft. In universal crushers the plates are pivoted in the middle so that both the top and the bottom ends can move. The Blake crushers are single or double toggle drives. The function of the toggle(s) is to move the pivoted jaw. The retrieving action of the jaw from its furthest end of travel is by springs for small crushers or by a pitman for larger crushers. As the reciprocating action removes the moving jaw away from the fixed jaw the broken rock particles slip down, but are again caught at the next movement of the swinging jaw and crushed. This process is repeated until the particle sizes are smaller than the smallest opening between the crusher plates at the bottom of the crusher (the closed set). For a smooth reciprocating action of the moving jaws, heavy flywheels are used in both types of crushers.   The factors of importance in designing the size of primary crushers, such as a jaw crusher, are: These dimensions vary as individual manufacturers have their own specifications and their catalogues are a good guide to the geometry and design of individual makes. The size of a jaw crusher is usually described by the gape and the width, expressed as gape × width. The common crusher types, sizes and their performance are summarised in For sizing a crusher and ancillaries for open circuit operations, Equations The largest particle size is generally ascertained by the blast pattern in the pit or the size of shovels and dump-cars used to transport the ore from the mines. Thus, as a general rule, the size of the gape would be 1.1 times the largest size of the lump ores that are to be charged for crushing. These relations are, in turn, helpful to size the opening of the scalping screens that are placed in the ore stream before the crusher. The purpose of scalping screens, also called grizzly screens, is to reject lumps of ore greater than the size of the gape. Placement of scalping screens results in smooth and uninterrupted operation of the circuit and also prevents any damage to the crusher by extra large lumps. Primary jaw crushers typically operate in open circuit under dry conditions. Depending on the size reduction required, the primary jaw crushers are followed by secondary and tertiary crushing. The last crusher in the line of operation operates in a closed circuit. That is, the crushed product is screened and the oversize is returned to the crusher for further size reduction, while the undersize is accepted as the product. Flow sheets showing two such set-ups are shown in Jaw crushers are installed underground in mines as well as on the surface. When used underground, jaw crushers are commonly used in open circuit. This is followed by further size reduction in crushers located on the surface. When the run of mine product is conveyed directly from the mine to the crusher, the feed to the primary crusher passes under a magnet to remove tramp steel collected during the mining operation. A grizzly screen is placed between the magnet and the receiving hopper of the crusher to scalp (remove) boulders larger than the size of the gape. Some mines deliver product direct to storage bins or stockpiles, which then feed the crushers mechanically by apron feeders, Ross feeders or similar devices to regulate the feed rate to the crusher. Alternately haulage trucks, front-end loaders, bottom discharge railroad cars or tipping wagons are used. In such cases, the feed rate to the crusher is intermittent which is a situation generally avoided. In such cases of intermittent feed, storage areas are installed and the feed rate is regulated by bulldozers, front loaders or bin or stockpile hoppers and feeders. It is necessary that the feed to jaw crushers be carefully designed to balance with the throughput rate of the crusher. When the feed rate is regulated to keep the receiving hopper of the crusher full at all times so that the volume rate of rock entering any point in the crusher is greater than the rate of rock leaving, it is referred to as choke feeding. During choke feeding the crushing action takes place between the jaw plates and particles, as well as by inter-particle compression. Choke feeding necessarily produces more fines and requires careful feed control. For mineral liberation, choked feeding is desirable. When installed above ground, the object of the crushing circuit is to crush the ore to achieve the required size for downstream use. In some industries, for example, iron ore or coal, where a specific product size is required (iron ore –30 + 6 mm), a careful choice of jaw settings The ore or rock is fed to the crusher where the jaws are furtherest apart, i.e., at the maximum opening or gape. When the jaws come together the ore is crushed into smaller sizes and slip down the cavity. In the return stroke, further reduction of size is experienced and the ore moves down further. The process is repeated till particles having size less than the bottom opening or set pass through as product. The rule of thumb applicable for operating a jaw crusher with respect to its design characteristics can be summarised as follows: In practice, the operator has to decide on the spacing of the set at the discharge end. This setting has to include the maximum and the minimum positions that the bottom has to open during the oscillation of the bottom end of the jaws. The manufacturer of jaw crushers provides all the controls to adjust these settings. The actual distances are best measured by taking a soft metal, such as lead or a ball of aluminium foil, and by squeezing it between the jaws at the desired width forming a kind of template. This piece of lead metal is used to check the change of setting during operation. During the operation of a crusher the bulk density of the material increases and the particle size decreases. With time, wear on the plate surfaces develops resulting in a change to the crusher surface profile. This could alter the throughput and size of the crusher product. The operation of jaw crushers was best described mathematically by Whiten The values of  For a single feed, The capacity of jaw crushers is a measure of the mass or volume of crushed material produced in unit time of operation. The capacity is primarily a function of: crusher design characteristics such as width and depth of the crushing chamber, open and closed side settings, options on feeding method, e.g., intermittent feeding (manual or direct by haulage trucks) and continuous by conveyor belt, operating characteristics such as the length of stroke, the number of strokes per minute, the nip angle. Mathematically, the capacity can be expressed by the general formula        θ= jaw angle The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession. The capacity of a jaw crusher per unit time will therefore depend on the time taken for a particle to be crushed and dropped through each successive wedge until they are discharged through the bottom. The frequency of opening and closing of the jaws, therefore, exerts a significant action on capacity. Following the above concepts, several workers, such as Hersam Hersam’s empirical expression given in Equation ρ  Although it is not truly applicable to hard rocks, for soft rocks it is reasonably acceptable Rose and English The distance, Then for a fragmented particle to fall a distance It follows that Rose and English ν= frequency (cycle/min)     Equation The relationship between the frequency of operation and capacity of the jaw crusher can be seen in  At this critical frequency the maximum capacity is given by It should be noted that while considering the volume rates, no consideration was made to the change of bulk density of the material or the fractional voidage. However, during the crushing operation the bulk density of the ore changes as it passes down the crusher. The extent of the change depends on the size distribution of the feed, the break-down characteristics which could be different for hard, brittle and friable ores, the packing characteristics, the initial density of the ore, surface characteristics of the particles. Rose and English defined the packing characteristics,   The capacity is then dependant on some function which may be written as ƒ(β). Equations The bulk density of the packing will depend on the particle size distribution. The relation between As the closed set size must be less than the feed size, ƒ(β) may be taken as equal to 1 for all practical purposes. The maximum capacity of production can be theoretically achieved at the critical speed of oscillation of the moving jaw. The method of determining the critical speed and maximum capacity is described in Section 4.2.3 For actual crusher speeds, the actual crusher capacity is given by The capacity of a jaw crusher is given by the amount of crushed material passing the discharge opening per unit time. This is dependent on the area of the discharge opening, the properties of the rock, moisture, crusher throw, speed, nip angle, method of feeding and the amount of size reduction. In order to calculate the capacity of crushers, Taggart The 80% passing size is chosen as data have shown that this is a convenient point where the distorting effect of coarse slabby material on the shape of the size distribution has been removed. Hersam The The comparative reduction tonne is a standard for comparison and applies for the crushing conditions of uniform full capacity feeding of dry thick bedded medium-hard limestone where To evaluate The moisture factor, The feed factor for continuous manual feeding, for continuous mechanical feeding, Taggart used the comparative reduction ton (tonne) to estimate the size of the Blake-type crusher required for a given duty and its productivity. The procedure is summarised below. The reduction ratio of the operation is estimated from screen analysis of the feed and product. Where a screen analysis is not available, a rough estimate can be obtained if the relation between the cumulative mass percent passing (or retained) for different size fractions is assumed to be linear (  That is, the size of ore passing 80% of unscalped ore equals the size of the same cumulative percent of scalped ore plus 0.2 times the aperture of the scalping screen, The 80% passing size of the feed may be approximated by  = the ratio of the intermediate to minimum particle dimension (ranges from ∼1.7 for cubic shapes to ∼3.3 for slabby rock) Equation The method is illustrated by Run of mine granite is passed through a grizzly (45.7 cm) prior to crushing. The ore is to be broken down in a jaw crusher to pass through a 11.5 cm screen. The undersize is scalped before feeding to the jaw crusher. Assuming the maximum feed rate is maintained at 30 t/h and the shapes of feed and product are the same and the crusher set is 10 cm, estimate the size of jaw crusher required and the production rate. The first exercise is to determine According to the data, the undersized would be = (11.5/45.7) × 100 = 24.2% Hence, the actual amount to be crushed would be (100 – 24.2) × 30 = 22.74 t/h = Determine From Thus, the value for Since adequate screen analysis data are not available, we shall use In this case: Say Again Substituting values, assuming cubic-shaped particles where the shape factor = 1.7, we have Since the comparative reduction capacity of the jaw crusher is given, the crusher dimensions may now be determined. For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80–85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm. From the data given by Taggart ( To choose the appropriate jaw crusher therefore, the nearest size commercially available crusher will be used to meet the performance required. To determine the capacity of jaw and gyratory crushers, Broman This area is defined by the conditions at the discharge end. Broman neglected the Extending the concept to the entire chamber, Broman deduced the capacity of the crusher, ν= speed (rpm)  In Equation Michaelson Taggart All dimensions are in metres. For a set of crusher sizes and set openings, the calculations obtained from the work of Rose and English and others can be compared with data from equipment manufacturers. It can be seen that Broman’s method yields a higher capacity than the other methods and deviates considerably from the nominal operating capacity. The theoretical analysis by Horsham To estimate the critical speed of operation, it is required to determine the time and distance travelled at the speed of operation of the toggle corresponding to the maximum production rate. Referring to To determine this distance assume the particles travelled freely due to gravity during the time taken for the toggle to make half a cycle between successive compactions. Let us assume it travels through a distance Hence From the laws of dynamics, the distance Also, the time Hence, Equating Equations Replacing According to Equation Equation At a constant reduction ratio, an increase in throw decreases the critical speed. With an increase in reduction ratio, the crusher could be run at higher speeds.  The critical speed calculated by use of Equation A number of workers The expression for computing the power consumption ( Also, to establish the Having estimated   Equations Simplifying Equation For operating a jaw crusher it is necessary to know the maximum power required consistently with the reduction ratio and the gape and closed side settings. The maximum power drawn in a system will occur at the critical speed. Thus for maximum power, Q in Equation The largest size of ore pieces mined measured 560 mm (average) and the smallest sizes averaged 160 mm. The density of the ore was 2.8 t/m the maximum operating capacity of the crusher, the optimum speed at which it should be operated. Assume that the largest size of ore = 0.9 × gape. That is 0.560 = 0.9 × Gape. Hence Gape = 0.560/0.9 = 0.62 m. Length of throw, Width: (assume) = 1.3 × Gape = 1.3 × 0.62 = 0.81. Set: by definition Gape/Set = reduction ratio, and assuming the set = Hence Determine ƒ( From Equation Also from Equation Neglecting Max capacity, Optimum speed: Lynch  Lynch correlated this size parameter with the current draw This expression has been applied with success. Application of this expression in practice is illustrated by The size distribution of an ore to be crushed in a closed circuit jaw crusher was logged as the following table: If the crusher set is 25.4 mm, estimate the power required to crush the ore. For a single set of feed and product size distributions, the values of For interval 2: Similarly, for the other intervals: From Equation Hence by substituting in Equation Assuming the voltage = 415 V, power consumption = 15.1 × 415 = 6.3 kW The models for determining the power required for operating jaw crushers have mostly been derived using Bond’s work index. While these gave satisfactory estimations of power, it must be remembered that Bond’s expression was derived using a tumbling mill where the forces of comminution are not quite the same as that in jaw crushers. Andersen et al. Morrell et al. If the observed power actually drawn by the crusher under load was Equation The concept of this method has been tested for cone and gyratory crushers and found to be satisfactory with values of  Air-dried limestone was crushed continuously in a laboratory single-toggle Blake jaw crusher designed to provide a throw of 228 mm.

The gape was 813 mm and the width of hopper 1067 mm. 90% of the ore commenced crushing 200 mm from the bottom of the crusher. The Bond index was estimated as 15 kWh/t. Assuming that the density of the limestone was 2.6 t/m the optimum RPM of the toggle, the maximum annual capacity of crusher with 99% availability, power consumption at the optimum speed. A single toggle Blake jaw crusher with 22.8 cm × 47.7 cm receiving hopper crushed gold ore at the rate of 85 t/h with closed setting at 2.54 cm and maximum opening of 3.8 cm. The work index of the ore was 13.5 kWh/t. Assuming the SG of the ore was 5.4, calculate optimum frequency of the toggle cycle, maximum frequency of the toggle cycle, the power required.

The mined material had a top size of 40 × 100 cm after screening through a grizzly. The kiln accepted top size of 10 cm. A single toggle Blake jaw crusher was available for crushing. Assume the shape factor of the feed and the product were the same. Determine: the rate of the toggle movement that would meet the target production, if the toggle rate was reduced by 25% indicate the production rate of lime. A jaw crusher was used to crush a chert ore. The top size of the ore was 25 cm and the moisture content was less than 3%. It was required to produce a product 100% of which would be less than 4 cm.

It was charged continuously by a conveyor belt to keep a charge level constant at 46 cm from the bottom of the jaws. A reduction ratio of 7.5 was desired. If the maximum opening between the jaws at the discharge end was fixed at 20 cm for a material of density 2.8, compute the angle between the crusher faces (assume flat), operating speed and critical speed of operation, the rate of crushing when the angle between plates is increased by 2°.
