Water contaminated with dyes presents serious environmental problems. An important quantity of dyes is released as industrial waste in nature. As part of the recovery and the regeneration of these complexes, the extraction of a cationic dye Acid Yellow 99 has been the subject of this work. To removal dyes from industrial wastewater, the technique of extraction by emulsion liquid membrane could provide an industrial success. The membrane used in this study consisted of SPAN80 as emulsifier and aliquat 336 as extractant. The stability of the emulsified liquid membrane has a very important role in the extraction. A study of the effects of different components of the membrane is necessary. The process parameters were studied using a statistical method of experimental Plackett-Burman design, This method allows us to study the effects of different factors simultaneously and determines which factors are most important parameters. The modeling was done by a mathematical model representing the extraction yield according to various factors. The most significant factors on the elimination of the acid yellow99 by the emulsion liquid membrane were then studied.
