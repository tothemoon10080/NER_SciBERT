Introduction
                  Fracture-dislocations of the tarso-metatarsal joint are a relatively rare injury, but their long-term consequences can be devastating for the patient. The aim of this study is to analyze the results obtained by surgical treatment.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The authors reviewed 26 patients between 1995 and 2006. Fractures were classified according to the Myerson & Hardcastle classification. All patients were treated by emergency surgery by means of either screws or K-wires. The AOFAS functional scale was used to assess results in the midfoot; patient satisfaction was also evaluated.
               
                  Results
                  After a mean 5-year follow-up, the mean score on the AOFAS scale was 85.38 points, with a high level of satisfaction in nearly all patients. Results obtained with screw fixation were slightly better than those with K-wires.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Like most authors, we believe that the best results are to be obtained by the immediate reduction and fixation of the injury. We rule out nonoperative treatment and favor an ORIF procedure with screws provided that the condition of the soft tissues allows it.
