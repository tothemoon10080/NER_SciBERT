Mechanical alloying was utilized to produce Cu80Fe20/CNT nano-composite powder. The effects of CNT addition on solid solubility of Fe in Cu, morphology, magnetic, and electrical properties of the products were evaluated using X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer, and four point probe technique, respectively. It was found that solid solubility of Fe in Cu increased to 20wt.% in a sample milled for 15h, but CNTs impeded the solid solubility extension in Cu80Fe20/CNT nano-composites. CNTs were distributed evenly in metal matrix after 15h mechanical alloying and final products were agglomerates consisting of nano-particles. Analysis of magnetic hysteresis loops showed that the magnetic properties of nano-composite samples were altered as a function of CNT addition. Saturation magnetization and coercivity of composite samples increased with increasing CNT content probably due to the presence of non-dissolved Fe in nano-composites and exchange coupling phenomenon, respectively. Electrical resistivity of nano-composites also increased with increasing CNT concentration.Carbon nano-tube (CNT) reinforced metal matrix nano-composites have been subjected to intensive studies in recent years Commercially pure Fe powder (99%, < X-ray diffraction patterns of 15 Mean crystallite size and lattice parameter change as a function of CNT concentration for Cu SEM images of 15 Hysteresis loops of samples are shown in A complete solid solution of nano-crystalline Cu Mechanical alloying products were micron-sized agglomerates consisting of nano-particles. Agglomerates size decreased dramatically when CNT content increased to 10 Coercivity and magnetization of composite samples increased on increasing CNT content probably due to the presence of non-dissolved Fe in nano-composites and exchange coupling phenomenon, respectively. Electrical resistivity of nano-composites also increased with increasing CNT concentration. The financial supports of this work by the
