X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) is a severe disorder of phosphate homeostasis and skeletal mineralization caused by mutations of PHEX, encoding a bone-specific endopeptidase. Phex-deficient Hyp mice have been extensively studied to understand the molecular bases of XLHR, and here it was found that Fgf23, encoding a major phosphaturic hormone, was transcriptionally activated in bone-forming osteoblasts. We and others could additionally show that Col10a1 expression is increased in Hyp osteoblasts and bones, thereby raising the possibility that ectopic production of type X collagen could contribute to the impaired mineralization of the Hyp bone matrix. Here we show that an additional deficiency of the Col10a1 gene does not overtly affect the skeletal phenotype of Hyp mice. More specifically, Col10a1-deficient Hyp mice displayed severe disturbances of skeletal growth, bone mass acquisition and bone matrix mineralization, and they were essentially indistinguishable from Hyp littermates. This was confirmed by non-decalcified histology and bone-specific histomorphometry quantifying all relevant parameters of growth plate maturation, trabecular bone architecture and osteoid accumulation. Taken together, our results show that increased Col10a1 expression in Phex-deficient osteoblasts is not a major cause of the XLHR phenotype, which was an important issue to address based on the previous findings.Phosphate homeostasis is tightly linked to skeletal mineralization, not only because low serum phosphate concentrations (hypophosphatemia) can result in decreased bone matrix mineralization (osteomalacia), but also because the most critical regulators of renal phosphate handling are expressed in bone The most common form of inherited hypophosphatemic rickets, with an incidence of 1 in 20,000 newborns, is XLHR, where the underlying genetic defect was identified in 1995 In this regard it is important to state that two studies have been performed to analyze the impact of Phex-deficiency on gene expression in an unbiased approach. First, RNA was isolated from long bones of wildtype and  Immunohistochemistry was performed on decalcified and paraffin-embedded tibia sections from wildtype and After their initial analysis by contact X-ray (Faxitron X-ray Corp.), the vertebral bodies L2 to L5 and one tibia from each animal were dehydrated and embedded non-decalcified into methylmetacrylate for sectioning. A fixed-blade rotation microtome was used to cut 4 All data are presented as means We first performed immunohistochemistry to address the question, if type X collagen is detectable in the bone matrix of Phex-deficient Regardless of these initial findings we next addressed the question, whether a moderate ectopic production of type X collagen by We next analyzed the bone phenotypes of The most important analysis related to our initial question was however a quantification of osteoid parameters in the four groups of mice, since the primary bone defect of Based on previously performed genome-wide expression analyses by us and by others, we hypothesized that increased Based on these arguments it was highly important to address the role of In summary, our study provides a negative result and a falsification of our initial hypothesis. Nevertheless, given the striking overlap of two unbiased gene expression studies with respect to This work was supported by the German
