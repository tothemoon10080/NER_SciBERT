The control goals for a froth flotation cell are to maintain a stable pulp level and maximise the separation between valuable minerals to the concentrate and gangue to the tailings. Only a limited set of manipulated variables are available to achieve a target concentrate grade and tailings grade for a specific pulp level. The froth flotation cell can be represented by a non-linear phenomenological state-space model. The states of the model are the concentration of minerals in the froth and the pulp, and the volume of liquid in the froth and pulp. A state controllability analysis of the model indicates that the states are controllable using air flow-rate, tailings flow-rate, and feed-rate as manipulated variables. Therefore, given these three manipulated variables, a controller should be able to maximise the separation between minerals in the concentrate and tailings, while maintaining a pulp level within acceptable bounds.
