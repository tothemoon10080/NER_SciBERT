Three U-free matrices were compared with the UO2 matrix. Mixed with minor actinides (MA) in targets, they were irradiated in the ADS and the SFR. The study focuses on the feasibility of target reprocessing by hydrometallurgy: dissolution, separation by extraction of U, Pu, Np, Am and Cm, followed by the concentration and vitrification of fission products. It was shown that UO2-MA-bearing targets could be reprocessed without major difficulty, whereas among the inert matrix targets, only MgO-MA-bearing target industrial reprocessing could be possible today. There would, however, be a significant production of waste.
