Global warming mitigation is an urgent issue all over the world and the mineralization for CO2 sequestration is one of the best methods to permanently store CO2 gas. The current work has developed a quantified mineralization formula through the systematic investigation of the kinetics of mineralization of a dunite containing high-grade olivine under the chemical reaction control. The effect of the most important CO2 partial pressure, addition of sodium bicarbonate, specific surface area of the olivine, addition of sodium chloride and reaction temperature can be quantified to the 1.6th, 0.8th, 0.7th, 0.34th power and 47.97 kJ/mol activation energy respectively with a relative error less than ±5%. When there was high addition of sodium bicarbonate, the effect of sodium chloride was not significant. Once the addition of sodium bicarbonate and the CO2 partial pressure were high enough, the mineralization was always controlled by dissolution of olivine. The following quantified mineralization formula has been developed. α = (1 − (1 − k0 × [S]0.7 × [PCO2]1.6 × [NaHCO3]0.8 × e(−Ea×1000/RT) × t)3) × 100%, where

                      is the correction factor, related to the mineralization capability of the material and others. The developed formula and the transformations can be applied to predict the mineralization efficiency, the necessary requirements of reaction time, required sodium bicarbonate and the relationship between the required specific surface area and CO2 partial pressure. It can be theoretically suitable for the materials where the majority are olivine and it is necessary to carry out several pre-tests to determine the value of the correction factor (

                     ).The earth has been reported to be warming particularly in recent decades However, the rate of mineralization for CO In fact, this necessity has been attempted recently by a few researchers Ji et al. where Though it fitted the experimental data well, the constants, In order to develop the complete formula which can quantify the comprehensive effects of various factors, it is necessary to systematically investigate the kinetics of the mineralization process of olivine firstly, prior to the successful application of the technology. The choice of a kinetic model is crucial. Classical shrinking core model (SCM) with constant size of particles is a potentially reasonable choice This work is designed to systematically research the kinetics and further to develop a complete formula to quantify the kinetics. As the high CO A green dunite sample was supported by Sibelco Europe. This sample has an olivine content of 86% (w/w) followed by an enstatite of 6% by the Quantitative X-ray Diffraction (QXRD) analysis. The chemical composition is shown in The mineralization tests were performed in a 600 mL stainless steel autoclave (No. 5103) provided by Parr Instrument with a 15 mL sampling kit which can continuously take slurry samples from the autoclave for analysis. The range of temperature and pressure remained ±2 °C and ±1.6 bar. The precision of the whole tests and analysis maintained at ±4%. The green dunite was ground by a rod mill and then screened to provide samples with narrow size distribution. The sieve sizes were 500 mesh, 400 mesh, 270 mesh, 200 mesh and 170 mesh. As a result, the particles 0–25 μm, 25–38 μm, 38–53 μm and 53–75 μm were collected and used for systematic mineralization tests, including the effects of particle size, temperature, P The mineralization efficiency was calculated based on the change in the carbon content of the solid sample, shown in Eqs. Since The FEI Quanta 650 instrument was used to further analyze the transverse surface of particles of the obtained solids by the scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEM-EDX) method through measuring the molar ratio of Mg, Fe versus Si. Prior to systematic research of the kinetics, comprehensive effects of various factors on the mineralization under the conditions below CO Firstly, the effect of particle size on the mineralization efficiency is shown in The temperature showed a more complicated effect, as shown in The mineralization efficiency was proportional to the CO The additives, both sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride, can remarkably enhance the mineralization process of olivine, shown in  In order to investigate which step controlled the mineralization process, the kinetics was analyzed based on the classical SCM model, shown in The kinetic analysis on the CO The kinetic analysis for the effects of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride is shown n In fact, the mineralization was controlled by product layer diffusion only when the CO Quantifying the factors affecting the kinetics can lead to the development of a formula that is capable of predicting the mineralization efficiency under specific conditions. This can provide significant support for the industrial application and the further development of mineralization technology. This work mainly focused on the mineralization process controlled by the chemical reaction as discussed above. The data from According to the Arrhenius Equation (Eq. It is important to confirm whether the mineralization process under high addition of additives and over 21 bar CO It is obvious that both The practical chemical reactions during the mineralization process are the following: Reaction Once the supply of Based on the above theory, the addition of NaHCO Therefore, the effects of NaCl can be neglected once there was addition (≥0.5 m) of NaHCO Furthermore, according to Eq.. According to For all the particles, the correction factor k According to Formula As to the mineralization without NaHCO The correction factor k As discussed above, the developed quantification formula (Formula 25) can be used to predict the mineralization efficiency according to the listed conditions. In fact, the quantification can be also used to calculate the time needed to reach the acceptable mineralization efficiency under the specific conditions, shown in Formula 29. For example, it is considered that 80% of the efficiency is acceptable for the mineralization of the particles with 1.53 m The experiments showed that the practical time needed for reaction is 4.29 h, as shown in In addition, the formula can also predict the minimum requirement of a specific factor for acceptable mineralization efficiency. For example, Formula 25 can be converted to Formula 30 to predict the requirement of sodium bicarbonate addition. For the particles with 1.53 m The practical data shown in It is the same way to calculate the requirement of the other factors to reach the specific efficiency under the specific conditions for a specific reaction time. It is known that the requirements of the specific surface area and the CO For any material with a known specific surface area, the minimum specific surface area requirement can be calculated once the other conditions are known as well. According to Formula 31, for instance, for the above dunite, the specific surface area is 1.53 m  Herein, Formula 25 was only developed from the high grade olivine under the chemical reaction control. It can provide the suitable guidelines for the application of mineralization technology. Theoretically, the developed Formula 25 can be also used for any materials where the olivine is the major mineral. However, this must be confirmed by investigating other sources of olivine for comparison. The In this paper, comprehensive effects of factors on the mineralization efficiency have been investigated under moderate conditions. The specific surface area, temperature, CO A systematic kinetics analysis has been carried out on the significant factors. It is found that the mineralization process was always controlled by the chemical reaction between protons and the olivine once the addition of sodium bicarbonate and the CO There are no conflicts to declare.
