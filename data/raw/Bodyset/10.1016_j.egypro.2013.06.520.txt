The dissolution of thermally activated serpentine (75% dehydroxylated) by direct flue-gas mineralization was investigated at far-from-equilibrium (w.r.t mineral dissolution) flow-through operating conditions. Experiments were performed at moderate partial pressures of CO2 (0.1bar 2bar CO2) and temperatures (30°C 90°C). Thermal activation enabled the dissolution of serpentine at mildly acidic conditions. Both magnesium and silica were released upon dissolution. However, the silica conversion was under-stoichiometric with respect to magnesium. Fast initial dissolution rates were observed with magnesium conversions reaching 60% in 30min. Experiments were also performed in the absence of CO2 with identical pH conditions generated with mineral acid (HCl). The dissolution profiles were similar to those obtained under flue-gas atmosphere.
