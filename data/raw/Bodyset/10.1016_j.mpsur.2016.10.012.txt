This article provides an overview of upper limb fractures in children from clavicle fractures to fractures of the wrist. We will focus more on common injuries including fractures around the elbow and those of the forearm. We will review the aetiology and classifications of common fractures and discuss appropriate considerations for management to provide a general overview of treatment options. This article will cover injuries that are managed differently from those seen in adults.Can be used in all fracture patterns Technically easier Greater stability to axial rotational stress Risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury — mini-open procedure with elbow partially extended is required to reduce risk Avoids need for mini-open procedure and risk of ulnar nerve injury Technically challenging, especially when 2-mm K-wires are used Not advised with medial comminution and fractures with medial proximal extension Does not completely avoid iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury Upper limb fractures in children are very common and account for nearly 75% of all paediatric fractures. They span a spectrum from minor buckle fractures of the distal radius to supracondylar fractures with vascular compromise requiring emergency intervention. The majority of fractures result from low-energy trauma such as a fall from recreational equipment or sporting activity. Particular fractures in infants and toddlers should raise the possibility of non-accidental injury (NAI). The paediatric skeleton demonstrates greater capacity for healing and remodelling than seen in the adult and as a consequence greater angulation, displacement, translation, and shortening can be accepted and reliably expected to heal and remodel without functional deficits. Remodelling is influenced by proximity of the fracture to the physis, the plane of the deformity, age of the child, and the presence of underlying bone disease. The clavicle is one of the most commonly fractured bones in children accounting for 10–15% of all paediatric fractures. It is the most common site for obstetric fractures. Allman classified clavicle fractures into three groups based upon anatomical location — middle (I), lateral (II) and medial (III). Middle-third fractures predominate (90%) and are caused by direct trauma, a fall onto the shoulder or excessive lateral compression. Distal (lateral) fractures account for approximately 5% of clavicular fractures. The injury frequently involves a fall onto the lateral aspect of the shoulder. The lateral clavicle remains cartilaginous until the third decade of life. Fractures can involve the epiphysis but more frequently the metaphysis is affected, which displaces superiorly and the epiphysis remains held in place by the acromioclavicular ligaments. Lateral clavicle fractures represent physeal injuries and as such have tremendous healing capacity. Medial fractures constitute less than 5% of all clavicle fractures and are commonly Salter–Harris (SH) II fractures. The medial clavicular physis is the last physis to close around age 20–25 years. Very rarely, sterno-clavicular joint displacement may occur and if symptomatic and problematic, computerized tomography (CT) may be required.         In severe injuries, brachial plexus injuries may be seen. Malunion is common but seldom has functional implications; residual subcutaneous deformity will remodel with time but will take 18 months in children. Non-union is very rare — is more common after attempts at open reduction. Comparatively rare injuries accounting for less than 0.45% of all paediatric fractures and up to 7% of epiphyseal fractures. Physeal fractures are classified as per SH; Neer developed a classification based upon displacement with respect to the diameter of the humeral shaft. The proximal humerus has immense remodelling capacity with 80% of humeral growth occurring at the proximal physis. The glenohumeral joint demonstrates considerable mobility and can therefore tolerate residual deformity and angulation.    For very displaced fractures, shortening and varus malunion have been reported but are not clinically significant. Neurovascular injury to brachial plexus, brachial artery and axillary nerve have been reported but are rare. Humeral head osteonecrosis (rare). Humeral shaft fractures in children are rare and account for 2–5.4% of all paediatric fractures. They are the second most common obstetric fractures. In toddlers and infants, these injuries should raise the suspicion of non-accidental injury (NAI). Spiral fracture of the humeral shaft in children under the age of 15 months is significantly associated with NAI. In one study, 100% of toddlers and infants with this injury were victims of abuse. Is based upon anatomical location and fracture pattern. Treatment is conservative.     Radial nerve injury (4.4%). Outcome is invariably good with recovery seen within several months of the injury. Non-union is exceedingly rare; in cases where it does occur, open-reduction and plate fixation may be utilised. Overgrowth is seen in approximately 80% but is generally less than 1 cm and is asymptomatic. The most common elbow fracture in children, supracondylar humeral fractures account for 3% of all paediatric fractures. The average age at injury is 5–7 years. They span a spectrum from relatively benign undisplaced fractures, to limb-threatening off-ended injuries with neurovascular compromise. Extension type fractures predominate (95–97%) and are caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand or falls from recreational equipment. In hyperextension, the olecranon engages the olecranon fossa and acts as a fulcrum around which the fracture occurs. The Gartland classification is the most widely used classification system: I: Undisplaced II: Displaced with an intact posterior hinge III: Off-ended and completely displaced. The Gartland classification has been further amended many times to incorporate varus, valgus and rotation rendering it essentially meaningless. We prefer the AO classification where supracondylar humeral fractures are coded as 13-M/3 and subdivided into four types I: Undisplaced II: Pure extension (rarely flexion) III: Displaced (varus, valgus, rotation) with bony contact IV: Off-ended with no bony contact.    The need for open reduction in the absence of vascular compromise is a matter of debate. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons suggest that open reduction might be performed for fractures with varus or other malposition after closed reduction fails, but acknowledges that supporting evidence for this is unconvincing. The timing of surgery is a contentious issue and reference is often made to the perfusion status of the hand and three distinct groups: 1) pink and well perfused with a palpable radial pulse; 2) pink but pulseless; 3) white (ischaemic). It should not be forgotten that the latter two groups represent dysvascular limbs and warrant  Neurological injury (10–20% of fractures). The anterior interosseous nerve is most commonly injured as a consequence of the injury, the ulnar nerve with fixation. Vascular injury; reported incidences vary from 2 to 38%; 10–20% of patients with a Gartland III fracture have an absent radial pulse. Compartment syndrome (Volkmann ischaemic contracture); seen in 0.1–0.3% of patients. More common in cases associated with ipsilateral forearm fractures. Malunion; cubitus valgus and varus deformities have incidence ranges variously reported between 0 and 50%. Cubitus varus is more noticeable owing to the cosmetic appearance. Hyperextension may lead to restricted flexion. Pin site infection; incidence ranges from less than 1% to 6.6%. Myositis ossificans; very rare but more common with open reduction. The second most common fracture of the elbow, lateral condyle fractures account for 12–20% of all distal humeral fractures. The peak age range is 5–10 years. The injury may be sustained by a ‘push-off’ injury where a valgus force with the elbow in extension causes the radial head to impact into the lateral condyle. In a ‘pull-off’ injury, the common extensor origin produces an avulsion of the lateral condyle when the forearm is forcefully adducted in extension. The Milch classification ( Lateral condyle fractures can be challenging to treat, not least because they can be difficult to identify. Treatment is influenced by displacement.   Following screw fixation, the elbow is immobilized for 2 weeks to rest the soft tissues before commencing gentle mobilization. The metalwork should be removed at approximately 3–6 months to prevent growth restriction. Screw fixation is preferable as it avoids any issues with delayed union.  Delayed/non-union; common in lateral condyle fractures owing to the intra-articular nature of the fracture and resultant persistent exposure to synovial fluid thought to inhibit callus formation, poor metaphyseal blood supply, and persistent deforming force of the common extensors. Cubitus varus; seen in up to 40% of patients. This may be because of overgrowth of the lateral physis or malunion. Lateral spur formation occurs because of periosteal displacement that leads to new bone formation; may accentuate apparent varus deformity. Cubitus valgus; rare complication and may occur as a consequence of physeal arrest. Milch I fractures involve extension across the physis (SH IV) and may lead to lateral growth arrest. Fishtail deformity; the exact cause is unclear. It is characterized by deepening of the trochlea groove and may result from AVN or growth arrest of the lateral trochlea. It seldom has functional implications. Neurological injury; acute injury is rare but valgus deformity may lead to tardy ulnar nerve palsy. Avascular necrosis (AVN) after open reduction. Stripping of posterior tissues should be avoided to minimise vascular insult to the lateral condyle. Medical epicondyle fractures account for approximately 11% of all elbow fractures and the peak age for injury is between 9 and 14 years. These fractures represent apophyseal injuries where the medial epicondyle is pulled off by the common flexor origin. Half of all fractures are associated with posterolateral elbow dislocations; following reduction the medial epicondyle fragment can be trapped in the joint along with the ulnar nerve. Application of a valgus force to an extended elbow causes pull of the common flexor origin and medial collateral ligament. The level of displacement which requires fixation is contentious. Most surgeons would accept the need for surgery when the displaced fragment has reached the level of the bony joint. Although lesser displacement can be managed conservatively, extra care should be taken in the face of multiple fractures, elbow dislocation, elbow instability and high-level athletes. Fixation is commonly achieved with a cannulated screw to permit early range of movement.  Missed injury — particularly when the fragment is trapped in the joint following dislocation. Ulnar nerve injury. Instability and symptomatic malunion/non-union in athletes whose elbow is subjected to valgus stress. These are rare injuries accounting for 1–2% of paediatric elbow fractures. In the younger child, diagnosis can be challenging because the trochlea ossifies later than the capitellum and the medial epicondyle and as a consequence medial condylar fractures can be mistaken for epicondylar fractures. However, condylar fractures are SH IV fractures and represent intra-articular injuries. Application of valgus stress in extension causes the olecranon or coronoid to impact upon the medial condyle; alternatively, the common flexor origin can avulse the medial condyle.    Non-union with varus deformity. AVN (rare). More common in children under 3 years where the distal humerus is entirely cartilaginous. These fractures are akin to supracondylar fractures sustained in older children. It can be challenging to distinguish these fractures from elbow dislocation. In children presenting with transphyseal separation, one must have a high index of suspicion of NAI with up to 50% of such injuries being the result of abuse. Hyperextension of the elbow causes injuries in older children while shear and rotational forces are implicated in younger children; this may occur with birth trauma or NAI. Treatment is predicated upon identification of the injury which can be difficult. In infants, presentation is frequently delayed as a consequence of NAI. The key is to exclude elbow dislocation. In cases of distal humeral physeal separation, the radio-capitellar articulation remains congruent while in cases of elbow dislocation, this relationship is disrupted. Conservative treatment is with collar-and-cuff with high arm flexion or with plaster cast immobilization. In older children, reduction and K-wire fixation, as per supracondylar fractures, should be performed.  Cubitus varus AVN of distal humerus Failure to recognize NAI A comparatively rare injury in children. It is seen in adolescents who have suffered a fall onto an outstretched hand. Associated fractures are common, particularly fractures of the medial epicondyle, radial neck, and coronoid process. Posterolateral dislocation is the most common direction of displacement; in 50% of cases there is an associated fracture. As per all dislocations, classification is based on the direction of displacement of the distal fragment. Posterior dislocation (posterolateral > posteromedial) is more common than anterior dislocation. Closed reduction in the emergency department should be performed. A focused neurological examination should be performed pre-and post-reduction. Post-reduction radiographs must confirm a concentric joint and should be scrutinized for associated fractures, particularly an incarcerated medial epicondyle fragment. After reduction, an above elbow cast or collar-and-cuff may be applied and the joint rested for 1–3 weeks before commencing gentle mobilization. For those in cast, repeat dislocation is possible and potentially missable. Surveillance radiographs are compulsory to ensure the joint remains congruent.  Stiffness — more common in patients who are immobilized for extended periods. Missed fracture. Neurological injury — neuropraxia of the median and ulna nerve are seen in 10% of dislocations. The ulnar nerve may be taken with the medial epicondyle fragment and become trapped in the joint. Recurrent dislocation (rare). Myositis ossificans (rare). Isolated ulna metaphyseal fractures are rare accounting for 4–6% of all fractures and in 20% of cases there is an associated elbow dislocation or fracture, most commonly the proximal radius. Peak incidence is seen in those aged 5–10 years and 10–20% of olecranon fractures require surgical intervention. They are particularly common in patients with Three common mechanisms predominate—hyperextension, flexion, and shear injuries. No classification system has gained widespread acceptance.    Stiffness. Failure to identify associated injuries and Also known as nursemaid's elbow, refers to traumatic subluxation of the radial head from the annular ligament which displaces proximally and becomes partially interposed between the radial head and capitellum. Commonly seen in children under 4 years and rarely seen after the age of 7. Longitudinal traction with the elbow extended and the forearm pronated. Radiographs will be normal but are useful to rule out associated injuries. Diagnosis is made on the basis of history and clinical examination, usually apparent from a position of elbow flexion and forearm pronation and a reticence to move the elbow. Reduction is achieved with elbow flexion to 90° and repeated forearm prono-supination with thumb pressure over the radial head. Successful reduction may be confirmed by a palpable or audible snap and resumption of active movements by the child. Immobilization is generally not required.  Recurrence — reported rates range from 5 to 40%. Repeat episodes are managed in the same manner as above. Account for approximately 1% of all fractures and 1–5% of all paediatric elbow fractures. They are generally seen in children aged 7–12 years; 50% are isolated injuries and the remaining 50% occur in association with other elbow injuries. The paediatric radial head is largely cartilaginous and so fractures occur at the neck, giving rise to physeal or metaphyseal fractures; they are commonly SH I or II fractures. A fall onto an extended elbow with valgus stress is the common cause. O'Brien classified fractures into three groups based on the degree of angulation (type I <30°; type II 31–60°, and type III >60°).   When closed methods fail, percutaneous reduction with a small steinman pin or K-wires used as a joystick or lever may be utilised. The Metaizeau technique of intramedullary flexible nail reduction may obviate the need for open reduction. Introduced in a retrograde fashion through the distal radial metaphysis, the curved of the end of the flexible nail can be used to disimpact the displaced fragment and rotation of the nail can act to reduce the radial head. The nail should be left in-situ for 6 weeks. Open reduction is widely associated with poor outcomes and places the posterior interosseous nerve at risk of injury. It should be avoided whenever possible because of the risk of AVN.  Loss of prono-supination secondary to malunion, radial head overgrowth or AVN. AVN of the radial head has been reported to occur particularly after open reduction. Radio-ulna synostosis. Injury to the posterior interosseous nerve. Dislocation of the radial head with associated fracture of the proximal ulna. Monteggia fractures occur most commonly in children aged 4–10 years and are frequently missed. The Bado classification describes four types of fracture–dislocation based on displacement of the radial head (can easily be remembered as APL): I: anterior II: posterior III: lateral IV: anterior dislocation of the radial head with associated radial shaft fracture Hyperextension, hyperpronation and direct injury to the ulna have all been proposed. Reduction of the dislocated radial head is the primary objective. Most acute injuries can be managed with closed reduction by reducing the ulnar angulation with cast immobilization. It is important to scrutinize fluoroscopic images to ensure that the radial shaft line intersects the capitellum in all positions.    Delayed diagnosis/missed injury can lead to pain, instability, deformity and tardy ulna nerve palsy. Re-dislocation can happen, particularly with plastic deformity of the ulna and needs close monitoring. Nerve injury; transient posterior interosseous nerve palsy is seen in 20% of type III (lateral) fractures. Malunion of the ulna leading to restricted prono-supination. Stiffness. Paediatric forearm fractures make up 5–10% of all paediatric fractures. Plastic deformation, greenstick or complete fracture may occur. Plastic deformation refers to bony deformation secondary to multiple microscopic shear fractures. These fractures have limited remodelling capacity. Greenstick fractures are characterized by failure on the tension side of the bone with the compression cortex remaining intact. They are the result of rotational forces described by Rang as the parachute reflex. Complete fractures involve disruption of both cortices and displacement is dictated by the level of the fracture and the associated muscular attachments and deforming forces. The Galeazzi fracture is a fracture of the distal-third of the radius with concomitant disruption of the distal radio-ulna joint. It is rare in children. Diaphyseal forearm fractures are described on the basis of the level of the fracture, completeness, and direction of angular deformity. A fall onto an outstretched hand is the leading cause. With the hand palm-side down, supination around the hand will produce a greenstick fracture with apex volar angulation; a pronation force produces apex dorsal angulation. With greater degrees of force, complete fractures may occur. Direct force may produce isolated single bone fracture as occurs with self-defence injuries such as ulna nightstick injuries. Treatment is dictated by the completeness of the fracture, level of displacement and remodelling potential.     Refracture. Occurs in 5–7% and is more common after greenstick and open fractures. Malunion. Non-union — rare. Neurological injury. Neuropraxia of the median nerve is the most common nerve injury. Iatrogenic damage to the superficial branch of the radial nerve may occur with flexible intramedullary nailing. Synostosis — rare Compartment syndrome — rare. Fractures of the distal radius and ulna are the most common fractures in children and account for more than 75% of all forearm fractures. Approximately, 15% of these fractures affect the physis. They span a spectrum from simple buckle fractures to off-ended metaphyseal fractures. The majority of fractures can be managed non-operatively. As per forearm shaft fractures, distal fractures are described based on the completeness of the fracture, location and angle of deformity. Physeal fractures are classified according to the SH classification. A fall onto an outstretched hand is the most common mechanism. Recreational equipment and sporting injuries are strongly implicated.      Physeal growth arrest (particularly if manipulated >10 days post injury); incidence is 4–5%. Malunion — rare. Re-fracture — less common than with diaphyseal fractures. Neurological injury. Transient injury to the median nerve may occur with fracture displacement but frequently resolves with fracture reduction. 17% complication rate with K-wire fixation. Carpal tunnel syndrome. The remodelling capacity around the shoulder and wrist in a growing child is immense. Fractures around the elbow show less remodelling capacity. The vast majority of these injuries should be treated non-operatively. For those requiring surgical intervention, fixation methods frequently differ from those used in adults. As with all injuries in children, some thought must be given to the possibility of NAI.
