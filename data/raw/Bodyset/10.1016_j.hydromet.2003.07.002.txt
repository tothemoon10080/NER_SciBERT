Solvent extraction of Zr(IV) from acidic chloride solutions has been carried out with 2-ethyl hexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethyl hexyl ester (PC-88A) as the extractant. Higher acid concentration increases the extraction of zirconium and is quantitative around 1 M HCl. An increase of extractant and Cl− concentration at constant H+ ion also increases the extraction of Zr(IV). Plots of log D vs. log [Cl−]/or [extractant] are linear with slopes ∼2 indicating the association of 2 mol of chloride ions and PC-88A with the extracted metal species. The IR spectra of the extracted Zr–PC-88A complex is reported. The effect of H+ ion concentration at constant concentration of [Cl−] has no effect on Zr(IV) extraction. Addition of sodium salts enhanced the extraction of Zr(IV) and follows the order NaSCN>NaNO3>Na2SO4>NaCl. Loading capacity of the 0.005 M PC-88A was determined to be 0.078 g L−1 Zr(IV). Stripping of metal from the loaded organic (LO) with different acids indicated sulphuric acid as the best stripping agent. Temperature, regeneration capacity of PC-88A, and extraction of associated elements such as Hf(IV), Ti(IV), Al(IV), and Fe(III) are also reported.Zirconium is used in the nuclear industry because of its excellent corrosion resistance and low neutron cross-section. Organophosphorus compounds, namely, TBP and D2EHPA, have been extensively employed in the solvent extraction studies of Zr. This paper discusses the solvent extraction of Zr(IV) from low hydrochloric acid solutions with PC-88A dissolved in kerosene. The parameters studied are acid variation, effect of Cl The concentration of Zr(IV) in the aqueous phase was determined by the xylenol orange (XO) method PC-88A (Daihachi Chemical Industry, Japan), TOPS-99—an equivalent of (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (Heavy Water Board, Mumbai) and Cyanex-272 (bis-(2,4,4-trimethyl pentyl) phosphinic acid (Cytec, Canada) were used as-received with distilled kerosene (160–200 °C) as a diluent. ZrOCl Initially, many experiments were conducted to obtain reproducible results on the extraction Zr(IV) from HCl solution by PC-88A due to the continuous change in composition of Zr(IV) species arising from hydrolysis and polymerization phenomena in the aqueous phase. Therefore, working solutions of Zr(IV) were prepared fresh and used for the extraction experiments. Equal volumes of aqueous phase and organic phase were equilibrated for 30 min with a mechanical shaker at room temperature (30±1 °C) unless stated otherwise. Preliminary experiments showed that equilibrium was achieved within 20 min contact. The concentration of the metal in the organic phase was calculated from the difference in the aqueous phase concentration before and after extraction. Zr–PC-88A solid complex was prepared by repeatedly contacting 0.005 M PC-88A in chloroform with fresh portions of Zr(IV) solution. Diluent was removed from the loaded organic (LO) to obtain a semisolid metal complex. This was made into a KBr pellet for IR analysis after complete evaporation of chloroform. Pure PC-88A was recorded for comparison. The distribution coefficient The effect of the HCl concentration in the range 0.1–1 M on the extraction of Zr(IV) (0.001 M) was investigated using 0.005 M PC-88A and shows a significant increase in extraction with increasing acid concentration However, the effect of chloride ion concentration in the range 1–2 M at constant H The effect of extractant concentration, in the range 0.003–0.01 M of PC-88A, was then studied using Zr(IV) in 0.3 M HCl. A plot of log The effect of salts such as NaCl, Na The extraction of Zr(IV) from 0.3 M HCl by 0.005 M PC-88A in various diluents decreases in the order cyclohexane ( The effect of temperature in the range of 303–333(±1) K on the extraction of Zr(IV) from an aqueous solution containing 0.001 M Zr(IV) and 0.3 M HCl using 0.005 M PC-88A was also studied. An increase of temperature from 30 to 40, 50, and 60 °C increased Loading capacity of 0.005 M PC-88A was determined by contacting the organic phase repeatedly with the same volume of aqueous phase containing 0.001 M of Zr(IV) and 0.3 M of HCl. After three contacts, the loaded extractant concentration was 0.078 g/L Zr and remained constant with further contacts. Zr(IV) stripping from LO (0.005 M PC-88A) containing 0.078 g L Studies on the recycling capacity of 0.007 M PC-88A for the extraction of Zr(IV) was carried out by first loading the extractant with an aqueous phase containing 0.001 M Zr(IV) and 0.3 M HCl. Single-stage extraction gave LO containing 0.085 g L The extraction behavior of hafnium(IV), titanium(IV), aluminum(III), and iron(III) (0.001 M each) has been studied as a function of HCl concentration using 0.005 M PC-88A in kerosene as an extractant The infrared spectra of pure PC-88A and Zr–PC-88A solid complex were recorded.
