Development of three-dimensional ternary vanadate compounds with excellent structural stability on exfoliated graphene nanoflacks allows the first success of conversion-type sodium vanadate anode candidate for high-rate and long-life lithium-ion batteries(LIBs). Corresponding additive-free self-anchoring behavior of active sodium vanadates material on graphene surface is representatively investigated, architecturing unique dendritic structure, a first-of-this-kind configuration, with robust flexibility and sufficient capability of structure-preservation. The prepared nanocomposite provides a high reversible capacity over 800mAhg−1 and ultrafast charging/discharging capability with Li-ions via conversion-type reaction. More remarkably, the well-designed structure retains more than 96% of initial capacity with respect to their ultralong cycling stability, demonstrating the combined advantages of the facile hydrothermal protocol, high active material loading and architecture configuration for high-performance Li-ions storage. As a consequence, this research reveals the importance and effectiveness of self-assembling sodium vanadates on graphene nanoflakes with 3D hierarchial structure and indicates the significant potential of developing ternary vanadate compounds as promising anode candidate for LIBs.Alloy/conversion-type electrode materials is under active exploration due to their theoretically high capacity and charateristic alloying or displacement mechanism for Li-ion storage. Nanostructuring design of these high capacitive yet insulating materials has provided unique promises on maximum utilizing their high gravimetric capacities and specific energy density in the wide range of application, including device portability, power-grid intellectualization, vehicle electrification and large-scale energy-harvesting, to name a few Ternary vanadate compounds, in particular of NaV Herein, in this work, we proposed a facile, low-cost and additive-free protocol for in-situ self-assembling dendritic SVs (mixture of α-NaV Natural graphite powder (C%≥99.85%), sodium orthovanadate (C%≥99.98%), 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (C%≥99.85%) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) were purchased from sigma-aldrich without further purification. Ultra pure water (18 Our proposed formation protocol involves easy to handle, additive-free and one-pot operation with cost-effective vanadium precursor, in which the formation of SVs were triggered spontaneously with the reduction of GO via hydrothermal process. In a typical synthesis, sodium orthavanadium (6.7 The synthesized SVs/ Electrochemical measurements were tested by mixing active material, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder according to the weight ratio of 80:10:10. The mixture was dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution to make a homogenous slurry. The as-prepared electrode slurry was coated on an copper foil by doctor-blade method and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 The scheme of proposed strategy was presented in The SVs/  The high power rate and ultra-long cycling stability of prepared SVs/ The electrochemical properties of SVs/ In summary, we have proposed a simple procedure of hydrothermally self-anchoring SVs into the exfoliated graphene nanoflakes, which allows one to produce unique dendritic nanocomposite architecture. The structural tunability is fulfilled and found to be determined by the reaction time and temperature during preparation. Furthermore, such protocol allows formation of SVs/graphene nanocomposite with high fraction of SVs with promising performance characteristics when unprecedentedly tested as anode candidate for LIBs.
