A hydrometallurgical process has been developed for cobalt recovery from a waste dust formed during the colouring of glass plates. This dust, containing about 33% Co, is highly contaminated by Fe and Cr. The process consists of the following major steps: (1) leaching the dust in H2SO4; (2) purification of leach liquors by hydrolytic precipitation using Na2CO3 and/or K2CO3 as neutralizing agent; (3) precipitation of basic cobalt(II) carbonate; (4) dissolution of basic cobalt(II) carbonate in sulphuric acid and separation of residual chromium; (5) electrowinning of cobalt from refined sulphate solutions. A compact metallic deposit containing =99.5% Co was obtained.Pure cobalt has relatively few applications, but its use as an alloying element and as a source of chemicals makes it strategically important. World cobalt consumption has increased progressively during the last ten years. The current world demand for cobalt is about 40 000 t/a, while the world cobalt consumption in 1990 was about 28 000 t/a. This gradually increasing demand for cobalt results in increasing cobalt prices. Low grade cobalt (99.3% Co) was sold for 47.39–49.60 USD/kg in January 2004, high grade cobalt (99.8% Co) for 51.80–54.56/kg, while the price of high grade cobalt was only 15.87 USD/kg in January 2003. The market specialists predict that in the coming years the cobalt demand is going to exceed the supply because until 2006/2007 no large projects will be realized ( Cobalt is produced mainly as a by-product of the mining and processing of copper and nickel ores. Silver, gold, lead and zinc ores may also contain considerable amounts of cobalt, but their processing does not always lead to cobalt recovery ( Recovery of cobalt from secondary sources can occur through introduction of recycled material at an appropriate stage in a primary refining or transformation process, depending on its technical and economical capabilities. Waste scrap carbides, in which metallic Co is used as a binding matter, are one of the most important secondary cobalt sources. However, in contrast to the lack of valuable cobalt ores and to increasing cobalt demand there exist some cobalt-rich wastes, which are not recycled but even disposed as hazardous wastes. One of them is waste cobalt dust, which is formed during the production of metal deposits on glass plates. During this procedure, acetylacetates of metals, namely of Co, Cr and Fe, are sprayed on a glass belt at 600 °C. They are partly oxidized and escape to the chimney, where the resulting dust is separated in the filters. In comparison to common ores with only about 1% Co, this dust containing about 33% Co appears to be a valuable raw material for the cobalt recovery. This study is a continuation of our previous work ( The objective of this experimental study was to recover metallic cobalt of commercial purity from the waste cobalt dust, which is still formed in the glass works Glaverbel Czech, a.s. Teplice and due to closing of the plant Aktiva is not recycled. It was not possible to utilize liquors from leaching the cobalt dust in sulphuric acid directly for cobalt electrowinning due to high iron and chromium concentrations. Therefore, we prepared convenient cobalt electrolytes by dissolution of cobalt(II) carbonate in dilute sulphuric acid. In agreement with previous results ( Further work was performed to determine the critical chromium concentration in the cobalt electrolytes and to establish conditions of cobalt electrowinning from refined acidic sulphate electrolytes. While the effect of impurities such as nickel, copper, iron, lead and zinc on cobalt deposition has been well investigated, the effect of chromium is unknown ( The average elemental composition of the waste cobalt dust is given in Leaching and precipitation experiments were carried out in a closed, stirred and thermostated 2 L glass reaction vessel provided with temperature and pH control. Based on the results from leaching experiments in our previous work ( The impurities, namely Fe and Cr, were removed from the CoSO The cobalt carbonate obtained was dissolved in diluted sulphuric acid at pH 2.5. The solutions with concentrations of Co and Cr at approx. 30 g/L and 80 mg/L, respectively were purified to remove chromium, probably as Cr(VI), using the procedure described in literature (         The short-term runs were conducted at a constant current density (CD) for 1 h. During these runs cell voltage (CV) was continuously measured and current efficiency (CE) of electrowinning was determined by weighing the cobalt deposits. From experimental data obtained, electric energy consumption (EEC) was established. The purity of cobalt deposits was established by semi-quantitative emission spectral analysis while the morphology of cobalt deposit was studied using an electron scanning microscope. The main leaching reaction of the cobalt dust should be described as Because, it was found that almost 100% dissolution of cobalt was accompanied only by partial dissolution of iron and chromium. We assumed that the cobalt dust contained cobalt free iron and chromium oxide compounds including Cr(VI) oxide besides its major phase Co(Fe,Cr) The courses of precipitation of Fe, Cr and Co using alkali-carbonate as neutralizing agent are illustrated in As it was found in our previous work, both iron and chromium precipitation was complete at pH=6. However, irrespective of cobalt, chromium and acid concentrations in processed leach solutions, it was observed that only about 80% of the initial chromium content was removed. Subsequent increase in pH value of solutions by K Cobalt precipitation was complete at pH=9 while the significant amount of basic cobalt(II)carbonate was formed in the pH range from 7 to 8. The Fe–Cr precipitates containing on average 11–16% Fe, 12–14% Cr and 4–5% Co, could be utilised for production of Fe–Cr alums as it was performed in the plant Aktiva Kaznìjov. Precipitates of basic cobalt(II)carbonate obtained from undiluted liquors using Na Results of cobalt electrowinning from model electrolytes contaminated by chromium suggested that the addition of up to 50 mg/L Cr had insignificant effect on either the compactness of the cobalt deposit or the current efficiency. The deposit became fragile-spongy when cobalt was plated from solutions containing 75 mg/L Cr although current efficiency remained comparable to those at lower concentrations of chromium. The initial concentration of chromium in the solution obtained by dissolution of basic cobalt carbonate in diluted sulphuric acid was about 86 mg/L. After reduction of hexavalent chromium by sulphite according the overall reaction and dilution by distilled water to achieve the required cobalt concentration of 20 g/L, the chromium concentration decreased to about 8 mg/L. Removal of the residual Cr(VI) from the solution after cobalt carbonate dissolution appeared more advantageous than the preliminary proved procedure involving reduction of Cr(VI) in the original leach liquor and its separation before cobalt carbonate precipitation. The latter procedure caused cobalt losses from leach liquors. Cobalt electrowinning from sulphate model solutions, without the addition of any chromium, and from purified electrolytes carried out at a current density of 250 A/m The hydrometallurgical process developed in this study represents a feasible approach to cobalt recovery from wastes of non-standard composition. In agreement with our previous experience ( On the basis of laboratory scale experiments performed, a flow sheet was proposed and verified to process the waste cobalt dust and recover metallic cobalt, The present study was supported by the Research Intention MSM: 223100002.
