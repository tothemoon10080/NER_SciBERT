Controlled delivery systems would be more beneficial and ideal if the drug could be delivered with respond to external environmental change. It could be used to overcome the shortcomings of conventional dosage forms. Therefore, the correct amount of drug would be released upon the stimulation of such a temperature and concentration change. The purpose of study is to investigate the influence of temperature and drug concentration from poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and N-isopropylacrylamide)/poly(HEMA-NIPAAm). The macroporous structure 5HEMA15NIPAAm was showed the most rapid responsiveness in swelling ratio, polymer volume fraction, swelling and deswelling kinetics. The high drug loading capacity was achieved at or below ambient temperature, whilst the release profile was revealed sustain release of conventional anti-inflammatory drug; prednisolone 21 hemisuccinate sodium salt. In general, drug loading capacity and drug diffusion kinetics are influence by the porosity of hydrogels, temperature, and drug concentration.
