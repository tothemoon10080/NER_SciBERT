The electrosynthesis of cobalt-doped lead dioxide in an acidity bath has been studied using PARSTAT2273 electrochemical workstation with rotating disk electrode (RDE) and β (Beta)-PbO2-CoOx composite coatings were obtained by means of anodic galvanostatic polarization. The concentrations of Co2+ and Pb2+, pH, temperature and rotation velocity of the electrode effects on deposition behavior have been investigated. The amounts of PbO2 deposited on the electrode surface increase with increasing concentrations of Co2+, Pb2+, H+ and temperature within a certain range. There are only one main peak oxide peak (Pb2+→PbO2) and reduction peak (PbO2→Pb2+) with both anodic and cathodic scan in the cyclic voltammetry curves. The steady-state measurements show that the most suitable deposition current density is 6 mA/cm2. Surface analysis by SEM and XRD reveals that the Co-doped PbO2 has more uniform morphology and smaller crystals size than pure PbO2. The E-t curves show that Co2+ added into the original plating bath brings on a large amounts of nucleation points for β-PbO2 deposition.
