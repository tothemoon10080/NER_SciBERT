Titanium powders of about 2μ particle size were subjected to high energy attrition milling in an argon atmosphere. Selecting suitable milling parameters, nanosize (<100nm) titanium powders were prepared after 15h of milling. An average particle size of 35nm was obtained at 30h of milling after which the particle size stabilized with continuation of milling to 75h. The powders after milling for various durations were characterized by TEM, ICP and XRD, and these results are reported and discussed.Nanosized powders are single phase or multiphase materials, the particle size of which is in the nanometric range (<100 Due to the extremely small size of the grains and a large fraction of the atoms located at the grain boundaries, these materials have properties like higher strength/hardness, enhanced diffusivity, improved ductility/toughness, reduced elastic modulus, increased specific heat, higher electrical resistivity, higher thermal expansion coefficient, lower thermal conductivity, and superior magnetic properties much improved over those exhibited by conventional grain sized (>10 Several novel and non-equilibrium processing methods like mechanical milling During mechanical milling, the metal powder particles are subjected to severe mechanical deformation from collisions with the milling tools. Consequently, plastic deformation at high strain rates (∼10 Elemental Ti powder (99.8% purity) with average particle size of around 2 Nanosized Ti powder was synthesized by milling Ti powder in the attrition mill under argon flow. Argon gas of 99.99% purity was passed into the vessel, and the attrition milling was started with a milling speed of 400 The powders after attrition milling were heated at 250°C in vacuum (<10   Thus the particle size decreases during attrition milling exponentially.  ICP atomic emission spectroscopy indicated the presence of Fe, Cr and Ni as the major impurities in the milled powders. The impurity pickup was found to increase with the milling time and the final powder (75 XRD pattern of the milled Ti powders showed the formation of small amounts of different nitride phases such as Ti  Nanosized titanium powder can be successfully synthesized by high-energy milling. Using the present milling parameters, nanosized titanium was obtained between 15 and 30 The particle size decreases during attrition milling exponentially and obeys the relation XRD revealed the formation of small amounts of nitrides at 15 The major impurity pickup was that of Fe, Cr and Ni.
