The main aim of this work was to assess the potential of in situ carbonation as a treatment to modify the properties of alkaline materials such as industrial soil in terms of leaching behaviour and mineralogy and to store the CO2 generated by specific treatments applied in the context of Brownfield regeneration. The process was investigated through lab-scale column carbonation experiments, in which 100% CO2 was fed through humidified stainless steel slag under ambient temperature and pressure for set reaction times. The reaction kinetics and the maximum CO2 uptake attained (5.5%), corresponding to a Ca conversion yield of 15.6%, after 4h treatment proved slightly lower than those resulting from batch tests carried out on the same particle size fraction at enhanced operating conditions. The mineralogy of the material showed to be affected by column carbonation, exhibiting a higher calcite content and the decrease of Ca hydroxide and silicate phases. As a result of carbonation, the material showed a decrease in pH and Ca release as well as an increase in Si mobility. Furthermore, a reduction of Cr and Ba leaching, up to 63% and 96% respectively, was achieved after 2h of reaction. However, carbonation was observed to lead to an increased leaching of V and Mo. The effects of carbonation on the leaching behaviour of the material were also investigated performing pH-dependence leaching tests and the results indicated that in situ carbonation appears to be a promising treatment to improve the properties of alkaline materials in view of their reuse on-site.The modification of land use and the subsequent dismantling of several industrial activities has led to the formation of a number of derelict or underused sites, i.e. Brownfields, all across Europe ( In a Brownfield regeneration context, soil is commonly referred to as industrial soil, since it may be characterized by the presence of material of anthropogenic origin arising from the historical use of the site that may cause detrimental environmental effects related to the release of toxic metals and metalloids ( In addition, ex situ carbonation processes carried out in aqueous conditions, applying liquid to solid ( Hence, the application of accelerated carbonation in a Brownfield regeneration context appears to be of particular interest since it may allow the achievement of multiple benefits. In Brownfield sites primary CO The main aim of this work was to assess the feasibility of the proposed in situ carbonation process by means of a column carbonation experimental method in terms of the effects exerted on the environmental behaviour of the treated material as well as on the achieved CO The slag sample tested in this study, provided from a stainless steel production plant, is representative of the residues mix that is sent out of the plant for disposal. As the main residues produced by the plant are those generated from the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and from the Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) converter units, the sample may be expected to be a mixture of these types of slag. After determining its particle size distribution (ASTM D422), the coarser fraction ( The elemental composition was determined by alkali fusion of the slag samples with Li The intermediate fraction was also characterized in terms of its leaching behaviour before and after column carbonation tests, in order to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the mobility of major and trace elements. Specifically, the EN 12457-2 compliance test and the CEN/TS 14429 pH-dependence leaching test were applied both on as received and carbonated samples and the eluates were analyzed by ICP–OES. For the latter type of test, in order to span a wide pH range, acid additions were performed employing a 2 Column carbonation experiments were performed in a glass column with a height of 16 In each experiment 40 The carbonation experiments were carried out at ambient temperature ( Accelerated batch carbonation tests were performed on both the fine and intermediate slag particle size fractions at the operating conditions ( The stainless steel slag employed in this study was quite heterogeneous in its grain size distribution and showed a large amount (about 40 The elemental composition of both grain size classes is reported in The XRD patterns resulting for the fine and intermediate fractions are reported in The main results of the compliance leaching test carried out on the intermediate fraction are reported in The CO On the basis of the CO In The main results of the batch carbonation experiments carried out at enhanced conditions with the aim of assessing the reactivity of the examined type of residues in comparison to the data reported in previous works on steel slag carbonation are reported in Comparing the results of the experiments performed at ambient conditions in either the column or batch set-up (see The influence of the amount of water (expressed as The column carbonation experiments did not notably affect the physical properties of the slags. The moisture content measured at the end of the different experiments was quite in line with the initial one after water addition, with a maximum reduction of about 3.5% and 3% for the tests carried out at The two carbonated samples showed a very similar mineralogy and indicated that the most considerable variation in slag mineralogy compared to that of the as received material reported in Regarding the results of the compliance leaching test performed on the carbonated samples obtained from the column experiments, the pH of the eluates compared to the as received slag showed to decrease progressively with reaction time, reaching values suitable for reuse even after 2 The effect of carbonation on the leaching of regulated elements is summarized in In order to better analyze the effects of the tested column carbonation treatment on the leaching behaviour of the slag and to identify the main mechanisms governing the release of major and regulated elements in a long-term scenario, especially relevant for the proposed application since the slag/industrial soil is expected to remain on site, the pH dependence test was performed. On the basis of the amount of acid or base added in each sub-test and the resulting pH of the leachate at equilibrium conditions, the acid/base neutralization capacity of the slag before and after the carbonation treatment, reported in As for the as received sample, the acid titration curve exhibited a noticeable buffering capacity at alkaline pH values (between 8 and 12), consistent with the presence of calcium hydroxide and silicate phases detected by XRD analysis. A second acid neutralization plateau was observed in the pH range between 4 and 6 that may be partly related to carbonate/bicarbonate buffering. As shown in The leaching curves of major elements as a function of pH, derived from the pH-dependence test, are reported in Conversely, the leaching curve of Ca showed to be notably affected by carbonation, exhibiting a decrease in mobility at pH values higher than 6, proving the occurred conversion of the reactive phases into calcite as a result of the reaction with CO The leaching of regulated elements as a function of pH is shown in Hence, it may be concluded that notwithstanding the rather mild operating conditions adopted in the carbonation column experiments and quite limited resulting CO The feasibility of in situ carbonation as a treatment technique aimed at improving the environmental behaviour of alkaline industrial materials and to store the CO The results showed that, even at the mild operating conditions tested, a significant degree of carbonation could be achieved. Namely, an average CO As far as the leaching behaviour is concerned, the results of the compliance test showed a decrease of the eluate pH well below the limit for reuse set by the Italian national legislation. As to the behaviour of regulated trace compounds, barium and chromium leaching was improved after carbonation, although the eluate concentration was still above the limit for reuse for the latter element; the opposite behaviour was observed for vanadium and molybdenum, whose eluate concentration remained anyhow below the corresponding limits. Based on the results obtained from pH-dependence tests, the behaviour observed for chromium and molybdenum was explained by the reduction of eluate pH occurring after carbonation, that of barium with the possible formation of Ba–Ca carbonate solid solutions, whereas that of vanadium was attributed to its incorporation in Ca phases, such as dicalcium silicate, that react during carbonation. The results of the acid neutralization test also showed that a further reduction of the eluate pH to fairly neutral values could be expected in a long-term perspective upon contact with water. This suggests that in an application scenario Cr and Mo eluate concentrations could be reduced, thus making the reuse of the material feasible from an environmental point of view. In order to better investigate this point, up-flow column percolation tests could be performed on the treated materials. The results obtained in this work suggest that an in situ carbonation process which exploits a CO The authors wish to acknowledge the support received by the Seventh Framework programme of the European Commission within the project Holistic Management of Brownfield Regeneration (HOMBRE).
