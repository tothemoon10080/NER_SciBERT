The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a modified postero-medial surgical approach to the knee in treating a series of patients with complex tibial plateau injuries with associated postero-medial shear fractures. Postero-medial shear fractures are often under-appreciated and their clinical relevance have recently been characterised. Less invasive surgery and indirect reduction techniques have been shown to be inadequate for treating these medial coronal plane fractures. We present a case series and cadaveric dissection highlighting the relevant anatomy. The approach includes an inverted ‘L’ shaped incision and reflection of the medial head of gastrocnemius, while protecting the neurovascular structures. This is a more extensile exposure than the approach described by Trickey (1968). Our case series includes 6 females and 4 males. The average age of the patients is 57.7 years. The mechanism of injury included 5 RTAs, 4 fall from height and 1 valgus injury. All patients were Schatzker 4–6. One was open, one had vascular compromise and all were neurologically intact. The average time to definitive surgery was 6.8 days (range 0–12). 7 patients were fixed using the posrtero-medial approach only and 3 were combined with an anterior approach. The average operative time was 126 These are complex fractures to fix with the best chance for a good outcome achieved by anatomical reduction. We recommend this modified approach, which simplifies the fixation of the fracture by providing excellent exposure and minimal risk.
