We present results from ongoing and former, hitherto unpublished, studies of the role of protons in the electrical conductivity of three acceptor-substituted perovskites; BaMO3 (M=Pr, Tb, Th). Acceptor-doped BaPrO3 becomes dominated by electron holes at low temperatures in oxidising atmospheres, making it a p-type electronic conductor, leaving hydration and proton conduction barely measurable. It is unstable towards even mild reduction, as is also BaTbO3. Acceptor-doped BaTbO3 and BaThO3 exhibit mixed proton and electron hole conduction, and the hydration reaction and proton mobility have been studied through conductivity variations with T, p(O2) and p(H2O). Modeling of the data yielded enthalpies of hydration and activation enthalpy of proton mobility for BaTb0.9Yb0.1O3–δ of ΔH

The parameters are in qualitative agreement with literature for comparable perovskites, and with a correlation proposed between hydration enthalpy and difference between B- and A-site occupants' electronegativities. The BaTbO3 and BaThO3 materials had grain boundary resistances comparable to those of the grain interiors, suggesting that these materials with relatively high p-type electronic conduction generally exhibit smaller grain boundary resistances than typical BaZrO3-based materials, which are purer proton conductors.Acceptor-substituted barium cerate, BaCeO Another reason for the high conductivities of the cerate and zirconate is the large, polarisable oxygen ion host sublattice of these oxides, yielding high proton mobilities. It is thus of interest to follow this trend to BaThO Finally, the large grain boundary resistance to proton transport in the barium-based perovskites seems to diminish when the electronic conductivity increases, i.e., ongoing from BaZrO BaPrO The oxides in question are known or likely to react with H Several reports on conductivity, including possible effects of protons, exist for BaPrO The work presented here is based partly on a Master thesis study on BaTbO BaPr The accuracy of the ratios A/B between the cations in the perovskites is in all cases here estimated to be of the order of < All materials produced were phase pure perovskites by XRD after the last calcination prior to sintering. They were uniaxially cold-pressed and sintered at 1400–1550 °C for 12 h in air, reaching densities of 80–95%. They thus contained significant open porosity, having the advantage of relatively fast equilibria with the surrounding atmosphere, but lowering the measured conductivity somewhat. The sintered samples were of around 20 mm diameter and 1–2 mm thickness. The electrical characterization was performed in ProboStat measurement cells (NorECs AS, Norway). Four-point van der Pauw-type conductivity measurements were used for the BaPrO Solartron 1260 FRA and HP/Agilent 4192A impedance spectrometers were used for the impedance spectroscopy and conductivity measurements. 10 kHz was used for the reported 2-point measurements of AC conductivity at fixed frequency, in order to short electrode impedances. Lower frequencies were used for the 4-point van der Pauw measurements, in order to avoid inductance. Mostly, relatively high AC voltages, typically 1 V RMS were used, since we focused on characterizing bulk and grain boundary and not electrode impedances. The conductivities were corrected for porosity by the empirical first approximation The transport numbers of protons and native ions have been attempted to be measured by employing small, defined gradients in hydrogen or oxygen activity, and measuring the resulting emf using high impedance voltmeters (Solartron 7150+ or HP/Agilent 34401A). Several measures are taken to increase the sensitivity to and reliability of small voltages reflecting small transport numbers: each measurement is a time average after proper equilibration, in order to minimise noise. We always reverse the gradient and subtract the two measurements so as to eliminate thermal and other offsets. Some times we make measurements as a function of the magnitude of the gradient and extrapolate the transport number to zero gradient in order to minimise effects of varying transport numbers, of semi-permeability and electrode polarisation, and of leakages.
