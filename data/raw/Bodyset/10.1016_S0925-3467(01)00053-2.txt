                      films were fabricated on thermally grown SiO2 layers by reactive r.f. sputtering at room temperature. The working pressure was 5 mTorr, adjusted by changing Ar and O2 flow from 1:1 to 10:1. Post annealing was performed at the temperatures of 200°C, 300°C, 400°C, 450°C, and 500°C. Electrical resistivities of VO

                      films were measured at various temperatures from 25°C to 80°C and the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) was calculated for each film. The resistivity decreases with the increase of the annealing temperature and shows two steps of critical drops at 300°C and 450°C, respectively. This is attributed to the phase transitions of the as-deposited VO

However, the low resistance usually comes with the low TCR (responsivity). VO The work has been supported by the Brain Korea 21 project.
