Thickness- and morphology-controlled vanadium pentoxide/polyaniline (V2O5/PANI) core/shell hybrid nanofibers are fabricated by electropolymerization of PANI on V2O5 nanofibers for enhanced energy storage. By simply adjusting the electrodeposition time, the thickness of the PANI shells can be controlled from 5nm to 47nm, and the morphology can be changed from coaxial to branched. The influence of shell thickness on the improved Li-ion storage performance of the V2O5/PANI core/shell nanofibers is systematically investigated, and this enhancement of charge capability and cycling stability strongly varies with the shell thickness. Thickness-dependent synergistic electron transport, Li-ion diffusion distances, and shell mechanical strength mechanisms are also proposed. These results provide meaningful references for developing new functional core/shell materials and high-performance energy storage composite materials.Inorganic/organic hybrid materials stand at the important intersection between two fields of materials science, as these hybrids are creative alternatives for use in both academic research and innovative industrial applications Because of its unique advantages of high energy density In this work, using a V We have previous published the preparation of V The V The electrolyte for the electropolymerization of PPy was an ethanol solution containing 0.015 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to obtain crystallographic information using an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected with a FEI Helios Nanolab 600i at an acceleration voltage of 20  To more clearly investigate the core/shell structure of the V  Our results show that the PANI preferentially nucleates and grows along the V This developed synthesis strategy can be easily extended to other metal oxide/CP core/shell nanostructures by simply changing the morphology of the metal oxide materials or the type of CP used. To test this, we also used V Here, we believe that the electropolymerization coating method demonstrates several advantages over chemical oxidative polymerization coating process mainly in the following aspects: (1) electropolymerization coating process on metal oxide nanostructures is controlled by the solvophobic features of CPs and the electrostatic low-energy sites on the oxide surfaces, leading that this coating process is suitable for almost all metal oxide nanostructures as well as all CPs which can be prepared by electropolymerization; (2) the thickness and morphology of CP shells can be predictable when the polymerization time is chose, and the thickness of CP shells can be varied in a large range. On the other hand, it is undeniable that the electropolymerization coating method has a primary drawback. The substrates where the metal oxide nanostructures are on must be electric conductive. For investigating the influence of PANI shell thickness on the electrochemical performance of V This synergistic effect can be attributed to the improved electric conductivity of the electrode It is interesting to note that the charge capacity of the V In addition, the PANI shell thickness also influences the electrochemical performance of V In addition, as shown in the CV curves, the Li Cycling performance was investigated by CV measurements at scan rate of 1 To further elucidate their correlation, SEM studies were performed on these three samples after cycling tests. According to the above results, both the charge capacity and cycling performance of V In summary, we have demonstrated the fabrication of PANI shells onto V We thank Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article:
