In this study, a simulation of layout rearrangement in grinding/classification process was conducted to increase the throughput of an industrial plant processing 5.9 t/h of gold ore in Jeollanamdo province, Korea. The layout was rearranged to maintain the final product particle size while restoring the loss of throughput that has resulted from recent developments in mines. The process is composed of two-stage circuit, the first stage is an open circuit of the first ball mill and spiral classifier, and the second stage is a closed circuit of the second ball mill and hydrocyclone. Particle size distributions of each streams were predicted through simulation, using the population balance (PBM), Stokes’ and Plitt’s models for the ball mill, spiral classifier, and hydrocyclone, respectively. Lab-scale parameters for PBM were obtained by conducting batch grinding tests. The obtained lab-scale parameters were scaled-up using an empirical scale-up equation based on the industrial plant conditions. Using the obtained particle size distributions, the reduction ratio based on the 80% passing size was calculated to be 80.5 for the first ball mill, while it was only 1.19 for the second ball mill. To solve the process imbalance problem, a layout rearrangement that involves the switching of the first and second ball mills in the process was proposed. The final product was finer, with the 50% passing size reducing from 35

                     . The throughput of the industrial plant can therefore be increased by approximately 36% to 8 t/h. This study provides the guideline of the methodology which can help in adapting the simulation of layout rearrangement in the grinding/classification process for an industrial plant.Selection function of particle size interval Mass fraction of the particle size interval Breakage function from particle size interval Upper size of particle size interval Standard particle size Selection function parameter depending on the grinding condition Selection function parameter depending on the grinding condition Selection function parameter depending on the material characteristics Selection function parameter depending on the material characteristics Cumulative breakage function from particle size interval Breakage function parameter depending on the material characteristics Breakage function parameter depending on the material characteristics Breakage function parameter depending on the material characteristics Mass fraction less than the particle size interval Inner diameter of the industrial mill Inner diameter of the batch mill Ball diameter of the industrial mill Ball diameter of the batch mill Adjustment factor for the ball mill scale-up procedure (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) Adjustment factor for the scale-up concerning dry/wet grinding Ball filling ratio of the industrial mill Ball filling ratio of the batch mill Powder filling ratio of the industrial mill Powder filling ratio of the batch mill Critical mill rotational speed ratio of the industrial mill Critical mill rotational speed ratio of the batch mill Mass fraction of the ball diameter interval Maximum ball diameter in the ball diameter interval k Minimum ball diameter in the ball diameter interval k Maximum ball diameter in the ball mill Minimum ball diameter in the ball mill Adjustment factor for the ball wear rate Volume of the powder in the mill Volume of the void between balls in the mill Slurry volume below the pool level Slurry volume above the pool level Length of the ball mill The area of slurry pool The net area of the balls (excluding the interstices) below the pool Dynamic porosity The area of the active charge above the pool Radius of the mill Angle ∠AOP in Angle ∠EOC in Radial position of the charge inner surface Angle ∠TOP in Trunnion opening radius Slurry height inside the mill Height of slurry level above the discharge trunnion opening edge in Height of the stationary ball charge Distance between the stationary ball charge level and the lower trunnion opening edge Area of the stationary ball (including ball interstices) at the discharge end Angle ∠DOB in Angular displacement of toe position at the mill shell Fraction of the active charge of the total charge Angular displacement of shoulder position at the mill Time taken for a particle to move between the toe and shoulder within the charge Time taken for a particle to move between the shoulder and toe in free flight Mean value of rotational rate Mean radial position of the active charge Rotational rate at mill shell Fraction of theoretical critical speed at which centrifuging was fully developed Cut size of the classifier Rising velocity of the particle Apparent Viscosity of the fluid Density of the ore Pulp density in overflow Corrected cut size of the classifier Reynolds Number Geometric mean of the particle size interval Bypass of feed solid to U/F Classification sharpness parameter Imperfection of the classification Diameter of the hydrocyclone Diameter of the feed nozzle of the hydrocyclone Diameter of the overflow nozzle of the hydrocyclone Diameter of the underflow nozzle of the hydrocyclone Percent solids by volume in the feeding slurry Height of the hydrocyclone Volumetric flow rate Grinding is an energy-intensive process that accounts for up to 70% of the energy consumed during mineral processing ( Various simulation studies concerning the grinding/classification process in industrial plants have been conducted ( Based on these simulation studies, optimization of the productivity of the process has been attempted. The grinding process of molybdenum was also simulated ( This study investigated the grinding/classification process of an industrial gold ore plant in the Jeollanamdo province, Korea. The performance of the process depends heavily on the experience of operator because of the lack of optimal operating conditions ( The decreased throughput of the industrial grinding/classification process consequently decreased the overall production of the mineral processing plant. Therefore, the throughput should be increased to restore this production capacity. Considering that the recovery of the flotation process increases as feeding particles becomes finer, from 205 The process was analyzed using a simulation to identify the problem and predict the results of process modification. Phenomenological models such as PBM, Stokes’ and Plitt’s models were used for ball mill, spiral classifier, and hydrocyclone, respectively ( PBM is a phenomenological model that utilizes grinding kinetics and progeny particle size distribution. Particle size distribution of the product can be predicted quantitatively as a function of the grinding time. Eq. The selection function obtained for each particle size interval can be expressed by the empirical equation, Eq. The breakage function refers to the probability of grinding between particle size intervals To minimize the effect of particle re-breakage, a B II method (Eq. The scale-up equation for parameters depending on the grinding condition in the selection function can be expressed by Eq. However, because the ball diameter The powder filling ratio ( The area of the slurry pool ( The net area occupied by the balls ( The toe angle ( The area of the active charge above the pool ( Stokes’ model, which is based on the settling velocity of the particles, was used to represent the spiral classifier. When the pulp is injected into the settling pool, coarse particles settle because of the high velocity while fine particles rise because of the drag force. Stokes’ model helps in predicting the cut size using Stokes’ law, expressed by Eq. Using the calculated cut sizes, particle size distributions of the product were plotted on the Rosin-Rammler distribution as represented by Eq. Hydrocyclone is the most widely used classifier utilizing centrifugal force that accelerates settling velocity of a particle. Coarse particles are observed to underflow owing to centrifugal force while fine particles overflow because of the rising fluid. Plitt’s model is the most widely used model that is both empirical and mathematical and is expressed by Eq. This study mainly focused on Gasado ore. The density was measured to be 2.75 g/cm Lab-scale batch grinding tests were conducted to obtain lab-scale parameters for PBM. The outer layer of the batch ball mill was made of stainless-steel, whereas the inside was made of polyurethane and contained six rectangular liners. The inner diameter and length of the ball mill were both 20 cm, and the grinding media were steel balls with diameters of 2.54 cm. The The grinding time was set differently for each of the particle size intervals, considering that the specific breakage rate changes depending on the particle size. A linear regression method was used to calculate the grinding times that would obtain unbroken feed weight fractions of 80%, 50%, 10%, and 5%. The sample was initially ground for 0.5 min, to calculate the grinding time for obtaining an unbroken sample weight fraction of 80%. After this initial grinding time, the grinding times necessary to obtain each weight fraction of the unbroken sample were measured. The following grinding times are those that were determined for the 80%, 70%, 50%, 10% and 5% weight fractions, respectively, for each of the The grinding/classification process implemented by the industrial gold ore plant in Jeollanamdo province, Korea is composed of a two-stage circuit. The first stage is an open circuit of the first ball mill and a spiral classifier, while the second stage is a closed circuit of the second ball mill and a hydrocyclone, as shown in  Furthermore, the simulation results were adjusted when necessary to ensure that they agreed with the results obtained for the industrial plant. If the simulation and industrial results agreed, the process was analyzed based on the simulation results and modifications were proposed. Based on the lab-scale batch grinding tests and the industrial plant operating conditions, the grinding/classification process was simulated. A scaled-up procedure was performed separately because the USIM-PAC software that was used for the other scales does not provide a simulation for a scaled-up procedure. The simulation was performed using a commercial mineral processing software USIM-PAC 3.2 (© Caspeo/BRGM, France). Although other commercial software JKSimMET ( In this study, the PBM, Stokes, and Plitt models, which are included in USIM-PAC, were used for the ball mill, spiral classifier, and hydrocyclone, respectively. Several parameters were inputted for the PBM: the number of mills in parallel, the inner diameter and the length of the mill, the ball filling ratio, the mill rotational speed, the ball density, the mill discharge type, breakage, selection function, and the pulp density. Moreover, the input data for the Stokes model included the number of spiral classifiers in parallel, the length and the width of the spiral classifier, the pulp density, the decantation efficiency (useful area/total area), and the classifier type. Finally, the Plitt model used the following data for analyzing the hydrocyclone: the number of hydrocyclones in parallel; the diameter and height of the hydrocyclone; and data regarding the feed nozzle, overflow nozzle, and underflow nozzle of the hydrocyclone. Adjustments were made to ensure that the results of the simulated classification process matched with those of the industrial plant, regarding cut size and imperfection. To reduce the error in cut size and imperfection to be within 5%, the USIM-PAC adjustment parameters were modified. By analyzing the process through simulations, any potential issues in the process were investigated. Based on the investigated problems, a change in the process was proposed and the results of this change were predicted using simulations. This change consisted of a layout rearrangement to minimize costs. A schematic diagram of the layout rearrangement proposed in this study is shown in Lab-scale batch grinding tests were carried out with six mono-sized samples to determine the first-order kinetics of each of the particle size intervals ( However, first-order kinetics were not observed for interval The calculated selection function of each particle size is shown in The parameters for breakage function were also calculated for a 20 to 30% ground sample using non-linear programming methods. The calculated lab-scale parameters for PBM were scaled-up based on industrial plant operating conditions using Eq. The The scaled-up parameters based on industrial plant scale are listed in The corrected cut size was calculated using Eqs. The partition curves (   In addition, the process modification was proposed to address the process imbalance problem. To minimize the cost, layout rearrangement utilizing the existing equipment was considered. Starting from the points of reduction ratio gap, switching the first ball mill with large scale and second ball mill with smaller scale was considered. The large gap between the reduction ratios of the first and second ball mills could be decreased. Furthermore, the yield imbalance problem in the spiral classifier was expected to be resolved, because the feeding size was coarser than before. The particle size distributions of each of the streams of the proposed process, shown in In the case of the first ball mill, the particle size of the product based on 80% passing size was predicted to be 749 Because the process can be more efficient with the modification and the final product can be finer, the probability of the throughput increase was examined. It was predicted that the 50% passing size of the product in the current process would be reduced from 39 This study showed that simulation can be used to predict the effect of process modification. The grinding/classification process of the industrial gold ore plant was simulated, and layout rearrangement of the process was proposed. Moreover, the effect of layout rearrangement on throughput increase while maintaining the particle size of the final product was predicted quantitatively using simulation. PBM for the ball mill, Stokes’ model for the spiral classifier and Plitt’s model for the hydrocyclone were used. Particle size distributions of each of the streams were predicted using the previously mentioned models using simulations. The predicted particle size distributions of each of the streams were in agreement with the industrial results. Based on these simulation results, the grinding/classification process of the plant was analyzed. With respect to particle size based on the 80% passing size, the reduction ratio of the first ball mill even reached 80.5, while it reached only 1.19 for the second ball mill. In addition, in the case of mass balance for the spiral classifier, U/F yield was only predicted to be 9.5% while O/F yield was 91.5%. Based on these data points on particle size distributions and mass balance, it was confirmed that the process is not efficient. Therefore, a process modification was proposed where the first and the second ball mills are switched. In the proposed process, the reduction ratio of the first ball mill decreased from 80.4 to 21.7, while the reduction ratio of the second ball mill increased from 1.19 to 3.47. Moreover, in the case of spiral classifier, U/F yield was expected to increase from 9.5% to 78% while the O/F yield was expected to decrease from 90.5% to 22%. As a result, the final product of the proposed process is expected to be finer, where the 50% passing size reduced from 35  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
