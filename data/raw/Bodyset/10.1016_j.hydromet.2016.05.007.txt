As a part of our efforts towards better lanthanide recycling three novel polyamides (multicoordinate ligands) bearing tetrabutylmalonamide functional groups have been synthesized and evaluated for use as reagents for the solvent extraction of rare earth elements from nitrate media.
                  The pronounced improvement in the extraction of the trivalent lanthanides was observed for the tetraamide 2,2′-(1,2-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(N,N,N′,N′-tetrabutylmalonamide). The influence of nitrate and ligand concentrations on the distribution ratio of 152Eu is described for this tetraamide and potential compositions of the extracted metal complexes are proposed.Smartphones, computers, electric cars and bicycles, wind turbine generators and fluorescent lamps are all important in contemporary economies and in society. The large-scale production of such artifacts containing valuable rare earth elements (REEs) ( Recycling of end-of-life products is often technically and/or commercially challenging. For that reason the fraction of the REEs being recycled at the moment is close to negligible (< One possible method for the recycling of such materials is a hydrometallurgical treatment of wastes, which includes leaching of valuable metals with mineral acids followed by solvent extraction for isolation and separation of metals ( In recent decades a considerable effort has been expended on the design and synthesis of sustainable reagents complying with the ‘CHON’ principle ( However there is one significant disadvantage of the malonamides, namely their relatively modest distribution coefficients for f-block metal ions ( In the work described in this paper the possibility to improve the malonamides for lanthanide(III) extraction via increasing the number of amide groups (from two to three and four) in the extractant molecule was investigated. Tetrabutylmalonamide was used as a reference malonamide (the ‘parent’ molecule). Three novel polyamides (multicoordinate ligands) containing tetrabutylmalonamide functional groups have been synthesized and the effect of structural modifications of tetrabutylmalonamide on the solvent extraction of rare earth elements was evaluated. All reagents for synthesis were purchased from Aldrich and were used as supplied. All nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed using an Agilent400-VNMRS400 (400 All infra-red (IR) spectra were collected using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum Two FT-IR spectrometer, the resolution was set to 2 Microanalysis (CNH) was performed by Medac Ltd. Liquid scintillation cocktail (Emulsifier-Safe™ a high flash-point economy LSC-cocktail) was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. All liquid scintillation counting was performed in 7 Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer measurements were made using a iCAP Q spectrometer supplied by Thermo Scientific. Europium-152 nitrate was obtained from existing stocks at Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden) and used for spike extraction tests ( The inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to measure concentrations of metals in the radiotracer-free solvent extraction tests. A 150 In the experiments examining nitric acid extraction the volume of aqueous phase was increased to 600 All solvent extraction tests were performed in triplicate. The reported D ratios are the mean of three experiments. Four structurally related polyamides were prepared. The molecular structures of these compounds are represented in Synthesis of The diamide Synthesis of The triamide Synthesis of Sodium hydride (1.27 The Synthesis of 2,2′-(1,2-phenylenebis(methylene))bis( The tetraamide The tetraamide To the best of our knowledge the polyamides The polyamides The extraction equilibrium (1) is described with the observed equilibrium constant The cation M The formation of such complexes is described by the stability constants: The distribution ratio (D) of the cation M The total analytical concentration of the species in the aqueous layer The concentration of species extracted in the organic layer can be calculated from the material balance for the solvent extraction system: The combination of If the total concentration of nitrates in the aqueous phase doesn't change noticeably during the extraction of M The The radioactivity of samples was used in the In an initial test separate 20% v/v solutions of All of the compounds The ability of polyamides A separate test was also made for the adsorption of carrier-free radioactive europium onto the surfaces of the vial and the pipette tip, as < The hypothesis that the extractant was contaminated with a small trace of a substance very able to extract europium(III) was tested by performing an extraction experiment using equal volumes (300 The difference between the D ratios obtained for the ligand At this point it can be concluded that the increase in the number of amide groups in the malonamide ligands alone is not a sufficient condition for the improvement of its extraction efficiency, as was revealed for the triamides The diluent has a very pronounced effect on the distribution ratios of Eu(III) ( It was confirmed by preliminary kinetic studies that the concentration equilibrium in the system with the tetraamide The ammonium nitrate was used in all solvent extraction experiments to adjust the total concentration of nitrates in aqueous phase and thus to increase the distribution ratios of Like other malonamides, the tetraamide The change in the total nitrate concentration in the aqueous phase during the extraction of nitric acid is insignificant (~ The slope analysis ( Regarding the molecular structure of the extractant Solvent extraction of The distribution ratios of The nitric acid distribution between phases was not monitored in this experiment. Nevertheless the extraction of the acid has to be considered prior to determination of the composition of the {europium(III) — tetraamide The composition found experimentally of the {europium(III) —tetraamide The fractional value of the stoichiometric index [L] If we assume that europium(III) is extracted with the tetraamide The If the assumption of the formation of two Eu(III) complexes {Eu(NO From The observed equilibrium constants of extraction K The formation of such complexes of Eu(III) with the polyamide Extracted complexes of Nd(III) with malonamides having the ratios of Nd to malonamide (MA) from (1:2) to (1:4) were reported by Tian et al. ( The approach used to determine the stoichiometry of Eu(III) complexes with the tetraamide Finally the extraction properties of the polyamide The data obtained demonstrate high affinity and selectivity of the tetraamide Nitrobenzene is a toxic diluent that is undesirable in industrial applications. It was chosen as a diluent for academic research as in contrast to kerosene (Solvent-70) no liquid third phase formation occurred during the solvent extraction of trivalent lanthanides with the tetraamide It has been clearly demonstrated in this study that the affinity of the malonamides for trivalent lanthanides can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of amide groups in the extractant molecule. Thus the extraction efficiency of the novel tetraamide Our results on the modification of molecular structure of the malonamides with the aim of improving solvent extraction abilities could serve as a guideline for the design of new efficient ligands for trivalent f-block elements.
