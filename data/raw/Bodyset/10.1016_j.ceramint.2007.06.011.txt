Four types of commercial silicon nitride (Si3N4) powders with poor dispersibilities have been studied, and influences of acid leaching, surface hydrolysis, and thermal oxidation on the aqueous dispersibilities for the powders have been investigated systematically, in conjunction with their DRIFT spectra and soluble counterions. Soluble counterions (especially high-valency counterions) and particle surface groups have proved to be the two crucial factors that determine the aqueous dispersibility of Si3N4 powders. A universal modification method involving surface hydrolysis and subsequent thermal oxidation gives the different Si3N4 powders similar, and excellent, dispersibilities.Homogeneous slurries with high solids loading and low viscosity are necessary for the ceramic colloidal forming process, because solids loading highly influences the density, strength, and homogeneity of green bodies. For example, the minimum solids loading of suspensions should be >50 Oxide powders, such as Al The surface characteristics and aqueous dispersibility of commercial Si The four types of commercial α-Si The total oxygen content of the powders was determined by the inert-gas-fusion method, using an O/N determinator (Model TC-436, LECO, St. Joseph, MI). To determine the bulk oxygen content, the powders were leached in 5% HF (1 The acid cleaning procedure was as follows: the mixture of as-received Si For the particle surface hydrolysis process, the ratio of Si For thermal oxidation treatment, the Si   The DRIFT spectra of the powders after acid cleaning and thermal oxidation are shown in According to the Schulze-Hardy rule According to the present experimental results and previous investigations For powder UBE, the ion conductivity and (Ca  The rheological curves of the 50  After the Si The DRIFT spectra of the powders after surface hydrolysis and thermal oxidation are plotted in Thus, the numbers of amine structures (Si The DRIFT spectra for the siloxane groups of the samples after surface hydrolysis and thermal oxidation are shown in The Si–OH groups then dissolve into the aqueous solution, and a fresh Si In the present study, the hydrolyzed powders were dried directly at 150 According to The rheological properties of the suspensions of the HO-treated powders with solids loading of 55 The aqueous dispersibility of the four types of as-received Si Soluble counterions (especially high-valency counterions) and particle surface groups are the two crucial factors that determine the aqueous dispersibility of silicon nitride powders. The process of surface hydrolysis and subsequent thermal oxidation (HO) is a universal method for preparing silicon nitride suspensions with high solids loading. After HO-treatment, the four types of silicon nitride powders used in the present study showed similar, excellent dispersibilities, and the solids loading of their aqueous slurries was >50
