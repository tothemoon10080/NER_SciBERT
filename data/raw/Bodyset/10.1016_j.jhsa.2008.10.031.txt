Two patients with high-energy elbow injuries were diagnosed with minimally displaced partial fractures of the radial head that subsequently displaced and were noted to be Essex-Lopresti injuries. The true complexity and instability of the fractures were not immediately obvious. High-energy partial radial head fractures may merit closer observation and evaluation for associated forearm ligament injury.
