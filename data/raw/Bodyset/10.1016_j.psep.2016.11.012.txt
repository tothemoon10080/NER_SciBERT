Iron ore sintering is the main SO2 emission process in iron and steel industry. The flue gas of iron ore sintering has been cleaned by desulfurization equipment, which causes high capital and operation cost. A novel technology of reducing SO2 emission of flue gas during iron ore sintering process by adding urea into granules bed was investigated in this paper. The results show that the emission concentration of SO2 in flue gas decreased significantly by adding urea loaded in the bed. The desulfurization rate higher than 85% was obtained when 0.05% urea was added in the bed at the height of 70–150mm from the bed bottom, and there is no adverse influence on sintering indexes and final sinter quality.Iron ore sintering is used all over the world to prepare agglomerates for the ironmaking blast furnace ( The iron ore sintering process has been recognized as one of major industry emission sources of SO The typical desulfurization technologies of sintering flue gas includes: lime–gypsum solution, ammonia–ammonium sulfate solution, circulation fluidized bed method ( The raw materials of sintering pot tests were taken from a commercially running sintering plant. The chemical compositions of raw materials were listed in Sintering pot is a simulation equipment of commercially sintering machine, as shown in The mass of SO The desulfurization rate ( Yield ( The tumbling index (  Compared with the SO The influence of urea location on flue gas desulfurization is presented in The sintering indexes in the absence/presence of urea are listed in The SO  Ammonia dissolves in water easily and a large number of oxygen contained in exhaust gas. Therefore, the reactions were described in wetting layer of sintering materials as follows.  During the igniting process, corresponding to stage I, a small peak SO In this paper, the SO For the absence of urea, SO Addition with urea obviously decreased the second peak of SO During the final stage of sintering, SO The authors are thankful to the
