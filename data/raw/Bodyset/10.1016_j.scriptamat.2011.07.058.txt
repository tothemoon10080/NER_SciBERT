Cu6Sn5 is an important intermetallic compound used in lead-free soldering and anode materials for Li-ion batteries. Cu6Sn5 exists in at least two crystal structures, with a transformation from hexagonal η-Cu6Sn5 at temperatures higher than ∼186°C to monoclinic η′-Cu6Sn5 at lower temperatures. Using variable temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis, the kinetics of the η–η′ transformation are investigated and a time–temperature transformation diagram is partially developed. The significance of the results in terms of phase and dimensional stability in solder joints are discussed. Based on the reported Sn–Cu binary phase diagram Ghosh and Asta Recent research has begun to explore the influence of alloying additions on the η This paper investigates the kinetics of the η To obtain Cu The samples were crushed in an agate mortar to obtain powder for X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments. The samples were powdered and loaded into a quartz capillary tube (0.3    The combined experimental data relating to the transformation can be seen in As the theoretical densities of the η and η′ phases at room temperature are 8.448 and 8.270 In conclusion, using synchrotron powder XRD with an incorporated rapid heating/cooling system, a TTT diagram for Cu
