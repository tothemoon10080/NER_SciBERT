Calcific aortic valve disease is the most common indication for surgical valve replacement in the United States. However, the number of patients that go undiagnosed is staggering ( The presence of calcification in the aortic valve is responsible for valve stenosis ( Stewart et al. ( Interestingly, although the serum phosphate levels correlated with cardiovascular calcification, they were also directly proportional to the low-density lipoprotein levels and inversely proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. The most common cause of elevated levels of serum phosphate is reduced urinary excretion with reduced renal function (
