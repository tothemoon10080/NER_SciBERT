Stable polycrystalline perovskite phase is obtained at a processing temperature of 1150°C, which is lower than the processing temperature of conventional solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows a systematic peak shift with increasing Zr content, indicating incorporation of Zr in BST lattice. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) is done to investigate microstructure of the pellets. The diffusivity parameter (γ) and the standard deviation from the Curie–Weiss law have also been investigated as a function of Zr. The polarization vs electric field shows a decrease in remnant polarization with increasing Zr content.Barium titanate (BaTiO In the present work, we report the structural, dielectric and ferroelectric properties of BSZT ceramics as a function of Zr content. Ba BSZT powders with different Zr contents were obtained from sols, prepared using barium acetate (Ba(CH    A diffuse phase transition is generally characterized by broadening of the dielectric constant maximum at the transition temperature, a large separation between the maxima of dielectric constant and dielectric loss and a deviation from the Curie–Weiss law in the vicinity of The parameter ‘ For diffuse phase transition, Curie–Weiss law is modified as  Diffuse phase transition can be induced by factors such as microscopic composition fluctuation and local disorder mode through the local strain The variation of electric polarization with applied field is shown in Ba
