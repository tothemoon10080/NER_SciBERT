Mono has been manufacturing progressing cavity pumps since 1935. Combining reliable performance with value for money, the pumps can accommodate a vast range of liquids with various viscosities, even those containing suspended solids and abrasive particles. The smooth, non-pulsating flow ensures that shear sensitive products can be handled, whilst no air locking also makes them suitable for gaseous fluids.
