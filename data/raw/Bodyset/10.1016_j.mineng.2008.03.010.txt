This Special Issue presents selected papers from the conference that collectively form a coherent volume that should be of practical use to those active in the field. Remarkably, given the coincidence of other international conferences in the Precious Metals area at the time, the papers were generally of high standard and consistently presented innovative developments in the field. Traversing the key topics of assay and characterization techniques, leaching systems, and recovery systems, the papers can be seen as a snapshot of where the industry may be headed into the future. Sponsors Diemme Filtration have shown a great commitment to innovation in the metals and minerals industry, illustrated within several of the conference discussions, and they have gone a long way to making this Special Issue of Minerals Engineering possible. The conference, while small, succeeded in bringing together process engineers, researchers and technology providers, resulting in very lively discussions after almost every paper presentation. The referees who put in significant effort to make this Special Issue possible are also most gratefully acknowledged. The papers covering characterization techniques illustrated the increasing sophistication of both instrumental techniques and applications â€“ QEMSCAN One factor that may continue to spur innovative research is clear. Perusal of trends in precious metals prices over the past five years reveals very significant increases, particularly in gold, platinum and rhodium prices. The effect of this is twofold: an increase in potential research and development funding, and an added motivation to develop processes for the recovery of precious metals from lower-grade and more refractory materials. Consideration of the papers from
