3-Amyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione (AATT) reacted with Cu2+ or Pb2+ ions in aqueous solutions to form CuAATT and Pb(AATT)2 complexes and their solubility product constants were measured as 10−16.17 and 10-20.60, respectively. In the moderately-alkaline media, both chalcopyrite and galena chemisorbed AATT on to their surfaces, and the adsorption amount of AATT on chalcopyrite was bigger than that on galena, which rendered a stronger hydrophobization toward chalcopyrite. While under the high-alkaline pulp, AATT only chemisorbed on chalcopyrite, not on galena. The micro-flotation findings indicated that AATT was a favorable collector for flotation enrichment of chalcopyrite and galena at pH <11.0, and realized an efficient flotation separation of chalcopyrite from galena under pH>11.5. The CuAATT complex was more insoluble than Pb(AATT)2, which implied a stronger affinity of AATT toward chalcopyrite than galena and returned their selective flotation separation at the high-alkaline condition.Copper and lead are the widely used metals in modern society Just like mercaptobenzo heterocyclic chelators, 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione compounds possess the S or N atoms in their amino-triazole-thione structure, which renders them to own the inherent affinity to bond transition metals such as Cu or Pb In this paper, the flotation experiments for the single and artificially-mixed minerals of chalcopyrite and galena were performed by using 3-amyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione (AATT) collector. The potential flotation mechanism of AATT towards galena and chalcopyrite were farther investigated through solubility product constant measurement, adsorption experiment, contact angle, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Based on the experimental findings, the selective adsorption of AATT toward chalcopyrite against galena was discussed and the implication for their selective flotation separation was discussed. AATT as shown in The XRD (D8 ADVANCEX-ray diffractometer, Bruker corporation, Germany) and XRF (S4 PIONERX-ray fluorometer, Bruker) for the hand-picked high-pure chalcopyrite and galena samples are shown in The chalcopyrite or galena slice with good crystallinity was wet-polished by hand sequentially with SiC paper and nano-Al The dissociation equation of AATT (being represented by The acid dissociation constant Take the negative logarithm on both sides to reach Eq. According to the quantitative relationship between concentration ( Combining Eq.s AATT solution (50 The solubility product constant of Cu/Pb-AATT complexes was determined according to the following steps: The micro-flotation procedures were similar with the reported method The JC2000C equipment (Zhongchen Digital, China) was applied in measuring contact angle 0.5 The adsorption amount of AATT was calculated according to the difference between its initial and residual concentration, which is shown in the Eq. FTIR detection was carried out on a FTIR-740 spectrometer (Nicolet corporation, USA) The measured melting range of AATT was located at 101.5∼102.4   As observed from The pH of AATT and metal ion solutions and their mixture is shown in The UV spectra of AATT and its mixture with copper or lead ions are listed in The chemical analysis results of the Cu-AATT and Pb-AATT precipitates are shown in After shaking 50 The dissolution equation and solubility product formula of the CuAATT and Pb(AATT) According to Eqs. (2), (10) and (11), the solubility product constant K The pK The flotation behaviors of chalcopyrite and galena by using AATT collector are listed in In flotation of the artificially-mixed minerals, the mass proportion of chalcopyrite and galena was set as 1:1. To simulate the practical industrial flotation, the CaO-saturated solution was adopted to adjust the suspension’s pH  The adsorption amount of AATT on the surface of chalcopyrite and galena is displayed in The FTIR spectra of AATT, Cu-AATT and Pb-AATT precipitates, and chalcopyrite or galena before and after AATT treatment are presented in  AATT reacted with copper and lead ions in aqueous solutions to generate AATT complexes. While, the CuAATT FTIR recommended that both chalcopyrite and galena chemisorbed AATT on their surfaces in the moderately-alkaline media, while under the high-alkaline media, AATT only chemisorbed on chalcopyrite, not on galena. The XPS In addition, AATT exhibited the bigger absorption density and stronger hydrophobization toward chalcopyrite than galena, especially in the high-alkaline pulp. As a result, AATT achieved a favorable flotation separation of chalcopyrite from its mixture with galena under pH In this work, the reaction products of AATT with Cu In aqueous solutions, AATT reacted with Cu FTIR recommended that both chalcopyrite and galena chemisorbed AATT on their surfaces in the moderately-alkaline media, while at the high pH, AATT only chemisorbed on chalcopyrite, not on galena. The adsorption affinity of AATT toward chalcopyrite was stronger than that toward galena, which returned a stronger hydrophobization to chalcopyrite. The micro-flotation results demonstrated that AATT was a favorable collector for flotation enrichment of chalcopyrite and galena at pH The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
