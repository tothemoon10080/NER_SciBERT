Field emission properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) deposited by electrophoresis were investigated. Uniform deposition of CNTs on 1×1cm2 of Ti substrate was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, in case of CNTs synthesized by arc discharge, purification of CNTs was also obtained due to the higher electrophoretic velocity of carbon nanotubes than those of other carbon species. It indicates that electrophoresis can be used as the purification method of CNTs. As the result of I–V measurement, CNTs synthesized by arc discharge showed the lowest turn-on-field (J=30nA/cm2) of 1.77V/μm. On the other hand, CNTs synthesized by vapor phase growth showed a little higher turn-on-field of 2.28V/μm. Moreover, turn-on-field of acid treated CNTs had the highest value of 2.77V/μm. These differences might result from the difference in the electrical conductivity as well as the structural quality of CNTs such as wall and caps structures, radius, defect density, and density of CNTs.Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated as field electron emission sources for field emission displays (FEDs), cathode ray tubes (CRTs), backlights for liquid crystal displays, outdoor displays, and traffic signals MWNTs were synthesized by two methods: one is arc discharge with a graphite anode, which was evaporated in He ambient; the other is vapor phase growth in that C  We compare the field emission properties of the above three samples. Useful parameters for such a comparison are the turn-on field, MWNTs were deposited uniformly on Ti substrate by electrophoresis. In addition, in the case of MWNTs synthesized by arc discharge, purification of MWNTs was also occurred. Field emission properties of MWNTs significantly depended on the electrical conductivity as well as the structural quality of MWNTs. This work was supported by BK21 program.
