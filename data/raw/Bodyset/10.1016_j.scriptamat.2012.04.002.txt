The phase-separation behavior of the Gd–(Hf,Ti,Y)–Co–Al system has been investigated. The Gd–(Hf,Ti)–Co–Al system undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation during quenching and solidifies into either a Gd-rich phase or a Hf-rich phase (or a TiCo crystalline phase) while the Gd–Y–Co–Al alloy forms a monolithic amorphous state. To investigate the influences of the feature of phase separation and the role of alloying elements on the magnetic properties, the temperature and field dependence of magnetization have also been measured. The composition Gd  The temperature dependence of the magnetization curves for the Gd–(Hf,Ti,Y)–Co–Al ribbons measured in an applied field of 100 Oe is shown in These values agree very well with the calculated magnetic moment per formula unit The strength of the magnetic coupling of individual Gd magnetic moments via the conduction electrons of the host metal is strongly affected by the Gd concentration and the composition of the matrix alloy and the phase morphology has to be taken into account when analyzing the evolution of Further, we calculated the hypothetical effective magnetic moment The experimentally determined effective magnetic moments are only slightly larger than the calculated values (see In summary, the Gd The values of ordered magnetic moment per formula unit
