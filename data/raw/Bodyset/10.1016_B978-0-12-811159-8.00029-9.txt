 This volume is a collection of state-of-the-art articles covering fundamental processes and the current state of knowledge on magmatic ore deposits. We expect that the primary audience for this book will be geologists, geochemists, exploration geologists, and volcanologists, as well as practitioners from the mining and metallurgical industry, ore metal processing, and mineral beneficiation groups. This volume has been edited with the idea in mind that it can be used as a reference book both for research work and regular course work, extending the audience both to research scholars and dissertation students. We also expect that the edited volume will provide knowledge and new concepts helpful to exploration geologists targeting new metal prospects. The volume also contains updated knowledge on the fundamental processes responsible for magmatic ore deposits, the relationships between tectonic settings and magmatic ore mineralization, links between magmatic ore mineralization and processes in the mantle (both shallow and deep) versus the crust, as well as the changing patterns in magmatic ore mineralization through time, and their bearing on the chemical evolution of the Earthâ€™s mantle and crust. The book covers a wide range of topics, which are organized thematically. Begg et al. (
