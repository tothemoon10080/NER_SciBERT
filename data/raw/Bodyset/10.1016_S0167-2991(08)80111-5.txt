Naphtha reforming catalysts have long been used in the petroleum refinery industry. In spite of their good performance, refineries, driven by the demand for high octane fuels, have been looking for ways of improving reformer performance by either enhancing the octane number of the product or lengthening the catalyst life, i.e., decreasing coke rate. A potential way of meeting these goals would be an improvement of catalytic properties of the reforming catalysts by the addition of zeolites. With this concept in mind, the n-heptane reforming over Pt-Re/Al2O3 and with the addition of different zeolite structures has been extensively studied under deactivation conditions. Factors such as the amount, nature, acidity and mode of zeolite addition were extensively investigated.
