Rare-earth concentrate obtained through mineral processing of rare-earth ore was characterized by a high rare-earth content and various rare-earth minerals. To effectively recover rare earth from the rare-earth concentrate, a novel method of enriching rare-earth elements and separating the RE-rich phases from Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate by super gravity was proposed in current study. The mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases and the migrations of rare earth in various phases with temperature rising were investigated. The variations of mineralogical compositions and microstructures indicated the rare-earth phases transformed into fine britholite, cerium oxyfluoride, rare-earth ferrate and monazite particles at a low temperature range of 1423 K–1523 K, which transformed further into lager equiaxed cerium oxyfluoride crystals and most rare-earth elements enriched into the cerium oxyfluoride phase significantly at a higher temperature range of 1573 K–1773 K. Consequently, separation of the RE-rich phases was carried out at the high temperature range in a super-gravity filed, and the cerium oxyfluoride phase and the britholite containing slag phase were effectively separated by super gravity.Rare-earth elements (RE) are known as the industrial vitamin, which have wide application in all walks of life Generally speaking, the iron concentrate and the rare-earth concentrate were obtained respectively through the multistage fine-grinding and mineral processing of rare-earth ore, and the iron concentrate with a high iron content was used further as a raw material of Blast Furnace process for extracting iron In view of the similar ionic radii of various rare-earth elements and the diversity between the rare earth and other elements Moreover, if the RE-rich phases could be separated directly from other minerals at a specific high temperature, at which the rare-earth elements enriched into a solid phase while other minerals form into molten slag, it would be beneficial for effectively separating the two different phases, whereas it was infeasible to accomplish this task under the conventional conditions. Ramshaw The super-gravity field used in current study was generated by a centrifugal apparatus as illustrated in The rare-earth concentrate obtained by multistage magnetic-flotation separations process of Bayan Obo ore was employed as the raw material in current study. The chemical compositions of the raw material were measured by the XRF method and calculated further through weighted mean method as listed in  Mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases with temperature rising The mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases and the migrations of rare earth in various phases with temperature rising were investigated by hot-quenching method at different temperature ranges combined with various off-line analysis methods. 200 g rare-earth concentrate powder were filled in 10 magnesia crucibles with an inner diameter of 18 mm and a high of 60 mm evenly, which were sequentially heated to 1323 K, 1373 K, 1423 K, 1473 K, 1523 K, 1573 K, 1623 K, 1673 K, 1723 K and 1773 K under argon atmosphere in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 1 K/min, respectively. After heating at each targeted temperature for 30 min, the magnesia crucibles were taken out and water-quenched immediately. Thereafter, the samples were measured by the X-ray diffraction method (XRD, monochromatized CuK Separation of RE-rich phases in a super gravity field Based on the mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases and the migrations of rare earth in various phases, the separation experiments of the RE-rich phases were carried out further in a super-gravity field generated by the centrifugal apparatus. 20 g rare-earth concentrate powder were placed into a same magnesia crucible and heated to 1623 K in the heating furnace of centrifugal apparatus for 10 min to make other minerals forming molten slag while keep RE-rich phases in a solid state, and then the centrifugal apparatus was started and adjusted to an angular velocity of 1625 r/min to achieve gravity coefficient of  Mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases The variations in the mineral compositions and microstructures of various rare-earth phases in Bayan Obo concentrate with temperature rising are shown in With temperature increasing further to a higher temperature range of 1573 K–1773 K as shown in Migrations of rare earth in various phases Moreover,  Characterization of macro and micro structures To further separate the RE-rich phases from rare-earth concentrate, isothermal separation experiments were carried out at the high temperature range of 1573 K–1773 K in a super-gravity field. As the macrograph and micrograph of the samples obtained by super gravity with gravity coefficient of Components of the separated samples by super gravity Furthermore, the chemical compositions of the separated samples obtained by super gravity are given in With respect to the Stokes' law As described in Subsequently, some works on adequately enriching rare-earth elements into the specified RE-rich phase with a simple composition, efficiently separating the RE-rich phase enhanced by super gravity, and effectively extracting rare earth from the RE-rich phase are needed to improve further the extraction efficiency of rare earth. In this paper, a novel method of enriching rare-earth elements and separating the RE-rich phases from rare-earth concentrate by super gravity was proposed. The Bayan Obo rare-earth concentrate was employed as the raw material, the mineral evolutions of rare-earth phases and the migrations of rare earth in various phases with temperature rising, and separation of the RE-rich phases in a super-gravity field were investigated. The following conclusions can be drawn: It was indicated by the mineral evolutions results that the rare-earth phases transformed from original bastnaesite and monazite minerals into fine britholite, cerium oxyfluoride, rare-earth ferrate and monazite particles at 1423 K–1523 K, which transformed further into lager equiaxed cerium oxyfluoride crystals at 1573 K–1773 K, and most rare-earth elements enriched into the cerium oxyfluoride phase significantly. In a super-gravity field, all the cerium oxyfluoride crystals concentrated as the cerium oxyfluoride phase along the super-gravity direction and effectively separated from the britholite containing slag phase, and the mass fractions of ∑ReO and CeO This study is supported by the
