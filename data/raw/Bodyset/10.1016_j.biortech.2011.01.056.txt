The IFBB process, which separates biomass into a press fluid for biogas production and a press cake for combustion, is aimed at converting low-input high-diversity grasslands into energy, which is problematic with conventional conversion techniques. Herbage from a lowland hay meadow (Arrhenaterion) was sampled on eight dates between 24 April and 21 June 2007. Silage from each date was processed in six treatments without and with hydrothermal conditioning at different temperatures. The impact on mass flows of plant compounds and on elemental concentrations in the press cake was investigated. Elements detrimental for combustion were significantly reduced in the press cake compared to the silage. Mass flows and elemental concentrations in the press cake were strongly influenced by conditioning temperature as well as concentration of neutral detergent fiber and dry matter in the silage (R
                     2 from 0.70 to 0.99). Press cakes of late sampling dates were considered best suitable for combustion.Energy from biomass is a contemporary issue in science and politics. The growing demand for energy worldwide, as well as the limited and unstable supply of fossil fuels, is responsible for increasing energy prices. Furthermore, constantly increasing CO Grassland plays an important role as part of the world’s biomass potential, since 26% of the total land area and 68% of the agricultural area is covered by permanent pastures and meadows ( However, both techniques face important limitations with regard to low-input high-diversity (LIHD) grassland. In the case of biogas production, these are associated with ligno-cellulose compounds, which are resistant to anaerobic digestion and inhibit the fermentation of readily digestible compounds through their inclusion. In consequence, the methane yields and the conversion efficiencies are low ( As for the combustion of hay, major limitations result from the production and from the chemical composition of hay. The process of haymaking is strongly dependent on good weather conditions for achieving dry matter (DM) contents of about 850 With the aim of overcoming the problems outlined above, the Integrated Generation of Solid Fuel and Biogas from Biomass (IFBB) was developed ( The PC achieves DM concentrations of about 450–500 Previous studies on the conversion of extensively managed grassland vegetations by the IFBB technique only comprised single sampling dates and a low range of temperatures during hydrothermal conditioning ( The grass silage consisted of herbage from a permanent sub-montane hay meadow ( Biomass was sampled and ensiled on eight consecutive dates of a prolonged spring cut (27/04, 02/05, 09/05, 16/05, 24/05, 31/05, 11/06, and 21/06). The sampling period was intended to cover the whole range of maturity stages possibly occurring at the first cut of this extensively managed grassland, from an early cutting date, commonly applied to intensively managed swards, over the traditional cutting date at the beginning of June to a late cutting date, commonly applied to LIHD grasslands. Due to technical constraints, an additional ninth sampling date, which was planned to be on 03/07, could not be carried out. Due to weather conditions, the interval between samplings varied from 7 to 12 The six barrels of silage from each sampling date were pooled, thoroughly mixed and subjected to six different treatments of hydrothermal conditioning. One treatment was the direct mechanical dehydration without hydrothermal conditioning, the other five treatments comprised hydrothermal conditioning at different temperatures (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 The silage and the PC were analyzed for K, Mg, Ca, Cl, S and P by X-ray fluorescence analysis, for N using an elemental analyzer (EA 1106, Carlo Erba Ltd., Rodano, Italy) and for the organic constituents crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) according to standard methods ( The concentration of any chemical compound (represented by Z; g The mass flow (MF) of a substance into the PF is defined as the proportion of this substance’s concentration in the silage, which is transferred into the PF after mechanical dehydration and is given in a dimensionless figure between 0 and 1. The MF of DM (Eq. (1)) and of any other compound (Z) (Eq. (2)) from the silage into the PF was determined by: Analysis of variance was performed to test the effect of hydrothermal conditioning before mechanical dehydration on the mass flows of plant compounds into the PF and on elemental concentrations in the PC. This was done by the comparison of two treatments, mechanical dehydration without conditioning and mechanical dehydration after conditioning at 10 Multiple regression analysis was performed to test the effect of chemical constituents in the parent silage on mass flows during mechanical dehydration and on the elemental concentrations in the PC, using the procedure GLM in SAS ( The selection of terms for inclusion in the model either as main effects, quadratic term or twofold interaction depended on standard statistical model selection methods ( Fresh matter (FM) yield of the sward increased from 7.9 The accumulation of biomass in t DM ha A continuous decrease with proceeding growth was detected for the concentrations of K (26.8–17.4 Few studies have dealt with the concentrations of mineral elements in grassland swards at different stages of maturity ( PF after mechanical dehydration without hydrothermal conditioning (PF Proportionately, 0.09–0.23 of the DM contained in the silage was transferred into the PF during mechanical dehydration without hydrothermal conditioning (PF Mass flows of DM and ash were higher compared to an experiment with five semi-natural grassland swards, where the biomass was sampled in July and August at a higher stage of maturity, and mass flows of 0.3 and 0.44 were obtained for DM and ash, respectively, in a treatment with hydrothermal conditioning at 60 In order to conserve the productivity of grasslands over a long time, nutrients exported with the harvest need to be replaced. The transformation of carbon from PF into methane and from PC into solid fuel does not allow an appreciable return of carbon. However, as grassland plants transfer 0.30–0.50 of assimilates below ground and mineralization processes on permanent grassland occur at very low rates, a net accumulation of carbon in the soil is accomplished ( Regarding essential plant nutrients, 0.62–0.68 of N, 0.84–0.90 of P, 0.86–0.91 of K, 0.70–0.75 of Mg, 0.59–0.65 of Ca, and 0.70–0.75 of S in the herbage were transferred into the PF and were thus available for the replacement of nutrients withdrawn with the sampling. Through the anaerobic digestion process, organically bound elements are mineralized and increase the short-term fertilization effect in comparison to conventional organic fertilizers, such as slurry or manure from animal husbandry ( In a monitoring program of 96 Austrian biogas plants, mean concentrations in the digestates were determined for K (66.5 The repeated measurement ANOVA showed significant treatment (T) and sampling period (SP) effects for mass flows of all plant compounds in PF ( As part of the dehydration of the silage, plant cells which contain the liquid phase have to be macerated before the separation of solid and liquid can take place. Screw presses, which provide a high degree of maceration of cell walls due to axial movement and abrasion of the tissue under high pressure, are also used in bio-refineries, where lactic acids and amino-acids are extracted from herbage ( When sampling date was replaced by fiber concentration, prediction accuracy of regression equations was highest when NDF was used as a variable representing sward maturity. Pearson’s correlation test between NDF and DM in the silage showed a low correlation coefficient ( DM in the silage had a negative impact on mass flow in the PF of DM, K and N ( The multiple regression models showed that the main parameters influencing the mass flow are the temperature of hydrothermal conditioning as well as the NDF and DM concentrations of the silage. High temperatures of hydrothermal conditioning might contribute to a better maceration of the cell walls compared to low temperatures, which was also found by Through mechanical dehydration without hydrothermal conditioning, the DM concentration of the press cake (PC Hydrothermal conditioning resulted in a significant ( Although the parameter settings of the conditioning unit and screw press were identical, the DM concentrations of the PC According to According to Overall PC combustion quality was superior at late sampling dates compared to early sampling dates. Hence, PC pellets of late cutting dates, corresponding to extensively managed grasslands, were considered to be suitable as solid biofuel according to European standard EN 14961 ( DM concentration in the silage had no marked effect on the DM level in PC ( The models obtained by multiple regression analysis for DM, ash and Cl concentration in PC had low Increasing temperatures of hydrothermal conditioning led to increasing mass flows into press fluids and decreasing concentrations of elements detrimental for combustion in press cakes. Increasing sward maturity further reduced element concentrations, but showed inconsistent effects on mass flows. NDF (representing sward maturity) and DM in the silage and temperature of hydrothermal conditioning were strong predictors of mass flows (
