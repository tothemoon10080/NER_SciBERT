We have investigated the hydrogen gas sensing performance of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) grafted with Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The SWCNTs, modified with dendrimers before grafting, were found to have a much faster response time (3s) and better recovery but lower response (8.6%) at 10,000ppm hydrogen gas than those prepared without the dendrimer template (253s, 25%). This can be ascribed to the dipole moments induced by the dendrimers. Removal of the dendrimers by heat treatment resulted in high response (25%), a fast response time (7s) at 10,000ppm hydrogen gas, and an ultra-low concentration H2 detection of 10ppm at room temperature. In addition, this sample was found to satisfy Sievert's law. Our results demonstrate that SWCNTs grafted with Pd-NPs through a dendrimer-mediated process can be used to fabricate highly sensitive hydrogen gas sensors that exhibit a broad dynamic detection range, fast response times, and excellent recovery.Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) became an important research topic with the publication of the landmark paper by Iijima In particular, research suggests that CNTs might be ideal materials for gas adsorption and detection because of their hollow centers, size, and large surface area Molecular sensing requires strong interaction between the sensor material and target molecules. In the case of hydrogen, however, pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) hardly interact with hydrogen gas In a few reported cases, metal NPs were templated and stabilized on the surface of CNTs with the aid of dendrimers SWCNTs (diameter: 1.0–1.2 To fabricate devices based on the three types of sample sensors, Samples I, II, and III, a 20-nm thick Ti film and a 100-nm thick Au film were deposited on a thermally oxidized Si(1 The hydrogen gas sensing experimental setup consisted of a sealed chamber (∼250 We synthesized dendrimers on SWCNTs by reacting ethylenediamine and a coupling agent with the carboxylic groups on the surfaces of the SWCNTs via amide formation (see Raman spectroscopy revealed characteristic differences between the G bands for metallic and semiconducting CNTs. G bands comprise a G The Pd-NPs grown on the surface of Sample II in aqueous solution were uniform in size, with a diameter of 3.3 We investigated the hydrogen gas sensing performance of Sample I, Sample II and Sample III. The density of Pd-NPs in Sample I was found to be very low. However, Sample II and Sample III were observed to have higher Pd-NPs densities than Sample I. The reason for this is the 3-dimensional structure of dendrimers, which act as hosts for Pd-NPs Representative electrical resistance ratios (  This relationship is called Sievert's law, where We discuss the H Pd-NPs-functionalized SWCNTs have been known to remarkably enhance the hydrogen gas detecting response of SWCNTs In contrast with Sample I, Sample II showed enhanced H To optimize the H We successfully functionalized Pd nanoparticles (NPs) on the surfaces of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by dendrimer-mediated synthesis using NH This work was supported by the Agency for Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
