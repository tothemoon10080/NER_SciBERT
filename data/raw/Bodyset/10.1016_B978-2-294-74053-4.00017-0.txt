Arthritis affects the patellofemoral joint less than the femorotibial compartments of the knee. Similar to arthritis of the femorotibial compartment, osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint is found predominantly in females (72%) with 51% of the patients having bilateral symptoms. The average age at the time of the first symptoms is 46 years. The radiological evolution is slow, with an average time interval of 18 years from Iwano stage I to stage IV. Four aetiologies have been identified :

               The main predisposing factor is the presence of a dysplasia in the patellofemoral joint. 78% of patients have a trochlear dysplasia with a crossing sign, and many of them have type B or D trochlear dysplasia.
               The indication for treatment must take in account the very slow progression of this specific arthritis, it is really important to analyze the aetiology because the natural history differs, with a slower evolution to global arthritis in the primary arthritis population. Conservative management should be the first step, then non-implant surgery such as lateral patellectomy or tibial tubercle osteotomy, which are good options in early stages, and later on the replacement option, partial or total, gives many good results. The patellofemoral dysplasia should be carefully analysed to plan the technical procedure in case of partial replacement, in order to avoid the frequent patellofemoral complications. Patient selection is of paramount importance. The surgical procedure should be adapted to the degree of patellofemoral dysplasia and bony wear.
