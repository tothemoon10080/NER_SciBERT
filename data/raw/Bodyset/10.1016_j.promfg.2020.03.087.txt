Centrifugal filtration is a mechanical method of separation which uses centrifugal force and density difference for separation of particles. The paper aims to optimize the filter design in order to maximize the filtration efficiency and increase the reusability of the fluid by varying the input parameters. This is achieved by analyzing the particle behavior using Discrete Phase Modelling and Taguchi approach. The filtration efficiency is found to be significantly enhanced by changes in design and process parameters in the system. Increased efficiency could assure higher quality of fluid, which enhances its reusability.
