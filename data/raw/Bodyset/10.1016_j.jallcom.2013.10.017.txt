The dealloying processes of Al–15Fe (at.%) alloy ribbons consisting of two distinct phases of α-Al (Fe) and Al13Fe4 in NaOH solutions were investigated. The effects of NaOH solution concentration, dealloying temperature and time on the results were comparatively discussed. The as-dealloyed samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that all of the three experimental conditions could affect the morphology of the as-dealloyed samples, and the influence of solution concentration was the crucial factor. The Al could be leached out from both the α-Al (Fe) and Al13Fe4 phases to obtain regular octahedral Fe3O4 under most of the experimental conditions except for that in the 0.5molL−1 NaOH solution at ambient temperature. In particular, the Fe3O4 from dealloying Al–15Fe ribbons in 5molL−1 NaOH solution for 48h at ambient temperature shows a uniform octahedral structure (average edge length: 667±158nm) and special magnetic properties (saturation magnetization: 83.3emug−1, residual magnetization: 10.4emug−1 and coercive force: 256.9Oe), implying its potential applications in magnetic fluid, information storage, etc.In recent years, the synthesis of micro/nano scale magnetic materials, especially magnetite (Fe Lots of methods had been developed to fabricate micro/nano scale Fe Dealloying, a selective corrosion process, was widely applied to fabricate nanoporous metals, during which the more active component was dissolved away from the precursor yet the less active component was remained and formed nanoporous structure Using Al–15Fe ribbons as precursor alloy, NaOH solution as the etching solution, the present work systematically studied the dealloying of Al–15Fe alloy ribbons under various conditions (different concentrations of NaOH solution, different reaction temperatures and reaction times) to acquire Fe The alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Al–15Fe, Al–25Fe, Al–35Fe and Al–45Fe (at.%) were prepared from Al (purity, 99.99 Dealloying of these rapidly solidified Al–15Fe alloy ribbons was carried out in 5 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the rapidly solidified Al–15Fe alloys and the as-dealloyed samples were collected in the 2 The XRD pattern of the starting Al–15Fe ribbons is shown in    The solution with Al–15Fe ribbons was heated up to 95   According to the results of dealloying in different NaOH solutions under different temperatures, it is indicated that NaOH solution with high concentration is conducive to the formation of octahedral structure. Zhao et al. Similar to the dealloying temperature, the length of dealloying time would also affect the microstructure of nanoporous metal by influencing the diffusion of the metal atoms in the preparation process of nanoporous metal   The octahedral Fe We thank Yanfei Hao and Jiao Wang for technical assistance in the
