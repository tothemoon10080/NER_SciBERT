The separation of manganese from sulfate solutions containing 14.59 g/L Mn2+, 1.89 g/L Mg2+ and 1.54 g/L Ca2+ was preformed successfully by carbonate precipitation. The results of thermodynamic analysis and tests indicate that carbonate precipitation holds better selectivity for manganese over magnesium than hydroxide precipitation and the feeding method is the most critical factor for minimizing the co-precipitation of calcium and magnesium. Furthermore, with adding MnSO4 solution to NH4HCO3 solution, the effects of the initial NH4HCO3 concentration, NH4HCO3 amount, solution pH value, reaction temperature and time on carbonate precipitation were evaluated and the optimum precipitation conditions were obtained. Under the optimum conditions, the precipitation rates of Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ are 99.75%, 5.62% and 1.43%, respectively. Moreover, the prepared manganese carbonate was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The results demonstrate that the product can be indexed to the rhombohedral structure of MnCO3.
