Recent studies have shown that SnTe is an attractive thermoelectric material, particularly after band engineering and/or all-scale hierarchical architecturing. In this study, SnTe microcrystals have been firstly synthesized by using a microwave-stimulated wet-chemical method, and then mixed with AgCl for spark plasma sintering. The crowding-out of AgCl induces all length scale hierarchical structures in the sintered SnTe-AgCl pellets, which include the point defects, dislocations, nanopores, and grain boundaries. Such hierarchical structures suppress the transport of phonons and result in a super-low lattice thermal conductivity of ~0.31 Wm−1 K−1 at 775 K in (SnTe)0.95(AgCl)0.05. Moreover, the decomposed AgCl induces cation doping to improve the electrical transport properties of the sintered pellets. Thus, a maximum figure of merit, ZT of ~0.51 at 773 K can be obtained with a composition of (SnTe)0.95(AgCl)0.05, which is 55% higher than that of the pristine SnTe. Our strategy enables to further increase the thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric materials.Thermoelectric (TE) materials, enabling directly converting heat energy to electrical power (and vice versa), show great potentials to recycle waste heat and improve energy conversion efficiency[ Top-down approaches, such as ball-milling [ Introducing all length scale hierarchical structure (i.e. including atomic-scale defect, nano-scale particles, strain and dislocations, mesoscale boundaries) in bulk materials is the most effective way to reduce Tellurium dioxide (TeO A series of (SnTe) The sintered pellets were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu K   Based on the measured electrical transport, we calculated the temperature-dependent  To explore the underlying mechanism of the super-low To examine the origin of observed low In this study, we employ a crowding-out effect strategy using AgCl as the inorganic agent to architect all length scale hierarchical structures in the ecofriendly SnTe.
