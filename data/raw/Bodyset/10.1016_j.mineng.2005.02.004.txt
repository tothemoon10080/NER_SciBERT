Bioleaching of a marmatite flotation concentrate with a moderately thermoacidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterial strain (MLY) was investigated in batch experiments. Experimental results showed that the dissolution rate of marmatite was influenced markedly by pH, temperature, pulp density and particle size of ore. The bioleaching of the concentrate by the moderate thermophile was more effective when carried out under the higher acidity and temperature compared with Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The adapted strain of the moderate thermophile could provide more rapid and complete oxidation of marmatite than its original strain and in the sterile control.Marmatite is an important resource of zinc ore in China, which is difficult to be processed effectively by traditional technologies due to its high content of iron. The bioleaching of marmatite flotation concentrate by In this work, the effects of some factors, such as pH, temperature, pulp density and particle size of ore on the dissolution rate of marmatite were examined in the bioleaching of a marmatite flotation concentrate with the bacterial strains of MLY. The bioleaching effects of the concentrate were compared between in the presence of The marmatite flotation concentrate used in the experiments was obtained from a leadâ€“zinc mine in Yunnan province of China. The original strains of MLY were adapted in the modified Leathen medium ( Experimental results from The results showed that the extraction of zinc from the concentrate was determined essentially by the activity and the growth rate of microorganism. Under the optimized conditions, the leaching fraction of Zn and the concentration of Zn The leaching curves of the marmatite concentrate by the bacterial strains of In addition, SEM observations indicated that the surface features of leach residues were different under different leaching conditions. XRD and EDX analyses showed that a mass of elemental sulfur formed during the bioleaching process of the concentrate although the bacterial strains of MLY were able to oxidize elemental sulfur into
