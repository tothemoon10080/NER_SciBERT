Cu-Ni-Si alloys and their variants constitute very important engineering materials, which have found a number of applications in different fields, as potential substitutes of the toxic Cu-Be alloys traditionally employed for the manufacture of different parts and components. However, the hot-working behavior of these materials has not been deeply investigated and only few studies have reported some limited information regarding the relationship between flow stress and deformation conditions. The present communication reports the main findings of an original investigation aimed at analyzing in detail the flow stress, work-hardening and work-softening behavior of a Cu-Ni-Si alloy deformed in the temperature range of 600°C to 950°C, at nominal strain rates in the range of 0.1–10s−1. Particularly, for the first time, a general constitutive formulation able to describe the changes in flow stress, work-hardening and work-softening rates of this material as a function microstructure and deformation conditions, in the temperature range between 800°C and 950°C, is proposed. The nature of the constitutive description here advanced allows the computation of the flow stress either under constant and transient loading conditions, on the basis of physically-based and well established models. Such a constitutive formulation is able to reproduce the experimental values of the experimental flow stress with an accuracy of ±7MPa and therefore, it represents a valuable tool for modeling hot-working operations conducted on this material. It has been concluded that, in order to take full advantage of the grain refining effects associated with dynamic recrystallization, hot-working of the alloy should be carried out at temperatures above 850°C. Deformation at temperatures below 800°C leads to a significant increase in the mechanical properties of the alloy and even fracture, as a consequence of the possible precipitation of fine secondary phases.material parameters in the STG model, s material parameter material parameters in the STG model number of experimental data points for the optimization procedure Avrami exponent universal gas constant, J time, s time for 50% recrystallization, s material parameter apparent activation energy for hot-working, kJ apparent activation energy for dynamic recrystallization, kJ absolute temperature, K volume fraction recrystallized dynamically material parameter Zener-Hollomon parameter, s material parameter in the STG model, MPa material parameters in the STG model, MPa work-hardening or work-softening rate of the material, MPa total effective strain effective strain rate, s temperature-dependent shear modulus, MPa flow stress of the material, MPa flow stress corresponding to the work-hardening and dynamic recovery transient, MPa critical stress for the onset of DRX, MPa peak stress, MPa yield stress, MPa actual or hypothetical saturation stress, MPa actual steady-state flow stress, MPa characteristic work-hardening rate, MPa flow softening due to DRX, MPa quadratic difference between σ In the last decades, Cu-Ni-Si alloys have attracted a great deal of attention due to their outstanding physical and mechanical properties, which make them potential interesting materials for their application in different fields such as the electric, electronic and land transportation industries. Previous work carried out on these and other similar Cu alloys The prolific research work conducted on different Cu based alloys in the past few years have addressed a number of important topics including: aging and precipitation behavior In this sense, the early study conducted by Zhang et al. More recently, Zhang et al. Similar results have been reported by Lei et al. Also, Zhang et al. Thus, the above account clearly indicates that, although a limited information concerning the temperature and strain rate dependence of the peak stress is available for some Cu-Ni-Si alloys, no information whatsoever regarding the same dependence of other stress parameters, including yield, saturation and steady-stress has been reported for these materials. Furthermore, no information concerning the evolution of the flow stress through the work-hardening and work-softening transients exhibited on the stress-strain curves, as well as the kinetics of dynamic recrystallization, has been reported so far. Therefore, the present investigation has been conducted with two different purposes. Firstly, to develop a rational description of the constitutive behavior of a Cu-Ni-Si alloy deformed under hot-working conditions, in the temperature range of 800–950 The description of the flow stress curves that were determined for the Cu-Ni-Si alloy under investigation, during deformation under hot-working conditions, follows a similar methodology to that employed for the analysis of the flow stress curves of other materials which also exhibit dynamic recrystallization (DRX) under some deformation conditions Furthermore, under deformation conditions in which the material exhibits DRX, the kinetics of such a microstructural process can be satisfactorily described by means of the Avrami equation, by expressing the volume fraction recrystallized dynamically (Xv) as a function of the time required to achieved 50% recrystallization (t When the material is deformed under hot-working conditions, before attaining the critical stress for the onset of DRX, the flow stress curve exhibits a work-hardening (WH) and dynamic recovery (DRV) transient, which can be adequately described by means of the exponential-saturation work-hardening law earlier proposed by Sah et al. Therefore, a more general expression of this law, able to describe the flow stress under both constant and transient loading conditions could be expressed as: This evolution equation allows the determination of the current flow stress corresponding to the WH and DRV transient, σ The above equation has been derived from the data reported by Kocks Regarding the temperature and strain rate dependence (expressed through the Zener-Hollomon parameter) of both the yield and hypothetical saturation stresses, this can be satisfactorily accomplished by means of the STG model, according to which both parameters are expressed as: As indicated before, in the above equations, Z represents the Zener-Hollomon parameter, whereas δ Therefore, the computation of Q, assumes that the peak stress can also be expressed by an equation such as: where, δ Since work-softening by DRX cannot occur below σ Again, δ As far as the computational determination of the flow stress of the material by means of Therefore, in order to determine the flow stress once DRX has started, a second evolution equation is required, which takes into consideration the description of the work-softening transient associated to DRX. By combining the Sah et al. law with the Avrami equation, both in differential form, in order to compute the flow stress under both constant and transient deformation conditions, the following expression is derived: Again, it can be clearly observed that, once DRX becomes operative, the incremental change in the flow stress with strain, regardless the predominance of work-hardening, work-softening or steady-state, it only depends on σ, σ In this way, any changes both in deformation temperature and strain rate could be readily updated after each strain increment during the course of plastic deformation. As can be observed in According to Jonas et al. Thus, As will be shown in the forthcoming, all the different material parameters involved in The present investigation has been conducted with samples of a commercial Cu-Ni-Si alloy, based on the EN12163-CW111C standard, whose chemical composition is given in This material was cast in round bars, hot extruded and quenched in water to room temperature. Subsequently, it was machined to bars, from which axisymmetric compression specimens of 15 A type K welded thermocouple was employed to measure and control the temperature of the samples during testing. The testing procedure involved the heating the specimens from room temperature to the corresponding testing temperature, at a mean constant heating rate of 3 Not less than three tests were carried out under each deformation condition, which allowed the evaluation of the results reproducibility. All the stress-strain curves were corrected for deformational heating during testing.  However, as the deformation temperature increases above 850 It is thus clear that, in order to provide an appropriate description of the changes in flow stress with microstructure and deformation conditions, not only the functional dependence of the above mentioned stress parameters with Z should be precisely determined, but also the accurate value of Z at which the change in the dynamic restoration mechanism occurs, should also be identified. The precise determination of each of the stress parameters of every stress-strain curve, as well as the reference work-hardening rate and the time to achieve 50% DRX (for the corresponding deformation conditions in which this mechanism is observed) involves the analysis of each individual stress-strain curve, employing the constitutive model described in In this case, the description of the curve can be readily conducted by means of As indicated in The non-linear fit of   A very important aspect concerning the evolution of the flow stress of the material during the WH transient is that related to the reference work-hardening rate, θ As explained in Thus, it can be concluded that the simple parametric relationship advanced by Jonas et al. Finally, the Avrami exponent, included in Such an analysis allowed the conclusion that a value of n The precision of the proposed constitutive equation, which has been derived for the material under investigation, can be quantitatively estimated from  As indicated above, a number of compression tests were also conducted in the temperature range of 600–750 At 600 Also, when the alloy is deformed at 700 It is important to point out that when the alloy is deformed in this temperature range, the yield stress of the material varies between approximately 150 and 400 Therefore, it can be concluded that during deformation at temperatures below 800 The first important aspect to be discussed regarding the model that has been developed concerns the computational instrumentation of the proposed constitutive formulation for modeling hot-working processes conducted under transient loading conditions, which should follow a well defined sequential procedure. It starts by dividing the total strain applied to the material in the corresponding pass, into an equal number of strain intervals. In each interval, it is assumed that both deformation temperature and strain rate are constant. Therefore, the parameters Z, σ The next step in the numerical procedure involves the determination of the σ If σ In this case, the volume fraction recrystallized is determined by means of the numerical integration of Clearly, if the critical condition for the onset of DRX is never achieved, the flow stress curve will only exhibit a work-hardening transient followed by the attainment of a saturation stress, whereas if the conditions for the onset of DRX are fulfilled, the curve will exhibit the different expected stages, which have been indicated in the previous sections. However, the important aspect to be highlighted is the fact that in each case, the flow stress is computed from its value determined in the previous iteration, and not from the total strain applied to the material. In this way, the flow stress will reflect the continuous changes in deformation conditions, which are updated after each iteration step of the computational procedure. It is well known that hot-working processes are characterized by the fact that the workpiece undergoes a nominal decrease in temperature with a concurrent increase in strain rate during the course of plastic deformation. Therefore, the use of FEM codes for modeling this type of processes should take into account such evolution of the deformation conditions, which is only possible by proposing the constitutive formulation in the form of differential equations, such as those presented in The second important aspect that should be discussed in relation to the present results is that concerning the significant increase that takes place in the mechanical properties of the alloy, particularly in the yield stress, when the material is deformed at temperatures below 800 As can be clearly observed from the above figure, the use of a unique value of Q does not allow the description of the data by means of a single set of constants. On the contrary, two distinct regimes are exhibited, which are represented by the corresponding dotted lines. The link between both regimes can be conducted by means of a Heaviside-step function and it is illustrated by the solid line. This result is a clear indication that the constitutive model that has been proposed cannot be extrapolated to deformation temperatures below 800 The increase in the yield stress value as deformation temperature decreases below this temperature could be attributed to the occurrence of precipitation of secondary phases, as it has been widely pointed out in the literature Given the above account, it is possible to infer that the significant increase in mechanical properties, as well as the decrease in ductility of the alloy investigated in the present work is possibly due to the precipitation of the phases described above. Therefore, an important conclusion of the present investigation is that hot-working operations in this CuNiSi alloy should be conducted at temperatures well above 800 A general constitutive description of a Cu-Ni-Si alloy, in the temperature range of 800 The present research work has been supported by the
