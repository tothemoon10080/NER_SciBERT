This study describes the change of organic degradation capability and soluble microbial products (SMP) generated in activated sludge under continuous exposure to Zn (II) in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). In 338 days of operation, the added Zn (II) concentrations were gradually increased from 50 to 100, 200, 400 to 600 and 800mg/L. Results showed that after adaptation, the activated sludge could endure 400mg/L Zn (II) without showing evident reduction in organic degradation ability (92±1% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal in stable state). However, when 600 and 800mg/L Zn (II) were applied, the effluent water quality significantly deteriorated. Meanwhile, under increasing Zn (II) concentrations, the SMP content in the activated sludge, together with its main biochemical constituents, first increased slightly below 400mg/L of Zn (II), then rose sharply under 600 and 800mg/L Zn (II). Furthermore, a close correlation was found between SMP content and effluent soluble COD in both the Experimental Reactor and Control Reactor. In addition, the Zn (II) concentrations in the effluent and SMP extraction liquid were further analyzed and discussed to reveal the role that SMP constituents played in defense and resistance to the toxicity of Zn (II).With the development of modern industries such as the electroplating, chemical manufacture, mining and mineral processing, a great amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of heavy metals is generated With respect to the effect of Zn (II), it is widely acknowledged that Zn (II) at low concentrations can perform as micronutrients and stimulate biological processes It has been reported that the heavy metals in high concentrations can lead to production of unspecific complicated compounds within biomass cells and induce the cells to rupture The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous high concentrations of zinc on the organic degradation ability (using chemical oxygen demand (COD) as indicator), SMP production and its components change in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The correlation between SMP and the effluent soluble COD, the change of SMP compositions were further examined to better understand the role which SMP played in Zn (II) toxicity resistance. In addition, the Zn (II) concentrations in the effluent and SMP extraction liquid were also analyzed to validate the function of SMP. Two SBRs with 4.0 For the nutrient supply, CH After 54 days of acclimation, the activated sludge in both reactors reached a steady state. The steady state in this study was identified by the situation that the standard deviation of COD removal efficiency was within 5% for at least 14 days. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) during that stage was maintained at 1700–2200 COD, Zn (II), MLSS and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) were all analyzed according to the Standard Methods As seen in As the operation progressed, the COD values gradually returned to a stable state (53 Nevertheless, when the added Zn (II) concentration rose to 600 So far, many researches have been conducted on the toxic/inhibitory effect of Zn (II) on activated sludge. The Zn (II) concentrations documented which had brought on distinct inhibition (>10%) on organics removal and/or nitrification rates usually ranged from 0.08 to 100 As stated above, DNA, protein, humic substances and polysaccharide were the main biochemical components of SMP When no Zn (II) was added, as shown in It was widely acknowledged that SMP was an important part of soluble organic matter in effluent It is commonly accepted that SMP is made up of two main parts: biomass-associated products (BAP) and utilization-associated products (UAP) In terms of DNA content ( Meanwhile, the protein, humic substances and polysaccharide content all varied in a trend similar to that of the DNA content, exhibiting a slowly increasing trend under 50–400 To further uncover the function which the SMP played in resistance to the toxicity of Zn (II), the Zn (II) concentrations in the influent, effluent and SMP extraction liquid of ER in the steady state were determined and presented in To support this estimation, the MLSS and MLVSS values were also measured and presented. Under 50, 100, 200 and 400 Nevertheless, when the Zn (II) concentrations in synthetic wastewater were raised to 600 and 800 Meanwhile, it should be noted that the ratio in Zn (II) concentrations between SMP extraction liquid and effluent gradually increased ( It had been proven that the protein could bind heavy metals such as Zinc with different metal binding sites  After long-term acclimatization, the activated sludge in SBR could tolerate 400 A close correlation was observed between SMP and effluent soluble COD, in both ER and CR. Under increasing Zn (II) concentrations, the SMP content, together with its four components, first maintained a slight increasing trend under 50–400 The Zn (II) concentrations in the effluent and SMP extraction liquid varied in a similar way as SMP, further confirming that the domesticated activated sludge could stand as high as 400 The authors wish to thank
