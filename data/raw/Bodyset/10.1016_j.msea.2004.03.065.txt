Despite the impressive development in understanding transformation toughening, tailoring the toughness of yttria-doped zirconia ceramics remained a major challenge. In our research, a simple but innovative route based on the mixing and hot pressing (under identical conditions) of zirconia powders with varying yttria content (3 and 0mol%) is developed to investigate this critical issue. The experimental results clearly reveal that the fracture toughness of yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) ceramics can be tailored by careful mixing of co-precipitated and yttria-free zirconia starting powders.In the world of ceramic materials, yttria-doped zirconia, and in particular yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) ceramics are regarded as a strong candidate for structural applications due to their excellent strength and toughness in combination with high wear resistance and chemical inertness Most of the published literature concerning the transformation toughening is based on the results obtained with yttria co-precipitated ZrO The commercial high-purity zirconia starting powders and the nomenclature for the derived ceramics are summarized in The Vickers hardness ( The measured grain size data is binned and fitted with a Gumbel (Extreme type I) function, that can be expressed as: EPMA (equipped with a Si–Li energy dispersive detector, EDS) analysis was performed on polished and thermally-etched samples with a nominal probe size of 1 Typical thermally-etched microstructures of the hot pressed Y-TZPs are shown in The mechanical properties of the hot pressed ceramics are summarized in The mechanical properties of the hot pressed TM-grade ceramics, summarized in Comparing the 2Y-TZP ceramics, it is clear that the indentation toughness of the TM2 ceramic (10 ± 0.5 Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that the indentation fracture toughness of the TZP ceramics can be tailored in the ‘mixing route’ by the controlled addition of Y-free monoclinic particles to 3 It needs to be pointed out that the toughness ranking of the pressureless sintered specimens (not shown) is the same as that of the hot pressed samples. A similar toughness trend is obtained in the mixed ceramics based on the mixing of Y-free zirconia and 3 In this section, the observed variation in indentation toughness of the investigated Y-TZP ceramics is explained in terms of the grain size distribution and the distribution and amount of yttria in the sintered microstructures. The physical modifications in the microstructure and their impact on the toughness of Y-TZP ceramics, established by the ‘mixing route’ are elucidated. It is well recognized that stress-induced transformation is the predominant toughening mechanism in Y-TZP ceramics The contribution of transformation toughening to the overall toughness of the TM-based materials is illustrated in It is well known that the grain size of the In Summarizing the grain size effect, it should be noted that the TM2 ceramic with an overall yttria content of 2 For the co-precipitated ceramics, EPMA analysis indicated that the yttria is homogeneously distributed in the tetragonal grains of the 3Y-TZP (T3 grade), leading to a narrow yttria distribution around 3 The yttria distribution of the TM2 ceramic (see During the yttria redistribution, the yttria content of the originally 3 Our present understanding is that once a critical tensile stress is generated in these grains during the propagation of cracks, they will immediately transform and will subsequently, induce martensitic phase transformation in the neighboring zirconia grains in an autocatalytic manner. This kind of autocatalytic transformation is a characteristic feature of the zirconia martensitic phase transformation In summary, two major mechanisms for enhanced indentation toughness can be considered for the mixed grade Y-TZP ceramics. The first one is due to grain growth and broadening of the grain size distribution originating from a reduced yttria content in the originally co-precipitated grain and the second one is due to the inhomogeneous Y-distribution in the sintered microstructures. From the discussion in Finally, we note that the newly formulated ‘mixing route’ for tailoring the toughness of Y-TZP is successfully exploited to develop high toughness ceramic composites. Our recent research work, has demonstrated that highly toughened Y-TZP composites with hard phases like TiB As a concluding note, it should be mentioned that a better friction and wear resistance in the mixed TM2 ceramic compared to co-precipitated T2 ceramic is achieved when all are fretted against a steel counter body under ambient conditions of temperature (23–25  The indentation fracture toughness of Y-TZP ceramics can be tailored from 2 up to 10 Although lowering of the yttria content contributes to an increased toughness in the mixed ceramics, the experimental fact that the mixed 2Y-TZP ceramic exhibit a higher toughness (by 4 EPMA analysis revealed that the presence of intentionally added yttria-free ZrO This work was supported by the Brite–Euram program of the Commission of the European Communities under Project contract no.
