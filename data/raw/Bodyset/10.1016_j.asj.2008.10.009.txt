Background
                  Hump reduction with manual osteotomy is an invasive procedure in aesthetic rhinoplasty.
               
                  Objective
                  We describe powered micro saw osteotomy as an effective alternative to manual hump removal.
               
                  Methods
                  Powered micro saw osteotomy was performed to reduce the bony hump layer by layer to reach the intended level. The edges of the open roof were softened with a powered reciprocating rasp. Shielded burrs were used to remove minimal bony prominences as needed.
               
                  Results
                  Between April 2005 and February 2007, the author performed 332 primary rhinoplasty and septorhinoplasty procedures. Hump reduction with powered micro saw osteotomy was performed in 259 cases, including 127 with moderate humps (3 to 4 mm), 112 with large humps (5 to 6 mm), and 20 with very large humps (7 to 8 mm). Satisfactory results were maintained in all cases, with minimal revision in 10 cases and no complications.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Powered micro saw osteotomy provides a less invasive approach to bony hump reduction and prevents the multiple complications associated with manual osteotomies.
