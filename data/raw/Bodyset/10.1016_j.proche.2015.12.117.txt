The adsorption of carbon black using chitosan made from the shell of shrimp has been investigated. The study was conducted to obtain the adsorption capacity of chitosan. Experiment were carried out as a function of weight dosage of chitosan (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0g) and concentration of carbon black (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100ppm). The initial concentration of 1000ppm was diluted to 100ppm. Samples of 100mL was inserted into Erlenmeyer and added an amount of chitosan. The mixture was filtered through Whatman 40 and residual concentration of carbon black analysed using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The results show that the condition of adsorption is achieved at weight doses of 1.5g.
