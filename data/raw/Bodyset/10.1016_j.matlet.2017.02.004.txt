Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/Co9S8 composites were successfully fabricated via a facile solvothermal method. The composites was firstly investigated as anode for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Due to the synergistic effects between the MWCNTs and Co9S8 composites, MWCNTs/Co9S8 composites exhibited good sodium storage performances including high specific capacity, excellent cyclic stability and high-rate property.Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated in portable electronics and vehicles market over the past decades, the large-scale commercial applications of LIBs are hindered by the high cost, unsafety and the scarcity of lithium Introduction with carbonaceous materials is considered to be one promising way for improving Li-ion storage properties MWCNTs have been confirmed to have high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical flexibility, chemical stability and easy functionalization 1 The MWCNTs/Co Electrochemical tests were performed on CR2016 coin type cells. The working electrodes were composed of active materials, super P and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (8:1:1). The electrolyte solution was 1 The crystal structures of MWCNTs/Co X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) were performed to detect the elemental composition and surface chemical state of the MWCNTs/Co TEM images were conducted to further confirm MWCNTs/Co Electrochemical behaviors of both samples as anodes were evaluated in the voltage window of 0.01â€“3.0 The cycle stability in higher rate current densities were also investigated ( We have successfully synthesized MWCNTs/Co This work was supported by the
