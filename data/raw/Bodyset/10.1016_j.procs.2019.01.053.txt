In Data Mining (DM) projects, specifically in the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation phases, several techniques defined in the literature are used to detect and handle noisy data (missing data, outliers, etc.). However, the application of such techniques remains complex and time-consuming due to the lack of anticipation in the detection and resolution of data quality problems. As a result, more than half of DM projects’ effort is spent on data preparation. This work supports an approach for reducing the time devoted to data preparation by advocating an early management of data quality problems. It’s an improvement of a previous work and proposes an implementation architecture based on an anticipative approach for managing temporal data quality.
