The distal radius and the scaphoid are the most commonly injured carpal bones among both active adults and the osteoporotic elderly. The purpose of surgical treatment is to restore form and function to the wrist. Depending on the nature of the fracture, either topical procedures or invasive surgery can be applied. This article critiques the treatments currently used for fixation of wrist fractures in order to drive the development of new materials to improve patient outcomes.No exposure to risks associated with surgery If able, quick return to work and daily activities Immobilization up to 6 Restrictions of some daily tasks Increase in stability Precise placement of the implant No need for external devices No interference of casts Possibly a faster healing time Stiffness Infection Nerve injury Potential for nonunion Tendon inflammation Loss of reduction with fracture collapse Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) Minimum disruption of soft tissue Temporary hardware Minimal scarring after the incision Infection Delayed union Stability for closed reduction No requirements for permanent hardware Minimal soft tissue complications Reduced pain from surgery No surgical incision Infection Pin loosening Malunion Quick recovery Less risk for infection Reoccurrence is possible Provides stability No loss of reduction pain in the donor site Swelling or blood clots in tissues Infection Morbidity Cost Biocompatible Osteoconductive Osseointegrative Cannot endure physiologic flexion-extension movements of the wrist on its own Requires the use of supplemental wire fixation to allow for more stability High strength Exothermic reaction causing thermal necrosis of healthy bone tissue A wrist fracture can occur as a result of trauma. They are common at any age, however those who suffer from osteoporosis are at higher risk of experiencing a fracture The wrist or carpus ( Distal radio-ulnar joint (performs as a pivot for the bones in the forearm) Radiocarpal joint (located among the radius and the bones located in the proximal row, in charge of wrist flexion and extension) Midcarpal joint (located between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones) Various intercarpal joints (between adjacent carpal bones within the rows) The flexibility and range of motion of the wrist can be attributed to the many bones and their multifaceted articulations. The radioulnar joint is detached from the wrist joint by a fibrocartilaginous disk, located between the radius and the ulna The radius and the scaphoid are the two wrist bones that most commonly fracture. The most common cause of both scaphoid and distal radius fracture is when an individual has fallen onto an outstretched hand in order to break their fall The radius can fail in various ways; the most common distal radius fracture is called the Colles fracture, which is when the broken piece of the radius is tilted upwards ( The scaphoid fracture involves a break in one of the 8 small carpal bones located at the wrist. The scaphoid is required for stability and coordination Young adolescents and adults who participate in intense activities as well as the elderly are at risk of developing scaphoid fractures and distal radius fractures A cast constructed of plaster ( Surgery may be necessary when the position of the broken bone is so displaced that nonsurgical techniques are not an option. Surgical treatment usually applies open reduction where an incision is made in order to provide entry to the broken bone in hopes of improving alignment Internal fixation: (stainless steel or titanium pins, plates, screws) External fixation (a stabilizing frame outside the body that holds the bones in the proper position so they can heal) Percutaneous fixation (pins and casting) Any combination of these techniques An incision is performed above the fracture; a stainless steel plate is applied and secured with screws directly to the bone in order to achieve proper alignment Early complications of volar locking plate fixation of distal radius fractures were evaluated by Ward et al. This type of fixation is simple and tends to only involved pins and casts with some incision, and can be performed in the operating room using local anesthetics This technique requires the implementation of an external frame ( Scaphoid fractures can be healed with a thumb spica splint cast, which immobilizes the elbow, wrist and thumb for six weeks; afterwards the wrist and thumb will be immobilized for another six weeks Surgical treatment is necessary when a scaphoid bone is broken at the scaphoid waist or proximal pole. Surgical treatments include Reduction Internal fixation Bone graft Patients are given an anesthetic and the surgeon manipulates the bone back into the proper position. In some cases, it is done through an open incision with direct manipulation of the fracture This technique involves surgeons using metal implants (wires and screws) to correct and stabilize the scaphoid in the correct position until completely healed In some situations a bone graft might be used with or without internal fixation, specifically when the bone is broken into two or more pieces in order to promote appropriate healing. Grafting involves new bone being positioned around the broken distal radius bone or scaphoid bone in order to accelerate the healing process while allowing bone production Autogenous bone grafts (harvested from other parts in the body), are typically used due to tissue compatibility, their ability to offer the greatest osteoconductive, osteogenic and ostoeinductive properties and ability to provide structural support Allograft bone (harvested cadaver bone) possesses osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. Allograft bone can be offered in different shapes and sizes, they are less likely to be associated to any morbidity at the donor site as they are harvested through bone banks, but it is not as structurally stable as the autogeneous bone graft. A study was conducted by Herrera et al. Since complications are associated with both autografts and allografts, bone grafts from other, non-human, sources have been used for the purposes of promoting bone healing. Regardless of coral's natural appearance, it does not go through osteoclastic resorption with ease and is visible on radiographic imaging for extended periods of time. Wolfe et al. Demineralized bone matrix is a result of processed allograft bone that has been demineralized in order to extract proteins that promote formation of bone. It is an osteoinductive and osteconductive material that does not provide structural strength to an articular surface Ceramics are inorganic materials that have also been considered as replacements for bone grafts. Hydroxyapatite (HA) can be developed in forms such as, powder, disk, block or granule; these are applied for skeletal treatments. HA is both biocompatible Tricalcium phosphate (TCP) has good biocompatibility and bioabsorability Calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) were discovered during the development of a re-mineralizing paste for dental caries Cortoss Typically, the material properties of bone can be confirmed by performing mechanical testing, although at times ultrasonic testing is also performed. Mechanical testing involves applying tensile, compressive, torsional (torque), bending, shear loads, or a combination to bone samples ( Klitscher et al. Biomechanical testing first consisted of 6 Results showed the axial stiffness of XSCREW-fixed specimens (median of 136.0 The researchers suggest that stability and micro-motion at the fracture site are important in order for the fracture to heal Sobky et al. A cobalt chrome sphere was centered over the articular surface and advanced at a steady rate of displacement of 10 In order to compare sawbones to human cadaveric bone, researchers implanted two of each plating system into fresh-frozen cadaver radii  Minimally invasive surgery can be used for treating fractures of the distal radius and scaphoid. There are many treatments and procedures used to treat both types of fractures, however there are risks associated that affect patient outcomes. Newer treatments and procedures such as injectable CPCs have potential, however CPCs alone provide insufficient stability to withstand physiologic flexion-extension motion of the wrist, due to their poor strength under tensile and shear loading. Recent procedures include applying injectable cements such as Cortoss The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial assistance of the Collaborative Health Research Project,
