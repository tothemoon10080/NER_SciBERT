The photocatalytic efficiency of different TiO2 powders, prepared by a sol–gel method and annealed at different temperatures, has been evaluated through the TiO2 photosensitized degradation (until mineralization) of acetone, as model reaction, in a static gas phase reactor. Two profiles “TiO2 efficiency vs. powders annealing temperature” have been obtained analyzing the produced CO2 by gas-chromatography or by an IR gas sensor. Despite the different operative conditions, that are: (i) acetone initial concentration (2400 or 600ppm), (ii) relative humidity (40 or 70%) and (iii) reaction time (a test after 7h or a continuous monitoring until 1h), the two profiles are similar and show the same TiO2 efficiency maximum (at 700°C calcination temperature of the powder). The efficiency increase until 700°C could depend on the crystallinity increase of anatase form and on the decreasing amount of physisorbed water at the surface of the semiconductor. The efficiency decrease observed at higher temperatures could be ascribed to the gradual transformation of anatase into rutile form, less reactive. Differently, parameters as specific surface and mesopore volume of TiO2 powders seem to be less important for the powder efficiency.In recent years many reviews have examined the developments of oxide semiconductor photosensitized catalysis to realize some environmental protection procedures such as air depollution, water disinfection, hazardous waste remediation and water purification The photosensitized process is initiated by the generation of hole/electron pairs on the semiconductor through the absorption of the light with energy equal to or higher than the band-gap energy; usually, electrons reduce atmospheric oxygen while holes oxidize pollutants. With organic substrates dispersed in liquid phase and adsorbed at the semiconductor surface, a detailed description of the photo-oxidation mechanism has been reported by us elsewhere In the case of gas pollutants, the oxidation generally brings to the mineralization of organic compounds, principally or exclusively, giving carbon dioxide and water as products. In this context, acetone is one of the most common indoor air pollutants and its TiO Some evidences are reported about the pre-adsorption of this substrate Therefore acetone is suitable to study the efficiency of different types of TiO The aim of this work is to evaluate the efficiency of some kinds of powders prepared by sol–gel method and annealed at various temperatures, using an experimental apparatus that, differently from those considered by previous authors, allows to obtain significant acetone conversions, avoiding direct photolysis of acetone (irradiation with external lamp with a very high power through a Pyrex filter). Considering these experimental conditions, in this work we report kinetic experiments, carried out determining the amount of formed CO Titanium(IV)tetraisopropoxide (97%, TTIP), isopropanol (IP), acetone and the gas mixture (O TTIP (12 Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a computerized Philips CUBIX-XRD diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, operating at 40 The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) of the samples dried at 100, 200, 350, 700 and 850 The experiments have been performed in a cylindrical Pyrex glass static reactor (diameter The TiO The analysis of the produced CO Analysis of the unreacted acetone was carried out quantitatively by the gas-chromatograph HP 5890 series II with FID detector, using a HP-Innovax capillary column. The TiO From nitrogen absorption–desorption data, the calculated BET surface area and micropore volume data of the considered powders are reported in The XRD patterns have been registered and are similar to those previously reported by us In The TiO Differently from Pyrex cap, the blank experiment with a quartz cap, that should increase the photo-oxidation efficiency allowing also the passage of photons with higher energy, showed the complete photolysis of the substrate within a short time, 2 The residual acetone and the produced CO The data relative to the produced CO A less time expensive, and more reliable, procedure to evaluate the TiO From the simplified LH equation (Eq. The profiles in The efficiency increase up to 700 It must be noted that, while the increase of the anatase crystallinity and the formation of the rutile form in the samples affect the powder efficiency, the surface and the micropore volume seems to have no role on powder efficiency. The last observation is surprising; nevertheless this fact is related to the results from Another observation is that we have previously considered the same series of powders to evaluate their efficiency in the photo-oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in liquid phase (CH Finally, coming back to the different experimental conditions (starting substrate concentration, reaction time and relative humidity) involved in the two profiles of In this work we have emphasized that TiO During the preparation of this manuscript, our colleague Prof. Giorgio Liuti died.
