Organisms always have limited options when constructing their hard tissues. Therefore, they appeal to the combination of soft and hard materials with structural designs at multiscale Recently, Yu and co-workers The synthetic nacre is practically indistinguishable by composition and hierarchical structure of natural nacre ( Because of the bioinspired mineralization process and the ambient conditions involved, the method can now be easily applied to other material systems “beyond biology”, including brittle and heat-labile materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as well as to matrices with other, non-natural pre-designed structures, maybe even coming from mechanical simulations first. In this field of biomimetic materials chemistry, understanding Nature can be followed by extending Nature by the larger choice of materials and non-biological structures, and the present pioneering work provides the strategic base tools for now producing various kinds of composites along our knowledge and imagination, such as ceramic/graphene, hydroxyapatite/chitin and porous functional MOF/chitin nanohybrides. Nacre-like materials might be then a growing family of materials, including real ultimate properties and other chemical and physical functionalities. The author declares that he has no conflict of interest.
