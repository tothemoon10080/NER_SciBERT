Dispersion pattern of geochemical elements in stream sediment data of a study area is affected by several factors, e.g., geological and geomorphological characteristics of the area. In this paper, we demonstrated recognition of efficient and inefficient mono-elemental geochemical signatures in a study area and exclusion of inefficient elements is worthwhile for increasing the probability of exploration success. For this, we adapted prediction-area (P-A) plot, normalized density and success-rate curve as tools that evaluate the ability of geochemical signatures in prediction of undiscovered mineral deposits and in delimiting exploration targets. After identification of efficient and inefficient elements, we combined efficient indicator elements to generate an effective prospectivity model. To illustrate the procedure we used a stream sediment data set for prospecting porphyry-Cu deposits in the Noghdouz area, Iran.In preliminary exploration stages, stream sediment geochemical data have been used to delineate target areas for further exploration of mineral deposits (e.g., The aim of this paper is integration of different geochemical signatures of porphyry-Cu deposits to generate target areas for further explorations using stream sediment mono-element data of Noghdouz area, NW Iran. In this regard, only geochemical evidence layers were integrated for mineral prospectivity modeling. We generated two prospectivity models for comparison purposes, a model by integration of all the geochemical signatures of the deposit-type sought (efficient and inefficient) and a model by integration of only the efficient geochemical signatures of the deposit. For purification of geochemical signatures, we analyzed different indicator elements of the deposit to discriminate efficient and inefficient geochemical signatures. In this regard, we used a criterion termed normalized density, N The study area covers an area of 600 km In the study area, there are 10 known porphyry-Cu occurrences ( The results of analyses of 174 stream sediment samples for eight elements (Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Au, Ag, As, Sb), collected by geological survey of Iran (GSI), were used in this study ( Statistical parameters of the raw data are given in Transformation of the values of stream sediment geochemical signatures into a logistic space, compared using original space (i.e., raw data), not only allows for better discrimination of geochemical anomalies but also improves the prediction rate of mineral occurrences ( After transformation of element concentrations, because each stream sediment sample is representative of its upstream composition ( However, Cu, Mo, Au, Ag, As, Sb, Pb and Zn have been used as indicators for prospecting porphyry-Cu deposits ( For creating P-A plot and success-rate curve, classification of the values of geochemical populations should be performed. In this regard, the concept of fractal ( Fitting straight lines to the C-A log–log plots, is an objective task, which should be based on the least square method ( Based on the classified maps ( In addition to the P-A plot and N For the study area described here, the value of W Two models of mineral prospectivity were generated with the aim of targeting porphyry-Cu prospects and exploring the effect of excluding inefficient indicators in the prediction ability of geochemical models. The first model ( For demarcating exploration targets, mineral prospectivity models should be interpreted subjectively ( Dispersion patterns and the intensity of dilution of element concentrations in stream sediments for a certain mineral deposit-type can be different in different areas duo to many factors related to the characteristics of the study areas that affect dispersion of geochemical elements ( Different methods have been proposed for evaluation of the ability of mineral prospectivity models or evidence layers of a deposit-type sought in prediction of mineral deposits. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and success-rate curve are two examples that were proposed in other fields of study (e.g.,   The results of this paper proved the trustworthy of prediction-area (P-A) plot, normalized density (N Recognizing efficient and inefficient indicator elements of mineral deposit-type sought in a study area and excluding inefficient indicators from the process of target generation, increases prediction rate of mineral deposits and delimits the study area efficiently for further exploration. In the study area of this paper, only geochemical anomalies of Cu, Mo, Au and Ag elements have a high spatial association with the porphyry-Cu deposits, and therefore are efficient indicators for further prospecting the deposit-type sought in this area.
