Ni–W–diamond composite coatings were prepared by pulse current electrodeposition on carbon steel. It is found that the pulse current can affect the rate of diamond incorporation and the content of tungsten alloyed in the matrix. The effect of the duty cycle and frequency on the hardness of the coatings is associated with the amount of diamond particles and the tungsten contents in the Ni–W matrix. Moreover, the diamond content is the primary mechanism in improving the hardness of composite coatings.Particle-reinforced metal matrix composites generally exhibited wide engineering applications due to their enhanced hardness, better wear and corrosion resistance when compared to pure metal or alloy The Ni–W–diamond composite coatings were co-deposited by a square wave pulse current electrodeposition method in a plating bath with aqueous bath chemistry: 15.8 The surface morphologies of the composite coatings were analyzed by SEM, as shown in The XRD pattern of Ni–W–diamond coatings with different duty cycles and frequencies is presented in The volume percentages of embedded diamond particles in the deposits were determined by the image analysis software and the tungsten contents were measured by EDS, as shown in The influence of frequency on diamond and tungsten contents is shown in The results imply that the pulse current could have significant effects on the composite coatings. Firstly, it can change the tungsten contents, which in turn alters the coating hardness. Previous studies concerning the Ni–W plating system have found that the hardness of the deposit rises with the tungsten contents In summary, Ni–W–diamond composite coatings were successfully prepared by pulse current electrodeposition. The duty cycle and frequency affect remarkably the microstructure and properties of the fabricated coatings. The effect of the duty cycle and pulse frequency on the hardness of the coatings is primarily associated with the amount of diamond particles and the tungsten contents in the Ni–W matrix. A maximum hardness of about 988 This research is supported by Ratchadaphisek Somphoch Endowment Fund (2013),
