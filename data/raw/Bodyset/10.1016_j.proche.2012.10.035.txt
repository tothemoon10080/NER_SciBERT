This work characterizes the non-ideal behavior of the solvent extraction agent di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP), constituting one piece of an effort to develop increasingly accurate models of advanced fuel separation processes such as TALSPEAK. Robust models are particularly important for processing high-level radioactive material in order to minimize the generation of secondary waste and to ensure reliable process control. Here, vapor pressure osmometry (VPO) data on binary solutions of HDEHP in toluene, dodecane, or cyclooctane yields the activity coefficients for each component after analysis. Initially, diluent activity data is obtained using the VPO results and then modeled using Scatchard-Hildebrand theory to provide the activity coefficients for HDEHP.
