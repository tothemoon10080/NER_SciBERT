A significant advance in the understanding of grain boundary contribution to magnetization in nanocrystalline ferrite thin films is demonstrated in this paper. RF-sputtered, room-temperature-deposited lithium–zinc ferrite thin films (Li0.5−

                     ) is observed to decrease with increasing Zn concentration, till x=0.32, and then it increases. Macro-texture measurements using X-ray orientation distribution function and micro-texture measurements using orientation imaging microscopy show reverse trend in the extent of crystallographic texturing and in the computed fraction of low-angle grain boundaries. This study brings out a correlation between low-angle grain boundary concentration and δM
                     .Lithium ferrites are superior to other spinel ferrites at the microwave frequencies because of their characteristic low insertion losses, high spin wave line widths and temperature stabilities of saturation magnetization In conventional single-phase polycrystalline materials, any structure-dependent property will be determined by grain size, shape and orientation. The relative nature of grain boundaries, though crucial in inter-granular properties, may not affect bulk properties significantly. Role of grain boundaries is expected to gain significance in materials with ‘reduced’ grain sizes, such as nanocrystalline materials. Although magnetization is an intrinsic parameter in nanocrystalline spinel ferrites depending on composition and crystal structure Quantitative texture analysis was originally designed for bulk materials In the present investigation, microstructure and texture studies of Li–Zn ferrite thin films were carried out with an aim to understand the reasons behind the difference between bulk and film magnetization. The X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and TEM studies were performed for structural and microstructural analysis. The bulk texture measurements using X-ray ODFs were performed for crystallographic texture analysis and to estimate uncorrelated GBCD. TEM–OIM was carried out for local orientation measurements and to determine correlated GBCD.
