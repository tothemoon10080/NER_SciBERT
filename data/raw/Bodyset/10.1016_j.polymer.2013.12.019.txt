Gas phase mineralization and mesoscopic replication of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers represents an attractive route to the preparation of silica nanotubes and hollow fibers with independent control of pore diameter and wall size. In the sol/gel gas phase process, PVA nanofibers, produced by electrospinning of aqueous PVA, were encapsulated in a thin silica shell by repeated sequenced feed of SiCl4 and H2O vapors, followed by thermal degradation of the PVA core at 550 °C. The hollow fiber wall thickness was governed by the number of SiCl4/H2O cycles with an average increase of the wall size of 0.7 nm per cycle. In contrast to conventional sol/gel electrospinning and wet sol/gel dip coating, shearing of such hollow silicate nanofibers afforded single silica nanotubes with an average length of a few microns. Aqueous silica sols added together with PVA gave control of the inner pore architectures. Methylalumoxane (MAO) activated silica nanotubes were used as supports for half sandwich chromium (III) (

                     ) and post metallocene (

                     ) catalysts for ethylene polymerization and in-situ nanocomposite formation with uniform dispersion of silica nanotubes within the polyethylene matrix. A blend of

                      and 
                        Fe
                      was supported on silica nanotubes to produce melt processable polyethylene nanocomposites with bimodal molecular weight distributions.Going well beyond the scope of hollow silica fibers used in fiber optics Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers with average diameter of 195 nm and melting temperature of 218 °C were produced by electrospinning and mineralized by means of sol/gel silica coating in solution and gas phase. Thermal post-treatment of PVA nanofibers for 10 min at 150 °C enhanced both PVA crystallinity (51%) and PVA solvent-resistance, which is important to retain nanofiber architectures during nano templating. In conventional wet sol/gel dip coating, similar to the TUFT process Upon applying high shear fields by Ultra-Turrax S.A. (PVA) = Specific surface of the electrospun PVA fiber       With increasing cycle number and increasing wall thickness, the average specific surface decreases from 130 to 40 m Similar to conventional silica supported (post) metallocene and half sandwich single-site catalysts, the silica nanotubes or filled nanotubes were treated with methylalumoxane (MAO) and used to support the half sandwich complex [(8-quinolyl)cyclopentadienyl]CrCl Cosupporting of The herein presented results show a versatile route for tailor-made hollow silica nanofibers with various sizes and possible precursor structures for a high diversity of catalysts. The advantages of the gas phase mineralization towards isolated silica nanotubes in comparison to dip coating processes have been pointed out. The relationship between average number of gas phase cycles and increasing diameter has been exploited. It appeared that the specific surface decreased with increasing weight of the hollow fiber and number of SiCl In a selected approach half sandwich polymerization catalysts and post metallocene catalysts were immobilized on the as fabricated single silica nanotubes, therefore accounting for dual site catalysts with good control of molecular weight and morphology. In conclusion, silica nanotubes are effective supports for preparing highly active supported (post) metallocene as well as half sandwich catalysts which can be tailored to control both molecular weight and nanotube dispersion during ethylene polymerization. All experiments containing moisture sensitive materials were carried out in an inert atmosphere. Procedures were performed using standard Schlenk techniques. Gases (argon 5.0 and ethylene 3.0) were supplied by Messer Griesheim and used without further purification. PVA (98% hydrolyzed, 16.000 g/mol), SiCl The electrospinning process was performed using a 17 wt-% aqueous solution of PVA. The electric fields used for electrospinning are in the order of 200 kV/m; a 30 kV electrical potential was applied across a 20 cm gap between the spinneret and the cylindrical collector, which was 0.20 m in diameter. The drum was used to increase the area on that the fibers were collected. The collector was rotated at a controlled speed of 10 rpm. The low-speed process led to non-woven mats of non-aligned nanofibers. The overall spinning process was performed during 6 h. To produce the nanofibers filled with silicate particles, a water dispersion of the silica sol with an average diameter of 20 nm (40 wt-% Silica-Sol; Akzo Nobel) was given to the PVA solution. The PVA solution had a higher concentration, so that a 17 wt-% solution was achieved after adding the silicate solution. The as-collected PVA precursor nanofiber mats were tempered at 150 °C in air for 10 min to increase the stability of the fiber mat For using the hollow fibers as supporting material for the During the polymerization the vessel was kept constant at a pressure of 3 bar of ethylene, a temperature of 40 °C and a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The reaction was stopped by injecting acidified methanol. The resulting polymer was filtered of, washed thoroughly with methanol and dried for 16 h in vacuo to constant weight. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using the STA 409 thermal analyzer from Netzsch, Germany under nitrogen flow of 75 mL/min, heating rate of 10 K/min and temperature range varied from 50 °C to 650 °C. Microscopy by means of SEM was carried out using an ESEM 2020 (Electroscan). The thin sections for TEM imaging were prepared using an Ultracut (Leica) and TEM LEO EM 912 Ω (Leica). We thank the
