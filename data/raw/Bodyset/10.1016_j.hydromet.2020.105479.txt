Instead of conventional two or three-stage zinc dust cementation purification, one-stage purification was proposed to remove copper, cadmium and nickel as well as cobalt by CuSb activation simultaneously from solution for an electrolytic zinc production process under development by MMG Limited. Copper was rapidly removed, forming a porous copper shell around a zinc particle. The shell acted as a cathode for the reduction of cobalt, cadmium, and nickel while the zinc particle dissolved anodically. The measurement of hydrogen evolution as well as slurry potential explains how the reduction and re-dissolution of cobalt, cadmium and nickel as a function of time is influenced by temperature, pH, and antimony and zinc dust dosages, providing a deeper understanding of impurity removal. Cobalt, cadmium and nickel were initially removed without back reaction. When zinc dissolved to a certain degree, the shell potential exceeded their redox potentials and the impurities started to re-dissolve. The shell potential was determined by the electrical contact between a zinc particle and the shell, the portion of the remaining zinc and the surface product on the zinc particle. The zinc dissolution weakened the electrical contact and therefore increased the shell potential. Temperature, pH, and antimony and zinc dust dosages not only affect the impurity reduction but also zinc dissolution, the shell potential and finally the impurity re-dissolution in different degrees. Copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel can be completely removed in one step. The optimal conditions for impurity removal are recommended.The process of zinc recovery from mine tailings developed by MMG Ltd. involves leaching of a pre-concentrated product followed by various process steps such as solvent extraction and electrowinning. Zinc electrowinning is very sensitive to impurities (Co, Ni, Cd, Cu, and etc.) in solution ( The current standard process for the removal of these impurities from zinc sulfate solution is the cementation with zinc dust. Copper, cadmium, and nickel are relatively readily removed from solution according to the following reaction: Compared to the other impurities, cobalt is particularly difficult to remove from zinc electrolyte by zinc dust purification. It requires a higher temperature, activating agents and a large excess of zinc dust ( Zinc provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for cobalt cementation as indicated by the following reaction: The equilibrium constant for the above reaction is 2 × 10 Hydrogen evolution is the dominant reaction during the Cu The removal of cobalt from zinc electrolyte by cementation has been intensively studied with respect to temperature, pH, additives, and residual organics. Increasing temperature accelerates the rate of cobalt cementation ( The solution pH affects the cobalt cementation because it not only influences the hydrogen evolution, but also the catalytic effect on cobalt cementation. At pH 3.5 to 4.5, the pH has a minor effect on cobalt cementation and a pH of 4 or slightly above is recommended for cobalt cementation ( Cu     Cu        The levels of copper, cadmium, and nickel in solution in the process used by MMG Ltd. are much higher than the typical values used in the Cu The objective of this study was to find whether copper, cadmium, nickel, and cobalt can be effectively removed simultaneously with the use of the Cu The removal of impurities from zinc sulfate solution by cementation was conducted in a 700-mL water-jacked glass reactor (8.2 cm ID and 15 cm deep) with three built-in baffles. The reactor was sealed with a removable lid, which had several openings for the temperature probe, pH, potential measurement, sampling, stirrer shaft, and nitrogen gas. Agitation was provided by double 45°-pitched impellers with a diameter of 2.54 cm. The lower impeller was suspended 1.0 cm from the bottom of the reactor. The distance between the two impellers was 5 cm. The rotational speed was controlled at 750 rpm to maintain all solids in a suspension and the temperature was controlled within ±0.1 °C using a circulating water bath. Zinc sulfate mother solution (150 g/L Zn) was prepared using extra pure zinc oxide, ultra-pure deionized water, and reagent grade sulfuric acid in a 6-L glass flask. The zinc sulfate solution prepared was saturated with Zn(OH) The experimental procedures for impurity cementation were as follows: (1) The required amount of solution (700 mL) was transferred to the reactor and then the reactor was sealed with the lid； (2) A tube was inserted to purge the solution with nitrogen gas for oxygen removal while the solution was also agitated； (3) After 40 min, the tubing was lifted above the solution surface and a nitrogen atmosphere was maintained in the reactor； (4) When the temperature stabilized, the ORP and pH electrodes were inserted and the zinc dust was added into the reactor； (5) The pH was controlled by the addition of 180 g/L H The amount of hydrogen evolved or zinc dissolved was calculated based on the amount of the acid added to maintain a constant pH as the acid was consumed due to its reaction with zinc particles. Several experiments were first conducted to evaluate the feasibility of simultaneous removal of copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel. The results of two experiments are shown in The increases in the concentrations of nickel, cobalt and cadmium was due to the fact that the zinc dust dissolution reached such a degree that the potential of the impurity deposit on a zinc particle exceeded the individual element redox potential and the impurities were no longer under cathodic protection and started to re-dissolve. The potential of the impurity deposit differed for each particle. Copper rapidly coated the zinc particles, forming porous shells or substrates that created active sites for cobalt, nickel and cadmium reduction in the presence of antimony. However, hydrogen evolution was also catalyzed ( At 85 °C, pH 4.0, 5 mg/L Sb, and 6 g/L zinc dust ( As nickel and cadmium are readily removed and the cobalt removal can reflect the removal of nickel and cadmium, the further investigation was mainly focused on the removal of cobalt. The cobalt concentration as a function of time at different temperatures is shown in The hydrogen evolution as a function of time ( The slurry potential rapidly dropped to −0.85 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 10 to 20 s and then increased slightly ( Cadmium was removed to less than 0.01 mg/L in 15 min for all temperatures and then it started to re-dissolve ( The initial nickel removal rate increased with increasing temperature ( The initial cobalt reduction rate increased with increasing antimony dosage ( The initial cadmium removal was not affected by antimony dosage ( Cobalt was initially removed faster at a lower pH ( The initial cadmium removal was not affected by pH while the cadmium re-dissolution was affected by pH ( The cobalt removal was improved with increasing zinc dust dosage ( From the SEM images of a fresh zinc particle and a zinc particle coated with impurities ( Copper was rapidly removed without re-dissolution. Cadmium was initially removed rapidly. The nickel removal was slower than that of cadmium due to its slower reduction kinetics. Cadmium has the lowest redox potential among the four impurities. Therefore, the cadmium re-dissolution occurred first while the nickel re-dissolution occurred last. The initial removal rates of cadmium and nickel increased with increasing temperature and zinc dust dosage, and were practically independent of pH and antimony dosage. In contrast to nickel and cadmium, cobalt removal needs antimony to catalyze its reduction. The initial cobalt removal rate increased with increasing temperature, zinc dust dosage, and antimony dosage and decreased with increasing pH. The cobalt cementation is a first order reaction with an activation energy of 56.1 kJ/mol and therefore is under the kinetic control. Impurity re-dissolution occurred when the shell potential on a zinc particle exceeded their redox potentials. The shell potential was determined by the electrical contact between a zinc particle and its shell. The zinc dissolution weakened the electrical contact and therefore increased the shell potential. The zinc dissolution resulted from hydrogen evolution and increased with increasing temperature and antimony dosage and decreased with increasing pH. The formation of less soluble products on a zinc particle passivated the zinc anode and then resulted in a high shell potential. Therefore, the impurity re-dissolution was determined by temperature, zinc dust dosage, antimony dosage and pH. Copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel can be well removed by one stage zinc dust cementation with the addition of antimony. This can significantly reduce the operation cost for zinc sulfate solution purification. The recommended purification conditions and final impurity concentrations of the purified solution are: 70–75 °C, 6 g/L zinc dust, 5 mg/L Sb, pH 4, 60 min of reaction time. Under the recommended conditions, copper, cobalt, cadmium and nickel can be removed to <0.04, 0.015, <0.01 and < 0.1 mg/L respectively, which is suitable for zinc electrowinning.
