To study the effects of earthworm casting on organic matter dynamics, control soil and casts were added as a surface layer (Horizon I) to perspex cylinders containing a ‘base’ soil depleted in organic C (Horizon II). Three treatments with different Horizon I were used; a control containing uningested soil and oak litter (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Lieblein), cast derived from the same substrates, and a third (Ew+cast) where cast as well as endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa Savigny, Allolobophora chlorotica Savigny) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris L.) earthworms were included. These were monitored over a 2

                      year period. Moisture fluctuations were reduced and higher amounts of organic matter and C were present in Horizon I with the cast treatment after 2 years. In addition, the proportion of clay C (and to a lesser extent light fraction) in Horizon I decreased significantly in the control and cast treatments while there was a corresponding increase in the proportions of silt C. Overall, earthworm activity had a limited effect on C distribution in the particle size fractions studied, though the dynamics of organic matter/particle associations may require more than 2

However, very few medium to long term studies have been carried out The present study addresses these issues by testing whether the decay dynamics of soil organic material differ between earthworm cast and similar non-cast material in soil columns. In addition, because earthworms intimately mix soil particles and plant debris during the digestive process, the effects of earthworms on the distribution of organic matter and C associated with the different soil fractions will be examined. This experiment was a component of the VAMOS study Earthworms ( The experimental units consisted of perspex tubing (diameter 15 cm) into which soil was placed as two separate horizons. Moisture, organic matter, C and N content and C mineralization at 25°C were measured as indicators of decomposition rates. Moisture content was estimated by drying at 105°C Some mixing of soil horizons by earthworms did occur in the In The organic matter content in In For the first two sampling dates total N content ranged from 0.3% to 0.4% for all treatments and decreased to around 0.3% on the final sampling date. The For In the The results show that earthworm casts had reduced moisture fluctuations in The higher content of organic matter in A similar trend has been found using litter bags (mesh size 40 μm) which allowed minimal faunal activity Although there were some changes in the proportions of soil C associated with the various soil particle size fractions, it is evident that earthworm activity had a limited effect on C reallocation. However, Christensen In conclusion, this study indicates that organic matter in casts, once stabilised (and left undisturbed by earthworms), can maintain this stabilisation for many years irrespective of the prevailing climate, including repeated wet-drying
