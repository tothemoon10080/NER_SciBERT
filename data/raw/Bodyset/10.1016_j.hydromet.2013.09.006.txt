The tendency of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) to form polynuclear species (especially mixed Zr–O–Hf complexes) in aqueous solutions is, besides their almost identical chemical properties, one of the main obstacles in their separation. Therefore, finding a suitable way for the aforementioned complexes to decompose may play a crucial role in efficiently purifying zirconium from hafnium. The best purifying efficiency on Diphonix® resin was obtained with a zirconium sulfate solution prepared with the intermediate stage of fluoride complexes creation. This permits the collection of the purest fraction of the zirconium sulfate solution, which has a hafnium content ten times lower than in the case of typically prepared solutions.The demand for zirconium with a low hafnium content (less than 100 Since the only sources of these elements are zirconium ores, which usually contain 2–3% Hf, the fulfillment of this demand requires the separation of the two metals, which is difficult due to their similar chemical properties (resulting from almost identical atomic and ionic radii) and which is still the subject of numerous studies ( If the separation is carried out in Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) aqueous solutions, an extremely complex solution composition, due to the extensive hydrolysis and condensation reactions, has to be taken into consideration. The formation of polynuclear hydroxide species (sometimes referred to as poly-condensates or even ‘polymers’) in zirconium(IV) and hafnium(IV) aqueous solutions has been investigated with several experimental techniques, such as: Raman spectroscopy ( The degree of the polymerization of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) ions in an aqueous solution is related to the ions' concentration, the type and concentration of the mineral acid, the conditions of the solution's preparation, storage time, Zr(Hf) compound type and its origin. Therefore their solutions cannot be fully characterized by acid and metal concentrations only. The observed differences in Hf and Zr ions' behavior create an additional obstacle to their separation. In individual solutions of either Hf or Zr, the behavior of each is different from when both are present in a solution simultaneously ( The way of treating the stock solution may play a crucial role in some separation processes. It is believed that breaking the olated polynuclear species can be obtained by heating the solution with strong concentrated acids, but obtained results vary with the different analytical procedures and conditions used. Beside their sulfates, fluoride complexes of Zr and Hf, [ZrF Among the other resins such as: extractant-impregnated, cation- and anion-exchangers or chelating resins utilized for Zr/Hf separation, Diphonix® (a commercially available chelating cation exchanger resin, containing diphosphonic and sulfonic acid groups bonded to a polystyrene/divinylbenzene matrix) has lately shown promise ( Diphonix® resin was obtained from Triskem (France). Its moisture content was determined to be 66.7 An ICP optical emission spectrometer Varian 710-ES (or ICP mass spectrometer Varian 810-MS as a reference method in the case of low hafnium content in zirconium) was used with the operating conditions as in our previous work ( The macrocomponent – zirconium – was determined by complexometric titration with EDTA in a 2 The microcomponent – hafnium – was determined by the ICP-OES method in the solutions containing 0.1% Zr in a 2 To investigate the influence of Zr(IV) and Hf(IV) solution treatments on their ion-exchange separation on Diphonix® resin, solutions of the same composition: zirconium sulfate containing the natural amount of hafnium [Zr] The column experiments were performed in the following way: the 6.5 The macrocomponent (zirconium) and microcomponent (hafnium) concentration in the collected fractions were determined by the methods described above. The breakthrough curves were obtained as dependences of the initial metal concentration fraction (c/c All the experiments described above were performed at least twice (error of C/C As mentioned above, the degree of polymerization may be a critical factor in Zr and Hf separation, thus some authors recommend heating the solution of Zr and Hf in sulfuric acid to white fumes of SO Next, the intermediate stage of the fluoride complex creation was introduced in the preparation of a zirconium sulfate feed solution. These complexes are known to be rather monomeric species ( Further studies showed that heating the solution of Zr and Hf fluoride complexes in concentrated sulfuric acid for over twenty hours permits the removal of HF completely. In this case (solution E) a remarkable improvement of Zr and Hf separation on Diphonix® resin was observed ( This significant enhancement in the Zr and Hf separation efficiency is probably caused by the breakage of the above mentioned zirconium sulfate polymeric forms by HF, and the formation of the mononuclear fluoride complexes, which may be described by the following rough chemical equation: The obtained species were digested in concentrated sulfuric acid, which by itself, as mentioned above, is unable to destroy polymeric species ( The essence of these reactions ( Unfortunately, there is a lack of available reference methods for a quantitative or even qualitative determination of the solution's composition (poly or mononuclear species' existence) to prove the above mentioned considerations. However, the indirect evidence of the proposed mechanism is the increase of Zr–Hf separation efficiency achieved at the same level of all factors, which may affect this efficiency (such as: temperature, pretreatment of the resin, the kind of solvent used, concentrations of Zr(IV) in solution, the initial concentration ratio Zr(IV) to Hf(IV), the ratio of the mass of resin (m Further studies showed that even a 0.5 One of the most important parameters of the proposed solution's preparation methods is the temperature of some procedure stages. For the formation of fluoride complexes, two various temperatures were applied: below (60 In order to remove HF faster by sulfuric acid, a higher temperature was applied in this step. Though raising the temperature of fluoride removal from 150 to 180 The summary of the breakthrough curves given above of Zr and Hf on Diphonix® resin, for various feed solution preparation methods, is presented in initial Hf content in feed solution final Hf content in effluent from the column amount of zirconium in effluent form the column [g], amount of zirconium supplied to the column [g]. As can be seen in The investigations carried out have proven that the preparation procedures of feed solutions are a very important step in the ion-exchange separation of Hf from Zr, because they influence the formation of mixed Zr–Hf polynuclear complexes, which are the main obstacle in achieving a high efficiency of separation. The best separation efficiency of studied ions on Diphonix® resin has been obtained from a Zr(SO The obtained results are of practical importance in efficiently increasing the purification of zirconium from hafnium, and may be a catalyst for further fundamental studies on changes in the formation of mixed polynuclear Zr–Hf complexes in their solution, under the influence of various factors.
