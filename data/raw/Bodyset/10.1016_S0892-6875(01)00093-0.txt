The precipitation of platinum is often enhanced by the addition of wood flour; a very fine, nonvaluable material as seed. The wood flour acts as surface area for precipitate deposition that ensures the formation of reasonable sized particles and prevents undesirable mirroring and scalingon the reactor walls. However, the downstream removal of wood flour is time consuming and expensive. This work investigated the potential of platinum precipitation without wood flour. The ideal product would be grey, dense, have large particle size, large surface area, little evidence of platinum flakes (these being undesirable to the customer) and have no mirroring or scale formation on the reactor wall (causing lost platinum).
                  The method and results are presented in a way that does not disclose priority knowledge.
