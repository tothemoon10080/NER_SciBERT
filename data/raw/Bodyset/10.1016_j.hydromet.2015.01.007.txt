The model was validated using different rate constant data points obtained during the reduction of SeVI and TeVI under different solution conditions. The rate constant k1 given by the comprehensive model was within a ±3.3% for SeVI and ±5.1% for TeVI reduction reactions compared to the rate constant determined using the experimental data. The model was used to estimate the selenium and tellurium reduction reaction times under Vale's (Sudbury, Canada) Electrowinning Department (ED) plant conditions. As a result, potential factors that may affect the selenium and tellurium removal rate at the ED plant of Vale were proposed and discussed.Dissemination of selenium and tellurium in pyritic ores and many other sulfide minerals results in downstream contamination of pregnant leach solutions and electrolytes in hydrometallurgical treatment of sulfide ores, concentrates and residues. The selenium and tellurium content dissolves in the form of Se The selenium and tellurium content of the solution may be reduced into insoluble precipitates of copper selenides and tellurides using cuprous ion. Cuprous ion is used as a reducing agent in hydrometallurgical applications and can be specifically used to remove selenate (Se Reduction of selenium and tellurium ions by sulfur dioxide gas is one alternative to using cuprous ion. However, the reduction of selenium and tellurium ions with cuprous is an environmentally cleaner process whereas SO The disadvantages of using cuprous ions as the reductant are the slow reaction kinetics for the reduction of Se Selenium and tellurium rates of removal are a function of the selenium and tellurium concentration, cuprous concentration, solution acidity, temperature and cupric concentration ( Superimposed Eh–pH diagrams of Se–Cu–H According to the diagram, in highly acidic solutions (0 The thermodynamic basis for selenium and tellurium removal at low pH and high temperature is depicted in Cuprous ion may react with Se Results of individual reduction of Se The kinetics of the removal of selenium and tellurium from copper sulfate-sulfuric acid solution by cuprous ion reduction and precipitation was studied and discussed in Accordingly, the integrated form of rate law (Eqs. The simplified form of the integrated form of rate law for both selenium and tellurium was also derived in the form of Eqs. By knowing the rate constants k The findings of this study were applied to the selenium and tellurium removal circuit under Vale's (Sudbury, Canada) ED plant conditions in  During contact with copper metal in the Copper Contact Column, the solution potential is reduced from almost 690 The copper selenide and telluride are precipitated in this process as fine black particles. The solution and solids then overflow the column into four consecutive aging towers ( Selenium and tellurium kinetics study was conducted under the continuous flow of argon gas to prevent oxidation of cuprous ions by oxygen during the experiment and solution sampling. Details of the experimental apparatus and cuprous analysis were explained previously ( By knowing the rate constant k The proposed model is based on the summation of three rate constant components starting with temperature. The rate constant k The second component is acidity, which had a significant effect on the selenium and tellurium reduction reactions with cuprous ions; it is directly involved in each of the reduction reactions (Reactions The third and final component is the cupric sulfate concentration. The effect of this factor on Se Finally, the three aforementioned rate constant components were summed together giving an empirical equation in the form: The model was validated using all rate constant data points presented in The difference between the calculated (Eq. The experimental data (analyzed cuprous concentration) and calculated concentrations of cuprous using the model (Eq. There is suitably good agreement between the model and the experimental data. Calculated curves are based on the general rate law. The curves were plotted using the selenium and tellurium rate equations into which the rate constant k The following calculations show the application of the findings using the ED plant's selenium and tellurium removal circuit ( The equilibrium cuprous concentration of the solution generated in CCC can be estimated using the equation developed in It is assumed that the residence time in CCC is sufficient for the reaction to produce cuprous ions to reach the equilibrium concentration. The effect of oxygen in CCC and aging towers was ignored (i.e., it is assumed no oxygen enters the aging towers). Therefore, it is expected that the CCC can continuously provide a steady state cuprous ion concentration of 0.026 In reality, the removal time of selenium at the ED plant was reported to be five times greater than the model prediction ( Assuming the rate constant k This long removal time compares closely to the removal time of 23 For tellurium, removal time can be calculated using Eqs. The tellurium removal time will reach to 3.3 The selenium and tellurium removal rate increases significantly with increasing of sulfuric acid concentration. If the solution acidity is increased from 144 These figures show that acidity had a more pronounced effect on the selenium and tellurium removal rates than temperature particularly at sulfuric acid concentrations below 50 The dissolution of oxygen in an electrolyte solution will decline with increasing temperature and the solution ionic strength in CuSO Accordingly, assuming limited access of air to the electrolyte solution, the maximum cuprous ion concentration that could be consumed with oxygen will not be greater than 0.0004 The knowledge that the removal of Se As a result, there are several potential options to improve the removal of selenium and tellurium at the ED plant. Firstly, cuprous ions could be generated in a separate reactor using a low ferric electrolyte and then directly injecting the saturated cuprous into the aging towers to supplement the rate of reaction. Secondly, the CCC could be redesigned to increase the residence time of the passing electrolyte solution. This would allow for higher cuprous ion concentrations and thus higher removal of selenium and tellurium. Thirdly, the CCC could benefit from being sealed better or purged with steam to limit the effect of oxygen ingress. Lastly, routine analysis of the cuprous ion concentration at the outlet of the CCC would help to monitor the performance of the CCC. This can decrease the selenium and tellurium removal time to the values predicted by the rate laws suggested in this study. Comparison of the actual cuprous concentration at the CCC outlet with the expected cuprous concentration estimated by the suggested function can verify if the required time for cuprous to reach equilibrium is provided or not. A comprehensive model capable of predicting the rate constants for various Cu Knowing the selenium and tellurium reduction rate laws and rate constants model facilitated the estimation of the residence time needed for removal of known amounts of selenium and tellurium. The findings of this study were applied to the Vale-Canada selenium and tellurium purification circuit at the ED plant (Sudbury, Ontario). It was realized that the removal times of selenium and tellurium were much greater than the model predictions. This has been proposed to be due to a lower cuprous concentration in the ED plant solution due to insufficient residence time at the Copper Contact Column (CCC) and reaction of ferric with cuprous in the CCC. Comparison of the actual cuprous concentration at the CCC outlet with the expected cuprous concentration estimated by the model in this study, showed that the required time for cuprous to reach equilibrium was not provided in the ED plant. As a result, the effects from the above mentioned factors are suggested as variables to be controlled or improved to increase the extent of selenium and tellurium removal rate from the Vale's operating plant. This knowledge can be useful for plant operators to troubleshoot the process and achieve the removal rates that are predicted in the model. The authors wish to thank
