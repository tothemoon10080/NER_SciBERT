In this paper, digestion behavior and removal of sulfur in high-sulfur bauxite during Bayer process were studied. The thermodynamic analysis shows that pyrite reacts with alkali solution to generate different valence sulfur (S2−, S2O3
                     2−, SO3
                     2−, SO4
                     2−), Fe2O3, and Fe3O4; the standard Gibbs free energy of these reactions is negative and decreases with the increasing of temperature in range from 473 K to 573 K; the generation orders of different valence sulfur can be easily determined: S2− > SO4
                     2− > SO3
                     2− > S2O3
                     2−. The digestion experiment researches indicated that sulfur in high-sulfur bauxite entered solution mainly in the form of S2−, the digestion rates of sulfur increased with the increase of temperature, which was consistent with our thermodynamic calculation results. Based on the digestion behavior of sulfur, an appropriate method of sulfur removal was proposed, the S2− which is the main form of sulfur in liquor can be removed completely by adding ZnO during digestion process.Rapid developments of alumina industry have made bauxite resources scarce. There are about 0.56 billion tons of diasporic high-sulfur bauxite in China ( Removal of sulfur is a crucial problem for high effective development and utilization of abundant high-sulfur bauxite resources. The sulfur-containing minerals in high-sulfur bauxite are pyrite and its isomers (marcasite and melnikovite), and sulfates such as CaSO At present, there are a lots of sulfur removal methods, they can be divided into two categories. One is pretreatment desulfurization: roasting desulfurization ( In order to find an applicable method of sulfur removal, especially for S The high-sulfur bauxite used in this experiment was obtained from certain mining area in China, it was treated by milling, screening, and drying.

The mineral sample and alkali solution were placed in a 100 ml steel bomb which was sealed throughout the experiment. The digester was heated to predetermined temperature, then the steel bomb was putted into it, the digestion process finished within the predetermined time. The digestion slurry was filtered, the Al Different reactions between pyrite and sodium aluminate solution occur as shown in As can be seen from It can be seen from It can be seen from The effects of temperature on sulfur digestion behavior were studied under the conditions of 60 min, lime dosage of 13%, temperature from 473 K to 553 K, and the results are shown in As can be seen from It can be seen from The effects of time on sulfur digestion behavior were studied under the conditions of 533 K, lime dosage of 13%, time from 15 min to 90 min, and the results are shown in As can be seen from It can be seen from The effects of lime dosage on sulfur digestion behavior were studied under the conditions of 533 K, 60 min, lime dosage from 7% to 17%, and the results are shown in As can be seen from It can be seen from Taking into account the recovery of alumina, digestion rate of sulfur and alkali consumption, the optimum digestion conditions in this experiment are as follows: 533 K, 60 min, lime dosage of 13%.
