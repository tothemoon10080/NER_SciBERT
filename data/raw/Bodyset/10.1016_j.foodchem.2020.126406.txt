In this study, 50 tomato landraces grown in Turkey were investigated in terms of their secondary metabolite profiles. Each accession was planted in 2016 and 2017 in 3 replicates in an open field. In this study, color, pH and brix of the fruit samples were measured and an unbiased LCMS-based metabolomics approach was applied. Based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) of the relative abundance levels of >250 metabolites, it could be concluded that fruit size was the most influential to the biochemical composition, rather than the geographical origin of accessions. Results indicated substantial biodiversity in various metabolites generally regarded as key to fruit quality aspects, including sugars; phenolic compounds like phenylpropanoids and flavonoids; alkaloids and glycosides of flavour-related volatile compounds. The phytochemical data provides insight into which Turkish accessions might be most promising as starting materials for the tomato processing and breeding industries.There is a general agreement that a healthy diet is important in preventing chronic diseases, and supporting the right energy balance of the body. Specific recognition has been given to the so-called ‘Mediterranean diet’ as being particularly healthy in terms of its balanced nutritious and health-promoting components ( The (poly)phenolic compounds of tomato and tomato-based products have frequently been evaluated in relation to their potential effect against, for example, cardiovascular diseases ( Tomato is a member of the Tomato fruit has been also a regular subject for metabolic profiling and has almost become a model organism for investigations relating to both the fresh fruit ( Metabolites are generally recognized as being the end products of the genome, and mirror the operation of the biological system ( There are several studies in which the metabolites of tomato fruit have been investigated by using LCMS methods ( The origins of all Turkish tomato seed samples used in this screen were obtained from the National Seed Gene Bank of Aegean Agricultural Research Institute, Izmir, Turkey. All details are reported in Color analyses were performed on the sliced surfaces of freshly-cut ripe fruits, using a colorimeter (Chroma Meter CR-410, Konica-Minolta, Milan, Italy) in the CIE 1976 (L*, a*, b*) color space. The instrument was calibrated against a white tile before measurements were performed. Chroma and hue values of samples were calculated from L*, a*, b* using the equation An Abbe refractometer (PCE Instruments, UK) was used for the determination of brix values and a pH meter (HI 2211 Hanna Instruments, The Netherlands) for pH values of the freshly blended tomatoes prepared as explained in Metabolite extraction and LCMS-based metabolomics was basically carried out as originally described in Chromatographic separation of extracts was performed with an HPLC system (Waters Acquity, Milford, MA, USA) fitted with a C The MetAlign software package ( The annotation of selected metabolites was primarily based on existing databases like the MotoDB (Sofia Moco, Raoul J Bino, Oscar Vorst, Harrie A Verhoeven, Joost de Groot, Teris A van Beek, et al., 2006), the KOMICS database In this study, we collected 75 tomato accessions from Turkey and 2 commercial hybrids. As can be seen from The color, pH and brix values of the tomato accessions were measured and are reported in Fruits of 48 accessions and the 2 hybrids from the 2017 harvest were examined for their metabolic diversity by analyzing semi-polar (aqueous-methanol) extracts with a high-resolution LC-MS system and processing the data in an unbiased manner. To estimate the overall technical variation of the untargeted analysis, appropriate reference extracts were prepared both from a pool of all samples (QC’s, n = 5, spread evenly across the real samples and used to check system stability during the entire analysis series; and 2 random accessions (n = 4 each). We first checked whether the metabolite intensity data generated by the untargeted metabolomics workflow, as applied in the present study, are representative of data obtained by targeted data analysis. For 3 well-known phenolic compounds in tomato fruit i.e. rutin, naringenin chalcone and chlorogenic acid, we plotted the peak intensities derived from the untargeted processing workflow against those derived from targeted LCMS data analysis based on retrieving the peak height of their corresponding molecular ion-specific mass signals from the same raw LCMS data files ( Using our untargeted workflow, we were able to obtain relative abundance values for 251 putative compounds present in the ripe fruits of the 48 Turkish accessions and 2 hybrids harvested in 2017 ( In order to provide insight into the overall differences and similarities in the metabolite composition between accessions, the metabolite data of the 2017 harvest year were subjected to multivariate analyses. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) results ( For comparing the two harvest years (2016 and 2017), we subsequently performed LCMS analysis on fruit samples of those 37 accessions for which sufficient material had been collected in both years ( To evaluate further the metabolic diversity and identify possible common metabolic pathways between specific accessions ( In this study, untargeted comprehensive LCMS-based metabolomics was used to determine biodiversity in phytochemical composition, regarding mainly semi-polar secondary metabolites, in ripe fruits of 50 unique accessions originating in Turkey (landraces). Our results of unsupervised multivariate analyses based on the variation in 265 and 251 compounds detected in harvests from 2016 and 2017, respectively, indicated that there is no clear metabolome distinction between these tomato accessions based on their geographic origin, while fruit type appears most influential to their metabolite composition. Small cherry-type fruits generally contained higher levels of peel-specific compounds, including flavonoids, than did large beef-type fruits. Within the accessions analyzed a large biodiversity was detected in various classes of compounds related to tomato fruit quality, such as flavonoids, alkaloids and smoky-flavor related compounds.
