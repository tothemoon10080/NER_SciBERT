The formation of icosahedral phase by mechanical alloying of crystalline elemental powders has been investigated. The effect of milling energy on icosahedral phase formation in Al70Cu20Fe10 has been studied using X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis. In order to study the alloying process during milling, different starting compositions of Al, Cu and Fe elemental blends have been used. The present study indicates that even though the intermediate phases formed during milling are the same, the icosahedral phase formation is sensitive to the way in which the nominal composition is reached.Formation of icosahedral phase (i-phase) by methods other than melt spinning has offered insight into the structure, thermodynamics and kinetics of the processes leading to its formation An elemental blend of Al, Cu and Fe powders with the nominal composition of Al The as-milled and heat-treated samples were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Philip’s 1710 diffractometer with Co Kα radiation. The compositions of the powders were checked using a Noran energy-dispersive X-ray analysis spectrometer II (EDX).  In bulk systems, the QC phase forms through a peritectic reaction involving Al It is clearly evident from the above observations that the i-phase forms directly during MA except for the case of PROC3. It appears that the mechanism of i-phase formation is the same in both cases. However, the formation of the i-phase along with β-phase has been observed by additional heating of the PROC3 sample at 873 MA of Al This work is supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi, India.
