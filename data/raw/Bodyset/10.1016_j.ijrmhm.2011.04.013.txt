In this study, the effect of Y2O3 additions on the microstructural and the physical properties of W-SiC composites was investigated. Powder blends of W—4wt.% SiC, W—4wt.% SiC—1wt.% Y2O3 and W—4wt.% SiC—5wt.% Y2O3 were mechanically alloyed (MA'd) using a Spex mill for 24h. MA'd composite powders were sintered under inert Ar and reducing H2 gas conditions at 1680°C for 1h. Microstructural and morphological characterizations of composite powders and sintered samples were carried out via SEM and XRD analyses. Furthermore, density measurements and hardness measurements of sintered samples were carried out. A highest Vickers microhardness value of 11.4GPa was measured for the sintered W—4wt.% SiC—5wt.% Y2O3 while W—4wt.% SiC sample possessed the highest relative density value of 97.7%.In the last decade, tungsten and its alloys have attracted considerable attention among the scientists as a matrix material because of their superior properties like high melting point, high modulus, high resistance of thermal shock, low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), good high temperature strength and stiffness As dispersion strengtheners, refractory carbide, nitride and oxide phases, such as TiC, ZrC, HfC, TiN, Y The rare earth oxides have some special chemical characteristics. They improve the low-temperature brittleness and decrease the ductile to brittle transition temperature in Mo and W materials The objective of this work was to develop tungsten matrix composites reinforced with SiC and Y Elemental tungsten (W) powders (99.9% purity, 14 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the W-4SiC, W-4SiC-1Y Peaks of W (Bravais lattice: Body-centered cubic; Space group: Im3̄m; a   All possible reactions and related phase diagrams are given in detail in the literature  Relative density and Vickers microhardness results are presented together in the Actually, the fluctuation in the relative density results is in accordance with the literature. Kim et al. In the present study, there is an almost steady increase in hardness with increasing amount of Y The present study reports the effects of Y WC phase was identified in the samples with Y After sintering the samples at 1680 The sample without any Y In overall, W matrix composites reinforced with SiC and Y The authors wish to express their thanks to the
