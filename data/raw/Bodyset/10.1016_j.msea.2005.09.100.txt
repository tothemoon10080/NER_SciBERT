In situ Fe-aluminide and alumina reinforced aluminium matrix composite was prepared by hot pressing a powder mix of aluminium and Fe2O3 powders containing nanosized crystallites. The reinforcements were formed in situ by exothermal reaction between the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the host aluminium matrix. The thermal characteristics of the in situ reaction were studied with the aid of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were employed to study the microstructural architecture of the composites as a function of hot pressing temperature and volume percent reinforcement. Micro-hardness measurements on the as-prepared in situ aluminium matrix composites show significant increase in hardness with increase in hot pressing temperature and volume fraction of reinforcement.During the last two decades, metal matrix composites (MMCs) have emerged as an important class of materials for structural, wear, thermal, transportation and electrical applications. These composites possess superior strength-to-weight and high strength-to-cost ratio, when compared with their equivalent commercial alloys Recently, the technique of reinforcing metal matrices by in situ reaction has gained considerable attention In the above perspective, it is to be noted that particles containing nano dimensional crystallites possess better chemical reactivity as compared to their coarser counterparts The present investigation aims at developing a mechanically stiffer and stronger in situ Al matrix composite containing finely dispersed Al Nanosized Fe Aluminium powder of 99% purity with an average particle size ∼20 The powder mix, so prepared, was subsequently compacted in cylindrical (10 The thermal characteristics of the in situ reaction in the green compacts, expected to yield 100 XRD studies on the 40 Here, it is imperative to briefly mention about the principle of SLPA technique. The X-ray diffraction pattern of nanocrystalline materials exhibits considerable peak broadening with reduced intensity due to the combined instrumental effects and structural factors like reduced crystallite size and strain at the atomic scale, caused by the lattice distortion. Therefore, the measured line profile ‘ The contribution of The contribution of the size and strain profiles in the structurally broadened profile The integral breadth ( The constituent Cauchy and Gaussian components were obtained from the ratio ‘ A Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL, JSM-840A) along with the energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) was used to study the microstructural architecture and composition of the different phases of the composite samples. Average values of micro-hardness on different phases of the composite samples were measured with the help of a standard Vicker's micro-hardness tester (Type 3212, Zwick, Ulm Germany) using a load of 25 The XRD spectra of the as-received Fe The DSC plot of the 40  The type of reinforcements formed in the composite samples with respect to the hot pressing temperature and composition were investigated using the XRD technique and the representative patterns are shown in Here, it is to be noted that the initiation temperature of the above reactions with the conventional micron sized Fe Representative SEM micrographs of the in situ composite samples with varying volume percent of reinforcement content prepared by hot pressing at 900 Variations in the Vicker's micro-hardness values recorded on the bright and dark shaded microstructural areas as a function of temperature and reinforcement content is shown in The present work demonstrates that Al-based in situ composites reinforced with Fe-aluminide and alumina can be prepared by allowing the in situ reaction to occur between molten Al and Fe Aluminium metal matrix composites reinforced with well dispersed alumina and iron aluminide particulates of size less than 1 The fine reinforcements in the host matrix are formed by the in situ exothermal reaction between aluminium and nanosized Fe The initiation temperature of the in situ reaction decreases significantly with the use of nanosized Fe Evolution of the reinforcements is kinetically favored by the increase in pressing temperature.
