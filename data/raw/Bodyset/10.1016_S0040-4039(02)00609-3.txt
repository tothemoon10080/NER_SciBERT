A series of functional bisphosphosphine oxides were synthesized in good yields via new Pd-catalyzed bis-hydrophosphinylation reactions of terminal alkynes and diphenylphosphine oxide. The resulting bisphosphine oxides were reduced to their corresponding bisphosphines in quantitative yields via a Ti(O

Terminal alkynes were either obtained from commercial sources or synthesized in excellent yields by Heck reactions between aryl halides and trimethysilylacetylene followed by removal of trimethylsilyl group under basic conditions. When the hydrophosphinylation reactions were carried out with 1 equiv. of diphenylphosphine oxide under milder conditions and shorter reaction times, both Reduction of phosphine oxides is typically carried out with a metal hydride system or with HSiCl Treatment of vicinal-bisphosphineoxides The characteristic signals for the protons on the alkane backbone of In summary, we have developed an efficient method for the synthesis of functional bis-diphenylphosphine oxides via Pd-catalyzed bis-hydrophosphinylation reactions of alkynes with diphenylphosphine oxide. We have also shown the facile reduction of the bisphosphineoxides to the corresponding bisphosphines using triethoxysilane/Ti(O We acknowledge NSF (DMR-9875544) for financial support.
