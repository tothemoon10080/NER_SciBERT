The permeability characteristics of highly concentrated O/W emulsions were clarified on the basis of the kinetic data of the centrifugal flotation experiments with the aid of an analytical centrifuge which could monitor timed near-infrared (NIR) transmission profiles of the samples in the centrifugal field, and then the permeability data of the soft particles of oil droplets were compared with those of the rigid particles of silicon dioxide in centrifugal sedimentation. The dependence of centrifugal flotation velocity of concentrated emulsion on the emulsion concentration was not able to be described by the conventional Richardson–Zaki equation. By considering an analogy between the flotation of oil droplets in a solvent and the permeation of a solvent through the granular bed of oil droplets, the specific flow resistance of the oil droplets was determined as a function of the porosity from the data of centrifugal flotation velocity measured for a variety of initial porosity of O/W emulsion. Moreover, the dependence of the effective specific surface of the oil droplets on the porosity of O/W emulsion was derived using the Happel's cell model, which accurately describes the flow properties in the concentrated colloidal dispersions. As a consequence, it was shown that the effective specific surface of the oil droplets markedly decreased with decreasing porosity of emulsion in the range of the relatively high concentration. By contrast, it is significant to note that the effective specific surface remained almost constant in the case of centrifugal sedimentation of particulate suspension of silicon dioxide. These results provide important new insight into the mechanisms involved in the solid–liquid separation of the deformable particles.diameter (m) mean specific surface area size (m) frequency Kozeny constant local excess hydraulic pressure (Pa) local compressive pressure acting on oil droplets or solid particles (Pa) radial distance of an arbitrary position from center of rotation (m) radial distance from center of rotation to interface of dispersion and clear liquid (m) radial distance from center of rotation to cell bottom in centrifugal flotation, or radial distance from center of rotation to interface of dispersion and air in centrifugal sedimentation (m) radial distance from center of rotation to interface of dispersion and air in centrifugal flotation, or radial distance from center of rotation to cell bottom in centrifugal sedimentation (m) mass fraction of oil droplets in emulsion or solid particles in suspension flotation coefficient or sedimentation coefficient (s/rad effective specific surface of oil droplet or solid particle (m flotation coefficient of a single droplet emerging in an infinite fluid, or sedimentation coefficient of a single solid particle settling in an infinite fluid (s/rad transmission apparent downward liquid velocity relative to oil droplets, or apparent upward liquid velocity relative to solid particles (m/s) initial flotation velocity or initial sedimentation velocity (m/s) local specific flow resistance (m/kg) initial porosity of emulsion or suspension viscosity of continuous phase (Pa flotation time or sedimentation time (s) density of continuous phase (kg/m density of dispersed phase (kg/m volume of oil droplets per unit cross-sectional area measured from interface of emulsion and air, or volume of solid particles per unit cross-sectional area measured from bottom of cell (m) angular velocity of rotor (rad/s) Several methods have been developed for determining accurately the compression–permeability characteristics of particulate suspension which are essential to the design and operation of the solid–liquid separation equipments For many decades most efforts have been devoted to describing the compression–permeability characteristics of the rigid particles such as kaolin, calcium carbonate, silica, and so on In response to this need, in the present work, the centrifugal flotation experiments are performed by means of an analytical centrifuge which detects the light transmission over the total length of the cell containing the dispersion during centrifugation, in order to obtain the permeability characteristics of O/W emulsion. Moreover, our results on the soft particles such as oil droplets are compared with those of the rigid particles by conducting the centrifugal sedimentation experiments of aqueous suspension of silicon dioxide particles. The oil used as the dispersed phase was kerosene, whose density The size and size distributions of the oil droplets in O/W emulsion and the silicon dioxide particles in particulate suspension were evaluated using laser diffraction particle size analyzer (SALD-300V, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Considerable dilution of the concentrated dispersions was required while there is no direct evidence that the size distribution is completely unchanged during the dilution procedure. Mass-based size distributions of the oil droplets and the silicon dioxide particles are plotted in Centrifugation experiments of O/W emulsions and particulate suspensions were carried out at various rotor speeds ranging from 1000 to 3000   The dependence of the flotation velocity |d The experiments were carried out in order to investigate the influence of the rotor speed on the flotation velocity.  In At relatively high solid concentrations there is an analogy between the flotation of oil droplets in a solvent and the permeation of a solvent through the granular bed of oil droplets. Thus the permeability data may be estimated through the flotation experiments. On the basis of the measurement of the flotation velocity using the analytical centrifuge in which the motion of a solvent–emulsion boundary is followed, the local specific flow resistance When the centrifugal force is applied to an emulsion of oil droplets in the analytical centrifuge, the oil droplets in emulsion move away from the cell bottom toward the center of rotation. The basic flow equation for flotation of concentrated emulsions can be described by According to the well-known Kozeny–Carman equation The hindered flotation coefficient Combining Eqs. To ensure this more clearly, the effective specific surface It is significant to compare the results for centrifugal flotation of O/W emulsion with those for centrifugal sedimentation of suspension of silicon dioxide particles. The typical profiles for centrifugal sedimentation of particulate suspension are shown in The logarithmic plot of the sedimentation coefficient The specific flow resistance The centrifugation experiments of O/W emulsion and particulate suspension of silicon dioxide particles were conducted under different experimental conditions by means of an analytical centrifuge with a NIR light source, and both behaviors were compared. The dependence of the centrifugal flotation velocity on the emulsion concentration was not consistent with the Richardson–Zaki equation, unlike in the case of the rigid particles. The specific flow resistance and the effective specific surface of the oil droplets were evaluated from the measured centrifugal flotation velocity. It was revealed that the effective specific surface of the oil droplets substantially decreased with decreasing porosity of emulsion in the range of the relatively high concentration. In contrast, the effective specific surface exhibited constant values irrespective of the porosity in the case of centrifugal sedimentation of suspension of silicon dioxide particles. The results of the permeability characteristics of O/W emulsion obtained in this study provide useful information about the mechanisms involved in the solid–liquid separation of the deformable particles.
