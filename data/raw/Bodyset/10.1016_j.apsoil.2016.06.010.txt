Plant litter is the main carbon (C) source of belowground communities, influencing the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In cultivated systems, litter varies quantitatively (restitution or exportation of aerial plant parts) and qualitatively (crop rotation) throughout the year. The effects of litter quantity and quality on the soil biota structure and their relative contributions at different trophic levels have rarely been simultaneously assessed in agricultural soils. To evaluate the role of litter quality and quantity on soil food webs, we incorporated two litter types (labile or recalcitrant) and two litter quantities (low or high) in a long-term experimental site studying the impact of different cultural practices in Northern France. After 7 months, we measured the litter mass loss, enzymatic activities (hydrolytic and oxidative), nitrogen (N) content and biomass of the soil biota: microorganisms, nematodes, Acari, Collembola, earthworms and macro-arthropods. Litter quantity and quality had distinct effects on the structure and functions of soil communities.
                  Doubling the quantity of added litter caused deep changes in the composition of detritivorous fauna by promoting the largest-sized group of detritivores (anecic earthworms) to the detriment of the smaller-sized groups (Collembola), which in turn led to higher litter consumption for a similar amount of soil biota biomass and hydrolytic enzyme activities after seven months of decomposition. In contrast, low litter quality stimulated the fungal energy channel, with an increase in the relative proportion of fungi, fungal feeding nematodes and euedaphic and hemiedaphic collembolans. This food web was characterized by a shift towards nitrogen acquisition that decreased the C:N ratio of enzymatic activities. Litter management is a central factor to consider for influencing ecosystem services such as soil fertility and nutrient cycling through the promotion of specific functional groups in soil.Plant residue decomposition is an essential process that drives carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in soils ( Litter quantity and quality are two major factors that can influence the activity and composition of soil organisms. Higher resource quantity and quality usually support the development of opportunistic bacterial taxa that increase with the greatest quantity of labile C compounds ( With the objective of disentangling the effects of litter quantity and quality on soil community structure and function, we hypothesized that (i) litter quantity should increase the biomass of soil organisms, whereas litter quality should shape the composition of soil communities; and that (ii) the increase of biota biomass by litter quantity should increase litter degradation and C enzymatic activities, while the change in community composition by litter quality should change C and N enzymatic activities. We tested these hypotheses in a field experiment by adding two different crop residue quantities (5 The study was conducted in a long-term French experiment based at the Estrées Mons station in Northern France (49°873′N, 3°032′E). The experimental site was established in 2010 to study the impact of different cultural practices such as tillage, residue exportation and N fertilization on soil physicochemical properties, biological activities and environmental impacts ( To assess the initial quality of litters, pea and barley were analyzed using four replicates of 1.2 To determine the litter mass loss after 7 months of decomposition, we collected one litterbag per experimental plot (corresponding to four replicates for the The following analyses were performed on the mixtures of soil and litter samples collected with a trowel from the 0–10 Soil mineral N was extracted from 40 The microbial carbon biomass (C Ergosterol was extracted according to the following adaptation of the method described by We measured the potential activity of seven enzymes that degrade a range of C and N organic matter compounds according to All faunal groups were extracted within 72 Micro-arthropods were sampled from a single soil core (diameter, 5 Macrofauna was hand sorted from a monolith of 25 Our results showed that 11 months after the beginning of our experiment, more than 95% of the litter initially added was degraded ( Biomass in mg We summed the activities of BGLU, CBH and XYL to obtain the global C hydrolytic enzyme activities; NAG and LAP were also summed to obtain the global N hydrolytic enzyme activities ( Differences in the quality of Pea and Barley were tested by Student Redundancy analyses (RDAs) were used to observe the effect of soil edaphic factors on biota composition and of biota composition on enzymatic activities as a function of the treatments ( Overall, litter quantity induced a contrasting structure of soil food web through the selective stimulation of specific groups of decomposers ( Litter quantity significantly affected only a relatively low number of soil functions. Approximately 74% of the initial amount of litter added was degraded in the Many litter traits varied significantly between pea and barley. For instance, the C: N ratio varied by almost two-fold from 55.0 Changes in litter quality differently influenced the structure of soil food webs ( Despite the initial differences in litter quality, the litter mass loss was similar in the In agreement with the reported differences in the soil food web structure, the ordination plot from RDA clearly distinguished three contrasting assemblages ( The effects of litter quantity and quality on the biotic relationships between soil functions and food web composition are presented in For a second time, we studied the differential effects of litter quantity and quality on the biotic relationships between the different groups of the soil food web in Litter quantity and quality impacts on soil biota biomasses did not last after 11 months ( Doubling the quantity of added litter increased the amount of litter available for soil biota, which led to a greater amount of C degraded by the soil community through deep changes in the composition of the degradation community. Different litter qualities strongly influenced the soil N availability during the decomposition of plant litter ( Soil functions, represented by the litter mass loss and enzymatic activities, were strongly affected ( High litter quantity increased the amount of degraded litter (364 Litter quality had fewer effects than litter quantity on the composition and biomass of the detritivore communities but exerted stronger impacts on the fungal energy channel ( Finally, because of the complexity of biotic interactions within the different food webs, it was difficult to clearly link the soil functions to specific microbial and/or faunal groups ( By manipulating the litter supply in agricultural soil, our main objective was to disentangle the effects of litter quantity and quality on the structure and functioning of soil food webs. Increasing the litter quantity mainly increased the proportion of anecic earthworms, which further impacted the C acquisition by the soil food web and may have favoured the soil C stabilization. Contrastingly, a decrease in litter quality led to N acquisition strategies by soil biota through the promotion of the fungal energy channel. Furthermore, litter management also induced shifts in biotic interactions, which appear to play an important role in soil functions. Therefore, modulating litter quantity and quality through different litter management modalities may be a way to favour the development of certain functional groups in soil, but whether these changes apply for a larger panel of litter quantity and quality and could have more long-lasting effects through repeated applications remains an open question.
