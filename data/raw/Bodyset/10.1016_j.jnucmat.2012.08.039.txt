Co-precipitations of cerium (III) and neodymium (III) at 10wt.% in LiCl–CaCl2 (30-70mol%) molten salt at 705°C have been achieved using an original way of precipitation, wet argon sparging. Several CeCl3/NdCl3 ratios have been studied, and the isolated powders were analyzed using different characterization methods including XRD investigations. The lanthanides precipitation yields have been determined around 99.9% using ICP-AES analysis. XRD demonstrated that the precipitates mainly contained mixed oxychloride (Ce1−

                     . Calcination of these precipitates has resulted in the cerium and neodymium mixed oxides. For the precipitation with a Ce/Nd=50/50 ratio, an hydroxychloride Ln(OH)2Cl and the oxychloride CeIV(Nd0.7Ce0.3)IIIO3Cl have been identified as unexpected intermediate compounds.Currently in France, spent nuclear fuel is recycled at industrial scale by the hydrometallurgical PUREX process which allows the selective recovery of uranium and plutonium. In the future, one of the different fuel cycle options under evaluation for Generation IV systems is co-management of the actinides (An) in an integrated closed fuel cycle Precipitation in molten chloride can be achieved by increasing the O A detailed investigation was undertaken here on the co-precipitation of these two elements with wet argon sparging to determine the performance of the precipitation method and to examine solid solution formation. Therefore, precipitations were carried out with different The precipitations of Ln(III) (Ln The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the precipitates were recorded with a Huber G670 Guinier powder diffractometer with transmission geometry using Cu Kα Powder diffraction patterns of calcined precipitates were recorded using a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer with Cu K The precipitation rates were calculated from the concentration of soluble lanthanides remaining in the molten salt at the end of the precipitation. The concentrations of soluble cerium and neodymium in the salt were measured by Induced Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). About 100 To obtained an elemental map of the precipitate, the powder from the The morphology of the precipitate was observed with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Hitachi S4700 with Field Emission Gun (FEG), a cathodoluminescence and an Electron Beam Induced Current (EBIC) system. The neutralization of the hydrogen chloride from water reaction leads to a decrease of the soda conductivity. The water reaction in the molten salt was followed up with the measurement of the conductivity of the soda solution placed downstream the reactor. The evolution of soda solution conductivity shown in ICP-AES analysis of unreacted lanthanides in the LiCl–CaCl The XRD patterns of the precipitates reveal the formation of a mixture of CeOCl oxychloride and CeO The microprobe cartography ( The oxychloride (Ce Because of possible calcium contamination in the precipitate which could be problematic in the fuel refabrication, the concentration of this element has been determined by ICP-AES analysis of solubilized precipitates. The calcium represents 0.1 The calcination of the mixed oxychloride (Ce The evolution of the cell parameter refined from the X-ray diffraction patterns is in good agreement with data given in the literature The co-precipitation of a The precipitations of cerium and neodymium at 10 The co-precipitation of the two lanthanides mainly leads to mixed oxychloride (Ce In the frame of the developed pyrochemical process, this technique of precipitation by wet argon sparging seems promising. It could be used for nuclear fuel refabrication in the process end-step. This method will be further tested with actinides in order to confirm the precipitation yield and to characterize the obtained powder.
