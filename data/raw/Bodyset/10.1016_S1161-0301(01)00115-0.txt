From 1990 to 1998, we studied the N release from ploughed 3-year-old grazed grasslands in the subsequent three seasons of forage crops on a sandy loam soil. Silage maize in the ley–arable rotation outyielded continuous maize on permanent arable plots by 85, 21 and 2% at mineral N fertilization rates of respectively 0, 75 and 180 kg N ha−1. This decreasing yield effect with increasing N fertilization indicated that the ley–arable rotation effect was mainly a N-contribution effect. The N release was highest during the first year; it decreased during the second and third year following the grassland ploughing. Economically optimum N fertilization rates for silage maize in these years were respectively 2, 139 and 154 kg N ha−1. Simultaneously, on permanent arable plots this was respectively 152, 191 and 183 kg N ha−1. This resulted in comparable yields (19.75 Mg DM ha−1 year−1) but with a possible saving of 231 kg of mineral N fertilizer ha−1 in a 3-year silage maize period following the ploughed leys compared with continuous silage maize. The N uptake by silage maize on temporary arable plots following grasslands was higher than on permanent arable plots, owing to the higher yields but also to an increased N concentration in the crop on the temporary arable plots. Starting the arable forage crop sequence with fodder beet following the grassland ploughing and adjusting the N fertilization to the enhanced N release minimized the risks on high amounts of residual soil N and hence N leaching losses.For a long time in the history of agriculture, grasslands (with or without legumes) were considered of vital importance in crop rotations for building up reserves of organic matter and nitrogen in the soil ( After World War II however, the plentiful and inexpensive availability of mineral fertilizers and pesticides enabled the development of monocultures, ‘without loss of yield’. Nevertheless, these systems often induced a decrease in soil organic matter content, a degradation of the soil structure, increased needs for external inputs and higher risks of surface and groundwater contamination ( Recent (often legislative) restrictions on the use of N fertilizers and a renewed interest in organic farming or more integrated, sustainable farming systems in general, restored the attention to crop rotations and more specifically to the role of grass/legume leys in these rotations ( Under grass leys, organic matter accumulates in roots, stubble, litter and soil organic matter ( The amount of released N (“N credit”) increases with the age of the ploughed sward (  Compared with cut grassland, grazed grassland accumulates more subsoil organic matter and N and hence more N is released post ploughing ( The fertilization level of the grassland has a relatively small effect on the amount of accumulated organic matter and on the N release following the grassland ploughing ( Besides the important N contribution effect, a rotation effect that does not relate to N occurs in arable crops following grassland ploughing. This non-N effect is observed and estimated as the yield (or other parameter) advantage for the crop in the rotational system under non-N-limiting circumstances (e.g. at high mineral N fertilizer rates). In the case of silage maize, the nature of such a non-N effect was often ascribed to healthier plant roots ( Ploughing grass or grass/legume leys to allow arable production is often mentioned as a potentially major contribution to nitrate pollution of drinking water resources ( Possible measures to control these N losses are a time delay in the ploughing of the ley from early to late autumn or from autumn to spring ( Since the largest amount of mineralized N is released during the first year after ploughing the leys and less N is mineralized from the second year on ( The challenge is to select a first arable crop which is profitable and which utilizes the released N efficiently ( A first aim of our research was to quantify both the N-contribution effect and the non-N effect of 3-year grazed grassland breaks on a subsequent 3-year period of arable forage crops. We considered the non-N effect to be observable at a mineral N fertilization rate of 180 kg ha Additional N fertilization levels of 0 and 75 kg N ha In 1966, the basic experiment was established on a sandy loam soil of the experimental farm of Ghent University at Melle (50°59′ N, 03°49′ E, 11 m above sea level). The clay (<2 μm), silt (2–20 μm), fine sand (20–200 μm) and coarse sand (200–2000 μm) content at Melle is 86, 116, 758 and 40 g kg The individual plot size was 750 m The grass leys were cut during spring, at a yield of 3000–5000 kg DM ha New temporary leys were established during the autumn (September–October), with recently released Belgian perennial ryegrass ( The ploughing of the 3-year-old grasslands was conducted during the spring (March–April). Since the first following arable crops were silage maize or fodder beet, this spring ploughing was feasible. From 1981 on, all the arable land plots were split in two sub-systems: a silage maize ( In this paper we consider the arable periods between 1990 and 1999. During this period, three rates of mineral N fertilization (0, 75 or 180 kg mineral N ha More agronomic data for the considered maize and fodder beet crops are summarized in On these arable plots weeds were killed with the appropriate herbicides. At the end of each growing season, subplots of 12 m A quadratic model was used to describe the DM yield response to applied mineral N. The marginal yield response to applied mineral N fertilization was determined by the first derivative of the yield response curve ( According to The yield at The second method (“difference method”) considers the difference between the We considered the non-N effect to be the yield- or N uptake advantage of the silage maize on the temporary compared with the permanent arable plots at the highest N fertilizer dose of 180 kg N ha At the end of the growing seasons 1994–1999, the mineral N content of the soil profile was determined (on 29 September 1994, 13 September 1995, 8 November 1996, 7 October 1997, 24 October 1998 and 9 November 1999). Using a gauge auger, four at random spots were sampled on each individual subplot, a bulked sample was composed per treatment, separately for the horizons of 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm of soil depth. We extracted the 0–30 cm samples with KCl (1 N) and determined N (ammonia and nitrate) colorimetrically with a continuous flow analyzer. The deeper soil samples were extracted with a 1% KAl(SO The amounts of residual mineral soil N were compared with the Flemish legislative limit: no more than 90 kg NO For the considered growing seasons, the monthly precipitation and the accumulated effective temperatures measured at the meteorological station at Melle, are summarized in According to The observed silage maize DM yields obtained from the temporary and the permanent arable plots (1990–1998) are summarized in During the considered 9-year experimental period, the silage maize on temporary arable land significantly outyielded maize on permanent arable plots, by 64.4, 28.8 and 3.4 Mg DM ha Without N fertilization, silage maize on temporary arable land yielded as much as on permanent arable plots receiving 736 kg N ha During the first year after ploughing the 3-year-old grasslands, the maize yields were high and no significant yield differences between the N fertilization rates were observed: even without N fertilization the maximum DM yield was reached. During the second and third year after ploughing the grasslands, temporary arable plots still outyielded the permanent ones. However, the benefit had decreased and a yield response to applied N fertilization already appeared during the second year following grassland ploughing. This response increased during the third year after ploughing. The permanent arable–temporary arable land effect, as well as the N fertilization rate effect were significant, but so was the interaction between these factors (  The observed differences in yield response of silage maize to applied N fertilization ( The calculated rates of the economically optimal N fertilization rate ( In case where  In the second and third year after ploughing the grassland, On average over the 9-year period, (and using an arbitrary value of 200 kg N ha In the first, second and third silage maize season following the grassland ploughing, The silage maize N uptakes corresponding with the DM yields of Over the 9-year trial period, silage maize on temporary arable plots exported 758, 577 and 252 kg more N ha In the first year after ploughing the grasslands, N-unfertilized silage maize exported as much or even more N as maize on corresponding permanent arable plots receiving 180 kg N ha Considering the DM yield range between 11 and 24 Mg DM ha During the first arable season following the grassland ploughing, a fodder beet crop (including the beet tops) exported significantly more N than silage maize did (  The calculated NFRV of the ploughed grassland, derived from the maize yield response curves are given in On average over the three rotation periods, the values decreased from 124 to 81 and 52 kg N ha The NFRV values found on arable plots following N+ grasslands (350 kg fertilizer N ha The calculated N credit on the arable plots following the grassland ploughing ( The amounts of residual mineral soil N are summarized in In a first arable season following the grassland ploughing, the risk of excessive nitrate leaching was substantial: in the autumn of 1996, the post harvest residual mineral N amount in the soil profile (0–90 cm) exceeded the limit of 90 kg N ha Following the fodder beet of 1996 however, no excessive quantities of residual N were found (maximum: 44 kg N ha During November 1999, there was one overshoot of the 90 kg N ha  With fodder beet as arable openers in 1996, following the grassland ploughing during the autumn of 1995, the amount of residual soil N under silage maize was below 90 kg ha During 1998, also a third year arable season following ley incorporation, climatic circumstances were more favourable for production and N uptake, resulting in low residual N amounts (less than 90 kg N ha Silage maize following the 3-year grazed grassland breaks significantly outyielded the maize on permanent arable land. The reduction of the yield benefit with increasing N fertilization rate confirms the findings of The still positive yield effect at the highest N dose (180 kg N ha In the second and third season following the grass ploughing, This “N credit” corresponds with the “N-contribution effect” of the ploughed grassland according to the difference method. The calculated N fertilizer replacement values result in an average 3-year N credit of 257 kg kg N ha According to For these reasons, when drawing conclusions, we follow The uptake of N by silage maize on the arable plots after ploughing grass was significantly higher than the N uptake from the permanent arable plots, the difference decreased with increasing N fertilization. In contrast with the DM yield observations, at the highest rate of N fertilization (180 kg N ha Fodder beet proved to be potentially better arable openers following the grassland break. Owing to their deeper rooting and longer growing season ( Three-year grazed grassland breaks offer a valuable potential for a significant reduction of fertilizer-N use in arable forage crops. Positive yield as well as quality effects occur. Applying an adapted forage crop succession and an adjusted N fertilization, the risks on high N losses can be minimized.
