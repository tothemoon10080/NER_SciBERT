Undoped and Pd-doped SnO2 hollow nanofibers were prepared by single capillary electrospinning and their gas sensing characteristics for 100ppm H2, 100ppm CO, 500ppm CH4, and 100ppm C2H5OH were investigated. The gas responses and responding kinetics were closely dependent upon the sensor temperature and Pd doping concentration. The undoped and 0.08wt% Pd-doped SnO2 nanofibers showed selective detection to C2H5OH at 385 and 440°C. In the 0.4wt% Pd-doped SnO2 nanofiber sensor, the selective detection to CH4 and H2 was optimized at 440°C with the minimum cross-sensitivity to C2H5OH. The tuning of gas selectivity via the combinatorial control of Pd doping concentration and sensor temperature in the electrospun hollow nanofibers was discussed in relation to the gas sensing mechanism.Oxide semiconductor gas sensors undergo resistance change upon exposure to reducing gases by the oxidative interactions with the negatively charged chemisorbed oxygen. The gas sensing characteristics such as gas response, responding speed, and selectivity are greatly influenced by the surface area, donor density, agglomeration, porosity, and acid–base property of the sensing material, the presence of catalyst, and the sensing temperature However, research on the design of selective gas sensors using electrospun oxide nanofibers remains in the elementary stage and further studies are necessary to realize high-performance gas sensors and electronic nose. As the compositional control of nanofibers is relatively easy in the electrospinning process, the kinds and concentrations of catalyst can be manipulated conveniently, which provides further benefit to the design of a selective gas sensor. In this study, undoped and Pd-doped SnO One gram of SnCl The nanofibers were dispersed in isopropanol (Sigma–Aldrich Co., Ltd., USA) by ultrasonic treatment and subsequently dried at 80 The morphologies of the undoped and Pd-doped SnO The sensor element was packaged with a stainless steel holder ( The pure and Pd-doped Sn precursor nanofibers showed amorphous XRD patterns regardless of composition (data not shown). The XRD patterns of SnO The as-spun Sn precursor nanofibers were approximately 200–300 The high-resolution TEM observation of the as-spun precursor nanofibers containing Sn or Sn–Pd showed the core–shell configuration ( Thus far, the oxide hollow nanofibers have been prepared by heat treating core(organic)/shell(inorganic) nanofibers attained by the coaxial two-capillary electrospinning of two immiscible liquids The gas sensing transients of SnO The times to reach 90% variation in resistance upon exposure to gas and air were defined as the 90% response time ( At a Pd doping concentration of 0.4 The gas responses ( At 385 The roles of Pd in the gas sensing reaction, as reported in the literature, have not always been consistent. This suggests that Pd plays a complicated role that varies according to its doping concentration When an n-type oxide semiconductor is exposed to a reducing gas, the resistance is significantly decreased by the release of electrons via the oxidation between the reducing gas and the negatively charged surface oxygen (O The catalytic oxidation activity of H The above results indicate that the detection of H The selective H The CH The undoped and Pd-doped electrospun SnO This work was supported by KOSEF NRL program grant funded by the
