This paper presents results for a project demonstrating a new technology for arsenic removal from copper concentrates. The problems concerning pyrometallurgical processing of copper concentrates with high arsenic content are presented in the first part of the paper. Possible solution of the problem by leaching of natural enargite crystals with sodium hypochlorite, under alkaline oxidizing conditions, with enargite converted into crystalline CuO and the soluble arsenic forming

According to the Arrhenius diagrams, the activation energy of the process, under isothermal conditions was calculated. The kinetic equation for desulfurization during isothermal roasting was found to be:

                     , with activation energy of 30±1kJ/mol.Arsenic is one of the most common toxic impurities found in copper concentrates. The main As-containing mineral species, in copper concentrates, are enargite and luzonite, while realgar and arsenopyrite are also present in lesser amounts. Unfortunately, the prevalence of enargite among the copper-bearing minerals and as a result the relatively high arsenic content in the concentrates substantially reduces their economic value, owing to the hazardous emissions generated from pyrometallurgical processing. The amount of arsenic removed during the process of arsenic-bearing concentrate roasting is very high. Arsenic, as well as its oxides, are highly volatile and leaves the reactor as off-gas constituents. Thus, in unfavorable metal market conditions, direct roasting is uneconomical because gas cleaning facilities demands are too expensive. In order to minimize the problems associated with the processing of these very hazardous fumes, the arsenic content in copper concentrates must be reduced to low levels (usually to <0.5% As) and such levels are difficult to obtain by differential flotation some sulfide deposits ( In an attempt to solve this problem, we have explored the possibility of hydrometallurgical technology for dissolving the arsenic from the concentrate prior to pyrometallurgical processing. Two techniques for arsenic removal from enargite are presented in the literature ( Alkaline leaching of energite concentrates using sodium sulfide solutions after mechanical activation via fine grinding ( Leaching of natural enargite crystals with sodium hypochlorite under alkaline oxidizing conditions with enargite converted into crystalline CuO and the arsenic solubiles forming It was decided to evaluate the possibility of applying the second method, because it is attractive in terms of its potential application on a commercial scale. Large natural crystals of enargite from Bor copper mine (Serbia and Montenegro), ore deposit “H”, were chosen for this study. Mineralogical investigations were conducted using X-ray diffraction with the atomic powder diffractometer “PHILIPS” APD SYSTEM PW 1710, under the following conditions: 2 Isothermal investigations were performed using an electric resistance furnace with thermostatic control. A measured volume of air was introduced into the reaction area, while gaseous product of reaction (mostly SO     The degree of desulphurization was calculated using the equation %S – amount of sulfur reacted with oxygen during process of oxidative roasting, calculated using Eq. %S Schematic diagram of the experimental setup for roasting process is presented in The degree of desulphurisation was calculated using Eq. All the kinetic experiments were performed with particle sizes – 100 Leaching of enargite samples was conducted in a 1  Diffractometric analysis (XRD) ( Oxidative roasting was performed by introducing a pre-determined volume of air into the tube furnace reaction space. Kinetic analysis under isothermal conditions during enargite roasting was investigated both with respect to S and As removal during the process. Roasting temperatures were in the range of 400–800 The following reactions ( When roasting enargite in oxidative atmosphere at temperatures up to 193 In the temperature interval 193–550 Part of the As At 315 Analysis of kinetic parameters for the process of oxidative roasting of investigated samples, under isothermal conditions, was done using the method proposed by According to the results presented in Linearisation of experimental results, presented in Using equation D From the slopes of the linearized isotherms, rate constants were determined and an Arrhenius diagram, According to the Arrhenius diagrams, the activation energy of the process, under isothermal conditions was calculated. The kinetic equation for desulfurization was found to be: From the results shown in Leach tests were conducted in a 1 Leach residues were also analyzed using XRD, For the results presented in Using data in According to the Arrhenius diagram, the activation energy of the process, under isothermal conditions was calculated. Kinetic equation was found to be: For enargite leaching using hypochlorite solution to be applied in the practice of copper concentrate leaching, it is important to know behaviour of other minerals possible to be present in copper concentrate during the process. The results of the selectivity of leaching reagent investigations are summarized in According to the results obtained during the experiments and presented above, following scheme for process proposed can be proposed, Arsenic can be stabilized by direct precipitation of the leach solution with Ca(OH) Reaction rates are fast (in transition area with activation energy of 30 Selective alkaline-oxidizing leaching of enargite in hypochlorite media can be used for arsenic removal from copper concentrates. Leaching reaction described could be the basis of a new process for removing As from copper concentrates and can be used on a commercial scale. The work presented in this paper can be treated as an beginning of investigation of this possibility for treating copper concentrates from Bor copper mine (Serbia and Montenegro), ore deposit “H”, which contain large amount of As.
