Batch adsorption from aqueous solutions in a slightly basic medium of Methylene Blue, up to 2500 mg/L, onto synthetic magnesium silicate (Florisil) of three particle size ranges (mean diameters of 112, 200 and 425 Î¼m) was compared to the corresponding adsorption onto activated carbon and Amberlite XAD-2. The best fit of the kinetic results was achieved by a pseudo second-order equation. The equilibrium data were found to be well represented by the Langmuir isotherm equation. Amberlite XAD-2, an unspecific adsorbent capable of adsorbing exclusively through a surface effect, exhibited a poor dye uptake, confirming that the adsorption mechanism on Florisil was due to electrostatic attraction and ion exchange. Moreover, the comparison between Florisil and the other adsorbents was performed on the basis of the evaluation of the surface area and pore volume occupied by the adsorbed dye.
