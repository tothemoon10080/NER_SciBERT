Fe, Fe–Al2O3, and Fe–Pb nanocrystalline alloys were prepared using ball milling. Fe–Al2O3 forms a nanocomposite and rule-of-mixtures hardening occurs with an additional contribution due to grain size reduction during milling. Fe–Pb forms a non-equilibrium solid solution where hardening appears to be modulated by Pb clustering and segregation to grain boundaries.Nanocrystalline (nc) metals with grain sizes <100 A SPEX 8000 high-energy shaker mill was used to make pure Fe, Fe–Pb (1, 3 and 5 Grain size measurements were made by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Scherrer formula, and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). XRD studies were conducted on a Rigaku X-ray machine using CuKα radiation. For TEM sample preparation, 3 Backscattered electron (BSE) imaging was carried out in a Hitachi S3200 scanning electron microscope for the detection of second-phase particles. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements were done for the Fe–Pb alloys using a Perkin–Elmer DSC 7 differential scanning calorimeter. Samples were heated to 450 The hardness was measured using the nanoindentation technique. Nanoindentation tests were carried out on a Hysitron Triboscope using a Berkovich indenter. The maximum load was 8–9.6  The Fe grain size measurements by XRD and TEM are shown in The hardness values obtained for pure Fe, Fe–Pb and Fe–Al  The presence of a solute atom, different in size from that of the matrix, causes a localized misfit strain field. The addition of Pb to Fe produces a very large misfit strain, defined as A plot of Δ Fe–Al The authors acknowledge Mr. Kristopher Darling for assistance in the experimental work.
