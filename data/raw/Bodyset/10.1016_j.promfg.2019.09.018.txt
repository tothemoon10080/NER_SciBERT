In general, a set of linear segments defines the tool-path in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) a well-known additive manufacturing technology. While a zig-zag (or a contour parallel) path, based on linear interpolations, is a good option for filling a product because it is easy to implement, the used of a linear tool-path for curved contours increases the build time, and leads to dimensional inaccuracies and to appearance problems due to a lack of synchronization between print speed and extrusion speed. This work explains how to use the interpolation options (linear, circular and Bezier) provided by an open source firmware, and defines an analytical and experimental procedure to compare those schemes by means of their speed profile.
