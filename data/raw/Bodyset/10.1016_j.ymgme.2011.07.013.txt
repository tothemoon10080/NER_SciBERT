Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a multisystem heritable disorder characterized by ectopic mineralization of peripheral connective tissues, particularly in the skin, the eyes and the cardiovascular system Recently, Markello et al. (2011) To test this hypothesis, we utilized Sf9 insect cell transport system transfected with an expression vector allowing overexpression of human ABCC6. Inside-out vesicles were then generated from these cells and used for vesicular transport assay The pathomechanistic pathways of ectopic mineralization in PXE as a result of inactivating
