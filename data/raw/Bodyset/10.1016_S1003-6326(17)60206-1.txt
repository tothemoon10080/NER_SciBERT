In the cationic flotation of pyrolusite using dodecyl ammine (DDA), the depressive effect of sodium carbonate and calcium chloride on the calcite mineral was investigated systematically through flotation experiments, FTIR analysis, contact angle measurements and zeta potential tests. The microflotation experiments showed that both depressant agents decrease the flotation recovery of calcite significantly. In addition, sodium carbonate acts as activator agent for pyrolusite, and increases its floatability. The flotation experiments and contact angle measurements indicated that the selective depression effect of sodium carbonate on the calcite mineral is more than that of calcium chloride. As evidenced by zeta potential and FT-IR analysis, sodium carbonate decreases the negative charges on the surface of calcite mineral and subsequently reduces the adsorption of DDA collector through electrostatic forces. At a pH of 7.5, using 2000 g/t DDA and 1500 g/t sodium carbonate, a pyrolusite concentrate containing almost 40% MnO with 71.5% recovery is achieved by carrying out the ore flotation experiments on the tabling pre-concentrate.
