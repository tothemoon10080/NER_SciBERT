The aim of this study was to investigate dry micro-fine grinding of sodium feldspar (albite) with and without grinding aids using a vertical stirred ball mill. The effect of amine based various grinding aids (BMA 1923, BMA 1517, KATPLAST 54 and GRACE XS 304) and dosages (500, 1000 and 2000g/t) were investigated and test results were evaluated based on the product size (d80) and specific energy consumption. Tests revealed that the grinding energy required to reach target grinding size (d80
                     =10 micron) was reduced up to 60% using grinding aids. BMA 1923 was determined to be the most effective grinding aid in terms of target d80 except that lower sizes could be reached with BMA 1517 at the same dosage and similar energy consumptions.Grinding is an important operation used widely in various industries, but it is also one of the most inefficient unit operations ( An albite sample < Laboratory batch type stirred ball mill manufactured by Union Process type HD1 with a vertical axis mill was utilized in grinding tests. It comprises a 620 The effects of various parameters were investigated in a detailed study by present authors ( Four different amine based grinding aids, commonly used in cement industry, were used and their effect of dosage was investigated. Trade names of the aids used were BMA 1923, BMA 1517, KATPLAST 54 and GRACE XS 304. They were added in the form of liquid. The grinding tests were carried out as a batch process in which samples were taken from the pot at a determined grinding time intervals. After each test, all of the media and ground samples were removed from the mill and the media were separated from the products by sieving. A Wet Laser Diffraction Particle Sizer Malvern 2000 Ver. 2.00 with Hydro 2000 MU attachment (Malvern Co., Ltd., UK) was used for the particle size analysis of the feed and the ground products. Its measurement range of particle size is between 0.002 and 2000 Energy consumption was determined by torque measurement ( Graphs of d  A series of dry grinding tests were carried out with and without grinding aids using a laboratory batch type vertical stirred ball mill.
