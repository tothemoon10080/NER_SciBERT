Hourly simulation results allow for computing the solar fraction, in cases when the cooling capacity of the ejector cycle is kept constant during daily periods. The computed solar fraction is compared with estimates obtained from the

                      method based on the utilizability concept. An equivalent minimum temperature for the utilizability of the solar system is found, which proves to be different, but close to, the vapor generator temperature of the ejector cycle. It is shown that the solar fraction derived from the utilizability concept based on the monthly means of the global solar radiation is applicable to solar-assisted ejector cooling cycles, in cases when the minimum temperature at which solar heat is supplied to the load is determined. Good agreement is found between the solar fraction results obtained from the simulations and those obtained by the

Solar energy is considered worldwide as an effective renewable energy alternative; with potential to contribute to reductions in fossil fuel and electric energy consumption, mostly for domestic air and water heating applications. Collectors of the flat plate and evacuated tube types are cost effective for many applications in domestic and industrial process heat, if the required temperatures are lower than 100 Solar-assisted ejector systems are usually simulated on an hourly basis ( The solar fraction, defined as the ratio of solar-supplied heat to total thermal load, is dependent on available solar radiation, collector efficiency, collector surface area, and thermal load. The cost of solar-assisted cooling cycles is therefore linked to the solar fraction, which determines the optimal collector area, and the cost of operating an auxiliary heating system. A proper estimation of hourly, daily, monthly mean, and yearly mean solar fraction allows for correct dimensioning of a solar-assisted cooling system, and for an accurate estimation of capital and operation costs during its life cycle. Varying conditions for available solar radiation exist in every geographical location, which difficults the application of standardized solutions. It is therefore necessary to develop methodologies for determining the solar fraction of solar-assisted cooling cycles, in order to help the optimization process that can lead to the design and deployment of high-performance, low-cost systems. One of such design methodologies is the In what follows, simulation results are reported, which show that the It should be pointed out that the A solar-assisted ejector cooling system is composed of a solar heating system that supplies heat to a vapor generator, which operates as the heat source in an ejector cooling cycle, as shown in The working fluid evaporates in the vapor generator at the saturation temperature An auxiliary heating system is needed if the amount of heat provided by the solar heating system is unable to satisfy the thermal load requirements. The combined operation of solar and auxiliary heating systems guarantees a proper steady state flow rate of refrigerant. A model for the solar-assisted ejector cooling system is developed based on energy conservation principles for three flow circuits: the solar heat collection system, the vapor generation circuit, and the ejector/evaporator circuit. It is composed by the solar collector, the storage tank, and the water side of the vapor generator. A full mixing model is assumed in order to simplify the energy balance of the system: all the fluid inside the storage tank is considered to be at the same temperature, and the system pipes are ideal, without friction and temperature losses. An energy balance of system leads to the following equation: The solar heat collection system and the vapor generation circuit are linked through the vapor generator heat exchanger, which receives the solar-supplied heat The hourly solar fraction in the vapor generator varies from 0 (no heat supplied by the solar heat collection system) to 1 (as when The annual solar fraction The temperatures in the vapor circuit shown in Depending on the solar fraction, the vapor generator can work either as a single-phase heat exchanger or as a two-phase heat exchanger. This gives origin to two different operation regimes for the heat exchanger. For low solar fractions, the solar heating system is able to supply only sensible heat to the vapor generator, and the refrigerant does not reach a saturated state. In this case, and according to heat exchanger theory, the heat supplied to the vapor generator is given by: If the solar fraction is such that the refrigerant temperature does not reach the onset of saturation after flowing through the vapor generator, then the temperature For a high enough solar fraction, the solar heat supplied will increase the refrigerant temperature until it reaches a saturated state, and then provide latent heat. In this case part of the heat exchanger area A The heat input in this two-phase flow case is a function of the saturated liquid and vapor enthalpies In Eq. Eliminating the unknown transition temperature Then, an energy balance in the evaporator section of the vapor generator yields From Eqs. The temperature differences By subtracting By replacing the expression of For any given vapor quality Eqs. In the circumstance the vapor quality The temperature The vapor quality can be obtained from an energy balance in the evaporator section, as Eq. In this circuit, the ejector is assumed to operate steadily at its optimum efficiency point. The refrigeration load The coefficient of performance of an ejector cooling cycle is known to be a function of the condenser temperature For given values of the heat exchanger area The values of  If a phase change process does occur in the refrigerant side, then the evaporator maximum area is dependent on the reservoir thermal capacitance, and on the heat exchanger area, as seen in For given values of (  For constant heat exchanger areas, the solar fraction increases with an increase on the thermal capacitance ratio. For relatively low values of heat exchanger area, the solar fraction is proportional to temperature. This behavior is expected, since a low temperature heat exchange results in one-phase, sensible heat being transferred to the refrigerant circuit. For relatively high values of heat exchanger area, the refrigerant temperature reaches a saturated state, and phase change occurs, which in turn results in higher values of solar fraction. The sudden slope change on For given refrigeration load For case II, the solution procedure is more complex. Eq. In this case the evaporator area Once Results are presented in the following section for the parameters which determine an optimal solar-assisted cooling system, as in ( The parameters used in the simulations are those for an optimized ejector cooling cycle: Simulations are performed for a COP of 0.6 using R142b as the working fluid. The COP 0.6 corresponds to the case of a cascading cooling ejector cycle assisted by a mechanical booster as analyzed in (  It can be observed that as the collector area increases, the most frequent temperature approaches 80 The occurrences of hourly solar fractions for collector areas The frequency distribution of From a statistical point of view, it can be argued that the mean value for The annual solar fraction These tendencies are valid for fixed values of   The numerical results from the hourly simulations here presented have been used to adjust the solar fraction correlation presented in The mean annual solar fraction computed with the A direct comparison for the mean annual solar fraction between the simulation results and the It can be observed that good agreement exists between both methodologies, with error levels decreasing as collector area approaches a value of 100 The comparison for the mean annual solar fraction between the simulation results and the A comparison of the solar fraction computation by the The numerical results show that the simulation results are in good agreement with the The analysis indicates that the simulations presented are a valid design methodology, comparable to the more established The methodology is independent of the refrigeration cycle COP, and thus can be used for different combinations of components and refrigeration loads. The present analysis should be made for other values of the vapor generator temperature. It should also be extended to other refrigerant fluids, in order to find a correlation between vapor generation temperature and the respective equivalent minimum temperatures for the The authors acknowledge financial support from CNPq, the National Research Council of Brazil, and PETROBRAS, under contract CT-Petro/FINEP No. 21.01.0387.00, and from the Dirección de Asuntos Internacionales of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile.
