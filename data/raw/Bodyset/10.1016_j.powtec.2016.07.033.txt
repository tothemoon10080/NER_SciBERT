Ball milling motion has been previously studied through computationally expensive, off-line experimental video processing and numerical simulations by the discrete element method. This research establishes a more efficient formulation of the ball energetics and kinetics similar to the Brownian kinetic theory of statistical mechanics. Based on assumptions of thermomechanical equilibrium, negligible gravitational, aerodynamic and surface condition effects, and decoupled impact interaction among balls and with milled particulates, this model proposes mono-parametric spectral energy and velocity probability density functions akin to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, along with uniformly distributed impact directionality. The model predictions are calibrated and validated by comparison with published experimental measurements and computationally derived spectra. This descriptive Brownian-like motion model enables effective simulation of contact and impact, material deformation and micro-joining of ball milled bimetallic powders. A comprehensive simulation of the evolving internal fractal microstructure of the processed particulates is implemented at real-time computation speed, and its predictions are compared with experimental micrographs of ball milled NiAl particulates.Milling of particulates, originally powered by humans, animals, water and wind, has been one of the prehistoric fundamental manufacturing methods for processing of rock and soil, construction materials, foodstuff and medicines Ball milling in rotating uniaxial cylindrical vial or planetary settings ( Recently, real-time modeling of the particulate microstructure for in-process feedback control of ball milling was introduced, based on a computationally cost-effective semi-analytical predictive simulation of the dynamic product geometry and material composition During steady-state ball milling, the previous experimental and numerical literature elucidates a continuous, time-invariant, chaotic motion pattern of the ball population in a confined vial, consisting of deterministic free trajectory segments between random collisions with other balls and vial walls, under predictable impact conditions. Upon distant zoomed-out observation from a larger dimensional (macro) scale, this Wiener process/LÃ©vy flight pattern is reminiscent of the familiar nanoscale Brownian motion of ideal gas atoms/molecules at thermal equilibrium, with well-established descriptions by kinetic theory The Brownian model involves fully reversible, perfectly elastic collisions between spherical particles and with stationary, adiabatic container walls. In ball milling, irreversible mechanical energy losses into heat during impacts, as denoted by the coefficient of restitution In a fixed-elevation ball milling setup, gravity introduces no mechanical work to the average ball energy, while limited vial height ( As per kinetic theory, decoupled ball motion requires that their mean free path between successive collisions as analyzed below, should be larger than the characteristic geometric size, i.e. the harmonic mean of the ball and vial dimensions. While temporarily adopted for simplicity (i.e. balls only in vial), the assumption on ball-particulate interactions will be explicitly relaxed in the sequel to reflect transport of mechanical energy to the processed particulates during collisions. The (normal and shear) impact energy transported to the particulate contact area, and the corresponding restitution of the impacting ball or vial, are determined by the relative linear and spin velocity components of the impactor surface at the contact location. Such an effective composite velocity Similarly, at the surface of a ball of radius where Besides the deterministic motion of the vial, the experimental evidence In this distribution, the most probable energy is The parameter where Through its relation with energy The most probable velocity in this pdf is In the presence of milled particulates in the vial along with the balls, it is now assumed additionally that both these elements follow kinetic energy typically resulting to During each such collision, from the impinging vial or ball energy implying that This also implies that, while the corresponding incoming energy The kinetic energy The random incidence angle Finally the particulate surface is hit by an impactor which is either one of Statistical selection of impact energy Before each impact event, this original primitive or developed composite particulate is surrounded by statistically selected additional clusters, similar to the current particulate and/or its prior development generations as explained below, and brought into random but stable contact by relative surface rolling of each cluster ( During the progression of each impact event, an initially elastic Hertzian contact at the particulate-impactor ellipsoidal interface patch with respective equivalent contact curvatures and stiffnesses, absorbs the impact energy components (Eq. Next, the equivalent elasticity assumption above is relaxed and the total work Therefore, sequential collisions with the impactors cause a progressive evolution of the external geometric size and shape along with internal material structure of the particulate under study, yielding successively new particulate generations along with previous ones in the setup, all the way back to original mono-material powders. Since the other balls and vial impactors, besides the one involved in the collision with the studied particulate, also act simultaneously during ball milling, the populations of particulate generations grow in parallel according to a logistic parabola law. The pdf of each particulate generation is composed of products of the population sizes for combinations of its prior generations. These pdfs are used in assembling the adjacent cluster layer around the particulate before each collision; and they reflect the eventual demographics of particulate diversity in the ball milled product.   It can be seen that the statistical distribution slightly over-predicts the ball fraction at very low velocities as explained before, while it somewhat under-predicts at high velocities. A plausible reason for these deviations, also manifested in the variance of the efficiency parameter The comparison of coefficient of restitution  To validate the ball milling energetics formulation, the previously described simulation model For a quantitative comparison of the fractal dimension metrics in the experimental and simulated particulate sections of The previous Brownian-like model of statistical ball milling motion is described by cost-efficient analytical probability density functions for the ball energy and velocity, and by spherically uniform directionality of impactor incidence. A single calibration parameter in a Maxwell-Boltzmann expression, i.e. the RMS velocity of the balls in a single direction, can be either calibrated from video-measured energy or velocity laboratory spectra, or computed from the initial or final transients of the process conditions. The estimates of this descriptive model directly fit published energetic and kinetic spectra for various decoupled ball milling process conditions, while they also enable simulation of impacted particulate structures in low-energy planetary processing of bimetallic powders at real-time computation speeds on ordinary hardware. The convenience of this probabilistic kinetic theory-based model of ball milling is attractive for description of other milling processes, potentially challenging its original assumptions and calling for appropriate adjustment of its formulation and/or parameters. High-energy uncooled processing, for example, may result in dominant thermomechanical transients departing from steady-state equilibrium and isothermal assumptions. Temperature variation of the material parameters may also alter impact restitution and affect spectral distribution parameters. Use of liquid process control agents may also affect such parameters through concomitant viscosity and capillary surface tension effects during contact. Finally coupled interaction of ball impactors at high bulk volume charges or with larger milled particulates of commensurate mass and energy, as well as complex surface geometries and impact property distributions, could invalidate the decoupledness assumption of ball motion made above. Such conditions may necessitate coupled-species, modified energetic and kinetic spectral expressions with dependencies on non-uniform impact directionality distributions, to be established through subsequent investigation.
