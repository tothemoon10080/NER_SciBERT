This paper presents a study for leaching kinetics of sphalerite concentrate in FeCl3–HCl solution. The shrinking core model was applied to the results of experiments investigating the effects of stirrer speed of 200–600rpm, ferric ion concentration in range of 0–1M, solid/liquid ratio in range of 1/100–1/5, leaching temperature range of 40–80°C and particle size on zinc dissolution rate. The activation energy for the leaching process was found to be 45.30kJ/mol and the Arrhenius constant was calculated to be 5.454s−1. The order of reaction for ferric ion concentration, solid/liquid ratio and particle size were also obtained. The rate of the reaction based on reaction-controlled process can be expressed as,

                     The dissolution of sphalerite with acidic ferric chloride solution was found to be controlled by reaction-controlled process.Sphalerite (ZnS), which associates mainly with other metal sulphide minerals, such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS Conventional zinc recovery process from sphalerite concentrates involves roasting the concentrate to zinc oxide or sulphate, leaching the resultant calcine with dilute sulphuric acid and electrodepositing of zinc from purified leach solution (roasting–leaching–electrowinning, RLE) The elimination of roasting step is an important advantage and high zinc extraction increases the importance of hydrometallurgical treatment processes. For this purpose, various leaching studies have been performed by many researchers in basic medium using ammonia solution Ferric ion, which is one of the most important oxidative agents in leaching process, is mostly used from the source of ferric chloride (FeCl Sphalerite leaching with acidic ferric chloride solutions products, including zinc chloride and other zinc chloride complexes, elemental sulphur, ferrous chloride, Fe It has been known that dissolution rate during the leaching decreases with time and it is directly dependent on the activation energy. Habashi Wadsworth Hence, the objectives of this study were to investigate the main factors involved in the leaching of sphalerite by acidic ferric chloride solution, such as ferric ion concentration, solid/liquid ratio, particle size, temperature and stirring speed, and also to determine what process controls the rate of the dissolution of sphalerite or what kinetic model can be applied. In this study, samples of the sphalerite concentrate were taken from Menka Flotation Plant (Sivas, Turkey) where CuFeS A pyrex beaker of 1  The study for the effect of ferric ion concentration on sphalerite dissolution is given in The effect of temperature on the sphalerite dissolution is shown in The effect of solid/liquid ratio on the dissolution of sphalerite was investigated in the range of 1/5–1/50. The results are presented in Leaching was also investigated by various particle size of sphalerite concentrate. The shrinking core model considers that the leaching process is controlled either by the diffusion of reactant through the solution boundary layer, or through a solid product layer, or by rate of the surface chemical reaction. The simplified equations of the shrinking core model when either diffusion or the surface chemical reactions are the slowest step can be expressed as follows, respectively Eq. The rate constants values, The results on the effect of ferric ion concentration were applied to this kinetic model and From the effects of solid/liquid ratios and particle sizes on zinc dissolution given in Furthermore, activation energy and the order of reaction values with respect to ferric ion, solid/liquid ratio and particle size also confirm to the shrinking core model for a reaction-controlled process. So, the leaching of sphalerite can be clearly controlled by surface chemical reactions as described by Eq. In the present study, the dissolution kinetics of sphalerite in acidic ferric chloride solution was studied. It was found that the reaction rate increases with increase in ferric ion concentration, reaction temperature, stirring speed and with decrease in solid to liquid ratio and particle size. A shrinking core model can be used to describe the dissolution kinetics of sphalerite concentrate in acidic ferric chloride solution. The dissolution of sphalerite with acidic ferric chloride solution was found to be controlled by the shrinking core model for reaction-controlled process. Dissolution rate can be expressed by Eq.
