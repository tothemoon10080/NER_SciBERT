A MgY2Zn1 alloy composed of a Mg matrix and about 19% of LPSO phase has been prepared by casting and further processing at high temperature by extrusion and equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). After extrusion an elongated microstructure was obtained in the direction of extrusion where the LPSO phase appears partially broken and the Mg matrix is partially recrystallized to very fine grain size. ECAP processing carried out both in the as-cast and extruded alloy leads to further grain refinement by recrystallization and also to further comminution of the LPSO particles. The increase in strength of the alloy by the different processing routes has been analysed in terms of the contributions from the LPSO particles and the deformed and the recrystallized grains in the magnesium matrix.Mg-transition metals-Y/Rare Earth alloys containing Long-Period Stacking Ordered structures (LPSO) are very attractive for structural applications due to the combination of low density with high mechanical strength, appreciable ductility and good creep resistance Recently, Yamasaki et al. Severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques have emerged in the past decade as effective methods for the production of bulk metallic materials with very fine grain sizes In the present study an MgY The alloy used had a nominal composition of 97%Mg–2%Y–1%Zn (atomic per cent) and was prepared by melting in an electric resistance furnace using high purity Mg and Zn elements and a Mg–22%Y master alloy. Ingots were cast by pouring the liquid metal into a cylindrical steel mould of diameter 42 Microstructures were examined by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were prepared by mechanical polishing and finishing with an etching solution of 5 The mechanical properties of the alloy in all conditions were evaluated by tensile testing cylindrical samples of diameter 3   In  During the high temperature processing, both extrusion and ECAP, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) of the magnesium matrix takes place, the extent of which increases with increasing deformation. As seen in The SEM images of The microstructure changes taking place during extrusion and ECAP depend mainly on temperature and total strain during processing. As already confirmed in previous studies by several authors, the extrusion process leads to the elongation of the equiaxed dendritic microstructure along the extrusion direction In parallel with the comminution of the LPSO phase into short fiber-shaped particles the magnesium matrix transforms into a bimodal microstructure by DRX, the extent of which also depends on temperature and total strain during processing, see At the same time the size of the DRX grains is much smaller after ECAP at 300 Examination of For the analysis we have used the same approach as that of a previous study made in the same MgY After processing, the term For the value of Finally, it is worth noting that the present results confirm the effect of texture and its evolution on the ductility and strength of the different processed materials The microstructural changes taking place during extrusion and ECAP processing of a MgY The as-cast microstructure, consisting of equiaxed magnesium dendrites and the LPSO phase distributed at the dendrite boundaries, becomes elongated by extrusion and ECAP due to the deformation of the LPSO phase which eventually cracks and comminutes. This comminution is more pronounced for the higher processing strains and lower temperature. In parallel, dynamic recrystallization of the magnesium matrix occurs resulting in a mixture of fine new magnesium grains and larger deformed grains. The fraction of DRX matrix is larger for the higher processing temperature and strains. The finest size of the new recrystallized grains was obtained after ECAP processing at 300 Both extrusion and ECAP processing lead to an increase of mechanical strength of the alloy, with a maximum of 418 The strengthening of the alloy has been analysed in terms of a composite consisting of a magnesium matrix and fiber-shaped LPSO phase particles. As the volume fraction of DRX magnesium increases, the new fine grains decrease in size and the remaining deformed grains become stronger, the alloy exhibits an increase in strength. It has been shown that materials processed by ECAP at 300 We conclude that to optimize the strength a larger fraction of deformed magnesium grains is required, although this induces a lower ductility. A compromise in the exposure time during ECAP at intermediate temperatures (between 300–350 We should like to acknowledge financial support of the
