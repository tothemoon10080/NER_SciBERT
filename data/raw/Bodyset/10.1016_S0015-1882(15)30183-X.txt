The outlets of coal storage and feed containers in coal preparation and power plants are prone to blockages due to cohesion of the extruded materials. Such blockages threaten the plant's normal, safe operation. To address this issue, Zheng Gangfeng and his colleagues have developed an automated multifunctional device designed to provide timely and efficient separation of outlet blockages.
