Eponyms, whereas commonly used in hand surgery, are perhaps misused as often as they are used correctly. Many commonly used eponyms, such as Colles fracture, Barton fracture, Smith fracture, and Bennett fracture, were actually described decades before the development of radiographs. The goal of this article is to revisit the original descriptions of commonly used eponymous terms for distal radius and first metacarpal base fractures to provide clarity and enhance understanding of what these eponyms actually mean.
