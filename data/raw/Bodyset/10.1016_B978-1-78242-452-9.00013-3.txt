As the main building block of natural bone is a mineralized collagen fibril, the approach of using an inorganic phase such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP) in an organic carrier intended as a graft material is currently realized in bone-tissue engineering strategies. Biomimetic nanocomposites aimed at bone reconstruction are discussed in this chapter, which focuses on a comprehensive overview of different inorganic as well as organic phases and their combination in nanostructured composite materials. As for the inorganic phases, amorphous TCP, crystalline alpha-TCP, crystalline beta-TCP, octacalcium phosphate as well as biphasic calcium phosphate consisting of beta-TCP and hydroxyapatite are discussed. These phases are combined with organic phases such as polysaccharides (cellulose, chitosan), proteins (collagen, gelatin) and synthetic polymers (polycaprolactone, polylactic acid, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyvinyl alcohol). Moreover, fabrication processes of such nanocomposites are described and evaluated with respect to their practicability.One hundred years ago, the German philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) understood mimesis as a crucial step in the development of a child; children mimic what they see and hear Many studies have been performed to analyze the material “bone” Worthwhile to stress is another inorganic component of bone: water. With its 9 Besides these basic building blocks, bone cells populated on those structures are fundamental for keeping the bone material alive—osteoblasts and the mature osteocytes producing extracellular matrix (ECM) including the mineralized collagen fibrils; and osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells With this knowledge of bone composition in background, it should theoretically be easy to engineer artificial bone. However, it is not done with providing all the aforementioned components. As the different hierarchical levels of bone lead to a very wide range of biomechanical properties, tissue engineering encounters many difficulties in terms of stability. Although the mineral components should provide toughness and rigidity to a tissue-engineered bone graft, the organic component should add tensile strength and flexibility. Moreover, the new generation of phosphate nanocomposites should synergistically combine the advantages of polymers such as biocompatibility, desired shape and resistance to corrosion with the bioactive properties of the phosphate nanoparticles. Usually when speaking of natural bone, two large subgroups are considered: cancellous bone as well as cortical bone. Their biomechanical properties are completely different and do vary in a wide range within each subgroup. For example, Young’s moduli of 0.05 to 0.5 Tricalcium phosphate (TCP, Ca The second modification, beta-TCP, is widely used in combinations with polymers to mimic the phosphate phase in bone. Regarding this combination, there have been several reports lately. Yeo et al. produced a composite scaffold material based on polycaprolactone (PCL)–beta-TCP by melt plotting and embedding in electrospun collagen I nanofibers Rakovsky et al. also chose beta-TCP as a phosphate phase for the production of a nanocomposite. They produced the 50–150-nm sized beta-TCP nanoparticles via calcination of the previously prepared HA Finally, beta-TCP nanoparticles with a size of 100 Compared to crystalline TCPs, amorphous TCP is much more reactive with respect to HA formation in contact with water Biomimetic phosphate nanocomposites do sometimes include—besides other phosphate phases—HA, as for example in the next paragraph dealing with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) nanocomposites, consisting of beta-TCP and HA ( BCPs are bioceramics consisting of two different calcium phosphate phases which are mixed. Typically, BCPs used in nanocomposites aimed at bone regeneration consist of Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) has a low Ca/P molar ratio with 1.33 and favors faster dissolution of the Ca After presenting a diverse set of inorganic phosphate phases used in nanocomposites aimed at bone regeneration, the question arises which phosphate phase is mimicking frank bone the best. This is not an easy question, and the huge amount of literature dealing with research in this field suggests that no clear answer has yet been found. In terms of biomineralization capability, the crystallinity of a phosphate compound plays a pivotal role. From this point of view, introducing amorphous rather than crystalline calcium phosphate phases into organic carriers is advantageous; amorphous TCP in contact with water is more quickly transformed into HA compared to alpha-TCP or beta-TCP. Biomineralization capacity is coupled to dissolution rates of the corresponding phosphate phase. For the presented phosphate phases, the relative dissolution rates are amorphous TCP Cellulose, a polysaccharide based on β- High and medium molecular weight chitosan was used in combination with HA nanoparticles for bone-tissue engineering Using collagen I as the organic phase in bone-biomimetic nanocomposites comes to nature the nearest. Collagen initiates and orientates HA crystal growth and is reported to be responsible for size and distribution of HA crystals in natural bone Gelatin, as a derivative of collagen, is a polymer obviously useful to biomimic the organic phase of bone. To generate an ideal HA–gelatin nanocomposite, Hwang et al. studied different ratios of HA:gelatin, and determined the impact of glutaraldehyde (GA) addition At a physiologically relevant pH of 7.4, a gelatin hydrogel was placed in the middle of two solutions, CaCl Heliobond Hydrogels consisting of oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) were either physically or chemically mixed with calcium phosphate of varying crystallinity. Although the physical mixing resulted in irreproducible dispersion of the calcium phosphate components, the chemical mixing lead to a homogeneous distribution of the calcium phosphates in the hydrogel In a study by Mavis et al., PCL was immersed in 10SBF-like solutions (10 times as concentrated as simulated body fluid) based on a variety of protocols A functionally graded PCL–beta-TCP scaffold for bone regeneration was established by varying the beta-TCP:PCL ratio in different layers of a cylindrical radially graded material Differentiation studies of ASCs toward osteoblasts were performed on PCL-coated BCP Bone-biomimetic nanocomposite materials based on peptides potentially aimed at orthopedic applications are rather seldom reported; a thermoreversibly gelling block copolymer conjugated to HA-nucleating peptides, however, has been reported similar Homogenous and dense beta-TCP–PLA nanocomposites with very high compressive strengths of up to 400 Combined with calcium phosphate compounds, biodegradable PLGA is one of the mostly used organic polymers in orthopedic applications An interesting approach with the intention to tailor the release dosage of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2) was reported by Wang et al. There has been increasing interest in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposites recently From the presented organic-carrier phases for phosphate nanocomposites, collagen type I mimicks true bone the best, because natural bone’s organic phase primarily consists of this protein. Moreover, it makes up around 20 Immersion or soaking is one of the simplest methods to incorporate calcium phosphate compounds into organic carriers ( For example, successful formation of nano-HA in cognate with native apatite on electrospun PLGA, as well as on electrospun PLGA–collagen blend, has been reported to be achieved by a three-cycle process of alternately dipping the electrospun fibers for 5 to 10 As for the organic carrier in the biomimetic nanocomposites, electrospinning is a method that is very often used to generate nanofibers of organic polymers In this technique, not only pure polymers can be electrospun, but also polymers in combination with nanoparticles, as realized for example with PLGA and HA nanoparticles The (bio)plotting technique is also often used for the fabrication of nanocomposites aimed at bone-tissue engineering ( The process of freeze-casting consists of freezing a slurry or blend, usually based on water at low temperatures, and removing the solvent by sublimation under low pressure Rapid prototyping comprises a group of techniques that can generate a physical model directly from computer-aided data ( A rather seldom chosen approach is to chemically synthesize new polymers to mimic processes occurring in nature during bone generation ( Immersion, soaking or (alternatively) dipping accompanied with subsequent precipitation is one of the simplest methods to incorporate calcium phosphate compounds into organic carriers and is therefore widely used and reported. In contrast, chemical synthesis of polymers that mimic natural processes such as HA nucleation or phosphatation are rather seldom reported because large chemical background knowledge as well as a special equipment are needed. From a cost perspective, electrospinning, plotting and rapid prototyping under the use of computer-aided data are rather expensive methods and have the prerequisite of elaborate and special machines. In the case of electrospinning, such machines may be homemade with rather low costs; however, very sophisticated and expensive apparatus are on the market for which not only all variables can be programmed as a function of time, but also humidity in the electrospinning chamber can be tuned automatically. Compared to these methods, soaking and freeze-drying are low-cost methods with nevertheless very convincing results as shown previously. From a structure and architecture point of view, discrete 3D architectures are achieved by plotting and prototyping, whereas electrospinning, freeze-casting and also chemical synthesis provide materials that have to be further processed to get the desired final architecture for the implant device.
