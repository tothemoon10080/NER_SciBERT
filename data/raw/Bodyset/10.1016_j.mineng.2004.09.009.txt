Brucite was employed as a natural adsorbent to explore its capacity of removing Cu2+ from an acidic solution. Experimental results indicate that brucite has a good neutralization capacity for acidity. The final pH of brucite suspensions rises to 3.47 and 7.91 respectively with initial pH of 1.49 and 2.09, and Cu2+ adsorption on brucite is 1.85% and 96.31% accordingly. The adsorption of Cu2+ on brucite increases sharply from 9.23% to 82.00% with increasing final pH from 5.01 to 6.75. It is concluded that the removal of Cu2+ from a brucite suspension is ascribed to the synergism of neutralization and adsorption capacities of brucite.It is well understood that the adsorption of a given metal ion onto solid surface is mainly a function of the metal ion concentration and the concentration of other ions, especially pH ( The removal of heavy metals from water by brucite was first studied by Brucite was collected from Dandong City, China with a specific gravity of 2.35 All reagents used were of analytic grade. Deionized water was used throughout this study. All glasswares and other containers were thoroughly cleaned with detergent followed by soaking in 10% HNO Experiments were performed by mixing 0.1 The suspension was then sampled by extracting and filtering a volume of â‰ˆ10 The influence of pH  This study indicates that brucite has an excellent capacity to neutralize acid, which leads to the automatic increase of pH of an acidic solution. The increase of pH is favorable for the adsorption of Cu This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 50272008).
