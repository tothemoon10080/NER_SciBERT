The effects of arsenic on the cathode polarization process in zinc electrowinning, its kinetics equation, parameters and polarization mechanism were studied by multiple electrochemistry approaches. The experimental results show that, if [As3+]â©¾3 mg/L, electrowinning first enters into stationary passivation range, and then enters into precipitation range, which indicates that the depolarization function of impurity arsenic is zinc electrowinning.
