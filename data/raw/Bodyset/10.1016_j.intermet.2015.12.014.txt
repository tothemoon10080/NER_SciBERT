Nickel (Ni) improves the room temperature ductility, hot workability and sinterability of γ-TiAl based alloys. This study investigates the microstructure of a powder metallurgy nickel-doped Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2C–0.2B–1.25Ni alloy based on detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. The alloy was sintered at 1375 °C for 120 min, followed by cooling to 900 °C for a subsequent ageing treatment of 360 min. Micrometric

                     -Al3NiTi2 particles formed as a result of the solidification of a Ni-containing sintering liquid during subsequent cooling. Ageing of the as-sintered Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2C–0.2B–1.25Ni alloy at 900 °C resulted in the precipitation of both plate-shaped and lath-shaped nanometric τ3 phase in the α2 lamellae. The constrained coincidence site lattice (CCSL) theory was used to understand the morphology and crystallography of the nanoscale τ3-Al3NiTi2 precipitates. The compression yield strength of the Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2C–0.2B–1.25Ni alloy increased from 750 ± 20 MPa to 850 ± 20 MPa after ageing.Gamma TiAl based alloys continue to attract significant attention as promising candidate materials for structural applications at high temperatures due to their low density, high specific strength and good resistance to creep and oxidation In particular, the introduction of a small amount of Ni (≤1.5 at%) can lead to near full densification of the PA γ-TiAl based alloy powder at a practical sintering temperature Ageing has long been used to improve the mechanical properties of γ-TiAl based alloys Previous studies indicated that with an addition of 1.25 at% Ni, Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2B–0.2C can be readily sintered to near-full density. This is the first step towards utilizing the conventional powder metallurgy approach to fabricating high strength Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2B–0.2C–1.25Ni alloy. In this research, the as-sintered Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2B–0.2C–1.25Ni alloy was aged to explore further strengthening of this alloy by precipitation hardening. As a result, nanoscale τ Gas-atomized PA Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2C–0.2B (at. %) powder (45–145 μm, referred to as TNB-v5 alloy powder) and elemental Ni powder (99.9% purity, < 5 μm, in irregular shapes) were used. To enable cold compaction, the PA Ti–45Al–5Nb–0.2C–0.2B powder was coated using an ethanol-1.5wt.%nylon solution Samples for metallographic examination were prepared from as-sintered and sintered-and-aged samples and finished by polishing with colloidal silica. The microstructure was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Model JEOL 7001, Japan). The phase constituents were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the characteristic wavelength of Kα line for Cu (1.5418 Å). Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterisation was then carried out. The TEM samples were prepared as follows. Small discs (ϕ3 mm × 0.5 mm) were ground to ∼80 μm thick, and then dimpled to a thickness of ∼15 μm. Final thinning was achieved through ion milling using a precision ion polishing system (PIPS) operated at 4 keV with incidence angles first set to 7° for 240 min and then to 2° for 30 min. An FEI Tecnai TF20 transmission electron microscope was used at an operating voltage of 200 kV. Cylindrical compression samples (ϕ3mm × 6 mm) were prepared from as-sintered and sintered-and-aged specimens by electrical discharge machining. The compression testing was conducted on an Instron screw machine (Model 5054, USA) with a strain rate of 0.001 mm·s  The addition of Ni resulted in the formation of a Ni-enriched ternary phase.
