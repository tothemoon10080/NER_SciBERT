The program articulated around the experimental study of the effect of several parameters on the elimination of the cations: copper, cadmium and zinc, and the organic matter present in the phosphoric acid by using the bentonite, actived carbon and carbon of olives as supports, and on the other hand to show the effect of several parameters on this keeping back such as: the effect of the time (kinetic) of contact, speed of excitement, initial concentration of the pollutant, Solid report /liquid, the isotherms. At selected best parameters for better one capacity we calculated the capacity of purification for the different supports, the sawdust and the waste of cereal. The kinetic study of the keeping back of existing pollutants in the phosphoric acid is still presented.
