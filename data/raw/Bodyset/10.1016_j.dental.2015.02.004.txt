Objectives
                  Aim of this study was to investigate whether Dental Pulp Stem Cells-DPSCs responses to pulp injury caused by resinous monomers is be mediated through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
               
                  Methods
                  DPSCs cultures were established from third molars of healthy donors and characterized for stem cell markers with flow cytometry. Cells were exposed to TEGDMA (T: 0.5–2mM) with or without presence of the Wnt-1 ligand (W:25–100ng/ml) or the GSK3β inhibitor Lithium (L:1–10mM), used both as activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay, cell cycle profiles by flow cytometry and expression of key molecules of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Real-time PCR and Western Blot.
               
                  Results
                  DPSC exposure to TEGDMA caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, accompanied by G1 arrest at lower and G2/M arrest at higher concentrations or after prolonged exposure. Lithium caused a dual effect, by stimulating/inhibiting cell proliferation at lower/higher concentrations respectively and causing a G2/M arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. Wnt signaling could be activated in DPSCs after Lithium or Wnt-1 treatment, as shown by accumulation of β-catenin, its translocation into the nucleus and enhanced expression of key pathway players, like LEF1 and Cyclin D1. Importantly, exposure to TEGDMA caused a more pronounced activation of the pathway, whereas cumulative effects were observed after T/L or T/W co-treatment, indicating a very strong activation of Wnt signaling after treatment of already “activated” (by Lithium or Wnt-1) cells with TEGDMA.
               
                  Significance
                  These findings highlight the important role of Wnt canonical signaling in pulp repair responses to common injuries.Dental pulp is subjected to many influences that may trigger repair/regenerative responses or lead to loss of vitality, depending on the extent of injury. Among these influences, dental restorative procedures promoting the release of significant amounts of xenobiotics into the pulp cavity are one of the commonest injuries stimulating pulp repair responses It has been suggested that many of the cellular and molecular processes involved in pulp healing recapitulate developmental events Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism with a critical role in developmental and post-developmental tooth physiology Dental Pulp Stem Cells-DPSCs and their microenvironment (niche) are known to be important regulators of pulp repair processes. This is mainly achieved through their migration toward the injury site and subsequent differentiation into a new generation of odontoblast-like cells producing reparative dentin Therefore, this study aimed to shed more light on pulp repair mechanisms to common injuries, such as xenobiotics released from resin-based dental restorative materials, focusing on the specific role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in regulating DPSC responses to these stimuli. This analysis will create a basis for understanding pulp tissue responses recapitulating developmental events, highlighting the important biological role of DPSCs in pulp tissue homeostasis. Our research hypothesis was that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in DPSCs by exposure to resinous monomers, directly affecting cellular responses to such noxious stimuli. DPSC cultures were established from third molars of healthy donors aged 18–24 years. The collection of the samples was performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board and all donors signed an informed consent form. The enzymatic dissociation method was used DPSC established cultures were characterized for mesenchymal (STRO-1, CD146/MUC18, CD105/endoglin, CD24, CD90/Thy-1, CD81-TAPA, CD34, CD49f/a6-integrin), neural (CD271/NGFR, nestin), hematopoietic (CD117/c-kit, CD45) and embryonic stem cell (SC) markers (Nanog, Oct3/4, SSEA-3, TRA-1-60) using flow cytometry. For surface epitope expression analysis, 10 Cell viability was determined using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, as previously described In parallel experiments, DPSCs were exposed to various concentrations (1–10 For the MTT assay, cells were seeded at 10 Cell cycle analysis was performed with flow cytometry. DPSCs were seeded in six well-plates at 2 Total mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA synthesis using 1 DPSCs were seeded in 60 At least three independent experiments, with two to six replicates, were performed. Results were analysed by one-way ANOVA Bonferroni's post-test and two-tailed DPSC cultures were strongly positive (>95% of the population) for mesenchymal and embryonic stem cell markers, including CD90, CD73, CD81, CD49f, Nestin, Nanog, whereas lower expression could be recorded for other markers, such as CD105 (73 Treatment with LiCl (L) had a dual effect on cell viability, causing a concentration-dependent increase of the succinic dehydrogenase activity (as a measure of cell viability/proliferation) of DPSCs at lower concentrations (1 and 2.5 DPSC treatment with Wnt-1 (W) caused a slight, but statistically significant, increase ( In contrast, treatment with TEGDMA (T) caused a time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in DPSCs cultures. TEGDMA at 1 Co-treatment of DPSCs with TEGDMA and LiCl (T/L) reflected the additive effects of both substances. Analytically, 1 Finally, addition of Wnt-1 in TEGDMA-treated cultures (T/W co-treatment) had overall no reducing impact on the cytotoxicity caused by this monomer ( To determine whether TEGDMA-induced inhibition, as well as lithium-induced dual effects (stimulation or inhibition depending on the concentration) of DPSC viability, could be related to altered cell cycle regulation, cell cycle profiles were monitored by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content. In cultures treated with LiCl, a time- and concentration-dependent increase of the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, accompanied by a corresponding reduction of cell numbers in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, could be observed ( Exposure of DPSCs to TEGDMA was associated with disparate cell cycle profiles. Treatment with T1 initially caused a cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint, as a 10% increase of the cell population in G1 phase compared to control could be recorded after 24 and 48 This was not the case when DPSCs were co-treated with TEGDMA (1 or 2 In order to evaluate the effects of TEGDMA (T), LiCl (L) and Wnt-1 (W) (co) treatment in activating Wnt-β/catenin canonical signaling in DPSCs, we first analyzed the expression at the mRNA level of key pathway players, including the intracellular (cytocolic) molecules GSK3β and β-catenin, the transcription factor LEF1 and one of the main downstream target genes, Cyclin D1, implicated in cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. We additionally analyzed the expression of Cyclin B1, which plays-in complex with cdc2 – a key role in cell cycle progression from G2 to M phase Real time PCR analysis showed that neither LiCl (at any concentration) nor Wnt-1 (25–100 Similarly, only minor effects could be observed overall on β-catenin (CTNB) mRNA expression levels. LiCl (2.5–10 Pronounced effects were observed on the expression of the transcription factor LEF1. LiCl alone cause a statistically significant upregulation of LEF1 expression, up to 2.2 fold for L5 and 2.8 fold for L10 after 48 Finally, noteworthy results were obtained on the patterns of Cyclin B1 expression ( Overall, concluding the results of real-time PCR analysis, it was shown that Wnt-1 is a rather weak – if any – inducer of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, mainly affecting Cyclin D1 mRNA expression, whereas Lithium could obviously activate key pathway components (LEF1, Cyclin D1) in a concentration-dependent manner. TEGDMA alone could activate mRNA expression of all pathway components (GSK3β, CTNB, LEF1 and Cyclin D1), whereas the most pronounced effects were recorded after T/L and T/W co-treatment. Finally, the expression of Cyclin B1 correlated well with the cell cycle profiles obtained after different treatments. In order to further evaluate the effects of TEGDMA (T), LiCl (L) and Wnt-1 (W) (co) treatment in activating Wnt-β/catenin canonical signaling in DPSCs, we analyzed the protein expression of β-catenin in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Western blot analysis showed that β-catenin slightly increased in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions after treatment with L10 and W (25 Taken together, the above findings demonstrate that Wnt canonical signaling can be activated in DPSCs after various treatments, as shown by stabilization of β-catenin, its translocation into the nucleus, as well as enhanced expression of several key pathway players, like GSK3β, LEF1 and the target gene Cyclin D1. Lithium – a GSK3β inhibitor – and Wnt-1 can be considered as rather weak inducers of Wnt canonical signaling in DPSCs, whereas, TEGDMA caused more pronounced activation of the pathway. Finally, cumulative effects were observed after T/L or T/W co-treatment, overall indicating a very strong activation of Wnt signaling after treatment of already “activated” (by LiCl or Wnt-1) cells with TEGDMA. Compelling evidence supports that Wnt signaling orchestrates dental tissue development and stem cell renewal Our results showed that Lithium was able to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in DPSCs, as shown by increase of β-catenin in cytosolic and nuclear fractions ( DPSCs’ treatment with Lithium caused a dual, concentration-dependent stimulatory/inhibitory effect on cell viability ( Wnt-1 proved to be a less potent inducer of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in DPSCs, as shown by an increase in cytosolic β-catenin and a minor but statistically significant upregulation of cyclin D1 mRNA (1.8 fold, TEGDMA cytotoxicity has been evidenced in several previous studies and has been mainly attributed to generation of oxidative stress, depletion of intracellular glutathione and induction of cell cycle delays or – at higher concentrations – cell death, mainly in the form of apoptosis TEGDMA-induced activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling was evidenced in this study by accumulation of β-catenin in cytosolic and nuclear fractions ( Most importantly, we have shown that T/L or T/W co-treatment caused pronounced cumulative effects in canonical Wnt activation, which indicates that TEGDMA can further induce canonical Wnt in cells that are already “activated” by various environmental factors during pulp repair. For example, previous studies have shown that TGF-β1 is a central factor released in high amounts during pulp repair, regulating migration of DPSCs toward the injured site Cumulative effects induced by T/L or T/W co-treatment in canonical Wnt activation, were evidenced by significant increase of β-catenin in cytosolic and nuclear fractions ( Regarding cell cycle profiles, we could show that DPSC treatment with TEGDMA caused an initial low but statistically significant arrest in G1 phase after T1 treatment and a preferential G2/M cell cycle arrest at the higher TEGDMA concentrations (T2), or after prolonged treatment (72 In conclusion, our findings suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is regulating DPSC responses to noxious stimuli, such as xenobiotics released by resin-based dental restorative materials, therefore confirming our research hypothesis. These data provide a novel mechanism for DPSC biological role on pulp repair, by recapitulating developmental processes through activation of canonical Wnt. In a wider perspective, these results create the basis to understand pulp wound healing responses, considering the critical role of tissue stem cells in repair/regenerative processes. Finally, the analysis of the molecular mechanisms orchestrating stem cell fate during pulp healing is of crucial importance in future planning of pulp regeneration strategies by tissue engineering, as well as in development of new bioactive restorative materials able to trigger such repair mechanisms through Wnt activation.
