Here we present the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide and silver nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide composites using aqueous extract of dry leaves of Psidium guajava by one pot reflux method. Psidium guajava extract simultaneously reduces silver nitrate and graphene oxide in the reaction mixture which is confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. Variable concentrations of silver nitrate solution are used to obtain reduced graphene oxide with different dosage of silver nanoparticles and the resultant composites are examined using surface enhanced Raman scattering measurements. Considering methylene blue as a probe molecule, it is found that the surface enhanced Raman scattering activity increases with the increase in the dose of silver nanoparticles. Our as-synthesised silver nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide composite shows remarkable performance in detecting methylene blue with concentration as low as 10−8
                     M for which the enhancement factor is 4.6×105. In addition, we report that the reduced graphene oxide quenches the photoluminescence of methylene blue more efficiently than silver nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide composite. The charge transfer states have been extracted which are mainly responsible for the quenching processes.Graphene and its composite with metal nanoparticles (MNP) have evolved as potential candidates in the field of sensors, electronics and opto-electronics due to their interesting physical, chemical and electronic properties In addition to SERS, PL quenching property of graphene is widely applied for the selective detection of biomolecules. Recent studies have shown enhanced quenching efficiency of MNP-graphene composite as compared to graphene alone when excited with the energies lying within localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) bandwidth of MNP Various chemical routes have been utilised for the synthesis of MNP-graphene composites where simultaneous reduction of metal salt and graphene oxide (GO) occurs Herein, aqueous leaf extracts of Unlike previous reports GO was synthesized using modified Hummers and Offeman method Varying concentrations of AgNO The flakes/powder of as-prepared Ag-rGO samples were obtained by centrifuging the solution and oven drying the residue at 50 The prepared samples were investigated at room temperature using PANalytical X’Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered CuK Renishaw inVia RM2000 Raman spectrometer was used to collect Raman spectra for GO, rGO and Ag1-rGO using 785  For Ag1-rGO (see FTIR spectra of GO, rGO and Ag1-rGO are shown in In order to elucidate reduction of GO and formation of Ag-NP, UV-Vis spectra were recorded for as-synthesized rGO, Ag1-rGO and Ag10-rGO as shown in In addition, Ag1-rGO shows absorption peaks at 270  In both Ag1-rGO and Ag10-rGO homogeneous distribution of Ag-NP over rGO surface is noticed from The observed nanoparticles in both Ag1-rGO and Ag10-rGO are quasi-spherical in shape with an average size of 32(2) Raman spectra of GO, rGO and Ag1-rGO are shown in In case of rGO, the G peak blueshifts with respect to GO and is attributed to the presence of defects, removal of functional groups and charge transfer between graphene and phytomolecules The intensity ratio of D and G peaks (  To elucidate the effects of Ag-NP concentration on the SERS activity of Ag-rGO substrates, Raman spectrum of 10  The enhanced Raman spectrum can be quantitatively analysed by evaluating EF In addition to quenching the Raman signal, rGO also quenches the PL of dye molecules The charge transfer (CT) bands can be extracted from the difference spectrum obtained from the optical spectra of substrate with and without quenchers Most of the CT bands in rGO are closer to singlet S A similar CT behaviour is observed in Ag1-rGO and is also illustrated in In brief, we have successfully synthesised rGO and Ag-rGO from GO while using In addition, we have demonstrated that the as-synthesised Ag10-rGO acts as an effective SERS substrate (with EF > 10 The authors would like to thank Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following are the supplementary data to this article:
