Cementum protein 1 (CEMP1) has been recently cloned, and in vitro experiments have shown functions as regulator of cementoblast behavior and inducer of differentiation of non-osteogenic cells toward a cementoblastic/osteoblastic phenotype. In this study, we have produced a full-length human recombinant CEMP1 protein in a human gingival fibroblast cell line. The purified protein (hrCEMP1) has a Mr 50,000. Characterization of hrCEMP1 indicates that its secondary structure is mainly composed of β-sheet (55%), where random coil and alpha helix conformations correspond to 35% and 10%, respectively. It was found that hrCEMP1 is N-glycosylated, phosphorylated and possesses strong affinity for hydroxyapatite. Even more important, our results show that hrCEMP1 plays a role during the biomineralization process by promoting octacalcium phosphate (OCP) crystal nucleation. These features make CEMP1 a very good candidate for biotechnological applications in order to achieve cementum and/or bone regeneration.Cementum is a unique avascular mineralized connective tissue that covers the root surface of teeth and provides the interface through which the root surface is anchored to collagen Sharpey’s fibers of the periodontal ligament. Nevertheless, the complex processes that regulate cementogenesis and normal cementum metabolism remain unclear to date. Recent evidence indicates that cementum formation is critical for appropriate maturation of the periodontium  Recombinant human CEMP1 protein collected from conditioned media of HGF expressing CEMP1 was purified by Ni            Previously, we have expressed Circular dichroism of Dynamic light scattering analysis revealed that According to By comparison with the theoretical protein molecular mass for Detection of phosphorylation was done using anti-phospho-serine and threonine antibodies. Our data indicates that both antibodies cross-reacted with the Previous results have shown that CEMP1 plays a role during the mineralization process The morphology of apatite crystals grown in absence of Taken all together, these results demonstrated that biologically active The initial basis of CEMP1’s as a possible therapeutic agent rests on evidence showing that CEMP1 has a role during the biological mineralization process of cementum-like tissue, and that induces Studies on the function and structure of CEMP1 have been hampered by the difficulties in the isolation of protein from human and/or bovine cementum, due mainly to its low metabolic turnover rate, the amount of tissue being deposited and, its entrapment in hydroxyapatite. In this study, we showed the production, purification and characterization of a full-length The authors thank Dr. Pedro Bosch and Dr. José Reyes.
