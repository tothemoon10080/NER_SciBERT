To further understand rock damage mechanisms under loading, evaluate coal burst danger and ensure stopping safety during coal mining, uniaxial compression tests of rock samples at different mining-induced loading rates were carried out. A systematical analysis has been conducted on strain rate effect on rock mechanical properties, AE parameters response and damage evolution law. The results show that along with the increase of mining-induced loading rate, an increase of peak strength and elastic modulus of rock together with a decrease of peak strain and dynamic failure duration in post-peak period are shown. Several acoustic characteristics are found decreasing in power function when loading rate increases such as AE hits, counts and events, but an obvious increase of AE energy is shown. Peak frequencies of AE events are mostly between 95 ∼ 125 kHz and 270 ∼ 310 kHz. A well-defined correspondence between AE count curve and rock stress-strain curve is presented. Rock damage variable was derived based on accumulative AE count, and three stages of rock damage evolution at different loading rates can be divided: initial damage, steady evolution, and accelerated development. A constitutive damage equation has been established on the basis of equivalent strain hypothesis and AE count. Calculated results can basically reflect the characteristics of rock stress-strain curves at different strain rates. The conclusions of this paper can provide references for the issues of coal burst control and hazard assessment.Mechanical properties of coal-rock mass are not only influenced by applied stress state, but also related to loading rate. Several key parameters of coal and rock show different changes when under loading with different loading rates such as rock peak strength, elastic modulus, strain, etc. Thus the mechanical effect of rock mass under different loading rates is a key research topic in rock engineering ( Meanwhile, coal burst has become one of the most serious mining disasters in underground coal mining, leading to damage to facilities and the surroundings and even injuries and deaths. It is believed that the occurrence of rock bursts is more or less affected by dynamic disturbance of mining-induced loadings, but the process of mining dynamic load inducing coal burst still lacks systematic research at present. The influence of different mining-induced loading rates on coal-rock mass failure can provide references for mechanism and pre-warning investigation of coal burst danger. Research on loading rates around the world originates from the rock experimental observation by using rigid test machine in the 1960s ( The aforementioned study proves the importance of loading rate in affecting the mechanical properties as well as characteristics of deformation and failure of rock mass in the fields of rock engineering, geotechnical engineering and mining engineering. Meanwhile, the analyses of rock loading rate effect were mainly focused on stress-strain relation, physical and mechanical properties, etc., and few achievements are investigated on rock damage evolution, damage monitoring, and precursor information recognition under the strain rates caused by static or dynamic loadings. In mining engineering, drilling, blasting, coal bursts, et al, are examples where loading rate influences rock mechanical properties and initiation and propagation of fractures ( Unlike the strong blasting during mining operation of metal mines or surface mines, dynamic loadings in underground coal mining are mainly caused by strata failure, coal pillar instability, fault slip, gas outburst, coal bump, etc. Maximum strain rate of mining-induced dynamic load in coal mines generally does not exceed the level of 10 Therefore, further study on mining-induced loading rate effect still need to be carried out although previous studies have played a promoting role for research on strain rate effect to rock materials. In fact, the investigation conclusions may be different due to factors such as physical and mechanical properties, mineral compositions, loading strain rate and loading mode. It is highly necessary to systematically analyze the damage evolution and parameter response of coal-rock mass under different loading rates. In this paper, fracture characteristics, damage evolution law and AE response of sandstone samples were studied, which aims to reveal the damage evolution law of sandstone with coal burst proneness under different mining-induced static and dynamic loading rates, and further provide theoretical basis for precursor information identification and risk pre-warning of coal burst in underground coal mining. The sandstone samples in these experiments were taken from the roof stratum of a coal mine in Xinjiang, China. The average density of the tested samples is about 2.6 g/cm Loading equipment: Electro-hydraulic Servo Material Test System MTS-C64.106 with automatic data recording for deformation and other related data. The system MTS-C64.106 was set in a loading mode with displacement control. The loading rates are 0.001 mm/s, 0.0025 mm/s, 0.005 mm/s, 0.01 mm/s, 0.025 mm/s, 0.0033 mm/s, 0.05 mm/s, 0.1 mm/s, 0.167 mm/s, respectively, and the strain rate is between 1 × 10 Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system: PCI-2 AE System supplied by PHYSICAL ACOUSTICS. A 18 bit analog-to-digital converter was used to digitize the analogue acoustic sensor signal. AE sensors: 8 AE sensors were located in a rock sample, and the operating frequency of AE sensors is 100 ∼ 400 kHz. Based on background noise during the experiments, the noise detection threshold was set at 35 dB. The peak definition time (PDT) was set at 50 μs, which guarantees the correct recognition of signal peak for rise time measurements. The hit definition time (HDT) was set at 200 μs, which ensures that one single signal hit is recorded as only one hit. The hit lock-out time (HLT) was set at 300 μs, which improves data acquisition speed and stores the hit waveform quantification parameters. The sampling frequency was 2 MHz, and the preamplifier amplification was set at 40 dB. Arrival time difference of sound wave was used for the location calculation of AE hit. AE sensors and samples were coupled by Vaseline. The loading process and AE monitoring were carried out simultaneously, and all the tests were conducted at room temperature. All rock samples were loaded until finally destroyed. Displayed in The uniaxial compression results of five different loading rates were selected for analysis, as shown in The stress-strain curves at different loading strain rates are basically identical, which can be divided into 4 stages: compression, elastic deformation, plastic deformation and failure. The curve slope is rising with the increase of loading rate in the elastic deformation stage, and the limit elastic strength is also increasing slightly. Since there is no sufficient time for rock samples to release accumulated energy duo to the increase of loading rate, the elastic strength increase of the samples is limited. A transition of rock sample from elastic deformation to plastic deformation are presented when enough cracks are formed to balance the releasing rate of elastic energy. During plastic deformation stage, the peak strength of rock sample rises apparently with the increase of loading rate, and the strain value associates with peak strength declines, which is shown in In post-peak failure stage, there is no obvious variation of rock strength gradient when the strain rate There is no obvious change of rock elastic modulus with the increase of loading rate, but the time needed to reach the peak value is decreasing apparently. Which has a negative power function relation with the loading strain rate, as shown in AE technique was often used to monitor and analyze damage process and degree of rock mass in rock mechanics experiments. AE characteristics and generation mechanism of coal-rock mass may be different between different loading modes and loading rates. For example, Thus, a real-time AE monitoring was carried out in this experiment to study rock failure process and characteristics, which can be better to show the influence of loading strain rate on failure mechanism of rock samples.  As shown in As shown in Stress-strain relation of rock mass and damage evolution process can be reflected by AE accumulative hits. As shown in As AE count, is the oscillation number exceeding the threshold, which can further reflect the micro-rupture information and damage process of the rock sample. As shown in Similar to AE hits, the located AE events also decrease apparently, and present negative power function with the increase of strain rate, as shown in  The above results indicate that AE signals are affected significantly by the loading strain rate. Also, the developing and expanding speed of micro-cracks as well as damage evolvement process of rock mass under different loading rates can be well described by the variation of AE characteristics. From the fracture modes of rock samples (seen from AE location result shows that events with different energies are widely distributed at lower loading rates, and are basically identical to the main rupture surface of rock sample. With the increase of loading rates, AE hits decrease obviously and the located AE events are much fewer duo to the limited loading times, and the spatial distribution of AE events are controlled obviously by the main crack. However, it is still difficult to use AE events location to show the whole spatial development process of micro-cracks at higher loading rate. Peak frequency of AE signal may also be affected by loading strain rates. Damage variable, D, is usually used to quantify the damage degree of coal-rock mass. As AE signal is caused by the evolving and developing of micro-cracks and cavities within coal-rock mass, AE parameters, especially AE count, can be used as a statistical parameter to characterize the damage evolution of rock samples during loading. Damage variable D can be defined as ( If When the damaged area reaches Thus, damage variable D can be described as: In lab experiment, the inadequate rigid of test machine or different failure conditions of coal-rock mass will cause the cease of loading process when sample has not been fully damaged. In such a condition, the damage variable D cannot reach 1. Thus  Thus, damage variable D can be re-written as:  The damage evolution plots for rock samples at different loading rates in According to the above analysis, the damage evolution law of rock samples at different loading rates can be described as:        Lemaitre’s hypothesis for equivalent strain proposes a constitutive relation based on statistical damage, which can be expressed as (  By substituting the damage variables shown in To understand the effect of uniaxial loading rate on rock failure characteristics, the damage evolution law and acoustic emission (AE) parameters of roof rock samples are studied systematically in this paper. The following conclusions are drawn: Stress-strain curves of rock samples present obvious characteristics of rate dependence and plastic enhancement. With the increase of loading rate, the peak strength of rock sample increases, and the corresponding strain value decreases slightly, and the time used to reach the peak strength decreases as a power function. AE signals are affected significantly by loading strain rate. As loading rate increases, accumulative AE hits, counts and located events all decrease significantly by the power function, but absolute energy of AE hits increases obviously. Peak frequencies of AE events are mostly located between 95 ∼ 125 kHz and 270 ∼ 310 kHz, and the proportion of peak frequencies between 95 ∼ 125 kHz is somewhat increased with the increase of loading rate. With the increase of loading rate, rock fracturing modes change from shear failure to vertical splitting failure and even burst failure. AE spatial distributions are basically identical to the main rupture surface of the rock samples. Based on the accumulative AE counts, damage variable is derived to characterize the damage evolution of rock samples during loading. Rock damage evolution at different loading rates can be divided into three stages: initial damage period, steady evolution period, and accelerated development period. The corresponding constitutive damage equation has been derived on the basis of equivalent strain hypothesis and accumulative AE count. Theoretically calculated results can basically reflect the characteristics of uniaxial stress-strain curves for rock samples loaded at different strain rates. A further modification is still needed to better describe rock damage evolution and strain rate effect. Under static loading, a better sensitivity is presented for AE events, hits and counts. As loading rate increases, anomaly information is advanced and AE energy is more sensitive. Test results can provide basis for seismic pre-warning and coal burst precursor information identification in underground coal mining. The work is supported by the
