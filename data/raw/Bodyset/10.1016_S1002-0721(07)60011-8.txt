CeO2/γ-Al2O3, La2O3/γ-Al2O3, CeO2-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 and CeO2-La2O3, which were prepared by impregnating in certain ratio, were used as the catalysts for the reduction of SO2 and NO by CO. Separate and simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO over La2O3/γ-Al2O3, CeO2/γ-Al2O3, CeO2-La2O3/γ-Al2O3 were investigated. The phase characteristics of catalysts were also analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The result shows that the conversions of SO2 and NO are above 98% over CeO2/γ-Al2O3 and CeO2-La2O3/γ-Al2O3. After SO2 is added in the NO-CO-N2 system (NO:SO2 = 1:2 ∼ 1:3), the conversions of SO2 and NO are both above 98%. Furthermore, it is found that CeO2-La2O3 with various ratios has different activity for the simultaneous reduction of SO2 and NO.
