Rujevac is a low-temperature hydrothermal polymetallic Sb(As)–Pb–Zn vein-type ore deposit, hosted in volcanogenic-sedimentary zone situated in Rujevac-Crvene Stene-Brezovica Diabase-Chert Formation (DCF) of the Podrinje Metallogenic District (PMD), Serbia. The mineralogical composition of the deposit consists of sulfides (stibnite, sphalerite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena, realgar and orpiment), sulfosalts (zinkenite, plagionite, robinsonite, twinnite and gratonite), native arsenic, Sb-oxides (valentinite, senarmontite and kermesite), and gangue minerals (quartz, calcite and dolomite). Minerals containing mercury as a major element have not been detected. According to optical features, sphalerite belongs to the cleophane, low Fe content variety (yellowish to colorless). Electron Probe Micro-Analyses (EPMA) of sphalerite revealed wide compositional variations. The Hg content in sphalerite varies between 0.30 and 6.47wt%. The range of other minor elements (Fe and Cd) is highly variable; Mn, Sn, Ge, In, Tl, and As were analyzed, but not detected. Hg-rich zones occur as narrow lamellae and are related to the crystallographic directions of sphalerite. The average values of the EPMA results gave the crystallochemical formula of this sphalerite (Zn0.981, Fe0.007, Cd0.007, Hg0.008)∑1.003S0.997. Strong negative correlations have been determined between ∑Fe+Cd+Hg vs. Zn, and Hg vs. Zn, while these are absent between all other analyzed elements.Mercurian sphalerite has been reported from a few localities. In some deposits, sphalerite may be the dominant Hg-carrier. Exceptionally high contents of 0.08–16.35 It is important to emphasize this is the first report of Hg-bearing sphalerite in the whole Serbo-Macedonian Metallogenic Province (SMMP). Moreover, Hg minerals have not been detected so far in the Rujevac deposit, which is a significant part of the Boranja orefield. Besides, there is Hg mineralization (cinnabar mineral associations) within the Boranja orefield there is Hg mineralization (cinnabar mineral associations) in the Donja Trešnjica locality, 15 This paper contributes to the understanding of the Rujevac polymetallic ore deposit and its mineral parageneses and associations. Finally, identification of elevated Hg content in sphalerite from the Rujevac deposit, and Pb–Zn deposits generally, is also important for environmental questions because this highly toxic metal can be easily released during mining and processing of a zinc concentrate. Samples were collected mainly from underground locations from the Rujevac deposit. One hundred thirty-five polished sections of polymetallic ore were prepared for reflected-light microscopy and EPMA by following standard preparation and polishing steps ( Electron Probe Micro-Analyses (EPMA) and Cathodoluminescence (CL) were carried out at the Faculty of Mining and Geology, University of Belgrade, using a JEOL JSM-6610LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) connected with an INCA energy-dispersion X-ray analysis unit (EDX). An acceleration voltage of 20 Deposition temperatures of sphalerite and galena were determined according to the ratio of cadmium and manganese contained in both minerals. Coefficients of distribution of cadmium and manganese were calculated using following equations: Content of cadmium and manganese extracted from selected sphalerite and galena was obtained by atomic absorption spectroscopy method (AAS-Perkin Elmer AA-300). The Rujevac deposit belongs to the Podrinje Metallogenic District (PMD), which is a part of the Serbo-Macedonian Metallogenic Province (SMMP). The ore deposits of this province lie in a number of geotectonic units; they embrace a part of the Vardar zone, the Serbo-Macedonian massif, and a small part of the Dinarides. This metallogenic province has been delineated mostly by reference to the Neogene metallogeny, related predominantly to the granodiorite magma ( The Boranja orefield covers area of some 200 The outermost halo hosts several Sb deposits. The most important ones are situated in the Brasina-Zajača-Stolice-Dobri Potok intrusive-volcanic zone and in the volcanogenic-sedimentary zone of Rujevac-Crvene Stene-Brezovica Diabase-Chert Formation (DCF). The ore bodies occur as irregular pipes and lenses in silicified Carboniferous limestones ( The Sb(As)–Pb–Zn Rujevac deposit is located a few kilometers from the contact halos ( Mineralogical composition of the Rujevac deposit consists of sulfides (stibnite, pyrite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite, realgar, and orpiment), sulfosalts (zinkenite, robinsonite, plagionite, twinnite, and gratonite), native arsenic, Sb-oxides (valentinite, senarmontite, kermesite), gangue minerals (quartz, calcite, dolomite) and organic material (         EPMA of sphalerite revealed relatively high concentrations of Hg. The sphalerite with minimum–maximum and average values yielded the following crystallochemical formula: (Zn The amounts of minor elements (Fe, Cd, and Hg) are highly variable, while Mn, In, Sn, Ge, and As were analyzed, but not detected. According to the average content, quantitative amounts of minor elements are as follows: Hg Correlation analyses were carried out to determine and evaluate major and minor elements and the relationship between them. Based on the Pearson correlation coefficients, positive correlations were not found for any of these elements ( Hg-bearing sphalerites from the Rujevac deposit do not display effects of cathodoluminescence. Still, it is interesting to point out that quartz matrix, in which sphalerites are embedded, show distinct light effects (  The deposition temperature study of Pb–Zn mineral associations is based on determination of cadmium and manganese distribution in sphalerite and galena in temperature range from 200 to 850 Content of cadmium and manganese is determined from carefully chosen sphalerite and galena grains from the following locations: Veliki Cip Pb–Zn polymetallic deposit (I belt), Veliki Majdan (Kojići, Centralni revir, and Kolarica deposits) Pb(Ag)–Zn ore zone (II belt), Ravnaja CaF Based on previous results, it can be concluded that temperature interval of formation of minerals ranges from 500 The mineral chemistry of sphalerite has commonly been used to decipher principal conditions governing the ore deposition since its composition is a complex function of pressure, temperature and sulfur activity (e.g. After Mercurian sphalerite from the Rujevac deposit belongs to Fe-poor and Cd-enriched variety. The hypothesis is that Hg, occurring in a form of thin lamellae, most probably entered the crystal structure. The lamellae are noticeable only by SEM ( Besides Cd, Fe and Hg, it is interesting to point out the occurrence of quartz inclusions in sphalerite aggregates (black zones in According to the paragenetic and chemical features sphalerite from the Rujevac deposit is very similar to that from the Akoluk deposit ( This paper gives information of mineralogical, chemical, and crystallochemical characteristics of the Rujevac polymetallic deposit. Special emphasis is on results of sphalerite that is extraordinary for its chemical composition due to relatively large incorporation of mercury. Key fact is that mercurian minerals, as well as other Hg-bearing minerals, besides sphalerite, have not been detected in the deposit. Overall, the Hg content in sphalerite varies between ca. 0.30 and 6.47 Knowing compositional variations of sphalerite is of great importance since this mineral is the main zinc source. In the view of the fact that mercury is most likely incorporated in the crystal structure of sphalerite, any separation process (flotation, gravity) and removal of this metal will not give satisfactory results. From the aspects of environmental protection, pyrometallurgy is probably the most suitable process for mercury separation from zinc concentrates, having in mind how toxic mercury pollution is when released into atmosphere.
