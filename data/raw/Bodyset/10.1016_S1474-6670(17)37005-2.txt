It is a widespread assumed and accepted concept that Semiautogenous Grinding mills (SAG mills) operate mainly by applying impacts to the load components by the tumbling action of the load itself. However, not all the impacts are useful. If the load movement is not appropriately controlled, such that balls impact directly on the shell liners, a significant fraction of the mill energy can be wasted breaking balls and causing liner damage with a harmful effect on the process. The impacts can be measured by the sound of the mill. A new system based on this premise is developed to obtain a new SAG mill operation signal. This system is described in this paper. Results in plant are also given to illustrate the effects of SAG operation.
