For thermoelectric materials, the synthesis route is—besides composition—the crucial factor governing the thermoelectric transport properties and hence the performance of the material. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the influence of the synthesis technique on microstructure and thermoelectric transport properties in Li-doped Mg2Si0.2Sn0.8. The samples were prepared using two wide-spread, but quite different synthesis methods: high energy ball milling and induction melting. Microstructural analysis (scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction) reveals that ball milled samples are more homogenous than induction melted ones, which exhibit some Si-rich Mg2(Si,Sn) and MgO as secondary phases. On a first glance, the thermoelectric properties are qualitatively similar with

                      for both routes. However, a systematic analysis of the high temperature transport data in the framework of a single parabolic band model points out that the induction melted samples have a systematically reduced mobility and increased lattice thermal conductivity which can be tied to the differences in the microstructure. The reduced mobility can be attributed to a further carrier scattering mechanism for the induction melted samples in addition to the acoustic phonon and alloy scattering that are observed for both synthesis routes, while the increased lattice thermal conductivity is because of the larger grain size and presence of secondary phases. In consequence, this leads to significantly enhanced thermoelectric transport properties for ball milled samples (effective material parameter

Thermoelectric generators have numerous advantages such as no moving parts, a long lifespan, and scalability without efficiency losses compared with other energy conversion techniques Thermoelectric materials with high Among several thermoelectric materials, magnesium silicide–based solid solutions are highly promising for thermoelectric applications in the intermediate temperature range (300–800 K) because of material abundance, non-toxicity, low density and cost, good environmental compatibility, and high thermoelectric performance for n-type ( As for basically all material systems, an influence of synthesis technique on mobility The synthesis that yields the best thermoelectric properties cannot be identified from the comparison of experimental data only, in particular not from different publications: first, the sensitivity of Using the well-established single parabolic band (SPB) model, we have systematically investigated the differences of Li-doped Mg In this study, we show that both IM and BM can be used to obtain p-type Mg P-type Mg For induction melted samples, magnesium granules 99.8% (SRL), silicon pieces 6 N (Alfa Aesar), tin ingots 99.5% (Merck), and lithium carbonate powder 99% (Lobachemie) were used as precursors. The Li The temperature dependent measurements of Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity were performed using an in-house developed facility with a four-probe technique  Microstructure and phase purity of the obtained pellets were characterized utilizing SEM in back scatter electron mode. Differences in average grain size and phase homogeneity of the samples are observed. The grain size is estimated using ImageJ software after measuring over 100 grains in an image for averaging; for the BM sample, it is estimated to be The functional homogeneity and dominant carrier type of BM and IM samples are studied by spatial mapping of the Seebeck coefficient. The nominal composition of BM and IM samples together with their corresponding room temperature Hall carrier concentration The temperature-dependent TE properties of the BM and IM samples are plotted in The carrier concentration ( From the results of XRD and SEM, it is clear that the synthesis method (BM vs. IM) affects the microstructure ( The differences in microstructure and secondary phases give some indications for the origin of different TE properties of BM and IM samples. In particular, the presence of MgO can degrade the electrical properties of Mg For a deeper analysis, a SPB model is utilized to understand the influence of synthesis techniques (BM and IM) on the TE properties and to identify a superior synthesis technique. The relevant equations are: Here The density of states effective masses of both BM and IM samples are calculated using Eq. We have shown that the whole solid solution range of p-Mg AP scattering mobility ( As MgO has been reported to reduce the mobility in Mg The lattice thermal conductivity in The figure of merit The Independent of that the analysis clearly shows that samples synthesized by BM have a superior thermoelectric performance.
