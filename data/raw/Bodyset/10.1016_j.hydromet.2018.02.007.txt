Manganese oxides are essential in the production of electronic components and batteries. A promising alternative for their production from secondary sources is the leaching of the Mn and later oxidative precipitation of Mn2+ by an SO2/O2 mixture. The steps involved in this last reaction have not been fully understood. This work presents the reaction mechanism describing the oxidative precipitation of Mn2+ by an SO2/O2 mixture with MnO2 and SO4

The proposed reaction mechanism was validated with experimental batch tests and it was found that it describes satisfactorily the oxidation reaction. Experimental evidence revealed that this system is efficient at low concentrations of SO2 in the gas mixture composition; an optimal composition of 7.3% SO2 of the gas mixture was found.The transition metal-catalysed oxidation of sulfur (IV) oxides plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry (e.g. acid rain formation) ( In the literature, two types of reaction mechanisms have been proposed for the metal-S(IV)-O There is a lack of information about the reaction mechanism that operates in the latter system described, because the stage where the solid is formed is not fully understood; one original contribution of this research work is the proposal of the complete reaction path that shows the interaction between the different species in the system and explains how a mixture containing a strong reductant (SO According to   The authors mentioned that if the concentration ratio of gas mixture is not controlled, reducing conditions could be created (at least locally) and the generation of additional acid, as shown in Eqs. It has been found that the metal oxidation reaction is efficient only at low concentrations of SO In a previous work ( The pH has a strong effect in the Mn The reaction mechanism proposed in this investigation is based in the information reported in the literature. It presents the reaction path in which the Mn In A detailed description of the Mn In the first stage of the reaction chain, sulfur dioxide is dissolved into the solution, without chemical reaction, promoting the formation of hydrates of the type H Some authors have suggested that HSO It is worth mentioning that theoretically a small amount of Mn According to After the radical SO  One important fact to emphasise is that  In the tests performed in this investigation the oxygen supply was constant and in excess regarding SO It is proposed that SO In this stage, the Mn  As the last stage of the reaction mechanism, it is proposed that it the oxidation of the Mn In The redox cycle initially requires the existence of Me It is important to remark the similarity between the system describing the S(IV) auto-oxidation catalysed by transition metals and the system describing the oxidative precipitation of Mn If the Mn In The Mn In order to obtain information for the reaction mechanism validation, a careful quantification of reagents and products of the Mn Initial concentrations of the reactants were fixed in a stoichiometric ratio to obtain the values of the reagent consumption and product generation. At the beginning of each test, the reactor was filled with MnSO All reagents used were of analytical grade (JT Baker). The manganese content in solution was determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) using a Varian SpectrAA FS 220 spectrometer. The measurement of S(IV) species was made by iodimetry according to the method described by XRD analysis revealed that only MnO  The values of the unknown equilibrium constants were calculated by solving the equation system with the software Polymath 6.1. The values of the unknown equilibrium constants are: The magnitude of this values is coherent with the value of the global reaction equilibrium constant: The calculated values of the equilibrium constants describe satisfactorily the experimental observations presented by On the other hand, when just SO The complete reaction sequence of the reaction mechanism is presented in In order to make a careful quantitative analysis of the reagents and products involved in the Mn As shown in It was found that all the SO Results presented in The proposed reaction mechanism for the oxidation of Mn The authors are grateful to CONACYT (Mexico) for the financial support received.
