The annealing behaviour of Ti(C0.5N0.05)–40wt.% W and Ti(C0.5N0.5)0.6–40wt.% W mechanically alloyed powders was investigated using XRD, TEM, SEM and DTA techniques. It was observed that the reaction start and finish temperatures between constituents were lower in the system that had higher residual lattice strains after milling. The compositions of the intermetallic compounds and solution phases formed were dependent of the milling conditions and the annealing temperature. Thermal alloying was observed during annealing of Ti(C0.5N0.05)–40wt.% W mechanically alloyed products, whereas de-mixing of W-rich phases from the metastable solid solution occurred during annealing of the Ti(C0.5N0.5)0.6–40wt.% W milled powders.Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PcBN) is commonly sintered in high temperature high pressure systems (HTHP) that generate pressure higher than 5 Therefore, alloying of titanium carbonitride with a refractory metal such as W was investigated as alternative binder for PcBN. However, the high melting temperature of W (~ The characterization of transformations taking place during the heating of mechanically alloyed powders is of interest both theoretically and practically when these powders are intended to be used as cermets or binders in hard materials Some studies established that the solubility limits and thermal stability of the supersaturated solid solutions prepared by mechanical alloying determine the properties of the annealed materials Thermal decomposition with fine precipitation of secondary phases was observed when annealing some metastable solutions The effects of the composition of the Ti(C,N) and milling time on the stability and annealing behaviour of the solid solutions formed by ball milling of sub-stoichiometric Ti(C,N)–W powders were analysed in the present work using XRD, TEM, SEM and DTA techniques. Powder mixtures of Ti(C The milled powders were subsequently annealed in an argon atmosphere for 2 The DTA heating curves of Ti(C The two local maxima on the heating curve of the powders milled for 12 The large portion of the heating curve of the non milled mixture was characterized by a negative temperature change which indicates that the heat input was consumed to compensate for the latent heat. Positive temperature changes were observed between 1050 and 1220 The small temperature change observed in heating of the non milled powders indicates that the amount of heat of reaction released was smaller. Hence, the thermal induced chemical reaction between Ti(C,N) and W pure particles was not complete. Milling improved the kinetics of reaction, hence the degree of completion of the alloying process due to the large contact surface between the fine grains and the dispersion of W atoms in the Ti(C,N) particles. The amount total of heat released and the temperature change subsequently increased with the milling time. The low reaction start temperatures compared to the melting temperatures of the powder constituents were attributed to the lower activation energies to thermally induce alloying or chemical reactions between the species. The lattice strain energy stored in the milled particles, and the defects introduced in the crystals contributed to the fast kinetics of reactions in the mixtures milled for longer times. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the mixtures milled for 48 The peaks of the FCC phase (2ʹ) shifted to the lower 2θ angles as the annealing temperature increased, indicating an increase in d-spacing that was attributed to thermal alloying of W atoms in titanium carbonitride. Amounts of the γ-Fe–Ni (7) and α-Fe–W–Cr phases (8) were formed in materials annealed at 1085 A rhombohedral phase (10) was formed during annealing at 1285 The XRD patterns of the mixtures milled for 12 The thermal induced dissolution and the formation of intermetallics during annealing of milled powders led to the decrease in lattice strains of the Ti-rich matrices as shown in Selected area electron diffraction patterns (SADP) of the products milled for 48 The SADP of the powder milled for 48 The cross sections of the powder particles annealed at 1480 The Ti-rich phase only contained 2% Fe with no Cr, whereas the W-rich phase contained 13% Fe and 4% Cr. Hence, agreeing with the XRD analysis, EDS confirmed that the contaminants from the stainless steel milling balls mainly alloyed with W. The decrease of Ti:W ratio of the major phase formed at the higher temperatures was attributed to the dissolution of the Fe–Cr–W phase constituents into the Ti-rich particles. Part of the W-rich phase (1 Ti:6 W) formed at 1285 The selective partition of the contaminating elements suggests that W, Fe and Cr powders would readily form ternary alloys when processed by high energy ball milling and subsequently annealed at about 1285 The Ti–W equilibrium phase diagram The heating curves ( The lower reaction start and finish temperatures observed upon heating of milled Ti(C The maximum temperature change during the heating up of Ti(C The differences between the trends of the heating curves were therefore attributed to the thermal alloying of constituents of Ti(C The SEM microstructures (  The investigation on the effect of the milling on the annealing behaviour of milled Ti(C,N)–W powders showed that the reaction start and finish temperatures between constituents were lower in the system that had high residual lattice strains after milling. The milling time and annealing temperature determined the compositions of the product phases and contaminating intermetallic particles formed. De-mixing of W-rich phases from the metastable solid solution occurred during annealing of the Ti(C The heat required for decomposition of the Ti(C The contaminating Fe and Cr introduced by the stainless steel milling balls preferably reacted with W rather than Ti during annealing. Crystal lattice strains were thermally released and strain free crystals were formed in milled powders annealed at about 1450 The authors are grateful for the financial support of the
