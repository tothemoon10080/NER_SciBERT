The Observation and prediction of crack propagation are important in understanding rock behavior in engineering practice. Previous studies have focused on homogeneous and isotropic rocks, but the influence of bedding planes on rock fracture is sparingly documented. In this study, we investigate the fracturing response in uniaxial compression of artificial bedded rocks containing variable-inclination bedding planes and single structural flaws. The recorded stress-strain data and captured cracking patterns are examined together. Nine separate crack types are identified in which bedding-plane sliding and splitting are potentially new. The presence of bedding planes plays a decisive role in crack propagation. With a steepening of the bedding plane, tensile cracks initiating from the structural flaw are better able to propagate along bedding planes, and the accumulative length of bedding fractures accordingly increases. Failure transforms from a purely tensile mode to a bedding sliding mode and subsequently to a bedding splitting mode as the bedding inclination increases. Compared to pro-dip flaw tests, the fracturing of bedding planes is triggered by both the tensile and shear stress with more far-field tensile cracks initiating from bedding planes in the specimens containing anti-dip flaws. Finally, the results are applied to predict the failure mode and fracture evolution in bedded rock slopes.Bedded rocks such as stratified sedimentary rocks and foliated metamorphic rocks are common in nature ( Crack propagation leading to rock failure is of great significance for understanding the mechanical response of rock to external loads. Numerous studies of crack propagation have been conducted on prismatic specimens containing single/several flaws. In accordance with the testing materials, flaw arrays and loading conditions, these studies can be summarized as: (1) Testing of various materials, including limestone ( A recent study of fracture evolution in Opalinus shale ( We present the observations of fracture evolution in artificial bedded rocks containing single structural flaws under uniaxial compression. We analyze the stress-strain response to define how the effective mechanical parameters vary with specimen and flaw geometries. Through the cracking patterns captured by the vedio camera, we identify the crack types initiating in each specimen and investigate the effects of the bedding plane and structural flaw on crack propagation. Experiments are conducted on anisotropic prismatic specimens containing a structural flaw. To maintain consistency in the results, the specimens are rigorously prepared according to a uniform protocol. Artificial rocks are widely used to study the evolution of fracture and other aspects of the mechanical response as analogs to real rocks (     The machines/tools used for making specimens have a high degree of accuracy. All the specimens are manufactured under the uniform standard and cured under the same condition; hence, the properties of bedding planes in the same specimens and among different specimens are similar. The prismatic specimen measures 142(height) × 72(width) × 40(thickness) mm ( The testing system comprises two parts - uniaxial compression testing apparatus and data acquisition, as shown in The Recorded stress - strain data are described in detail and further analyzed to define the evolution of mechanical response of the specimens. Axial stress–strain curves of all 34 specimens are plotted in groups with respect to the bedding inclination, as shown in From these four phases of the stress-strain curves identified above, four types of stress-strain relationships are generalized - ductile with fluctuation (type A), ductile without post-peak fluctuation (type B), brittle failure with fluctuation (type C) and brittle failure without post-peak fluctuation (type D), as illustrated in In the present study, three key parameters are defined in evaluating the mechanical behavior of rock - the uniaxial compressive strength ( The uniaxial compressive strength varies with the bedding and flaw inclination, as illustrated in the polar plots of The uniaxial strain at the peak stress denotes where the peak stress is attained. The elastic modulus is a critical parameter in evaluating mechanical properties in the early stages of deformation and can be measured from the slope of the linear elastic phase of the stress-strain curve. The modulus of the specimens with different geometries is shown in The entire cracking process of the artificial bedded rocks under uniaxial compression are recorded and visualized by the video camera. The crack types and failure modes can be further identified from the observed evolving crack patterns. In light of internal mechanism and geometries of the observed cracks, nine different crack types are identified as shown in          The use of the above classification of crack types lies in describing processes that dominate under different conditions of the bedding and flaw orientations relative to the loading. The experimental results show that the fracturing processes in bedded rock are controlled by the presence of bedding planes and structural flaws and involve various crack types which combine in different sequential and spatial forms. Investigating failure modes in rock is largely driven by the motivation of engineering characterization of the performance of structures on and in rock. The failure mechanisms of artificial bedded rocks containing single structural flaws can be classified into five modes, namely, tensile failure, combined tensile-shear failure, combined tensile-bedding sliding failure, bedding sliding failure and splitting failure.      The failure modes dominated by bedding and flaw inclinations are plotted in The relation of the failure mode to uniaxial compressive strength is illustrated in Previous studies involving crack propagation have been conducted on several types of rocks (e.g. marble, sandstone, granite, gypsum, etc.) which were mostly homogeneous. This study explores artificial bedded rocks containing single structural flaws and the results are compared to previous research on homogeneous rocks as follows. Seven crack types including three tensile cracks, three shear cracks and one mixed tensile-shear crack were observed in marble and gypsum ( A comparison of the cracking paths between the current and previous studies is illustrated in Tensile cracks are the predominant crack types to primarily initiate under uniaxial compression. The tensile wing cracks are frequently observed as the primary crack in approximately 80% of all specimens. It is worth noting that the bedded specimens those do not primarily feature tensile wing cracks all possesses a bedding or flaw inclination of The threshold stress for crack initiation is a key parameter with respect to engineering applications. The normalized initiation stress In bedded rocks, tensile cracks initiating from structural flaws gradually tend to propagate along bedding planes under continuous loading (as shown in To reveal the influences of the bedding inclination on crack propagation, the accumulative lengths of bedding fractures ( Pro-dip and anti-dip flaws are two common forms of defects in bedded rocks. It can be concluded from the experimental results that these two flaw forms exert distinct and definable influences on the sequence of crack formation and failure mode of artificial bedded rocks. For specimens containing pro-dip flaws, bedding-plane sliding fractures coalesce with the tensile cracks that initiate from the structural flaw, ultimately leading to the failure of rock. This result is possibly due to the fact that the pro-dip flaw appears to be conducive to bedding plane failure with respective to the stress distribution, thus enhancing the connection of cracks from the flaw and bedding planes. For specimens containing anti-dip flaws, the bedding planes penetrating the flaw are fractured by a combination of the shear and tensile stresses. Bedding-plane sliding fractures propagate with multiple vertical tensile cracks initiating from bedding planes. It can be concluded from the experimental observations that these tensile cracks have a weakening effect on the rock properties. Compared to pro-dip flaws, the anti-dip flaws have a greater impact on the distribution of stress within bedded rocks. The flaw provides a free boundary for penetrating bedding planes; hence, compression-induced tensile cracks are able to propagate along the bedding planes. Controlled laboratory studies of fracture evolution in bedded rock allow the impact of individual influences of bedding and flaw orientations relative to the stress field to be deconvolved from other obscuring factors such as heterogeneities, scale influences and the presence of non-uniform stress fields. Such studies are of significance to engineering practice in defining the failure modes in slopes and underground excavations where failure typically occurs both on fractures and through intact rock ( The bedding orientation dominates the failure mode of bedded rock specimens as well as rock slopes. The behavior of a specimen containing horizontal bedding planes predicts the deformation of a slope containing gently inclined strata ( The rock specimen with Buckling failure occurs in the bedded rock slopes where the maximum principal stress is sub-parallel to the bedding plane, as shown in For rock slopes containing anti-dip bedding planes as shown in The failure of rock slopes containing rock bridges typically originates from the extension of pre-existing structural flaws to disrupt these bridges. Fracture evolution processes are diverse and are influenced by the orientation, scale and distribution of structural flaws. We can predict the fracture evolution in bedded rock slope according to our experimental results. The structural flaw in This paper presents an experimental study of fracture evolution in artificial bedded rocks containing single structural flaws. The specimens are fabricated to include various bedding and flaw inclinations and are then tested under uniaxial compression. Cracking patterns and stress-strain data are recoded during the entire loading process. The testing results are summarized as follows. All stress-strain curves show four phases representing the entire deformation process. These can be characterized as four deformation types, namely, ductile with fluctuation, ductile without post-peak fluctuation, brittle failure with fluctuation and brittle failure without post-peak fluctuation. These curve types transform in the above order as bedding planes become steeper. Mechanical parameters (i.e. Nine crack types are identified from the recorded images of the fractured specimens, in which bedding sliding and splitting are potentially newfound failure modes in such models, compared to previous homogeneous rock tests. These cracks have non-planar paths with a few transitions when they approach bedding planes. The inclination of the bedding plane exerts a significant effect on crack initiation and propagation in artificial bedded rocks. The tensile wing crack propagates as the primary crack in most low-inclined bedded specimens, but initiates along with other crack types in steeply-bedded specimens. With an increase of the bedding inclination, the tensile crack initiating from the flaw more likely propagates along bedding planes and may result in the failure along the entire bedding plane. However, as the bedding inclination approaches 90°, the failure transforms from sliding to splitting. The accumulative length of the bedding fractures has a positive relation to bedding inclination regardless of the variation in the flaw inclination. In the pro-dip flaw tests, tensile cracks mostly initiate from the structural flaw and bedding fractures are triggered by shear stress. But in the anti-dip flaw tests, many tensile cracks initiate from bedding planes in addition to structural flaw and the resulting crack density is much higher. Bedding fractures typically develop under the combined action of the shear and tensile stress. The failure mode in the bedded specimens transforms from the pure tensile mode to the combined tensile-bedding sliding mode and subsequently to the bedding splitting mode as the bedding planes steepen. The experimental results are significant for the analysis of bedded rock slopes. The failure modes and fracture evolution processes of rock slopes containing different bedding planes and structural flaws can be predicted on the basis the observed fracture patterns in specimens.
