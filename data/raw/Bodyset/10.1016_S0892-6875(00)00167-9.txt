Morphology, mineralogy and physico-chemical parameters of fly ash from Talcher area were studied. Morphologically it consists of spherical particles of varying size. Major minerals are quartz, mullite, hematite and magnetite. Elemental analysis and fusion characteristics of the material indicate the presence of class C type pozzolan with excellent pozzolonic properties and low slagging with medium fouling nature. In an attempt to remove iron from fly ash by selective magnetic coating followed by magnetic separation, the effects of pH, magnetic intensity, colloidal magnetite concentration and addition of sodium oleate have been studied. It is possible to remove around 92% iron at an optimum pH of ∼ 7.1 and magnetic intensity of ∼11.8 K gauss.
