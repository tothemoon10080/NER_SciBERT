Oxygen is usually the limiting reagent in bio-leaching processes. For this reason, aeration is a key point to take into account when designing such processes, and the oxygen saturation concentration is an important variable to know. Currently, there is a lack of data or models to accurately predict the concentration at which oxygen saturates under the operational conditions during copper bio-leaching.
                  For this paper, oxygen solubility was measured in solutions containing the main electrolytes present in bio-leaching solutions: sulphuric acid, ferrous sulphate, ferric sulphate, and copper sulphate; measurements were performed throughout the range of concentration that is characteristic to each electrolyte. These solutions were obtained by microbiological oxidation of ferrous sulphate, and were exposed to air, at atmospheric pressure, until oxygen saturation occurred. Measurements were taken using a dissolved-oxygen electrode. From the results, the equation is obtained:

                  that predicts oxygen solubility in copper bio-leaching liquors from the simple measurement of pH and Fe2+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ concentrations.Technical viability of hydro-metallurgical processes that are based on indirect bio-leaching is greatly dependant on the efficiency of the process that regenerates ferric iron, the leaching agent. Ferric iron is regenerated by microbiological catalysis in aerobic conditions, a process known as bio-oxidation ( Efficient operation of aerobic biological reactors requires maximisation of oxygen transfer rate from the gas phase that initially contains it toward the cells ( Solubility of a gas in a liquid medium is dependent on the gas' partial pressure, temperature, and composition of the liquid medium. It decreases in the presence of ionic solutes, an effect known as salting-out. Sechenov's equation is considered to be pioneering in modelling the salting-out effect on gas solubility in solutions with only one electrolyte ( In this equation, After Sechenov's equation, modelling evolved in order to achieve equations that would allow for the estimation of gas solubility in liquids with multiple components ( Empirical nature. Mathematical formulations contain adjustment parameters with values that are specific to each solute and independent from solute concentration, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure. The magnitudes of each individual salting-out effect for all electrolytes are taken into account as a function of their concentration, considering that they are not affected by the presence and concentration of other solutes. The overall decrease in solubility of a gas in a liquid with multiple components is calculated by arithmetic combination of the salting-out effects of each component of the mixture. Shumpe's model (  Development of general solubility models for solutions with multiple components is a very complicated task ( The need for precise estimations in certain engineering contexts has led to the development of models that are only valid under typical operational conditions. The models developed by Shumpe's model was initially developed to be used in the field of microbial fermentation. Narita's and Tromans' models were developed for quantification of oxygen solubility in hydro-metallurgical leaching processes involving oxygen. Narita's model is represented mathematically by an equation identical to that of Shumpe's model (Eq. (  This model, when extended for solutions with multiple components, is expressed by Subindex 1 refers to the main electrolyte, subindex Copper bio-leaching liquors are acid solutions in sulphate medium that contain Fe and Cu amongst their main components, at concentrations below 20 There is a wealth of literature showing oxygen solubility data in ionic media. The most recent and extensive of these publications is the data compilation by The lack of information regarding oxygen solubility in bio-leaching processes has led the authors of this paper to define the following goals: Obtain experimental data regarding oxygen solubility in conditions that are representative of bio-leaching processes; this means liquors that contain sulphuric acid, copper sulphate, ferrous and ferric sulphate resulting from microbiological oxidation of ferrous ions, and are saturated with oxygen due to contact with air at atmospheric pressure. Build an empirical correlation for estimating oxygen solubility in bio-leaching liquors using variables that can be measured quickly and easily. Oxygen concentration was measured with an Orion oximeter (3 Star model) equipped with an internal barometer for pressure compensation, and with a 081010MD Termo Scientific dissolved-oxygen electrode. This device allows for continuous measuring of the dissolved oxygen concentration with a resolution of 0.01 Assays were performed using the oximeter described above in order to determine oxygen solubility. Experiments were conducted under the following conditions: Oxygen saturation. To saturate the liquid with oxygen, air was pumped through it until the oxygen concentration remained constant (approximate transition time was 25 Minimal evaporation. Injection of air into the liquid favours solvent evaporation. In order to minimise its effect on solvent composition, fumes from the saturation beaker were cooled and returned. Humidity saturation. Because the air that is introduced must be compressed, it is partially desiccated. Air was humidified in a gas-washing bottle before coming into contact with the liquid, which also helps avoid losses due to evaporation. Sterility. Working materials were sterilised in autoclave and solutions were sterilised by filtration with Millipore equipment using 0.45 Temperature: 30 In order to satisfy these premises, the experimental setup shown in the diagram in The whole setup was placed inside a thermostatic chamber at 30 The presence of bubbles and boundary layers in the vicinity of the membrane interfere with dissolved oxygen concentration measuring with a gas-semipermeable membrane electrode. In order to avoid these interferences, oxygen saturated liquid was sent, via a peristaltic pump (1 Copper sulphate and ferrous sulphate solutions were prepared by dissolving ferrous sulphate heptahydrate and copper sulphate pentahydrate in water, previously acidified to a pH value slightly above the target pH by adding sulphuric acid, until the desired concentration was reached. Finally, solutions were filtered through a 0.45 All pH measures were taken with a WTW-3310 pH-meter equipped with software for multi-buffer calibration. A Sentix 41 electrode by the same brand was used, which allows for measurement within a temperature range of 0 to 80 Fe (II) concentration was measured by redox titration with potassium dichromate. To this end, an automatic burette with potentiometric end-point control manufactured by Radiometer Copenhagen was used. Total Cu and Fe concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer, model 2380). One thing bio-leaching liquors have in common is their acidic nature. Usual pH values are below 2, to avoid massive ferric precipitation, and above 1, to avoid deactivating the microbial population ( All values for oxygen saturation concentration shown in Oxygen solubility decreases linearly as proton concentration in the medium rises, and it is possible to calculate oxygen solubility in mg/L in an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid that is exposed to air at 30 in which The measured oxygen solubility values are shown in comparison to those obtained using Setchenov, Shumpe, Narita and Tromans' models in The oxygen solubility measurements obtained in these experiments were close only to the predicted values obtained using the model developed by Shumpe et al. 1978; this model was conceived for application in fermentation, which is characterised by low concentrations of acid. The other models predict much lower values for log( Oxygen solubility was examined in CuSO The results from experiments with CuSO For every pH value that was studied, oxygen solubility decreases as CuSO [Cu Following the same blueprint as with H As with the H  In Both graphic representations ( For every pH value studied, oxygen solubility decreased linearly as concentrations of ferrous or ferric sulphate rose. For both Fe salts, the obtained curves for the different pH values were almost parallel. For a given Fe That is to say, the results obtained with FeSO Both Oxygen solubility was studied in liquid media that are representative of Cu bio-leaching, that is in CuSO The link between bio-leaching and ferrous ion bio-oxidation restricts Fe Taking this into account, oxygen solubility was measured in CuSO Based on the previously formulated hypothesis, which considers the salting-out effects from different electrolytes to be additive, one can reach  In this work, all experiments were conducted at 30  A method for precisely measuring oxygen solubility in Cu bio-leaching liquors using dissolved-oxygen electrode has been put into practice in this work.
