Incoloy 825 is nickel-iron-chromium superalloy which selected as the materials using for petrochemical reactors. Because coke formation and carburizing cause a high temperature degradation of the alloy, the protective layers, i.e. Al2O3 and Cr2O3, are suggested to overcome such issues and prolong lifetime of the reactor. For a pack cementation, the heating rate is a process parameter in which influences on microstructure and performance of the aluminium-diffused layer. In this study, the heating rates are 5°C·min-1 and 30°C·min-1 in the high activity pack-aluminizing process at 700 to 900°C. Microstructure of the aluminized alloy consists of thin porous oxide film and homogeneous nickel-aluminide intermetallic layer. As the heating rate increases, the packing aluminium powder was found to be consumed with a shorter period of aluminizing time. This may result in the formation of porous oxide on the outermost layer which is consistent to the x-ray diffractions.
