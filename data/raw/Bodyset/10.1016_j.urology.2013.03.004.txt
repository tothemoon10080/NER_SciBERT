Studies that concluded that homogeneous calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stones required more shockwaves for comminution than did heterogeneous stones For the measurement of stone density in our study, We agree that Hounsfield units is affected by stone size and slice width of the computed tomography scan. In our study, the use of the bone window avoids artificially low attenuation values for small stones. At the time being, we believe that a high stone computed tomography attenuation value is the most important radiologic predictor of failure to fragment renal stones by shockwave lithotripsy. In the future, further studies are required to further define stone composition by computed tomography.
