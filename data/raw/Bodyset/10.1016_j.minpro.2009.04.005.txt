The particle size, morphology, crystallization, and growth of calcium carbonate have been widely studied in the presence of organics, biomacromolecules, and biopolymers. Calcium carbonate with regular surface-relief structures has been synthesized by templating methods in the absence of dual negatively charged organic additives. Although a number of attempts have been made, the large-scale synthesis of 90 wt.% aragonite microrods by a facile route has hitherto remained difficult to achieve at temperatures below 60 °C.
                  By using iminodiacetic acid as a crystal growth modifier, aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) in the form of single-crystal microrods has been successfully synthesized at lower temperatures. It has been shown that the crystallographic and morphological characteristics of aragonite PCC microrods synthesized in the presence of iminodiacetic acid at a lower temperature are the same as those of aragonite obtained at 75 °C without an organic additive. The stereochemical relationship between calcium ions and the arrangement around ions bound to the carboxyl groups of iminodiacetic acid is suggested as a potential factor in the oriented nucleation and selectivity for formation of aragonite PCC microrods. The morphology, size, and crystal structure have been characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).Calcium carbonate (CaCO In the case of aragonite synthesis in Nature, certain living organisms (e.g., oysters or abalones) are capable of synthesizing higher-order architectures composed of aragonite under ambient atmospheric conditions. To delineate the role of organic species on the biomineralization of aragonite, many researchers have developed the stereochemical recognition model, in which it is envisaged that these shapes are stabilized through the binding of peptides and proteins to otherwise unstable faces, presumably because the stereochemical match to the crystal lattice lowers their surface energies ( The effect of iminodiacetic acid, a chelating agent and a water-soluble metal salt ( The reactor used consisted of a cylinder made of Pyrex glass with a diameter of 10 cm and a volume of 1.0 L, with a 4 cm long impeller attached ( X-ray powder patterns were recorded in reflection mode using a Rigaku RU-200 diffractometer, operated using a copper source (Cu-Kα,  The morphology, particle size and aspect ratio of the crystals were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were examined either with a JEOL JSM-6380 LA SEM fitted with an LaB Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using an Hitachi model H-800 with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Image/diffraction pattern rotation calibration was used to identify the orientation of crystalline material relative to other crystals and the features of interfaces in the sample. For this calibration, it is necessary to take double exposures of the reference standard image plus the reference standard diffraction pattern, at each magnification range and at each camera length, for every accelerating voltage of interest. X-ray diffraction data were measured over the scattering angle range 15° The crystal structure of iminodiacetic acid was performed with the aid of the Cerius Iminodiacetic acid is an amino-polycarboxylic acid composed of two carboxyl groups. Amino-polycarboxylic acids have been widely used as sequestrants to control metal ions in aqueous systems ( The yield of aragonite obtained in the presence of iminodiacetic acid is increased at lower temperature as compared to that in the absence of an organic additive ( In the absence of organic additives, the yield is about 96 wt.% at 75 °C and 0 wt.% at 30 °C, respectively ( SEM analyses indicated that the crystallographic and morphological characteristics of the aragonite PCC microrods synthesized with and without iminodiacetic acid was essentially the same ( To investigate any specific crystallographic differences between aragonite PCC synthesized with and without iminodiacetic acid, a Rietveld refinement was carried out ( In order to judge the quality of the final structural refinement, some numerical criteria, e.g., The TEM analysis reveals the orientation of crystal growth of aragonite PCC with iminodiacetic acid ( Knowledge of the crystal structure of iminodiacetic acid is necessary in order to identify any structural correlation between aragonite PCC and iminodiacetic acid. The crystal structure of iminodiacetic acid was built-up with atomic coordinates based on the crystallography. There are two types of ring, one 10-membered and the other 14-membered ( From our results, we can conclude the following: First, there is strong interaction between Ca On the other hand, iminodiacetic acid promotes the formation of rod-shaped aragonite with the orientation of (012) or at least does not inhibit the formation of rod-shaped aragonite in the orientation (012) ( This work was partially supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF) grant funded by the Korea government (MOST) (No.2007-00467).
