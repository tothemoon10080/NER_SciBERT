Under deep and complex geological conditions, severe deformation occurs at intersection points of Y-type roadways with large cross sections during engineering projects in coal mines, especially at junction arches. Based on in-situ investigations and theoretical studies, we have summarized typical forms of destruction and identified high stress and unrestricted support at both sides of junction arch as its main causes. In this study, we also presented double-directional control bolt support technology for a large Y-type span intersection, applied to deep intersection engineering in the Jiahe Coal Mine, which has proved effective.
