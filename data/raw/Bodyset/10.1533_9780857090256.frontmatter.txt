   (ISBN 978-1-84569-375-6) Computer-based modelling of material properties and microstructure is a fast-growing area of research and the use of titanium is also growing rapidly in many applications. The book links the modelling of microstructure and properties to titanium. The first part of the book reviews experimental techniques for modelling the microstructure and properties of titanium. A second group of chapters looks in depth at the physical models and a third group examines neural network models. The final section covers surface engineering products.  (ISBN 978-1-84569-450-0) Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding process that is gaining wide acceptance in industry, especially the shipbuilding, aerospace, mass transportation and automotive industries. FSW is particularly suited to those industries that use aluminium and its alloys. This authoritative book provides a comprehensive review of the subject of friction stir welding and covers topics such as process basics, equipment, modelling, inspection and quality control and applications.  (ISBN 978-1-84569-407-4) The book is concerned with the theoretical principles of hydrometallurgical processes and engineering aspects. The hydrometallurgical processes of production of copper are discussed and leaching of chalcopyrite as the main sulphide mineral of copper processed in industry is used as an example. The book is suitable as a university textbook for students of metallurgy.
