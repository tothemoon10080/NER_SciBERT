A thermodynamic consistency test (TCT) was developed for data of aqueous unsaturated electrolyte solutions at 25 °C by using the Gibbs-Duhem equation (GDE), standard referential data and estimates of error propagation. The consistency criteria include a randomness analysis of the errors and maximum deviation limits calculated with discrete forms of the GDE, where the zero equality of the theoretical equation was replaced by a free variable that represents the deviation from this equation. The results of the application of this TCT to 3 groups of data reported in the scientific literature for the LiCl + H2O system at 25 °C showed that two of them are "mostly consistent" and one of them is "totally consistent", according to the criteria of thermodynamic consistency presented in this work.The thermodynamic consistency is the fulfillment of fundamental thermodynamic relations by a set of reported data, whether experimental or calculated. In this way, when these data meet this condition, whether in an exact or approximate way, they are classified as thermodynamically consistent. The thermodynamic consistency is a necessary condition, but not enough, for the data to be considered correct [ In general, compared to other areas of study, there is a small amount of thermodynamic consistency tests for electrolyte dissolution properties data. In Ref. [ In the present study, a methodology is developed to analyze the thermodynamic consistency of osmotic coefficient data and mean ionic activity coefficient of binary systems of unsaturated aqueous solutions of univalent electrolytes at 25 °C, based on the standard reference information of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, and informed by Hamer and Wu in 1972 [ The TCT proposed in this paper is based on discrete forms of GDE for electrolytes, standard referential data and estimates of error propagation. The approach applied in the development of this TCT is based on maximizing the possibility of consistency, using, on the one hand, the deviations of the standard data from the theoretical GDE, and, on the other hand, the errors associated with the variables involved. The TCT developed in this work was applied to the LiCl + H An important relation in the thermodynamics of solutions is the Gibbs-Duhem equation (GDE), being used in the verification of the thermodynamic consistency. For electrolyte solutions under isothermal and isobaric conditions, the GDE in its theoretical differential form is expressed as [ The standard referential values of Hamer and Wu [ Mathematically, the form of Eq. Then, Eq. As mentioned above, a set of thermodynamically and ideally consistent data should only contain errors of a random type, understanding the error of a variable as "the difference between a measured value of a magnitude and a reference value" [ The detection of points with systematic behavior is done in a visual way and is checked in an analytical way, by testing fits of curves, selecting those that graphically represent these data better and finally selecting the one that has the highest coefficient of determination R The total of points with non-random behavior among the reference values is approximately equal to 33% (14/43) and this value will be set as the maximum allowable with this type of behavior, counting them in groups of 4 or more adjacent points whose trends are curves with an R The calculation of the derivatives d( The term When (Δ In this work, the maximum deviation limits of Δ The general approach of the methodology presented in this paper is based on the maximization of the possibility of consistency. Concretely, this means that the limits of consistency developed in the previous section have been determined in order to reach the maximum possible expansion. On the other hand, the way of expressing the points to be analyzed in this TCT must have the same approach of maximization, using the propagation of the error of the corresponding data, assuming errors in some variables, in case they are not reported. The assumption of values for the error of variables in TCTs has been previously used in non-electrolytic systems, as in the work of Ruckenstein and Shulgin [ The data that will be analyzed individually by the proposed TCT will be represented by the values Δ The first instance, in which only the individual behavior of the values of Δ The second instance, to give a "second chance" to the data group (m, The application form of the individual test is as follows: If in an analysis performed in the first instance, the value or point Δ In this second instance, if the value of (Δ This last form of analysis is individual, but a global result for the entire group of data analyzed can be expressed as a percentage using the following equation: In this work, an application example of the previously described methodology will be shown using it for LiCl + H In this work, a general acceptability criterion applicable to any system will be used. This criterion is the condition that each of the data presented to be submitted to the TCT must obey the trends of the standard data. In the case of the studied system (LiCl + H For the decreasing zone: If it is desired to analyze the thermodynamic consistency of reported (experimental or calculated) data of the osmotic and average ionic activity coefficients (both represented by an asterisk as a superscript) depending on the molality of a certain system, on the condition of having the standard reference data for the same system, then the steps to follow are these:      If If If If  The proposed TCT is applied to the data sets reported by Gibbard and Scatchard in 1973 [ Acceptability analysis indicates that 34 of the 36 total data reported by Ref. [ The analysis of acceptability indicates that the 21 total data reported by Pan [ The acceptability analysis indicates that the 37 total data reported by Robinson and Stokes [ A summary of results given by the proposed TCT is shown in The applied test is oriented to the analysis of data ( One of the experimental methods most used in the determination of the osmotic electrolyte coefficient is the isopiestic method, whose description can be widely found in the literature. The data used by Gibbard and Scatchard (1973) and Robinson and Stokes (2002) in their modeling come from this type of experiment. Gibbard and Scatchard, in addition, used equipment (modified by them) of static measurement of vapor pressures, using dry LiCl in the preparation of their solutions, without reporting their degree of purity. Both aspects can generate random errors (in the case of vapor pressure) or systematic errors (in the case of impurities not reported), or their combined effect could imply greater errors. In the modeling carried out by them, it was necessary to determine the parameters necessary to solve their equation for the calculation of the osmotic coefficient, which also depends on pressure and temperature. These parameters were calculated with the help of both their own vapor pressure measurements and other authors, which together contained a range of molalities from 0.01 to 18.4 mol*kg According to the summary of results shown in The method of thermodynamic consistency analysis proposed in this work is designed to analyze reported data of the osmotic coefficient and the mean ionic activity coefficient of univalent aqueous electrolytes at 25 °C, both experimental and calculated. In this proposed TCT, due to the way in which it has been developed, it is required the existence of valid standard data, such as those reported by NIST, with the appropriate conditions of spacing in molality, so that the description of the systems is the adequate in each concentration range. As part of results, the proposed method provides a summary, giving a global consistency percentage based on the results of the individual analysis and it is able to distinguish between the reliability of consistent individual data, depending on whether said result is given in the first instance of analysis (higher reliability) or in the second instance of analysis (lower reliability). For each case, a different weight is applied in the calculation of the global consistency percentage. The verification of correct functioning of the proposed TCT has been carried out applying it to the study of the LiCl + H In general, the results of the proposed TCT applied to the system under study show that, with few exceptions, the data reported by Gibbard and Scatchard (1973), Pan (1981) and Robinson and Stokes (2002), present a good level of thermodynamic consistency, being these suitable for use in calculations of process involving the LiCl + H  subscript for derivative of the analytic function superscript for average of variables function of derivative of Gibbs-Duhem equation superscript for standard reference values subscript for position of a variable in the mesh subscript for derivative based on the Lagrange polynomial subscript for LiCl as solute molality of the solution, mol*kg superscript about maximum value of variable superscript that denotes minimum value of variable total number of data analyzed by the TCT quantity of consistent data in the first instance quantity of data consistent in the second instance National Institute of Standards and Technology percentage of global thermodynamic consistency coefficient of determination of fit thermodynamic consistency test vapor-liquid equilibrium deviation from GDE absolute error osmotic coefficient mean ionic activity coefficient superscript for values to be analyzed
