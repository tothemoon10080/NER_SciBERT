Structure of the CaO–SiO2–Al2O3–MgO–TiO2 slag was studied by molecular dynamics simulation at 1773K. Additionally, part of viscosities were measured for quantitatively establishing the relationship between the structure and viscosity with varying basicities and TiO2 additions. Role of TiO2 as basic oxide was verified and it can be inferred that the structure of TiO2 is relatively similar to MgO compared to CaO. In addition, distribution of three different types of O was presented from which it can be obtained that nonbridging oxygen preferentially localized beside Si rather than Al. Moreover, parameter αM
                      was proposed to estimate charge-balancing capability of M for [AlO4] (where M denotes Ca2+, Mg2+, Ti4+) along with the average values of αCa
                     , αMg
                      and αTi
                      equaling to 1.731, 1.282 and 1.092, respectively, suggesting that Ca2+ is preferentially compensated for [AlO4] than Mg2+ and Ti4+. Therefore, TiO2 and MgO have a prominent effect on depolymerizing the framework of the slags than CaO in slags containing high Al2O3. Finally, the natural logarithm of the measured viscosities exhibit a linear dependence on the fraction of Q4 for Si, indicating that the degree of polymerization for Si is still the principal factor which affects the viscosity despite the complicated composition.Viscosity is one of the key properties of slags which have a prominent effect on the metallurgical processes such as the kinetics of reactions and transport phenomena in metal-slag systems in high temperature It's known that the slags in the fields of pyrometallurgy are based on the silicate melts and the viscosity of silicate melts is a direct result of the composition and temperature. Nevertheless, several oxides exist in the slags resulting in the complexity of the structure, which contributes to the difficulty in the prediction for viscosities in comprehensive ranges of composition, in particular for blast furnace (BF) slags containing high TiO It's accepted that the viscosity of silicate melts is directly related to the structure such as the degree of polymerization. Therefore, structure analysis of different slags was investigated by some researchers Consequently, in the present work, the MD simulation was extended to this quinary slag based on the industrial composition. In order to investigate the structure, the effect of basicity and TiO MD simulation was carried out with the Born–Mayer–Huggins (BMH) interatomic potentials which has been generally used in the research of structure of glasses or slags and has been proved successfully by the comparison with the experiment results using XRD, NMR, Raman spectrum and the simulated results from MD Here, In this work, the samples were simulated with different TiO The viscosity of this 200 The viscometer was calibrated using different silicone oil standards with viscosities of 0.95, 4.92 and 9.8 The pair distribution function (PDF), In this system consisting of numerous oxides, the bond between cations and O  As noted above, in this multi-component slags, both Si Both [SiO In slag systems containing SiO As mentioned above, NBOs are the O anions bonded only to one tetrahedron consisting of Si Consequently, it can be inferred that NBOs preferentially connect to [SiO It is accepted that in slag systems at elevated temperature the structural species are presented by Q The measurements of viscosities of this quinary slag with basicity values of 1.0 and 1.2 along with TiO Additionally, temperature dependence of the viscosity for slags at basicity of 1.0 and 1.2 is shown in In silicate slags, the network formed by Si and Al transforms gradually to simple structural units, resulting in the decrease of viscosity. Consequently, it can be assumed that viscosity at a given temperature is a simple function of the abundance of fully polymerized structural units of Q Structure analysis of the CaO–SiO Both Si Viscosity decreased with both basicity and TiO This work is supported by the Major Program of
