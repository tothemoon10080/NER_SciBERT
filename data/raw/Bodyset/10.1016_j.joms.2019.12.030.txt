Purpose
                  Zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures occur often. However, no clinical consensus has been reached regarding the number of fixation points required when performing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The objective of the present study was to explore the utility of single-point fixation in the management of noncomminuted ZMC fractures.
               
                  Patients and Methods
                  We analyzed the data from a retrospective case series of 211 patients treated during a 20-year period.
               
                  Results
                  The mean length of follow-up was 3.4Â months. Of the 211 patients, 162 with noncomminuted ZMC fractures had been treated with single-point fixation of the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. During the follow-up period, 1 patient experienced tooth loss because of a root present in the fracture line, 7 experienced intraoral plate exposure, with 2 subsequently undergoing plate exchange, and 8 developed a wound infection. No patients required orthognathic surgery or cheek implants for malar asymmetry. No patient developed hypoglobus or enophthalmos, and none required revision ORIF of their ZMC fracture.
               
                  Conclusions
                  To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the largest series in the literature reporting the surgical results and outcomes of patients with noncomminuted ZMC fractures treated with single-point fixation. In experienced hands, we believe this is a viable surgical option if appropriate surgical considerations are made.
