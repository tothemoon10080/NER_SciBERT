  Professor Mridha was a senior research fellow at the University of Strathclyde, UK from 1989–1994 and worked on laser processing of aerospace materials in collaboration with UK Ministry of Defence. In late 1994 he moved to Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore where he was employed as an associate professor until 2001, working on semiconductor materials, composite and intermetallic coatings. In January 2002 he joined the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) as professor, later assuming the position of Head of the Department of Manufacturing and Materials Engineering. He left IIUM in July 2012 to join the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Strathclyde (UK) as a Leverhulme Trust Professor, and remains there presently as visiting professor. Professor Mridha has published more than 150 journal and conference papers. His research contributions are primarily on microstructure–properties relationships, semiconductor materials and surface modification of light alloys and steel using high power laser and TIG torch melting technology. He is the pioneer of TIG torch techniques for surface coating applications.
