In the present study, woven carbon fabrics, graphene nano sheets (GNPs) and graphites were used as the bonding source between Ti sheets to produce Ti-TiC laminated composites through spark plasma sintering. In the case of carbon fibers, the woven fabrics were cut in a circular shape and inserted between the Ti sheets; on the other hand, in the case of graphite and GNPs, ethanol with carbon sources as the mixture was sprayed on the surface of the starting Ti sheets until reaching the specified increase in the weight of the coated Ti. After that, seven layers of Ti sheets (including six coated layers and one un-coated one) were inserted to the graphite die and the sintering process was performed with the initial and final applied pressure of 10 and 50 MPa, respectively, at the sintering temperature of 1250 °C. The XRD patterns taken from the cross-section of the prepared composites revealed the formation of the TiC crystalline phase as the product of the reaction between Ti and the carbon sources. The FESEM images also showed the proper bonding between the layers due to the formation of TiC and carbon diffusion into the Ti sheets. The fracture surfaces of the prepared sample demonstrated the almost ductile fracture for the Ti-laminated sample, as well as the Ti-GNPs laminated composite, while the brittle fracture was obtained for the composites with graphite and the carbon fabric as the bonding layers. The highest hardness of 912 ± 17 Hv was calculated for the cross-section of the Ti-CF laminated composite; also, the highest bending strength of 1215 ± 18 MPa was obtained for the Ti-GNPs laminated composite.Structural applications with composite laminated materials have been developed in the past few decades due to their superior properties, as compared to the traditional composites [ Among all lightweight structural materials, titanium and its composites have been broadly regarded as appropriate structural materials in biomedical, aerospace, automotive and military applications due to their proper corrosion resistance, high specific strength and modulus at evaluated temperatures, etc [ Hot-rolling, showing good industrial prospects, has the advantages of low manufacture cost and the potential capability of mass production; it is one of the most popular methods to prepare laminated Ti-based materials [ This present study studied the effect of different carbon sources such as graphene nano plates (GNPs), graphites and carbon fibers to produce laminated TMCs by TiC bonding through the SPS method. Moreover, the sintering behavior, bonding mechanism, mechanical properties and the fracture surface of the prepared composites were investigated and compared to the pure laminated Ti material. Titanium sheets (Alfa aecer-43677 Titanium foil, 0.5 mm thickness, 99% purity), GNPs (XG Scinces, Grade C, the average thickness of approximately 2 nm, the particle diameter of less than 2 mm, average surface areas: 750 m    Approximately, the similar trend with Ti could be recognized in the sintering behavior of Ti-GNPs laminated composite with the obvious difference in the total shrinkage. It seemed that the formation of TiC at the interface of the coated Ti sheet with GPNs and carbon diffusion at the matrix decreased the total shrinkage, as compared with the Ti sample.            Ti-laminated composites with different carbon sources as the bonding factor were prepared successfully though spark plasma sintering and in-situ TiC formation. The XRD analyses of cross-section of the prepared composite confirmed the formation of TiC as the product of the reaction between the carbon sources and the Ti sheets. The microstructure investigations demonstrated the proper bonding of the Ti sheets and the good attachment by using the carbon sources between the layers. The FESEM images of the fracture surfaces also revealed the almost ductile fracture for the Ti-laminated sample (control specimen) as well as Ti-GNPs laminated composite. However, using carbon fabrics and graphite as the bonding factor led to the brittle fracture of the prepared composite. The highest hardness of 912 ± 17 Hv was calculated for the cross-section of the Ti-CF laminated composite. On the other hand, the highest bending strength of 1215 ± 18 MPa was related to the Ti-GNPs laminated composite, probably due to the proper alignment of GNPs at the interface of two Ti layers and the formation of TiC nanoplates.
