The relationships between deformation and fluid flow have been investigated in the Paleozoic basement of an isolated horst of the Catalan Coastal Ranges. A structural, petrological and geochemical study has been performed in a complex fracture network that resulted from a long-lived tectonic history (from Carboniferous to Miocene).
                  Nine fracture types, developed from a ductile regime in the greenschist facies to a shallow brittle regime, have been characterized in order to establish P, T and fluid compositions during the evolution of the horst. Syn-cleavage and late-cleavage quartz veins (qtz1-chl1 ± mu and late qtz2-chl2-dol1) formed during the Hercynian ductile deformation. These minerals precipitated from metamorphic fluids, possibly evolved from seawater, at temperatures between 240 and 340 °C. En-echelon albite vein arrays (ab-qtz3-chl3 ± ti-an) and NE-SW normal faults generating breccias mark the change from ductile to brittle, from compression to extension and from a closed to an open hydrologic regime. This paragenesis precipitated from the mixing of metamorphic and magmatic fluids at temperatures between 180 and 290 °C during the early Permian extension. Dolomite veins (dol2-chl4-qtz4), precipitated at 210–280 °C from the mixing of previous fluids with hypersaline oxidizing external brines, possibly during the late stage of the early Permian extension. Reverse faults and calcite veins (Cc1-ba) formed either during the Paleogene compression or during the Langhian to early Serravallian minor compression. Calcite and barite precipitated from meteoric or marine waters in an open hydrological system at temperatures below 50 °C. The Miocene extension is represented by NE-SW normal faults with fault gouges and NNW-SSE normal faults cemented by calcite 2 that precipitated at temperatures below 50 °C from meteoric fluids in an open basin-scale hydrological system.
                  The studied horst was part of a relay zone between two segments of the NNW-SE Llobregat fault during the early Permian, explaining the high fracture density and the fast upflowing of hydrothermal fluids at that time, thus controlling the development of albite veins exclusively in this area.Fluids are ubiquitous in the Earth's crust and play a main role in diagenetic processes, metamorphism and the formation of ore deposits as they transport heat and dissolved ions ( During shallow burial, fluids are produced by diagenetic reactions and by the expulsion of connate fluids during compaction, but external fluids may also enter in the system ( On the other hand, fluid generation may increase the fluid pressure, which causes a decrease in the effective normal stress favoring failure and even induce the reactivation of misoriented faults at a given stress field ( The study of veins, the best evidence of fluid flow, from a structural, petrological and geochemical point of view, provides insight about the relationship among deformation, metamorphism and fluid flow ( This work deals with the temporal and spatial relationship between fluids and deformation in an isolated horst of the Catalan Coastal Ranges (NE Iberia), mainly constituted of Ordovician phyllites. This horst, the Turó de les Forques, is differentiated from the surrounding areas by a complex network of fractures including syn- to late-cleavage Hercynian veins and faults and veins generated during different extensional and compressional events registered in the Catalan Coastal Ranges. The relationships between deformation and fluid flow in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic events have been previously studied in Mesozoic and Neogene carbonates ( The aims of this study are fourfold: (i) to characterize petrologically and geochemically the mineral paragenesis related to the different generations of fractures; (ii) to determine the composition and origin of fluids; (iii) to establish the hydrogeological regimes and the fluid pathways as a function of the involved tectonic event; and (iv) to decipher the structural evolution of this isolated horst and why it concentrates that high density of fractures. The Catalan Coastal Ranges (CCR), located in NE Spain, are the result of a long tectonic history that spans from Paleozoic to Present times. Nowadays, the CCR display a well-developed NE-SW horst-and-graben structure acquired during the opening of the Valencia Trough (Oligocene-early Miocene) ( The Turó de les Forques is a horst, constituted by Ordovician phyllites, isolated within the Miocene rocks of the Vallès Half-graben, which is separated to the west from the Garraf Massif by the incision of the Llobregat River ( The incision of the Llobregat River has exposed a 500 m long and 80 m high excellent outcrop, intensely crosscut by a huge amount of fractures resulting from a complex tectonic history from Hercynian to Neogene times. The field work carried out in this study allowed to generate a schematic map and a cross-section of the Turó de les Forques ( X-ray diffractions of 7 whole-rock powders have been performed with a Bragg-Brentano PAnalytical X'Pert PRO MPD alpha 1 operating at 1.5406 Å, 45 kV and 40 mA. They were scanned from 4 to 100°2θ with a 0.017°2θ step size and a count time of 50 s per step. Oriented aggregates of clay minerals in gouges were also prepared in order to recognize the mineralogy. Samples were dispersed and disaggregated by soaking in de-ionized water and suspended repeatedly. Separation of the <2 μm fraction was done by centrifugation. Samples were subsequently air-dried, glycolated during 24 hours at 50 °C and heated for 2h at 550 °C. XRD patterns were obtained between 2 to 62°2θ (normal sample) and 2 to 30°2θ (ethylene glycol and thermal treatment samples) with a 0.033°2θ step size and a count time of 50 s per step. Ordovician phyllites and gouges have also been analyzed by X-Ray Fluorescence (FRX). Major elements were measured in fussed samples with a Panalytical PW 2400 spectrophotometer, using an Rh anode. Fussed samples were prepared with 0.3 g of molten and dry sample mixed with 5.7 g of lithium tetraborate and 5 mg of lithium iodide. The mixture was homogenized and fussed at 1125 °C obtaining pearls of 30 mm of diameter. Carbon-coated thin sections were used to analyse major and minor elements of carbonate cements, chlorites, feldspars and micas with a CAMECA SX-50 electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA). It was operated using 15 nA beam intensity, 20 keV acceleration voltage and a beam diameter of 10 μm. The precision of major elements is about 0.64% (at 2σ confidence level). Twelve microsamples of calcite cements were powdered with a microdrill for carbon and oxygen isotopes. Samples (60 ± 10 μg) were reacted with 100% phosphoric acid at 70° C for three minutes. The CO Temperature conditions were estimated both, by thermometry from chlorite composition and by fluid inclusion analyses. Chlorite present several chemical substitutions (simple and coupled) controlled by the equilibrium conditions (P, T, pH, fO Fluid inclusions were examined in quartz and calcite to determine composition and temperature of the mineral-forming fluid. Thick sections were used for petrographic characterization of the fluid inclusions and for microthermometric determination. Measurements were made on a Linkam THM-600 heating-freezing stage. Raman microspectroscopy analyses were recorded with a LabRam HR800 Jobin-Yvon™ microspectrometer equipped with 600 g/mm gratings and using 532 nm (green) laser excitations. Acquisition timespan was 30 s and 60 s during 10 accumulation spectra. Vapor bubbles were analyzed in order to determine the presence of volatile species (CO The Ordovician phyllites show a regional foliation that dips dominantly 60° to the NNE which is deformed by km-spaced WNW-ESE open folds ( Based on field and thin section cross-cutting relationships, orientation, geometry and vein mineralogy, 9 fracture types have been described, being from the oldest to youngest: syn-cleavage quartz veins, late-cleavage quartz veins, en-echelon albite veins, NE-SW normal faults, NE-SW dolomite veins, NW-SE reverse faults, N-S calcite veins, NE-SW Neogene normal faults and NNW-SSE Neogene normal faults. The first seven generations have only been found in the Ordovician phyllites whereas the last two fault systems affect both Ordovician phyllites and Miocene rocks.          Phyllites are characterized by a penetrative cleavage defined by a strong preferred orientation of chlorite, muscovite and elongated quartz with some interbedded quartz-rich layers, from 0.1 to 1.8 mm thick ( Pelitic bands are constituted by muscovite (60%), quartz (25%), chlorite (10%) and albite (5%) and are rich in organic matter. Muscovite crystals range in size from 0.01 to 0.05 mm, quartz and albite from 0.02 to 0.1 mm and chlorite from 0.05 to 0.15 mm. On the other hand, quartz-rich layers have a granoblastic texture constituted by quartz (60%), muscovite (35%) and chlorite (5%). Quartz has a grain size between 0.05 and 0.1 mm, muscovite between 0.02 and 0.15 mm and chlorite between 0.1 and 0.2 mm. Quartz and chlorite are elongated parallel to the regional foliation and show intracrystalline deformation, indicating a pre-foliation development ( Miocene rocks from the Costablanca Formation (Burdigalian; Miocene limestones show δ  This mineral association constitutes the main paragenesis of the syn-cleavage and late-cleavage quartz veins. In both types of veins, quartz 1 crystals are inequigranular, up to 7 mm in size, inclusion-rich and have undulouse extinction ( Chlorite 1 grows along the contact between quartz crystals. It is characterized by brownish crystals up to 62 μm in size. Though less abundant, muscovite flakes up to 200 μm are associated with chlorite ( This mineral association is related to discontinuous ductile microshears and microveins developed in the late-cleavage quartz veins ( Quartz 2 crystals have less inclusions than the previous quartz generation and grow in optical continuity with the hosting quartz 1 crystals. Dolomite 1 cement is characterized by rhombic and subhedral crystals, 60 μm and 50 to 100 μm in size, respectively. Chlorite 2 is characterized by vermicular morphologies, from 53 to 174 μm long and from 15 to 50 μm wide, and it is included within the quartz 2 crystals and dolomite 1 crystals ( This paragenesis is found in en-echelon albite veins and breccias formed in the NE-SW normal faults. A temporal evolution is observed in these veins: The first veins, up to 1.5 mm wide, are characterized by the presence of elongated to euhedral albite and quartz ( This paragenesis is developed in the NE-SW dolomite veins and vugs affecting the quartz 1 crystals ( Dolomite is characterized by δ This association is present in the N-S subhorizontal calcite veins and partially cementing the cataclasites produced during the strike-slip reactivation of NE-SW normal faults. Calcite 1 is characterized by euhedral drusy, 40 μm to 1 mm in size, crystals with a zoned orange cathodoluminescence ( The calcite 1 shows δ Greyish fault gouges are formed in the NE-SW Neogene normal faults. They are constituted by quartz, muscovite, chlorite, albite and anatase resulting from the comminution of the phyllites and newly formed illite, smectite and kaolinite. Fault gouges change moderately the global bulk composition of the Ordovician phyllites, represented by a decrease of the SiO Calcite 2 cement is present in the NNW-SSE Neogene fractures. It is characterized by subhedral crystals, from 80 to 520 μm in size, with orange luminescence and a drusy disposition in the main fault planes ( Calcite 2 cement has δ The chemical composition of chlorites in the phyllites (abbreviation: chl Crystallization temperature and XFe Fluid inclusions analyses have been performed in quartz and calcite veins. The petrographic analysis revealed that quartz 1 (qtz Fluid inclusions in quartz 1 show homogenization temperatures between 230 and 370 °C (with most values between 240 and 320 °C), quartz 3 between 140 and 310 °C (180–270 °C) and quartz 4 between 157 and 330 °C (180–300 °C) ( In all the quartz generations, melting temperatures above 0 °C were obtained, indicating the presence of clathrates. Salinities, for the negative T Raman analyses in fluid inclusions of quartz 1 showed the presence of 0–3% CH The association quartz-chlorite-muscovite-albite of the Ordovician phyllites of the Turó de les Forques indicate their formation during greenschist facies. The absence of biotite suggests that they formed at temperatures Syn-cleavage and late-cleavage quartz veins are highly frequent in Paleozoic low-grade metamorphic rocks along the CCR, as occurs in most metamorphic rocks, as they are inherently related to deformation and Si-rich fluids derived from metamorphism ( It has been suggested that metamorphic fluids are the result of the continuous evolution of sedimentary pore fluids that are modified during diagenesis and metamorphism by devolatilization reactions as fluids interact with the host rocks at different P-T conditions ( At mesoscale, quartz veins evidence fluid flow along fractures. Dehydration metamorphic reactions supply large volumes of silica-rich fluids during cleavage development that favours the formation of syn-cleavage veins formation. During the last stages of cleavage development, the remaining volume of silica-rich fluids is lower as observed with the minor development of late-cleavage veins. We interpret that this late cleavage-perpendicular fracturing was triggered by the decrease in overburden pressure caused by the denudation of the orogen, which produced a relative fluid pressure increase in a ductile regime. On the other hand at microscale, fluid flow also occurred along microshears and intercrystalline boundaries and precipitated in low-pressure areas such as triple points created between elongated quartz crystals ( After the development of quartz veins, the formation of albite veins and albite-cemented breccias in the NE-SW normal faults suggests a progressive change in the fluid composition indicated by the change from quartz-enriched to albite-dominated paragenesis. As no ductile deformation structures neither recrystallization textures have been observed related to albite veins, a brittle regime is interpreted in the formation of these veins. Therefore, the compositional variation of the fluids, from silica-rich to albite-rich, occurred during the transition from ductile to brittle conditions ( The following dolomite 2-chlorite 4-quartz 4 veins mark a change in the physico-chemical characteristics of the fluid, as the increase in XFe Reverse and strike-slip faults observed at mesoscale have been related to the N-S subhorizontal calcite veins according to the similar structural orientation. All these structures, which are a minor phase in the Turó de les Forques, have been related to a compressional event. Vein minerals in this stage are different from previous deformational phases revealing a major change in the fluid composition and origin. Calcite 1 and barite are present instead of chlorite and quartz and, as indicated by the presence of monophasic fluid inclusions ( Finally, the youngest structures identified in the Turó de les Forques correspond to NE-SW and NNW-SSE normal faults affecting both Paleozoic and Miocene rocks, which form gouges and calcite slickenlines, respectively ( The Turó de les Forques hill and its associated fracture pattern resulted from a long-lived tectonic history spanning from Carboniferous up to Miocene. Unlike Hercynian quartz veins, albite veins (albite-quartz 3-chlorite 3 ± titanite-anatase) are exclusive from the Ordovician phyllites of the Turó de les Forques. They have not been observed neither in other phyllite outcrops along the CCR nor in any study about deformation and fluids in Mesozoic and Paleozoic rocks along the CCR ( The Turó de les Forques horst, formed by Ordovician phyllites, registers a long deformation history that spans from Ordovician to Miocene times that embrace from a ductile regime in the greenschist facies to shallow brittle deformation. Nine fracture types have been characterized in this horst. Based on petrological and geochemical analyses of their mineral assemblages, the evolution of the fluid flow system was established during the progressive deformation of the sequence constituting the horst: Syn-cleavage and post-cleavage veins of qtz En-echelon vein arrays of ab-qtz Dolomite veins (dol Reverse faults and cc1-ba veins formed either during the Paleogene compression or during the Langhian to early Serravallian minor compression. Calcite and barite precipitated from meteoric or marine waters in an open hydrological system. Finally, the Miocene extension is represented by NE-SW normal faults with fault gouges and NW-SE normal faults cemented by calcite 2 that precipitated at temperatures below 50 °C from meteoric fluids in an open basin-scale hydrological system. The ductile to brittle transition occurred between the change from compressional to extensional tectonics in the early Permian. This transition was produced by the exhumation resulting from the uplift and erosion of the orogen during compression. The intense albite veining, concentrated exclusively in the Turó de les Forques, together with their shear sense and orientations fits into a kinematic model of a relay ramp between two segments of the Llobregat fault. Such structure, produced during the early Permian collapse of the Hercynian orogen, produced a high-permeability path for the fast upflow of hydrothermal fluids in the low-permeability phyllites. The outcrop of this early Permian relay zone within the Miocene horst is due to a structural and erosional control. On one hand, the successive deformation phases have reactivated inherited faults, concentrating deformation along the same structures. On the other hand, from Permian up to now, the Turó de les Forques has been a structural high due to its position at the footwall of the NW-SE Permian extensional faults and at the footwall of the NE-SW Miocene extensional faults. As a consequence, the Turó de les Forques has remained as an area of almost no sedimentation and affected by erosion, allowing the exposure of the Permian relay zone.
