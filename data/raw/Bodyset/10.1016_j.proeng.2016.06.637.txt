This paper describes problem during water jet cutting with low (different) surface roughness on square workpiece, according to direction of abrasive feeding and cutting head moving direction. In this experiment, three types of water jet cutting machine were tested, with different types of entrance angle of abrasive in mixing chamber with inclination from the z – axis (angle) θ = 90˚, 60˚ and 50˚.
                  Material for test specimens was stainless steel AISI 316L with 20 mm thickness. Cut shape was square with side length 50 mm. Surface roughness was measured on three cutting depths: 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm. Results of surface roughness measurement for each side of specimen were obtained. Also, statistical analysis of scattering was made, in order to determine scattering of values of machined surface.
