An one-dimensional mathematical model addressing the field of tangential velocities, agitation power and other hydrodynamic features necessary for designing large-size unbaffled agitators with a precession impeller is proposed in this study. The adequacy of the model is confirmed by tests, published data, and lengthy positive operational results for industrial agitators with a volume of up to 1000m3, designed for leaching of ore slurries.Vertical large-size agitators with the capacity of 100–3000 Both standard modifications have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, mixing of suspensions in an unbaffled vessel in In baffled agitators ( Both modifications have also significant design imperfections, because they require either rapidly wearing end bearings and vibration-resistant single-span shafts or heavy metal-intensive open-end shafts and their supports, bearings, and covers. This is due to the low frequencies of bending vibrations of the open-end shafts and to the influence exerted on MMSs by unbalanced hydrodynamic fatigue loads ( Further on, specific computation and usage features for the alternative agitator type with three-blade impeller are considered ( The studies have been made both in laboratory and using the prototype industrial equipment designed and manufactured on the basis of the results described here. The laboratory equipment has been designed as cylindrical vessels with transparent walls and pipes for sampling, uniformly arranged along the height of the side surface. Ore slurries in the form of suspensions with a mass fraction 0.2–0.5 of solid particles have been used as a working medium. Alkaline solutions (pH 10.5–11.8) containing dissolved Ca(OH) As follows from The design of the pilot installation was geometrically similar to the one of an industrial agitator, and the standard instrumentation enabled determination of The average velocity of constrained sedimentation of particles of the suspensions under study in laboratory conditions has been about 1 As а rule the following elements are placed on the open-end precession shaft: on the first level, standard closed turbine ( At the same time, a large-diameter blade impeller, combined with a low-power-consuming turbine impeller moving near the bottom along a circle with a larger radius, provides effective homogenization of the suspension throughout its working volume. A particular interest has been expressed to the case in which the axial circulation flow of the three-blade precession impeller upwards from the bottom along the agitator axis toward the suspension surface (up-pumping), as it has not been widely enough covered in the earlier studies. In this case, the articulated shaft is loaded by an axial stretching hydrodynamic force of the impeller, which stabilizes parameters of the precession motion of the rotor and improves the efficiency of the suspension mixing process ( Mode 1: The shaft with an impeller slightly deflects from the vertical position ( Mode 2: A certain time after the startup, the shaft with an impeller deflects from the vertical position by an angle Further on, operating in mode 2 is called agitator with a precession (planetary) MMS or, briefly, agitator with a PMMS, with numerous advantages are considered in detail in the final section of the study. In a steady mixing mode, the turbine impeller is almost not involved in the formation of the velocity field. Therefore, a theoretical analysis is made for an agitator with a blade impeller. The main parameter of a PMMS is the angular precession velocity The angular momentum is added up with two components: The shaft length The steady mode of direct precession is possible if, in decomposition of the torque In this case, the torque on the axis of the precession impeller, Thus, the momentum of forces Because the shaft inclination angle does not exceed 20° in operation of industrial agitator and To find the precession angle It is noteworthy that the mathematical model considered below has been preliminarily tested for describing the field of tangential velocities and suspension's agitation power for a particular case with an impeller on the axis of a unbaffled agitator ( To find an expression for calculating the unit force For the axially positioned impeller ( Further, main relations that compliment to the calculation of the tangential velocity field are presented ( The turbulent viscosity near the wall outside the laminar layer with a thickness A comparison of the rated and experimental velocity fields reported by The shaft torque of the three-blade impeller can be found using the formula It is noteworthy that the velocity field and agitation power, rated by Eqs. The field of tangential velocities and other hydrodynamic parameters of the agitator have been rated in mixing of the slurry by a Fulfillment of the second condition The torque of the precession motion of the impeller can be rated by the formula Eq. It is necessary to note that Eq. The power consumed for slurry is related to the drive shaft torque by Solving numerically Eqs. The algorithm of the numerical calculation, developed in this paper, is the following. The torques This dependence characterizes the static stability of the system. Apparently, at Under real conditions with an articulated shaft, the axial symmetry of the velocity field is disturbed because of the presence of up- and down-comers or other internal structural elements in the agitator, leading to angle fluctuations Δ If these fluctuations exceed Calculations based on the proposed mathematical model, experiments on pilot installations, and working practice of industrial agitators (see The PMMSs calculation approach described above has been applied for a repair modernization of 10 agitators with The modernization of the agitators included the following procedures: Dismantling the end bearing of the shaft. Changing the size of inclined blades in accordance with the available power reserve of the gear-motor drive. Moving the three-blade impeller down to the boundary with the sediment. Reversing the electric motor to create an up-pumping circulation in the vessel. According to the table (examples 7–9), which briefly lists the measurement and calculation results in line with the mathematical model proposed, those, currently successfully operating agitators ( It is also noteworthy that, at a deflection The satisfactory correspondence between the rated and experimental data on two such important parameters of PMMSs as   The decrease of the central vortex from  When a blade of the precession impeller is rotated, the velocity of suspension flow around the blade changes, Δ At It is interesting to mention that the important advantage of the three-blade impellers, indicated by (28), does not extend to the frequently used impellers with As a conclusion, the application field and main advantages of precession MMSs for the two operation modes mentioned at the beginning of the paper are considered. The mode 1 ( As demonstrated by experiments, calculations, and service data, using mode 1 in unbaffled agitators ( Circulation contour favorable for suspension (ascending flow moves at the center of an agitator, rather than, as usual, on its periphery), with large peripheral and axial components of the slurry flow velocity and dead spaces eliminated by, in particular, conical displacers on the bottom periphery ( Decrease to almost zero in destructive unbalanced hydrodynamic transverse loads on the open-end shaft of MMS, which automatically adjusts itself to the minimum bending load via minor shifts of the articulated system in the angular and circumferential directions. Substantial decrease in the size, metal intensity, and cost at a simultaneous increase in the service life of a low-loaded MMS having no wearing friction elements within the working volume of the agitator. Enhanced vibration resistance of a light shaft with a new rated scheme of its fixation on the only hinged support-sleeve mounted on the drive shaft ( The advantages of mode 1 have been implemented in design and subsequent repair modernization of the already mentioned 19 agitators (see examples 6–9 in the table). Currently, the modernized agitators ( The mode 2 usage could be considered advantageous ( The substantially larger energy dissipation zone around the shaft–impeller system moving along a conical trajectory; markedly wider, along the radius, zone of increased peripheral velocities (see Substantial decrease in the depth of the central vortex impairing the interesting opportunities for intensification of the micromixing process, described ( Occurrence at any moment in time of a non-steady operation mode of the precession impeller that is favorable for mass and heat transfer and consumes a power close to the stirring power in an agitator with four standard baffles ( Precise control over the velocity field parameters and the precession and energy characteristics of PMMSs by varying, e.g., the working angular frequency of the drive or the impeller diameter. Noticeable decrease in the size, mass, and cost of the high-speed impeller, accompanied by a positive effect on the economic efficiency and reliability of the open-end shaft, hinged sleeve, and motor-gear. Having taken into consideration mode 2 advantages, two agitators with  A mathematical model has been developed, which can describe a number of parameters for a two-stage precession mechanical mixing device operating in a smooth-wall agitators. This device has a single-support open-end shaft fixed to the drive shaft with an articulated sleeve. The shaft bears two impellers of different types. The parameters being described are the following: field of circumferential velocities; mixing power and swirl profile; hydrodynamic loads on the blades, impeller shaft, and drive shaft; deviation angles of the shaft ( The adequacy of the model has been confirmed by experiments on pilot installations and by prolonged tests on 19 industrial agitators with volumes of 270–1000 The PMMS equipped with two impellers of different types and sizes is highly reliable and economically efficient because it is relieved from the action of dangerous transverse hydrodynamic forces, has no friction pairs within the working volume of the smooth-wall agitators, and is furnished with highly reliable standard units. Agitators with PMMSs, intended for leaching of ore slurries, can serve as an alternative to standard apparatus with axially mounted impellers, wearing end bearings, baffles, and strongly loaded heavy rigid shafts.  eccentricity of the precession impeller, m buoyancy forces for the impeller 1, and for the shaft, N inclined blade width, m impeller diameters in stages 1 and 2, m size of solid particles in the slurry, μm vessel diameter, m height of blade projection onto a vertical plane, m heights at which impellers are mounted in stages 1 and 2, m sediment height, m height of rotor in contact with suspension, m energy dissipation, W force applied per unit length, N gravitational acceleration, m inertia momentum of the shaft–impeller system, kg angular momentum of the shaft–impeller system, kg distances from the hinge center to mass centers of impellers, m mixing path length, m masses of impellers and shaft, kg total momentum of forces with respect to point O, N frequency of impeller rotation, s critical impeller rotation frequency, s impeller power, W power number ( mass fraction of particles with sizes in the range from 0 to specific load on a blade, N running radius, m radii of agitator, and inner and outer blade edges, m inertia radius of the shaft–impeller system, m shaft torque, momentum of resistance to impeller rotation, and momentum of resistance to precession displacement, N tangential velocity, m dynamic velocity, m radius, m ratio of momenta [see Eq.  angle of blade inclination relative to the horizon, deg angle (see thickness of the laminar layer, m blade rotation angle, rad kinematic viscosity of the suspension, m turbulent kinematic viscosity of the suspension, m angle of shaft deflection from the vertical (precession angle), rad density of the impeller and shaft material, kg suspension density, kg angular rate of impeller rotation about own axis, rad angular rate of drive shaft rotation, rad angular rate of the precession motion of the shaft, rad resistance coefficient of an impeller blade
