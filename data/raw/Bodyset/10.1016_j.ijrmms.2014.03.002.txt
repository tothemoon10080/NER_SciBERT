Drilling and blasting are commonly used rock excavation techniques within the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM), as a method of producing underground space by using all available means to develop the maximum self-supporting capacity of the rock itself to provide the stability of the underground opening In practice, blast-induced ground motion is commonly expressed by a peak particle velocity (PPV), estimated using various empirical ground motion attenuation relations In this paper, we develop a PPV prediction model for the specific case study. Even though there are already many ground motion predictors, which could give a reasonable prediction of PPV, there is a justified need for updating the existing models by including PPV values of new recordings. This arises from the fact that conventional predictors represent only approximate models, which take into consideration a scaled distance as the most important input unit, while the blast-induced ground motion depends on a wide scale of different influential parameters, such as total charge, stemming, hole depth, physico-mechanical properties of rock mass and explosive characteristics Bor mine deposit is one of the largest copper deposits in Europe, with production of almost 5.7 Orebody “T” is located in the central part of Bor copper mine, at relatively great depth, between 470 and 520 During 2011, detailed geological and geotechnical analysis showed that exploitation of this ore body with conventional mining methods would be associated with higher risk, cost and potential losses of very rich ore. Therefore, it was suggested that further excavation should be done with complete ensuring of stability, using the NATM method. In that way, an underground chamber of great dimensions was being formed. The ore excavation started from the upper zone, with the approach to the excavated area through the spiral ramp and upper transportation ramp. The excavated ore was transported through the vertical shaft to the transportation horizon. The excavation was performed in horizontal layers, about 5 Every excavation phase consisted of blasting and successive installation of the support system, with grouted anchors of different lengths (9 Field work consisted of (a) blasting, performed at fourteen different locations inside the underground chamber and (b) recording of blast-induced ground motion, at three monitoring stations ( The ground vibrations were registered with 3 accelerometers of D110-T type, with dynamic range of 120 A total of forty-two blast vibration records were used for development of an ANN model, from which twenty-one data sets were used for training and the rest for the validation and testing of the neural network. Different blast parameters collected from the site are PPV (mm/s), total charge (kg), maximum charge per delay (kg), charge per hole (kg), delay time (s) and distance between the shot point and monitoring station (m). In order to justify the development of a new PPV prediction model by using the ANN approach, first we turn to common empirical attenuation equations, which represent prediction models for PPV as a function of scaled distance The site constants were determined from the multiple regression analysis of the forty-two recordings ( The relationship between measured and predicted PPV by conventional predictor equations is given in Results of the analysis from the previous section indicate that conventional methods did not give accurate prediction of PPV. As a next step, we develop a neural network model, by using the same approach as in In the present study, in order to create an adequate ANN model for prediction of PPV, a three-layer artificial neural network is used with the back-propagation training rule optimized by Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shannon (BFGS) algorithm and with sigmoid activation function. The mathematical summary of the back-propagation learning algorithm is given in After analyzing several cases of networks with various numbers of hidden nodes, the most precise model for PPV prediction was obtained by a neural network with one hidden layer and twenty hidden nodes ( In this case, we chose a feed-forward back-propagation neural network with logistic activation function and BFGS training algorithm, as it was already used in We are aware of the fact that the analysis of this relatively small data set could lead to ambiguous results and interpretations. Common approach usually considers more than a 100 PPV recordings, in order to obtain reliable results In order to utilize the most sensitive part of neuron and since output neuron being sigmoid can only give output between 0 and 1, scaling of the output parameter was necessary, and was performed in the following way: If we compare the values of PPV predicted by different methods (conventional predictors and ANN), it is clear that prediction by ANN is closer to the measured PPV, while conventional predictors give weaker prediction ( Sensitivity analysis represents a method that enables us to determine the relative strength of effect (RSE) for each input unit on the final value of PPV Global sensitivity analysis, which was carried out for all the input parameters, indicated that the distance from blasting shot point and delay time have the strongest impact on the PPV value ( We developed an artificial neural network model for PPV prediction, on the basis of the recorded ground vibrations induced by blasting at fourteen different locations, during the excavation of orebody “T” in copper mine Bor in Serbia. The recording was performed at three different monitoring stations, with a total dataset of forty-two measurements. Even though the analyzed dataset is relatively small from the perspective of ANN modeling, it represents valuable experimental datum that has never been analyzed in such a manner for any excavated object in Serbia, as far as the authors are aware. The conducted analysis showed that, by using conventional equations, a small coefficient of determination is obtained ( On the other hand, by applying ANN, we developed a prediction model with satisfying accuracy ( As for the influence of input parameters on PPV, global sensitivity analysis showed that the distance from the blasting shot point and delay time have the strongest impact on the final value of PPV in comparison to the other parameters (maximum charge per delay, total charge and charge per hole). However, even though the results of the analysis are satisfactory and encouraging (regarding the predictive power of ANN in a first place) there are still certain questions that remain open. Is the developed model only valid for the investigated area (“T” orebody, particularly), or could it be used in a general case of blast induced vibrations during the underground excavation? Also, could the developed model be improved by analyzing a larger dataset? Only in that way, by broadening the presented research, would the prediction power of the suggested model be fully evaluated. This research was supported by the
