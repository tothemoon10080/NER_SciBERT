Carbon anodes used in the production of primary aluminium have to be covered with a layer of particulate materials, a mixture of alumina and crushed electrolytic bath. Alumina composition analyses of this material are performed daily in laboratory on a very limited number of samples. However, analyses results from this small number of samples do not capture all the composition variations occurring on a daily basis. In this paper, alumina composition estimation of anode cover material, based on the use of image analysis and regression models is presented.
