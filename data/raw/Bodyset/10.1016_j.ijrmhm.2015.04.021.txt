Porous Mo–30wt.% W alloy with controlled pore structure was produced by a freeze drying and sintering process. Unidirectional freezing of MoO3–WO3/camphene slurry with dispersion stability was done at −25°C. Pores were generated by sublimation of the camphene vehicle crystals, and subsequent sintering in hydrogen atmosphere was performed to reduce the oxide powders and consolidate the walls, leading to a porous body with unidirectionally aligned channels. The sintered bodies with Mo–W alloy phase showed macroscopic aligned pore with a size of 200μm. Microstructural observation revealed that the dendrite structure with small pores having several microns in size was presented in the internal wall. The strut between dendrite pores consisted of very fine particles with the size of about 100nm and showed that the degree of necking between the particles was not extensive. The formation of small pores was discussed in terms of solidification behavior of the liquid camphene with solid particles.Mo–30 Freeze drying technique In the present study, we have attempted to fabricate the porous Mo–W alloy with controlled pore structure by freeze drying process. MoO MoO The warm slurries prepared were then poured into the cylindrical molds with a diameter of 10 The dispersion stability of the slurry was measured by detecting concentration variation in the slurry by scanning the whole height of the sample in transmission, using a Turbiscan (Formulaction, France). The reduction behavior of MoO Typical SEM images of starting MoO To analyze the effect of dispersant addition on the dispersion stability of camphene slurries, the change in the transmission of slurries with elapsed time was measured by Turbiscan. In this apparatus, the sample cell containing powders suspended in an aqueous camphene solution was placed and its concentration variation monitored every 6 An optical micrograph of the sample prepared at a freezing temperature of −  XRD patterns of the initial and the reduced MoO The SEM image of the cross section parallel to the macroscopic camphene growth direction for sintered Mo–W specimen is shown in The pore structure of the internal wall of large pore and magnified image for the strut are shown in The strut microstructure of Mo–W alloy between dendritic pores is shown in Porous Mo–30 This work was supported by the
