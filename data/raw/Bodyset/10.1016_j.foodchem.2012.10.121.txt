The influences of composition and structure of meats from different pig breeds, including Duroc (D), Large White (LW), Landrace (LR), two-way cross (LR×LW) and three-way cross (D×[LR×LW]) on stability and textural characteristics of cooked meat emulsions were studied by using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Compared to other pig breeds, cooked meat emulsion from LW exhibited superior properties as indicated by lower water and fat released as well as higher chewiness, gumminess, cohesiveness, resilience, springiness and hardness. The univariate analyses of those selected properties indicated a significant correlation with higher contents of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, smaller muscle fibre diameter and lower myofibril fragmentation of LW meat, as compared to other breeds. Therefore properties of cooked pork emulsion were influenced by composition and structure of meat, which varied according to the pig breeds.Cooked emulsified meat products or sausages are widely consumed around the world. Basically, emulsion-type sausages are made from a mixture of finely chopped meat, fatty tissue, water, ice and additives (i.e. salt, nitrate, phosphate, seasoning, flavourings) ( Meat proteins serve as the emulsifying agent in a meat emulsion. To form a stable meat emulsion, these proteins must surround the finely chopped fat particles before cooking. Myosin, the major structural protein of meat, is the most important of the proteins for fat emulsification and water-holding capacity of processed meats. It is believed that myosin may bridge the oil–water interface, as the non-polar amino acid residues of the myosin tail would be attracted to the fat cell surface, whilst polar amino acid residues of the myosin head would be associated with the water phase. In addition to meat protein, fat is also an essential component of formulated meat products, contributing to tenderness, juiciness and overall palatability ( Technologically, emulsion-type sausages are mainly dependent upon the state of meat proteins and their water-binding and emulsifying properties ( Sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) was obtained from Aditya Birla Chemicals (Samutprakarn, Thailand). Sodium nitrite, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), sodium azide, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium chloride (KCl) and Nile Blue A were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Glutaraldehyde was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Ethanol and nitric acid were procured from Lab-Scan (Bangkok, Thailand). Ten (female) pigs from three purebred and two crossbred pigs, including Duroc (D), Landrace (LR), Large White (LW), two-way cross from LR and LW (LR Following 18 Moisture, protein, and fat contents were analysed according to the methods of The protein components were fractionated according to the method of Muscle microstructures of samples were determined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), according to the procedure of Myofibril fragmentation index (MFI) was determined as per the method of Cold pork emulsion was performed as described by Direct pH measurement of the ground pork, uncooked and cooked pork emulsion samples was performed in triplicate using a standard pH meter, Mettler Toledo 320 (Mettler Toledo, Greifensee, Switzerland). The surface colour of six cylinder-shaped samples (25 Emulsion stability was determined according to the method of Lipid distribution of uncooked and cooked pork emulsion was examined with CLSM, FV300 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Uncooked pork emulsion added with 0.001 % (w/v) of Nile Blue A solution was smeared on the microscopy slide. Cooked pork emulsion (1–2 TPA was performed using a TA-XT2i texture analyser (Stable Micro Systems, Godalming, England) with cylindrical aluminium probe (50 Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean comparison was performed by Duncan’s multiple-range test ( Since variables regarding the quality of cooked meat emulsion were the main focus, the relationships between the quality of cooked pork emulsion and the muscle composition and structure variables were determined by PLS regression with PLS2 algorithm ( PLS2 was used to establish a linear regression model, which calculates the dependent variables ( In matrix notation, the same formula can be written as the following equation: In the present study, the qualities of cooked meat emulsion sausage in terms of emulsion stability or texture were set as dependent variables ( Different moisture, intramuscular fat (IMF) and ash contents were observed among meats from different breeds ( Based on solubility, meat proteins were classified into five fractions, in which the amount of each fraction varied among pig breeds ( Fibre diameter and sarcomere length obtained from microstructural images of muscles from different pig breeds are shown in Ground meat from D exhibited the highest pH, followed by those form D Meats from different pig breeds showed different muscle composition and structure as assessed by the above analysis. Therefore, pig breed could be considered as the indicator or categorical variables in the explanatory matrix to improve the fitting of the predicted model in the PLS regression analysis ( Uncooked and cooked pork emulsions made from D showed higher pH, compared to those from other porks ( Cooked pork emulsion made from LR had the lowest redness ( The highest emulsion stability, defined as the lowest percentage of TFR, WR, and FR after heat treatment, was found in meat emulsion made from LW, followed by LR or LR The fat distribution in pork emulsion after staining with Nile Blue A was monitored by a CLSM as illustrated in For textural characteristics, cooked pork emulsion made from LW showed the highest hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and resilience, followed by those made from LR, LR The correlation coefficients between properties of cooked pork emulsion and the chemical constituents and microstructural parameters of pork from different breeds were determined ( In order to analyse the relationships among all selected properties of cooked pork emulsion and the chemical constituents and microstructural parameters of porks from different breeds, the PLS loading plot after applying PLS2 of the first two PLS components was shown in Univariate analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of each explanatory variable on prediction of each dependent variable. Considering the percentage of variation explained with the set of various explanatory variables when each of the dependent variables was analysed individually, WR and TFR were the best explained attributes, with about 90% of their variations explained by two PLS components, followed by FR (86% by 4 PLS components), chewiness (84% by 4 PLS components), gumminess (82% by 4 PLS components), cohesiveness (80% by 4 PLS components), resilience (79% by 4 PLS components), springiness (79% by 2 PLS components) and hardness (73% by 4 PLS components), respectively. The estimated regression coefficients of explanatory variables for predicting WR, TFR and FR exhibited a similar pattern ( Except for categorical variable of LW, the amount of myofibrillar protein was the most important factor for predicting variation in WR, TFR and FR, followed by the amount of sarcoplasmic protein. Among the meat proteins, myofibrillar proteins that are extracted into the water phase during comminution and blending are generally considered to be the most important factor for emulsification and the quality of meat network ( The next important factor for predicting a variation of WR, TFR and FR was fibre diameter, where a small fibre diameter could lower WR, TFR and FR of cooked pork emulsion. The physical properties of protein, such as conformation, size and shape, also influence the protein performance ( Selected textural parameters of cooked pork emulsion including hardness, chewiness, gumminess, cohesiveness, resilience and springiness are illustrated in Cooked pork emulsion made from LW exhibited superior stability and textural properties to those from other pig breeds. The variation in those qualities could be explained by the differences in muscle composition and structure. Based on the univariate analysis, higher emulsion stability and textural properties of LW were influenced by higher amounts of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, smaller fibre diameter and lower myofibril fragmentation at the time of use. This finding could provide better understanding in the properties and stability of cooked pork meat emulsion which was determined by composition and muscle structure that associated with pig breed.
