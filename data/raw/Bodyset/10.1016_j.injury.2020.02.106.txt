Objectives
                  Distal radius fracture (DRF) is the most common upper extremity fracture. The incidence of complications after surgical treatment still remains high.
                  The objective of our study was to assess functional and radiological results of DRF treated with volar locking plate.
               
                  Methods
                  We conducted a retrospective study including DRF treated by open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate during a period of 8 years (2010–2018). Data were collected from clinical records and included patient demographics, fracture characteristics, radiological parameters (radial inclination, palmar tilt, ulnar variance, articular step-off), range of motion (ROM), complications and reinterventions.
               
                  Results
                  A total of 170 patients (63.5% female) met the inclusion criteria with a mean age of 55.9 years [24.1–83.7; 13.76]. High energy injuries were more frequent in younger patients (25.56% vs 3.95%; p < 0.0001). AO classification was: 2R3A: 23.5%, 2R3B: 24.1% and 2R3C: 52.4%. Time until surgery was 8.5 days, longer in extraarticular fractures (AO-2R3A: 12.22 days, AO-2R3B: 7.97 days, AO-2R3C: 7.04 days, p = 0.018). Younger patients had better radial inclination (excellent in 85.1% vs 59.21%, p = 0.001) and radial shortening (excellent in 100% vs 88.15%, p = 0.001).
                  ROM was: flexion 63° [0–90°; 19.73], extension 57.67° [5–90°; 21.61], pronation 78.94° [40–90°] and supination 81.76° [38–90°; 8.87]. We found a weak correlation between ROM in flexion-extension and radial shortening (r = 0.218; p = 0.001) and articular step-off (r = −0.269; p = 0.002). We had 39 complications (21.18% of patients). 10.6% of patients needed a re-operation, being the most frequent hardware removal (6.5%) and tendinous disruptions repairs (2.4%). Reintervention rate was higher in younger patients (14.9% vs 5.3%; p = 0.042), complete articular fractures (AO-2R3A: 2.5%; AO-2R3B: 7.3%; AO-2R3C: 15.7%; p = 0.037) and high energy injuries (8.4% vs 22.2%; p = 0.044). Patients undergoing reintervention had a decreased flexion-extension (94.44° vs 123.83°, p = 0.007).
               
                  Conclusion
                  Radial shortening and articular step-off seem the most important predictors for postoperative range of motion. Worse radiological outcomes are observed in complete articular fractures and those affecting elder population.
                  Although radiological and functional results are good or excellent in most of cases, the incidence of complications and need for reintervention still remains noticeable. Re-operations were more frequent in younger patients, complete articular fractures and high energy injuries, and it worsened functional outcomes.Distal radius fracture (DRF) is the most common upper extremity fracture, involving 10–25% of all fractures Casting, percutaneous pinning, external fixation, or internal fixation can be the treatment of DRF. Closed reduction and cast application have been used for a long time as the main treatment, but the results are often poor with malunion or fracture collapse Many studies report that a better anatomical reduction of a DRF is related with a better functional outcome Many reports show up to 39% complication rates in volar stabilized DRF To assess functional and radiological results of all distal radius fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation with a volar locking plate. The aim of the study includes the comparison of the functional results (based on range of motion), surgery timing, fracture/patient characteristics and postoperative radiological parameters. Following institutional board approval, we conducted a retrospective longitudinal study in which we collected data from the clinical records of all the patients admitted in our institution during a period of eight years (January 2010–June 2018) with a diagnosis of fracture of the distal radius. Inclusion criteria included patients above 18 years old with a diagnosis of a fracture of the distal third of the radius treated with open reduction and internal fixation through a volar approach and a minimum follow up of 12 weeks. Criteria for surgery in our institution included the following fracture characteristics after a closed reduction and cast immobilization: >10° dorsal tilt, >3 mm radial shortening, >2 mm intra-articular displacement, <7° radial inclination. Exclusion criteria included loss to follow up, open fractures, additional injuries in the ipsilateral upper extremity and stabilization with additional fixation methods such as K-wires or external fixators. Patients undergoing arthroscopy or anything but a single volar approach were also excluded. Surgery was performed in decubitus supine position with the arm abducted in extension on a surgical table under a C-arm fluoroscopic assistance and a pneumatic arm tourniquet. Regional anesthesia was used in all cases through an axillary or interscalenic block. Open reduction was done through a volar Henry approach. Reduction was assessed under fluoroscopic imaging and maintained with provisional K-wires. Definitive osteosynthesis was made with one of the following volar plates according to surgeon preferences: Variable Angle LCP Two-Column Volar Distal Radius Plate® (DePuy-Synthes, Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf, Switzerland), Variable Angle LCP Volar Rim Distal Radius Plate® (DePuy-Synthes, Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf, Switzerland), Acu-Loc 2 VDR® (Acumed LLC, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA), DVR® Crosslock plate (Biomet Orthopedics, Warsaw, Indiana, USA). A splint was used until staples/suture removal (approximately 2 weeks). Follow up protocol included visits and X-Rays 1 week postop, 4 weeks, and then every month until fracture union. Rehabilitation consultations were requested according to the surgeon criteria based on the patient needs. Data was collected from the digital clinical records and included variables such as: patient demographics, fracture characteristics (mechanism/cause of production, AO Classification A total of 170 patients (63.5% female) met the inclusion criteria and were selected for the analysis. The mean age was 55.9 years [Range: 24.1–83.7; Standard Deviation (SD): 13.76]. 44.7% of the patients were 60 years old or above. 143 (84.1%) fractures were produced by low energy trauma, whereas 27 (15.9%) were caused by high energy trauma such as traffic accidents or sport injuries. High energy injuries were more frequent in younger patients (25.56% vs 3.95% The average time from the fracture event until surgery was 8.5 days [0–28 days; 9.74]. This time was longer in extraarticular fractures (AO-2R3A: 12.22 days) than in intraarticular fractures (AO-2R3B: 7.97 days and 2R3C: 7.04 days) Fracture union was achieved in all cases. Radiological parameters and their classification according to Sarmiento's modification of Lidström criteria are shown in Regarding range of motion (ROM), 153 patients (90%) made rehabilitation within the hospital facilities, whereas 17 (10%) didn't need consultation with this department. At the end of the follow up (mean: 6.82 months; range: 2.8–34.1; SD: 5.19) there was a mean flexion of 63° [0–90°; 19.73], extension 57.67° [5–90°; 21.61], pronation 78.94° [40–90°] and supination 81.76° [38–90°; 8.87]. We found a weak correlation between radial shortening and the range of motion in flexion-extension ( We found a total of 39 complications in 36 patients (21.18%): complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS: 11 cases, 6.5%); intra-articular screw penetration (10 cases, 5.9%); tendinous rupture (5 cases; 2.9%; being in 3 patients a rupture of the extensor pollicis longus and in 2 patients a rupture of the extensor digitorum of the 2nd finger); painful or hypertrophic scar (5 cases, 2.9%); carpal tunnel syndrome (3 cases, 1.8%); painful ulnar impingement (2 cases, 1.2%); pain related to osteosynthesis hardware (1 case, 0.6%); stiffness (1 case, 0.6%) and ulnar nerve compression (1 case, 0.6%). These complications weren't related to the experience of the surgeon, type of fracture, energy of the traumatism, time until surgery, type of implant, surgical time or radiological reduction. However, although not statistically significant we observed a higher complication rate in more complex articular fractures. (AO-2R3A: 15%; AO-2R3B: 17.1%; 2R3C: 25.8%; Up to 10.6% (18 cases) of the patients needed a new surgery, being the procedures performed: hardware removal (11 cases, 6.5%), tendinous disruptions repairs or transfers (4 cases, 2.4%), neurolysis (2 cases, 1.2%) and new osteosynthesis (1 case, 0.6%). We noticed that the need of reintervention was associated to the type of fracture (need for re-operation: AO-2R3A: 2.5%; AO-2R3B: 7.3%; AO-2R3C: 15.7%; Longer life expectancy has led to an increase in the incidence of distal radius fractures. Their treatment includes a wide variety of options from closed reduction and cast application to open reduction and internal fixation. According to Lafontaine there are five circumstances that increase the rate of secondary displacement after closed reduction Closed reduction and cast application has historically been the main treatment for DRF, but high incidence of malunion Open reduction and internal fixation restore the anatomy of the wrist and favors a faster rehabilitation with good clinical results Most of the patients (63.5%) were females in the present series, mean age reached 55.9 years, and 84.1% of the fractures were the result of a low energy trauma (fall from standing height). These results are similar to those described by other studies which confirm that DRF rise with age, are more common in female and are usually caused by low energy impacts Our observed radiological results (ulnar variance, palmar tilt and radial inclination) did not differ with those reported in other publications Range of motion achieved after follow up has been summarized and compared to the results obtained by other authors such as Duramaz Our study suggests that a better anatomical reduction of a DRF (radial shortening and articular step-off) is associated with a better range of motion (flexion-extension) The average time from the fracture event until surgery was 8.5 days. This time was longer in extraarticular fractures (AO-2R3A: 12.22 days) than in intraarticular fractures (AO-2R3B: 7.97 days and 2R3C: 7.04 days). The reason for this relies on our indication for surgery, where we always attempt an initial treatment with closed reduction and cast application. Decision for surgery is taken when a correct reduction is not achieved or when secondary displacement of the fracture happens. According to our data, there were no clinical or statistically significant differences when comparing early vs delayed osteosynthesis regarding radiological or functional outcomes. These results don't differ to the published by Yamashita et al. We found that longer surgery times were needed for high energy fractures and AO type 2R3C fractures, which we think is due to the higher severity of these fractures. We didn't notice any differences in the results when comparing the experience of the surgeon. However, we need to take into account that this is a retrospective study. Randomization could have avoided bias: perhaps more experience surgeons tend to perform more complex surgeries. The rate of complications in our sample is as high as 21.18%, ranging the reported complications by other authors from 8% to 39% We found a non-significant higher complication rate in complex intraarticular fractures (AO-2R3C). Thorninger et al. revealed significant results, which could be explained as more severe fractures could have more complications The need for reintervention was 10.6%. Our results are slightly higher than those published in other series, which are close to 7.5% To our knowledge this is the first study which shows a correlation between the articular step-off and the range of motion in the treatment of DRF with volar locking plates, and one of the publications with a wider sample describing radiological outcomes. The limitations of our study correspond to its retrospective design, lack or randomization and follow up time. We could not obtain a contralateral radiography for measuring radiological parameters in the uninjured limb, however, none of the studies mentioned in our publication take these measurements into account. Radial shortening and articular step-off were the most important predictors for postoperative range of motion in our cases. Worse radiological outcomes were observed in complete articular fractures and those affecting elder population. The results of our study suggest that although radiological and functional results are good or excellent in most cases, the incidence of complications and need for reintervention still remains noticeable. The need for a new surgery was higher in younger patients, complete articular fractures and high energy injuries, and it worsened functional outcomes. Attempt to close reduction, cast and follow up of distal radius fractures instead of early intervention hasn't shown to be related to the outcomes.
