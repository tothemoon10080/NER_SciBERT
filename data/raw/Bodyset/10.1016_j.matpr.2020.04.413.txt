In the present studies, efforts were made to improve corrosion resistance of 90CrMoV8 tool steel by following plasma nitriding. Plasma nitriding of this steel at 500 oC for6and 8 h significantly improved the corrosion resistance when compared to the as-received steel. X-ray diffraction reveals γ′ (Fe, Cr)4 N) and ε ((Fe, Cr) 2–3 N) phases formed after nitriding. Potentiodynamic polarization tests in 3.5% NaCl reveal that plasma nitriding significantly improved the corrosion resistance as compared to untreated steel. The improvement in corrosion resistance may be attributed to the N solid solution and the presence of Fe-nitrides formed in the compound layer
