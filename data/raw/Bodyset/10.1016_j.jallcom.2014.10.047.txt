The role of doping Ta in Fe-site on the phase, microstructure and dielectric properties of Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 (BLFO) has been investigated in this research. Single phase Bi0.8La0.2Fe1−

                     =0.0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. The BLFTO dried pellets were calcined at 800°C for 2h and then sintered at 1000°C for 2h. Phase analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated formation of single phase distorted R3c structure. Microstructural investigation using the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed that addition of Ta dramatically reduced the average grain size of Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 due to its strong pinning effect from 10.6μm in Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 to 0.92μm in Bi0.8La0.2Fe0.95Ta0.05O3. Ta doped BLFO showed superior values of dielectric constant (>2000) at room temperature. At higher temperature a considerable increase in the dielectric constant of Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 samples occurred due to space charge polarization. However, in Ta-substituted ceramics the stability of dielectric constant with temperature considerably improved. DTA analysis revealed that the peak for ferroelectric transition (T
                     C) shifted towards higher temperatures for the Ta-substituted BLFO and reached 870°C for x
                     =0.05. Moreover, a significant increase in remanent magnetization has been observed with increasing Ta addition in BLFO samples from 0.038emug−1 in Bi0.8La0.2FeO3 to 1.13emug−1 in Bi0.8La0.2Fe0.95Ta0.05O3.BiFeO Pure BiFeO In order to overcome these problems many attempts have been made recently, which include (1) doping rare earth lanthanide ions (La The main objective of the research was to reduce electrical leakage in BLFO caused by oxygen vacancies and to improve the ferromagnetic property of pure BFO by adding La and Ta as dopants. Doping reduces defects related to oxygen vacancies by charge compensation mechanisms As of yet, no investigations based on Ta doped BLFO has been reported.

BLFO and BLFTO multiferroic ceramics were successfully synthesized using conventional solid state reaction method. Single phase formation of all the samples was identified from the XRD patterns.
