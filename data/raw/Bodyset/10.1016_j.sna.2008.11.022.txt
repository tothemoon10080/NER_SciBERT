Piezoresistive composites with high hardness and conductivity are required for circuit breakers for multi-cycle operation under large current flow. Based on the simulation results for the mechanical behavior of piezoresistive composites, we developed piezoresistive composites with conductive TiB2 ceramic materials and silicone rubber. TiB2 up to 70vol.% was embedded into the polymer matrix without any mechanical deterioration while the electrical resistance was decreased with increasing TiB2 content. Piezoresistive composites with 70vol.% TiB2 particles exhibited a resistance of 1.7Î© at a pressure of 1.1MPa. A circuit breaker with the fabricated piezoresistive composites acted as a switch with a response time of around 2ms.Circuit breakers are electromechanical devices designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage by connecting or disconnecting the power flow at the generator, substation or load location Piezoresistive composite materials can be obtained by compounding an insulating polymer with conductive fillers such as metal particle, carbon black, graphite power, and carbon fiber Metal carbides, nitrides, and borides are groups of ceramics with outstanding and attractive properties for technological applications. Among these materials, titanium diboride (TiB  Utilizing the TiB As mentioned in Section The electric resistivity changes of the piezoresistive composite elements as a function of the applied pressure and the TiB As expected, the gap distance between the conducting ceramics decreased with increasing TiB By adapting the 70 To develop a high performance circuit breaker, we fabricated piezoresistive composites with TiB This work was supported by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Republic of Korea, through the Component-Material development programme, and Dr. D.-Y.
