I obtained great support and assistances from many Chinese professionals, editors of journals, and press for the permission in citing the contents, figures, and tables of their books, journals, and papers in this book. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for their efforts. I would also like to express my gratitude toward my wife Shuqing (Sue) Tian and my daughter Shelly Qi for helping me to revise and publish this book.
