The typical structure of a chondrichthyan tooth includes a base (or root), allowing it to be fixed to the cartilage of the jaw, and a crown composed of dentin and covered with enameloid. The variability in the tissue composition of these various structures was recognized very early and has generated a considerable amount of study with occasionally contradictory results. Histological characteristics have been and are still used in combination with the morphological characteristics of dentition, enabling in some cases the identification and classification of fossil taxa with unclear affinities. Numerous studies followed on the heels of those of Agassiz (1833) and Owen (1840), aimed at clarifying the systematic and functional interests of histological and microstructural characteristics. These questions are still not wholly resolved, due largely to a sampling that remains too small to identify the range of variation of histological characteristics satisfactorily and to a poor understanding of the developmental mechanisms of the origin of these tissues.The typical structure of a chondrichthyan tooth includes a base (or root), allowing it to be fixed to the cartilage of the jaw, and a crown composed of dentin and covered with enameloid ( Most of the controversies surrounding the dental tissues of Chondrichthyes have to do with the hypermineralized tissue (i.e. tissue that is ≤ 5% organic in composition) covering the crown of the teeth, the enameloid. Its nature and developmental origin have been debated for more than a century ( In Chondrichthyes, the main component of enameloid is fluorapatite, a calcium phosphate rich in fluorine, which forms microcrystals ( Histological variations in the dental microstructure of Chondrichthyes have long been considered a tool enabling the differentiation of the teeth of neoselachians (formed of batomorphs, rays, skates and torpedoes, and selachimorphs, including the so-called modern sharks; see  A recent re-examination of the diversity of dental microstructures existing in a wide sampling of neoselachians has shown the limits of the terminology used, demonstrating that it is no longer adequate to describe all of the morphological variation in enameloid encountered in this group. Thus, instead of a system based on the variation in Besides the problem of the still too limited sampling of the chondrichthyans as a whole, which makes it difficult to target histological variations in enameloid, the gray areas relative to its developmental origins also limit our understanding of its evolution. Most of the controversies surrounding enameloid involve two main points, its cellular origin and the nature of its protein matrix, questions that have been the subject of debate for over a century ( The use of the term In answering this question, it is useful to provide a quick recapitulation of dental development in vertebrates ( In this chapter, we will try to contribute new elements to these questions, based on the existing literature and on some recent data generated by developmental biology. The involvement of odontoblasts in the synthesis of the enameloid protein matrix has been recognized for many years ( the matrix is characterized by a non-collagenic protein secreted by odontoblasts, the organic framework of which is mineralized by ameloblasts (  the matrix is partly composed of collagen, which interferes with other proteins secreted by ameloblasts, before the mineralization of the organic framework ( the matrix is composed of tubules of enameline (an EMP protein found in the enamel of Osteichthyes), secreted by ameloblasts and forming “giant fibers” ( a variant of this hypothesis proposes that if the enameline tubules were epithelial in origin, the “giant fibers” would actually be produced by odontoblasts ( Most of these hypotheses acknowledge the activity of odontoblasts, which would be responsible for the secretion of the collagenic framework of the enameloid matrix. This aspect of the development of enameloid is no longer called into question by modern researchers, having been demonstrated by multiple studies on the basis of numerous imaging and histochemical techniques, for example. The precise role of ameloblasts, though, is less clear. Significantly, their potential involvement in the synthesis of the enameloid matrix and their contribution to the mineralization of tissue remains to be clarified. In taxa possessing enamel, ameloblasts participate in both the synthesis of its matrix by synthesizing specific proteins (the EMP already addressed) and in the maturation of tissues by synthesizing other proteins causing its mineralization while breaking down the organic framework. Although some EMP have been identified in the enameloid of several However, it has recently been shown in several non-chondrichthyan taxa possessing enameloid (teleosteans, amphibians) that ameloblasts are also capable of synthesizing collagens, thus participating actively in the formation of the enameloid matrix in these species (    Dentin makes up the largest part of the tooth crown in vertebrates. Most studies concerning the dental histology of chondrichthyans therefore focused initially on this tissue, due to its greater ease of observation and large volume compared to those of other dental tissues (e.g. In neoselachians, we mainly encounter two major types of dentin, osteodentin and orthodentin, which are subdivided into different categories according to the morphological variations appropriate to each of them ( We refer interested readers to the highly detailed studies of Peyer, Ørvig and Poole for a complete review of all of the types of dentin described in the literature. In any case, though, as we have seen from the many questions remaining The examination of questions pertaining to the developmental details of these tissues also question their homology with other mineralized tissues across vertebrates. Although we have seen that the homological argument concerning dentin is a robust one, this is not the case with enameloid. Even though the lack of homology with enamel seems well established, the relationships of the different kinds of enameloid with each other remain problematic. This type of tissue is seen particularly in many actinopterygians, where it is called acrodin (see The potential presence of enameloid in some euchondrocephals has also been put forward as an argument in favor of rejecting the convergence hypothesis. The differences in the matrix and mineralization observed between chondrichthyans and actinopterygians would thus be the product of divergences within each of the two groups (
