The chemical precipitation of magnesium from sulphate solution, resulting from heap leaching of nickeliferous laterites with sulphuric acid, was studied. Magnesium was removed as hydroxide using calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and the precipitate produced was a mixture of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) and gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). The variables studied were the temperature and the stoichiometric quantity of Ca(OH)2. The responses measured were magnesium removal and the specific surface of the precipitate. Design of the experiments and statistical analysis of the data were used in order to determine the main effects and interactions of the factors. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also used to investigate the effect of precipitation conditions on the morphological characteristics of the Mg(OH)2–CaSO4·2H2O mixture. Kinetic analysis with the aid of Nielsen theory allowed the determination of the Mg(OH)2 formation mechanism. The use of a magnesium hydroxide–gypsum mixture as a filler material was also examined. The suitability of the precipitate was evaluated by measuring a set of properties that can characterize a material as a filler and by measuring mechanical properties of polymers filled with the precipitate at various addition levels. The magnesium hydroxide–gypsum precipitate proved to be promising for this application, as it was found to have similar properties with other commercial products.A novel integrated hydrometallurgical method, suitable to treat low-grade nickel oxide ores efficiently and economically, includes heap leaching of the ore by dilute sulfuric acid at ambient temperature, purification of the leach liquors and recovery of nickel and cobalt ( A typical composition of the pregnant solution produced from heap leaching of Greek low-grade nickeliferous laterites with sulphuric acid is the following: Ni The magnesium in the pregnant solution has been found to arise from the leaching of the chlorite mineral of the lateritic ore and its concentration levels can be in the range of 6 g/L, for leaching of haematitic/limonitic ores, to 50 g/L, for leaching of serpentinic ores ( So far, little attention has been paid in literature to the problem of magnesium removal from leach liquors produced from the leaching of laterites. A patent of American Climax proposed the use of non-evaporative crystallization of magnesium sulphate monohydrate (MgSO The present research work is aimed at studying the removal of magnesium from a synthetic sulphate solution with a magnesium concentration close to the residual magnesium concentration of a real leach liquor that results from heap leaching of Greek laterites with sulphuric acid, after purification and nickel recovery, using a simple and low-cost method of precipitation with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) As a chemical precipitate, the mixture of Mg(OH) The aim of the present study was also to make a first approach to the utilization of the Mg(OH) For the systematic study of magnesium precipitation, a full 4×4 factorial experiment was carried out twice. The factors selected for examination were (1) precipitation temperature and (2) the quantity of Ca(OH) Precipitation was carried out in a 500-mL, five-necked, round bottom split reactor which was fitted with a glass stirrer, vapor condenser, thermometer and a pH electrode. The initial pH of the solution was fixed at pH 5.0 and adjusted for all runs with 0.01 N H At selected time intervals, samples of the pulp were taken and filtered under vacuum and the filtrate was analyzed for Mg The two precipitates selected for testing as filler materials were produced at 20 and 80 °C using stoichiometric and 1.3 times stoichiometric Ca(OH)  As is shown in Regarding percentage of magnesium precipitated, the main effects of temperature and quantity of the precipitant and their interaction were found statistically significant at the significance level The specific surface area of the precipitates produced in the 4×4 factorial experiment varied, according to the precipitation conditions, from 17.90 to 29.50 m Specific surface depends on the morphology and the size structure of the precipitate. For magnesium precipitation, the increase in temperature and in quantity of the Ca(OH) Electron microscopic observation ( As shown in For the evaluation of the activation energies, The precipitation of Mg(OH) These findings can be further checked by the application of the criteria given by the Nielsen theory. These criteria allow a conclusion to be drawn regarding the mechanism controlling the precipitation of magnesium without reliance on the characteristics of the precipitate produced ( According to Nielsen, the linearity of  The assessment of the Mg(OH) An essential characteristic of a filler is its oil absorption value, which gives an indication of how much quantity of a filler can be incorporated into a polymer. The oil absorption of the Mg(OH) The Mg(OH) The results obtained in the present work showed that, under the experimental conditions applied, the chemical precipitation of magnesium with the use of Ca(OH) The precipitate produced was a mixture of Mg(OH) The results of the kinetic analysis, based on the value of the activation energy and on the recovery ( The mixture of Mg(OH)
