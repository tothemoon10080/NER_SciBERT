Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) based light weight aerogel scaffolds were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method with ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. Hydroxyapatite was biomimetically mineralized on the surface of these scaffolds by soaking RGO aerogels in simulated body fluid which consists of calcium and phosphorous precursors. The biomimetic mineralization of these samples was also studied after functionalizing RGO aerogelwith various biocompatible polymerssuch as collagen, chitosan and poly-L-glutamic acid. The influence of these polymers towards mineralization were studied using various characterization methods. It was observed that polymer functionalized RGO aerogel exhibited increased rate of mineralization due to the presence of more functional groups which aids in mineralization and growth of apatite. Thus, mineralized spherical apatite was found to be uniformly assembled on the surface and the interior of the aerogel. The electrical properties of these samples were studied using a source meter and the electrical conductivity of these samples varied depending upon the functionalized polymers.
