Pulverised firing oil shale ash (PF OSA) is characterised by a theoretical CO2 capture capacity of 350–500kg (CO2)/t, 30–50% of which is based on free lime. A low porosity inhibits the availability of free lime, especially in the case of continuous flow processes where the recirculating process water is saturated with different species leached from the OSA (Ca2+, K+, Na+, OH−,

                     ). Referred ions in the slaking water are known to inhibit the diffusion of Ca(OH)2 from the particle’s surface, which, in turn, reduces the slaking rate and causes reactions to take place on the particle’s surface. The aim of the current study was to elaborate the effect of the listed parameters of liquid and solid phases on the availability of lime for hydration and following carbonation reactions. The experiments showed that the excess amount (⩾0.05M) of

                      ions in the slaking water had the severest effect on the availability of lime from PF OSA and its utilisation (<16%) in correlation with the solution concentration. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis showed the coherent product layer on the particles’ surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the shell contained mainly CaCO3, as, according to energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, free CaO inside the particles remained unreacted. The utilisation of lime could be enhanced substantially by diluting the process water or using ageing pre-treatment to increase the porosity of PF OSA. Comparative experiments with circulating fluidised bed combustion (CFBC) OSA showed that the porous structure of its particles supported the fast and full hydration of lime as well as the diffusion of Ca2+-ions into solution, which resulted in complete carbonation even under inhibiting conditions. The amount of CO2 bound in the process reached 130kg (CO2)/t (CFBC OSA) and 155kg (CO2)/t (PF OSA) under favourable conditions.The growing demands on the world’s energy supply require the utilisation of local low-grade fossil fuels. In Estonia, the oil shale-based power sector is the largest CO During aqueous carbonation of the ash, lime – as the most reactive component – passes through several stages: hydration, dissolution and diffusion of Ca Previous studies ( The aim of the current study was to elaborate, in more detail, the effect of the listed parameters of the liquid and solid phases on Ca Samples of PF cyclone ash (PF OSA) and a mixture of CFBC ash from an ash silo (CFBC OSA) were used as raw materials ( The chemical composition of the samples was analysed as follows: Ca The specific surface area (SSA) was determined by the BET-method in a KELVIN 1042 sorptometer (Costech Microanalytical SC). An LA-950V2 laser scattering particle size distribution analyser (Horiba) was used to measure particle size. A Jeol JSM-8404A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for surface observations and a high-resolution SEM (Zeiss ULTRA 55) using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) (Röntec EDX XFlash 3001 detector) was used for element analysis. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded with a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα source operated at 150 As shown in earlier studies ( The mixing of non-porous PF OSA with Na As expected, in the case of NaOH solutions the presence of OH Solutions of 0.05–0.1 According to the SEM images, the product layer coating the particles was notably affected by the liquid phase composition: it was porous and permeable in the case of the UPW systems ( The SSA of the carbonation products (14 Mixing CFBC OSA with Na As expected, the higher SSA of CFBC OSA ( The CaCO During ageing pre-treatment, the hydration of PF OSA took place by air humidity, which caused ash particles to fracture and disintegrate. In turn, the SSA of the nearly non-porous PF OSA increased from 0.5 to 1.1 As we have already seen in Section The effect of the listed parameters of liquid and solid phases on Ca leaching and the following carbonation in the case of different liquid agents (actual recirculating process water as well as model solutions) and OSA samples (initial PF OSA and CFBC OSA, pre-treated/aged PF OSA) was examined. The experiments with non-porous PF OSA showed that an excess amount (⩾0.05 The utilisation of lime could be substantially enhanced by diluting the process water (to 90% in the case of UPW-based systems, resulting in 155 Comparative experiments with CFBC OSA showed that the porous structure of its particles supported the fast and full hydration of lime as well as the diffusion of Ca The authors express their gratitude to Dr. V.
