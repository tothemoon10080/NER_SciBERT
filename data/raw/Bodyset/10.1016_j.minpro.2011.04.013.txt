Vanadium leaching from carbonaceous shale using H2SiF6 as a leaching aid was investigated. The results showed that vanadium leaching efficiency could reach up to 80% when the shale was leached by 15% H2SO4 and 8% H2SiF6 at 95°C for 16h with the liquid–solid ratio of 1mL/g. In comparison, the efficiency was 80% with 20% H2SiF6 at 95°C for 8h and only 51% for 30% H2SO4 at 95°C for 24h at the same liquid–solid ratio. Samples treated by H2SO4 and H2SiF6 were characterized by XRD showing that the crystal structure of illite bearing vanadium was mostly collapsed. The satisfactory performance of H2SiF6 was attributed to the generation of HF which would easily destroy the stable structure of illite.Vanadium is of great importance in many fields for its various applications ( Vanadium in the carbonaceous shale is usually difficult to extract since most of it is stabilized in the crystal lattice by taking the place of aluminum through isomorphism ( Much attention has thus been recently paid to the direct acid leaching process as it can effectively lead to a more environmentally friendly technology. Sulfuric acid was commonly employed as the leaching aid, and in some cases, it was obvious that a simple interaction between sulfuric acid and carbonaceous shale was inefficient ( The present paper is focused on the leaching process of vanadium from carbonaceous shale using fluosilicic acid as leaching aid ( The carbonaceous shale was collected from Hunan Province, China. It was analyzed by XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) giving the composition shown in The shale was ground to − In a further step, the carbonaceous shale was leached by by-product H The dosage of chemical reagent involved was defined as the mass ratio of chemical reagent to the shale. The theory concerned with the direct acid leaching of vanadium in the carbonaceous shale is that under high temperature and acid concentration, H The effect of leaching time on the vanadium leaching efficiency was investigated (shown in Vanadium leaching efficiencies of samples leached by H Vanadium leaching efficiency decreased with increasing liquid–solid ratio ( Given that the activity of by-product H As is evident from Samples leached by H As is shown in The satisfactory performance of H The generated HF would then destroy the stable structure of illite bearing vanadium through the following reaction ( Compared with sample leached by H Vanadium leaching from carbonaceous shale using fluosilicic acid as leaching aid was conducted as there was a concern over its strong corrosiveness which would lead to a high requirement on the cost of equipment. The utilization of it as leaching aid would considerably decrease its dosage and thus lower the damage to the equipment. As seen in Based on the results obtained from the current work, the following conclusions are made: Vanadium leaching efficiency was 80% with 20% H2SiF6 at 95 No obvious difference was observed between vanadium extraction using by-product H About 80% of vanadium was extracted with 15% H In addition, this work was financially supported by
