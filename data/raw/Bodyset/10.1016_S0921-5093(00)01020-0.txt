Fe–4.5 wt.% Cu–1.75 wt.% Sn–1 wt.% MoS2 antifriction material with varying additions of Pb (0.0–12.5 wt.%) were developed by a conventional powder metallurgy route by sintering at 800, 850 and 900°C for 20–50 min and the mechanical and frictional properties of the sintered compacts were evaluated. Addition of Pb up to 7.5 wt.% improved the antifrictional and mechanical properties, whereas further addition deteriorated these properties. The lowest coefficient of friction of 0.08 at the PV value of 0.76 MPa ms−1 and the maximum hardness level of 254 VHN were obtained for the composition containing 7.5 wt.% Pb sintered at 850°C for 30 min.Sintered iron-based materials have found wide use in applications requiring low friction coefficients and wear rates in combination with high strength. The main field of application includes porous bearing technology due to the above combination of properties and the economy involved. However, the iron-based materials developed so far have not met the contrasting set of properties demanded by the recent developments in the field of machinery. Attempts to improve one property by a suitable additive have reflected adversely on some other property The powder characteristics and the compositions selected for this study are given in The elemental powders of iron, tin, copper, lead and molybdenum disulphide were weighed in proper proportions and were wet mixed in a stainless steel container in an acetone medium with a charge to ball volume ratio of 2:1 for 1 h. The mixed powders were dried and compacted at a pressure of 500 MPa to obtain cylindrical specimens of size φ10×15 mm. The compacted specimens were sintered at 800, 850 and 900°C for 20–50 min (in 10 min steps) in dry hydrogen atmosphere in a tubular furnace of φ50×φ60×150 mm. The results for optimum sintering time, i.e. 30 min, are discussed below. The sample without lead addition was sintered at the above temperature for 30 min based on a previous study at the above temperatures  The sintered samples were polished and etched with 2% nital solution and were observed under the optical microscope. The microstructures of some of the selected samples where an optimum combination of properties were observed are shown in  The sample with 7.5 wt.% Pb addition sintered at 800°C for 30 min ( Sample with 7.5 wt.% Pb addition sintered at 850°C for 30 min ( The sample 7.5 wt.% Pb addition sintered at 900°C for 30 min ( Sample with 12.5 wt.% Pb addition (      The wear rates for different wt.% Pb addition at The volumetric dimensional change observed in case of the sintered samples indicates that the addition of lead retards the dimensional growth of the basic iron–copper–tin–MoS New sintered antifriction materials with iron-copper–lead–tin–molybdenum disulphide were developed and tested for antifrictional and mechanical properties. Formation of strengthening phases and lead rich layers affect the tribological behaviour of the sintered samples. Of the samples tested optimum combination of mechanical and antifrictional properties were realised for samples with 7.5 wt.% Pb addition sintered at 850°C for 30 min. These exhibited the lowest friction coefficients of 0.13, 0.08 and 0.12 and lower wear rates of 0.7, 2.82, 6.18 E-09 mm At maximum The authors wish to acknowledge the kind support of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India where the work was performed.
