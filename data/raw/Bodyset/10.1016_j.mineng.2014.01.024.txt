Rod matrix is effectively applied in pulsating high gradient magnetic separation (PHGMS), due to its reliable operation, simple combination and resistance to mechanical entrainment. The matrix is made of huge numbers of rod elements and as a whole its configuration presents a decisive role in the operation of PHGMS, due to the fact that it has an inherent determination on the distribution of magnetic field in the matrix and on the collision efficiency of particles with the matrix, thus producing a dominant control on the dynamics of magnetic particles in the matrix and on the separation performance of PHGMS. An experimental approach entitled Slice Matrix Analysis (SMA) method is developed and attempted to optimize the configuration of rod matrix, with a cyclic pilot-scale PHGMS separator in concentrating fine hematite. It was found that the configuration has a significant effect on the separation performance of PHGMS, and the SMA method provides an effective way for the optimization of rod matrix.Cylindrical magnetic matrix (rod matrix) is effectively applied in pulsating high gradient magnetic separation (PHGMS), for the concentration of fine weakly magnetic ores such as oxidized iron ores, ilmenite, and wolframite, and for the purification of non-metallic ores such as quartz, feldspar, and kaolin, due to its reliable operation, simple combination and resistance to mechanical entrainment ( Actually, the matrix is made of huge numbers of rod elements as shown in Although the vital significance of the configuration of matrix in the PHGMS separator, deep understandings on the effect of the configuration on the PHGMS performance are disappointedly scarce. This is primarily resulted from the fact that, on the one hand, the complicated interactions of magnetic field between rod elements in the matrix results in the extreme difficulty in the theoretical calculation or simulation of magnetic force onto a magnetic particle; on the other hand, there is no effective methods available for the measurement or detection of magnetic capture to magnetic particles, within the rod matrix. In practice, a sufficiently high matrix is usually used in a PHGMS separator to achieve a high separation efficiency, as that the collision efficiency of particles with matrix approaches unity after the height of matrix reaches a certain level; this, however, results in the costly magnetic separators and in the reduced magnetic inductions available in the separators ( An experimental approach entitled Slice Matrix Analysis (SMA) is developed and attempted to optimize the configuration of rod matrix. In the present work, the effects of key configurational parameters of rod matrix, i.e., arrangement of rod elements, layer of rod elements and spacing between elements in a single layer of rod elements, on the separation performance of PHGMS in concentrating fine hematite are investigated using the SMA method. In the use of the SMA method as illustrated in The operational procedure of the SMA method is as follows. Rod elements are arranged and consolidated into a number of slice matrices of single layer with ethoxyline resin and curing agent, in a matrix mold of stainless steel. These slice matrices are combinatorially optimized and formed into a series of rod matrices of different configurations with a detachable device, as shown in With the SAM method, an optimum rod matrix may be determined through PHGMS tests, and exclusively designed for a given material. The investigations are carried out through a cyclic pilot-scale PHGMS separator, as schematically illustrated in The most essential feature in PHGMS differing from other HGMS methods is the pulsation of slurry in the separating zone to loose particles, which, as shown in A very fine hematite was used as test material in the present investigation. The material assays 33.25% Fe and the dominant gangues in the material are quartz and plagioclase. The material is less than 0.074 The material was fully mixed in a stir beaker at around 10% solid concentration and then fed to the SLon-100 cyclic pilot-scale PHGMS separator within 10 The SMA method was firstly used to determine the arrangement of rod elements, with a matrix of 3 From It can be seen from As mentioned in the afore investigation, the collision efficiency of particles with matrix increases with increase in the layer of rod elements and improves the PHGMS performance. Thus, the effect of the layer on the performance is particularly investigated for the material, through a rod matrix of 2 It can be seen from It is easy to understand that the critical layer of rod elements is dependent on the configuration of matrix such as diameter and arrangement of rod elements, and spacing between rod elements, and on the operating conditions such as magnetic induction, feed volume flow rate, and pulsating intensity. As discussed above, the spacing between rod elements in a single layer and the spacing between layers of rod matrix have their effects on the separation performance of PHGMS. Therefore, the effect of the spacing between 2 From It is clear that this critical spacing, where the recovery begins to decrease, is also dependent on the configuration of matrix and on the operating conditions, for a given material. The key parameters in the configuration of rod matrix, such as diameter and arrangement of rod elements, and layer of rod elements and spacing between rod elements, have significant effects on the separation performance of PHGMS, and the SAM method, as an experimental approach, has provided an effective way for the optimization of rod matrix and may be used to improve the PHGMS performance.
