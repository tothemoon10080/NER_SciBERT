The mineral dressing methods used for processing vein-type mineralizations depend on the valuable mineral grades, their nature, grain-size, superficial properties and physico-chemical characteristics. In developing the proper treatment process the production of rare metals (ilmenite, monazite, molybdenite) and sulphytes (pyrite) concentrates was followed. The process developed for the vein-ore is a serie of mineral dressing methods (raw material preparation, molybdenite and ilmenite concentration) which comprises the following operations: molybdenite flotation, pyrite flotation, hydrogravitational separation on spirals and shaking tables, electric and magnetic separation.
