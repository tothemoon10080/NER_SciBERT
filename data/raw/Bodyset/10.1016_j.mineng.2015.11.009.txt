Textural information or information about the presence of porosity, different material or mineral types and their structural arrangement in iron ore is crucial for understanding, predicting and optimising downstream processing performance. Ores with the same chemical and mineral composition may behave very differently during downstream processing due to differences in textural components.
                  To produce a textural description of iron ore, it is preferable to use an automated system to avoid subjectivity and to collect additional information about mineral abundance, liberation and association. CSIRO created a unique dedicated optical image analysis software package for automated textural classification and characterisation of different minerals, sinters and coke. This software, called Mineral4/Recognition4, has been used extensively to collect data for this article.
                  Four case studies of CSIRO research are presented to demonstrate the importance of textural information.

The last example is an experimental study of ultrasonic treatment of hematitic–goethitic iron ore fines. It demonstrates how the resulting breakdown or deagglomeration of different particles, and the mineral deportment, can be better understood when textural information is also considered. Three levels of ore characterisation detail are applicable to understanding, modelling and predicting the downstream processing performance of iron ore. At the first (the simplest) level, only the chemical composition of the bulk ore or specific size fractions is considered. Such an approach is very basic and does not explain many phenomena about a given process. At the second level of ore characterisation, mineral composition is taken into account. This approach can give a much better understanding of processing behaviour, especially if mineral liberation and association information is available. However, ores that have analogous mineralogy can behave differently during the same processing. For example, consider two types of pure hematite with the same percentage of porosity, where in one case, the porosity presents as microporosity distributed throughout the whole particle, while in the other case, the porosity presents as macroporosity – i.e. large separate pores. The physical hardness and breakage characteristics of these two types of hematite will be significantly different, as well as their moisture absorption characteristics, behaviour during granulation and reactivity during sintering. Therefore, to understand the peculiarities of specific processes and to predict the results of particular processes adequately for a large range of ores and conditions, a third level of characterisation is needed which considers textural ore information ( The only well-known software package which performs automated textural characterisation of iron ore is the Mineral4/Recognition4 automated optical image analysis (OIA) package created by CSIRO ( Manual point counting has several deficiencies compared to an automated textural characterisation system such as Mineral4/Recognition4. The main problems are as follows: Even experienced mineralogists are subjective, so the results of point counting for textural classification may depend on external and internal factors. The results can differ significantly between different mineralogists or by the same mineralogist at different times. On the other hand, automated classification will always reproduce the same result for a given set of particles if the classification scheme and setup are consistent. Manual point counting is limited by human capability to identify different minerals with close (but different) reflectivity while modern automated optical image analysis can recognise more than 16,000 different shades of the same colour. The number of particles that can be characterised manually in a given amount of time is very limited – maximum 1000–2000. This means that particle statistics for minor textural classes will be statistically insignificant. Automated image analysis is faster and more efficient in this respect. In some studies, up to 200,000 particles have been characterised by Mineral4/Recognition4, providing robust statistics for minor textural components. The data obtained by manual point counting contains only information on the particle abundance of different texture classes, while automated OIA gives comprehensive sample characterisation information including mineral abundances, liberation and association data, calculated chemical composition and densities for all the measured particle sections in a polished block or for any selected subgroup of particles. There are two major automated imaging techniques used for characterisation of iron ores and capable of providing mineral abundances, mineral associations, mineral liberation and grain size distributions: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) ( Another important advantage of optical systems is their better identification of different iron oxides and oxyhydroxides. SEM systems struggle to distinguish between minerals with close chemical composition, or oxides and oxyhydroxides of the same major elements, which in the case of iron ores are hematite, kenomagnetite, maghemite, hydrohematite and different types of goethite. OIA systems can even identify zones with different oxidation and hydration for the same non-stoichiometric phase, due to the differences in reflectivity. Also, optical systems generally provide much higher resolution than SEM methods. The theoretical limit of resolution for OIA systems is 0.20 Finally, OIA provides better porosity identification. It reliably identifies pores larger than 0.5 The major drawback of OIA compared with SEM methods is the distinguishing between different minerals that have similar reflectivities. It should be noted that the latest Mineral4/Recogntion4 OIA package by CSIRO provides significantly improved mineral identification and can discriminate minerals with significantly overlapping reflectivities ( Another drawback of OIA is identification of non-opaque minerals, especially those with reflectivities close to that of epoxy resin (e.g. quartz). It should be noted that some non-opaque minerals such as apatite, amphibole, calcite and garnet can now be automatically identified following technical improvements in camera sensitivities ( However, considering the previous discussion about the automated identification of microporosity and analysis resolution, the capability for textural classification of iron ore and iron ore sinter by SEM-based systems such as QEMSCAN and MLA is limited. There appear to be no reports in the open literature of such systems having the capability for automated classification and characterisation of iron ores by texture. Both of these systems can, however, provide association analysis and have the capability to create and characterise liberation classes. Classification by liberation classes is the most frequently used method of sample characterisation or classification for modelling and process prediction ( The central idea behind the development of a textural classification approach is that the particles allocated to each textural class should have similar processing behaviour and not necessarily that the abundance of particular minerals should be within a particular range (as is required in liberation classification). Typically, the number of major textural types found in a single iron ore is between 15 and 30 (up to 100 classes can be allocated using Recognition4), so particle classification by textural type ( It is important to note that all the textural information about the sample is preserved when modelling and predicting downstream processes using ore texture classification. The preserved textural information can be used at any stage of the modelling, for example, after modelling hydrocyclone performance and subsequent magnetic separation, the resulting textural information can then be used for modelling sintering behaviour or direct reduction. The aim of this article is to show that ore texture is an important characteristic of iron ore and to emphasise the importance of textural information for understanding, predicting and optimising downstream processing. Four case studies, in which textural information was used to analyse the performance of different iron ore process operations, are presented below. The ability to operate with textural information was critical in all of these cases and provided a better prediction of process performance or a deeper understanding of the unit processes. The first case study shows that the extent of particle assimilation in the melt during sintering tests depends on the particle texture, and the reactivity of different textures can be very different despite having similar mineral and chemical composition. The assimilation results in all four experiments were completely different even though the mineralogy was identical (pure hematite) in the first three experiments and it was slightly different in the fourth experiment. In the second case study, the importance of textural information of initial iron ore blend for modelling the properties of final sinter is discussed. It is clearly shown that the prediction of sinter properties improved significantly after textural information was added to a large set of variables that were initially used for modelling without textural information. The third case study is the application of textural classification to create a “virtual feed” which was used for modelling and optimisation of hydrocyclone performance. Such a classification allowed particle feed information to be grouped into textural classes with similar texture, mineral composition, porosity and density, which in turn resulted in successfully predicting the hydrocyclone desliming process. The modelling enabled size distribution, mineral and textural data for the underflow and overflow products to be calculated. Such information output can be used to model subsequent units or stages in a beneficiation circuit. The last case study is an experimental study of stirring and ultrasonic treatment of hematitic–goethitic iron ore fines. Textural information obtained by OIA helped understand the effect that ultrasonic treatment had on different iron ore minerals and textures. A compact-firing sinter technique has been developed (   The high reactivity of this texture can be explained with the help of imaging at higher magnifications than those used for the photomicrographs in Quite often hematite and hydrohematite are classified as one mineral class (sometimes together with kenomagnetite, magnetite and maghemite) during liberation classification. However, the examples presented above show that the reactivity of different textures can be very different, even when the mineral and chemical compositions are similar, so that each of these textural components should be considered as different (discrete) textural classes. Sinter production is one of the most important operations in modern ironmaking. Sinter is the main iron-bearing feed to the blast furnace and can constitute up to 70–85% of the total ferrous burden. Sinter quality is a key factor for stable blast furnace operation, so the sinter needs to meet physical and chemical specifications such as strength, reducibility and composition. Physical pilot-scale sinter runs are costly and require large amounts of raw materials, so it is very advantageous to be capable of developing theoretically optimal blends from given ores, and to predict the sintering performance of particular blends. There are two major mathematical approaches that can be used to understand and predict sintering processes, namely, phenomenological and empirical modelling. In phenomenological mathematical modelling all processes that take place during sintering, including reactions, heat and mass transfer, shrinkage and swelling, etc., are modelled with the help of mathematical expressions and fulfilled as a numerical scheme ( However, empirical modelling, which is based entirely on measured data, can take into account the combined and interactive effects of different parameters of the initial mixture and sintering conditions. The effect of raw material properties on melt formation and sinter properties has been studied by Extensive studies of the sintering process at CSIRO have shown that sinter properties have a significant dependence on the textural composition of iron ores ( Further it became apparent that more comprehensive textural characterisation ( Modelling of TI without considering textural information is shown in The modelling in Modelling of TI considering textural information is shown in  After modelling Productivity using the same dataset without textural information (see It should be noted that the textural classification directly or indirectly included mineral abundance information, while modelling without textural information did not include any mineral composition information. Unfortunately, there was not enough mineral information to include it in the modelling separately from structural data; however, it would be a future option to better understand separate inputs by mineral and structural information. All these data clearly show that the inclusion of textural parameters in the model improved the modelling and reduced the unexplained part of the variation significantly. Analysis of textural factors can lead to a better understanding of the effect of different textures on certain sinter characteristics. During hydrocycloning of iron ore fines, smaller or less-dense particles are preferentially recovered to the overflow stream, while larger or denser particles are preferentially recovered to the underflow stream. Hematitic or goethitic ores usually have higher amounts of undesirable elements like alumina, silica and phosphorous in the very fine size fractions (slimes) (  The flowsheet of the multi-component hydrocyclone modelling approach used by Examples of predicted recoveries to the underflow for several ore textural classes in selected size fractions are given in The availability of calculated average mineral composition and iron grade data for every ore texture class in the hydrocyclone feed, and the recoveries of each class to the underflow and overflow, enabled the mineral composition and iron content of the resulting underflow and overflow streams to be calculated. When creating a textural classification scheme, the variability of density and mineral composition within each defined textural class should be as low as possible to reduce the errors in the modelling. However, if such variability is too narrow, the number of classes required to capture all the particles may be very large and the modelling will be substantially more complex. The calculated variability analysis for two textural groups, “Dense Hematite (Very Hard)” and “Martite–Goethite (Hard)”, in the −106  In contrast with textural classification, liberation classification can result in much greater density variance within each class. For example, It is obvious that particles with such large differences in porosity and density will behave differently during processing, which can significantly affect the modelling results for many downstream processes. Note that if the liberation classification criteria were to be based on not only the presence of hematite but also on the presence of other minerals and porosity, at least 5 classes with different porosity, rather than one class, would be required if 10% class increments were chosen. Further, some of these classes will exhibit poor statistics due to insufficient particles, for example, a class with an additional condition that porosity should be between 30% and 40% would capture only two particles, while a class with a condition that porosity should be more than 40% would capture only one particle. Particles in the “Martite–Goethite (Hard)” textural class (see In contrast, the variability table for the liberation class “Hematite <10 If liberation classification were chosen, additional liberation criteria for minerals other than hematite should be applied, which, as discussed earlier, would create a lot of classes with pure representation. Textural classification, on the other hand, creates significantly fewer classes, while particles in each class have similar texture/structure, mineralogy, density and porosity, and because of this, they behave similarly during processing. The hydrocyclone modelling results agreed closely with the experimental results (see CSIRO has been researching a novel process of iron ore fines ultrasonic treatment and several sets of experiments have been performed in this area ( For low-grade ores, the softer components in the particles, which consist of lower grade minerals such as ochreous goethite and kaolinite, are the most affected by ultrasonication. To predict ultrasonic treatment reliably, it is important to understand the effect of sonication duration and power on different iron ore textures. In these experiments a fine iron ore sample (−212 To better understand the effect of stirring and ultrasonication on ore fines, size classification was carried out on the initial feed (“Feed Head”) and product of the “Ultrasound 3” experiment, and the three coarsest size fractions (−106 As expected, with the exception of “Goethite–Martite (Hard)”, the general trend after ultrasonic treatment was that the amount of softer textures in the coarser size fractions decreased much more than the amount of harder textures did. The substantial decrease in the amount of the “Goethite–Martite (Hard)” textural class in the −212 In the case study above, textural classification and its analysis has led to a better understanding of the disintegration mechanisms during ultrasonic treatment of iron ore fines and provided a possible approach for modelling the phenomena. The importance of automated ore texture classification and the availability of textural information for predicting or better understanding downstream processing has been demonstrated in four case studies which showed different mineral processing treatments and applications performed by CSIRO, namely, compact sintering, pot grate sintering modelling, hydrocyclone modelling and ultrasonic treatment of iron ore. In all case studies, textural information played a key role and allowed analysis or prediction to be performed in more detail than would be possible without such information. The key element for success using textural classification is that particles within the same textural class have similar texture or structure, mineralogy, porosity, and density, so that they can be expected to behave consistently and predictably during processing. Therefore, ore texture classes can be used as basic units for building virtual models of feed ores for modelling a variety of downstream processes. Knowledge about particle abundances in different textural classes and about how these classes behave gives a solid basis for modelling or understanding how the whole ensemble will behave during particular processes. The compact sintering study presented in this paper demonstrated that particles with significant abundance of hydrohematite can have very high reactivity and they should therefore be allocated to a different textural class than purely hematitic particles. It was also demonstrated that even purely hematitic particles could react or assimilate to significantly different extents if they had variable porosity (in quantity and structure), so they should also be allocated to different textural classes depending on the nature of the porosity. Comparisons between textural and liberation classification have demonstrated that liberation classification may classify particles that have very different properties and processing behaviours, such as porous and dense hematite, into the same liberation class. It also has been shown that liberation classification may create too many classes with pure mineral representation, which may create considerable problems for reliable prediction and modelling. On the other hand, textural classification provides a good foundation for reliable multi-component modelling of hydrocyclone performance. The sinter modelling case study showed that the availability of textural information can improve such modelling substantially, and that there is a direct correlation between ore textural composition and key sinter properties. The case study on ultrasonic treatment of iron ore demonstrated that the textural classification approach led to a deeper understanding of the phenomena and it was shown that the disintegration of different textural classes depends mainly on the mineralogy and texture of these classes and not purely on the actual hardness of the textural classes. It also has been discussed that utilisation of proper automated optical image analysis has significant advantages compared with manual point counting and can provide reliable comprehensive textural characterisation. In conclusion, the described case studies demonstrated that the use of textural classification could largely improve, and provide new perspectives to, the study and understanding of downstream processing of iron ore, iron ore sinter and potentially other commodities.
