Uncertainty is an important phenomenon in mine project evaluation. Recovery, grade, commodity price, discount rate, and operating costs are highly uncertain variables. Given that uncertainties cannot be fully eliminated, mining companies focus on assessing risks associated with uncertainties. Mining projects generally encompass 10–50 years, and the evolution of uncertain parameters over this long time period is also uncertain. Since the future cannot be predicted, one way to deal with uncertainty is to create probable images of reality through simulation. When simulating multiple uncertain variables over time, an immediate problem is how to handle correlations among uncertain variables because the correlations themselves are uncertain variables. In this paper, the Jacobi process is used to treat the correlations stochastically. A case study was implemented in a mine project evaluation (e.g., net present value and option pricing), in which the gold prices and the US interest rates were considered as correlated uncertain variables. The correlations among uncertain variables significantly affected the value of the mining project. The Jacobi process can be used as a tool to increase the performance of mine project evaluation.In the mining industry, uncertainties derive from two main sources: data availability and unknown future occurrences. Data about the orebody (e.g., grade, geologic structures) are usually sparse; many decisions regarding a mining operation are made using simulations or estimations generated from sparse data. On the other hand, realizations of many financial variables (e.g., price, cost, and interest rate) depend on a series of unknown future events. In a different form, these uncertainties can also be classified as space- (data sparsity) and time- (unknown future) dependent uncertainties. Given that mining is a high-risk business, orebody valuation is a comprehensive process including scoping, pre-feasibility, and feasibility stages. Addressing uncertainties starts with geostatistical simulation for space-dependent variables ( Probable images of the uncertain phenomena are generated through simulation and used for risk management because uncertainties cannot be fully eliminated. Risk management has become a standard approach that helps decision-makers to understand the magnitude of the risk they undertake. For financial variables, many approaches have been developed for risk management, for example, Monte-Carlo simulation, value-at-risk, decision trees, scenario analysis, and various stochastic process ( Implementing most risk management approaches requires quantifying correlations between uncertain variables (e.g., prices vs. costs, prices vs. discount rates, and exchange rates vs. operating costs). In most cases, these correlations are taken as a constant value, which may misrepresent the risk: many correlations between financial variables vary over time. In addition, these correlations are not necessarily linear. In fact, the evolution of correlations over time can vary; thus, the correlations themselves can be taken as uncertain variables. Commodity prices and interest rates are essential components in mining business, and there is a meaningful correlation between them. However, the correlation structure can be very complex. As seen in When the interest rates change, the gold prices change. However, this may be a different magnitude and direction. Therefore, as can be seen from A stochastic method can yield a probable realization of an uncertain parameter for a given period. Another widely used stochastic method is based on the Mean-Reverting Model (MRM), for example, the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and the Vasicek model (a version of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). MRM is more realistic to model commodity prices, especially for the long-term model ( However, the MRM has drawbacks for use in mine project evaluation. It is not only difficult to determine the length of commodity prices returns to the mean value, but it also does not allow exponential price jumps ( The Jacobi process is a stochastic process that is used to simulate the correlation coefficient ( The Jacobi process is frequently used in financial analysis, but in mining industries, its use is limited. The Jacobi process has a potency to add value in the mine project evaluation by considering the changes more than one uncertain variable at the same time and are correlated. The application of discounted cash flow (DCF) and option pricing techniques in the mining industries is a common practice. Thus, incorporating the Jacobi process in mine project evaluation technique is the gap that we try to fill. Compared to classic DCF that applies the static value of uncertain variables and only uses one single number to describe the risk (i.e., discount rate), DCF incorporated with the Jacobi process captures uncertainties more realistic ( In this paper, the correlations between gold metal prices and the interest rates are reproduced through the Jacobi process. The aim is to show how the Jacobi process can add value to mine evaluation based on net present value (NPV) and Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) methods. NPV calculation is based on discounting back expected cash flows with a certain discount rate to the present value (PV), accumulating them, and then deducting the capital cost. As an alternative, option pricing can be used for valuing a project. Option pricing is adapted from the financial discipline to value natural resources. The similarity is that the option (i.e., call option) represents a right—not an obligation—of a company to exercise the project (buy the stocks/assets) in a particular timeframe ( First, historical gold prices (in US dollars) ( The second step was to estimate the Jacobi process parameters based on the historical correlation coefficients of 12-month between the random variables. The ordinary least square (OLS) estimator, combined with autoregressive first order (AR-1) model ( The third step was to simulate the correlation coefficient with the Jacobi process from the parameters produced from the previous step. The Jacobi process can reproduce the correlation coefficient between gold prices and interest rates if ( It is in [–1, 1]. Simulation parameters are available to calibrate the model to market data. It reverts around the mean. The probability mass in −1 and 1 is close to zero. In order to satisfy point a above, where Equation Furthermore, applying Equation The fourth step is the simulation of gold prices and interest rates on the basis of the correlation coefficient between them (unlike the first step, where they were simulated independently). The gold prices are used to calculate expected cash flows by deducting from the revenue the total cost, capital expenditures, and liabilities (e.g., taxes and royalties). The revenue calculation used in this paper is given in Equation On the other hand, the interest rate is highly related to the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow (DCF). The discount rate describes the future risk or the hurdle rate for a project to be considered as investable or economically attractive ( In the fifth step, the NPV calculation, expected cash flows are discounted back dynamically to the PV and then accumulated. The term “dynamic” refers to the application of the different pairs of the gold prices and discount rates in the annual revenue, and PV calculation is given as in Equation In addition, the Jacobi process can be incorporated into option pricing using the BSM model, but the BSM model must be modified (             The objective of this case study was to show the application of the Jacobi process used in a mining project evaluation using a historical series (1968–2018) of gold prices and interest rates data. The gold prices are obtained from ICE Benchmark Administration ( After the data were gathered, the Pearson's correlation coefficient ( Simultaneously, to perform the Jacobi process, gold prices and interest rates were initially simulated by performing GBM (Equation The results fit into Normal distributions for both the gold prices and interest rates. The GBM and CIR simulations do not necessarily determine the gold price and interest rate scenario, but merely determine the probability distribution parameter. The probability distribution parameter, together with Pearson's correlation coefficient, was then used to simulate gold prices and interest rates. The parameters for each distribution are presented in In January 2018, the correlation coefficient was 0.67 (mean 0.24, volatility 0.56) and the mean reversion rate ( To reproduce correlation coefficients stochastically, the Jacobi process was conducted using Equation The reproduction was repeated 100 times; thus, 100 scenarios are produced, which simulate 100 possibilities of the correlation coefficient in the following year. The correlation coefficient reproduction for simulation 1 is shown in  The gold prices and interest rates were then simulated based on Normal distributions, and the correlations between them. The probability distribution parameters in The predicted gold prices were then used to calculate the expected cash flows through Equation Assumptions: Company capital, 60% debt and 40% equity. The loan interest rate is 3.75% per year for 9 years. Mining lifetime is 9 years. There is 1 year lag from the decision made until the first production. Incorporating these assumptions, mining project evaluation can then proceed using DCF (Scenario 1 is presented in For 100 scenarios, the NPV ranged from –$169,010,971 to $283,971,141. This broad range is driven by highly volatilities value of the gold price (i.e., GBM parameter) and interest rate (i.e., CIR parameter), resulting in a wide range of simulated gold price (i.e., $726–$2358) and interest rate (i.e., 2.23%–9.68%). Assuming lower volatilities of the gold price and interest rate will tighten the range. The NPVs were fitted to a normal distribution to see the probability distribution of the viable project and estimate the mean project value ( To benchmark the proposed approach, the project valuation based on constant correlation was conducted. Initially, the correlation coefficient was calculated for the time series of 1968–2017 and found as −0.46. The mining industry involves significant financial and technical uncertainties, which add risks to the projects. Monte-Carlo simulations and stochastic diffusion processes are widely used for managing risks in the industry. Many risk management approaches require the reproduction of correlation among variables. In many cases, the correlation itself can be a random variable. The Jacobi process generates multiple probable realizations of the correlations. In this paper, we show how the Jacobi process can be used in mine project evaluation. In the case study given in this paper, the correlation between real gold prices and the US interest rates was reproduced through the Jacobi process. The multiple realizations were used in a risk analysis of a mining project. The project had a mean NPV of $81,191,561 and a standard deviation of $87,281,644, with an 82.4% chance that the project would be profitable. Future work will address the copula in which the correlation between random variables has varied over the project duration. Furthermore, Granger Casualty Test will be implemented to understand the nature of the association between the variables in detail. This paper is based on the research implemented by Aldin Ardian.
