The present work is focused on the preparation of Fe nanorods by the chemical reduction of FeCl3 (aq) using NaBH4 in the presence of glycerol as template followed by annealing of the product at 500°C in the presence of H2 gas flow. Subsequently, its surface has been modified by silica followed by silver nanoparticles to form silica coated Fe (Fe@SiO2) and Ag encapsulated Fe@SiO2 nanostructure employing the Stöber method and silver mirror reaction respectively. XRD pattern of the products confirmed the formation of bcc phase of iron and fcc phase of silver, though silica remained amorphous. FESEM images established the growth of iron nanorods from the annealed product and also formation of silica and silver coating on its surface. The appearance of the characteristics bands in FTIR confirmed the presence of SiO2 on the Fe surface. Magnetic measurements at room temperature indicated the ferromagnetic behavior of as prepared iron nanorods, Fe@SiO2 and silver encapsulated Fe@SiO2 nanostructures. All the samples exhibited strong microwave absorption property in the high frequency range (10GHz), though it is superior for Ag encapsulated Fe@SiO2 (−14.7dB) compared with Fe@SiO2 (−9.7dB) nanostructures of the same thickness. The synthesized Ag encapsulated Fe@SiO2 nanostructure also exhibited the SERS phenomena, which is useful in the detection of the carcinogenic dye crystal violet (CV) upto the concentration of 10−10
                     M. All these findings clearly demonstrate that the Ag encapsulated Fe@SiO2 nanostructure could efficiently be used in the environmental remediation.The development of materials for the electromagnetic (EM) wave shielding and/or absorption has received a considerable amount of attention in the recent years due to the rapid growth of wireless communication (mobile phones), information technology, high frequency circuit devices (in the GHz range) and radar stealth systems etc. ( A series of iron nanostructures with different morphologies, including superfine nanoparticles (NPs) ( According to Sun and Nava Motivated by these, the present work is focused on the synthesis of Fe nanorods, silica coated Fe (Fe@SiO Ferric Chloride anhydrous (FeCl Iron nanoparticles (amorphous) were prepared according to the reported procedure ( The annealed product (Fe) was used as the core material to deposit silica according to the modified Stöber method to form Fe (core)/SiO In order to further modify the surface of Fe@SiO Crystal violet (CV), also known as gentian violet, is often used as an anti-fungal additive in the production of feed to improve the health and survival of living body. However, it gives side-effects by biotransformation after entering into the human or animal body and is carcinogenic, teratogenic, mutagenic, and so on ( 1 X-ray diffraction of the as prepared samples were carried out on D8 Advance diffractometer, Bruker, Germany, with Co K The phase purity and crystalline nature of the borohydrate reduction product annealed at 500  The corresponding EDX spectra of the products are displayed in The surface morphologies of the products obtained by borohydride reduction of FeCl TEM and HRTEM studies of the borohydride reduction product annealed at 500 The change in the morphology of the products, if any, has also been studied as a function of glycerol concentration in glycerol–water (v/v) mixture and the FESEM images of the corresponding annealed products (500 FTIR spectra of Fe nanorods, Fe@SiO Thermal analysis of Fe, Fe@SiO  The room temperature microwave absorption property of Fe nanorods corresponding to the thicknesses of 0.74 and 0.83 The frequency dependence of the relative complex permeability ( The variation of the real part (  The concentration dependence of crystal violet has been determined from logarithmic plots of the signal intensities at 1588 Iron nanorods (length ~100 Financial assistance from the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
