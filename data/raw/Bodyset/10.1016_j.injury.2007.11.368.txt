Proximal ulnar fractures may be difficult to treat and may result in chronic instability, non-union heterotrophic ossification, synostosis, stiffness and post-traumatic arthritis. The aim of this study is to study success of treatment in achieving stable reduction and early rehabilitation. Between December 2003 and January 2007 47 patients (49 elbows) which had sustained 21.A3 and 21.C3 fractures were identified and retrospectively studied. There were two broad groups of patients. Young males following high-energy injuries (average age Eighteen patients had incongruent reduction. Eighteen patients had complications of the treatment. There were seven cases of non-union, one case of loss of fixation, three cases of heterotrophic ossification, three cases of synostosis, one case of deep infection and five complications resulting from radial head fractures. There was no relationship between loss of fixation and plating techniques. There was a direct relation between comminution and post fixation incongruency. Heterotrophic ossification was associated with comminution, radial head fracture, monteggia fracture-dislocation and non-union. Radio-ulnar synostosis was associated with comminution of the ulnar fracture. In conclusion, the main predictor of poor outcome is the comminution of proximal ulnar fracture and ability to achieve congruous fracture fixation.
