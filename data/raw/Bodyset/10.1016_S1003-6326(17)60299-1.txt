The feasibility and kinetics of lead recovery from the slag of traditional lead melting furnace using chloride leaching were investigated. The effects of operating parameters such as leaching time, NaCl concentration, FeCl3 concentration, liquid/solid ratio, stirring rate, temperature, and particle size on recovery of lead were studied and the optimization was done through the response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD) model. The optimum conditions were achieved as follows: leaching time 60 min, 80 °C, stirring rate 800 r/min, NaCl concentration 200 g/L, FeCl3 concentration 80 g/L, liquid/solid ratio 16, and particle size less than 106 μm. More than 96% of lead was effectively recovered in optimum condition. Based on analysis of variance, the reaction temperature, liquid/solid ratio, and NaCl concentration were determined as the most effective parameters on leaching process, respectively. Kinetics study revealed that chloride leaching of galena is a first-order reaction and the diffusion through solid reaction product and chemical reaction control the mechanism. The activation energy of chloride leaching of galena was determined using Arrhenius model as 27.9 kJ/mol.
