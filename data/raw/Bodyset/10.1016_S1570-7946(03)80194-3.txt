A model for estimation of the burden distribution is developed for blast furnaces with bell-type charging equipment. The model uses a radar measurement of the local burden level, combined with equations for the dump volume and the repose angle of the charged material, which are solved by least squares. The burden surface is described by two half lines intersecting in the point where the trajectory of the falling dump hits the burden surface. The model is tuned and applied to data from a Finnish blast furnace, and the results are in general agreement with findings reported in the literature.
