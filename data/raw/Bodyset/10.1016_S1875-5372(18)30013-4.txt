WC-Ni composite powders were prepared by electroless plating with a simplified chemical method. The morphologies of original, pretreated WC powder, WC-Ni powders and surface morphologies, fracture surface and composition of WC-Ni composites were analyzed by FE-SEM. EDS and XRD. Different contents of Ni doped WC composites were prepared after sintering. The relative density and properties of the WC-Ni composites were also discussed. Results show that the WC powder is uniformly covered by Ni particles. After powder metallurgy (PM), the fabricated composites perform a well-dispersed surface morphology. With the increasing of Ni content bending strength enhances without reducing hardness. Trans-granular fractures are observed on the fracture surface of the WC-Ni composites.
