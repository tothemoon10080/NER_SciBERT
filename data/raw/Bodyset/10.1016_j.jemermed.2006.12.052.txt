This study from Scotland identifies factors that may predict instability of distal radial fractures during initial presentation. Four thousand distal radial fractures were prospectively recorded over a 5.5-year period. For each subject, multiple variables were analyzed including the age, gender, level of physical independence, mechanism of injury, and various orthopedic fracture classifications. These variables were then grouped into the level of severity of the fracture as early instability, late instability, malunion, and carpal malalignment. Such classifications were defined by strict radiographic parameters, including dorsal angulation, ulnar variance, and anatomical alignment of the radius and capitate bones. Patients were evaluated both clinically and radiographically at initial presentation as well as at 1 and 6 weeks post-injury. Using regression analysis, statistically significant variables were identified for prediction of malunion, and early and late fracture instability. Age, presence of comminution, and the initial dorsal angle and ulnar variance were all statistically significant factors in prediction of early instability for fractures that were minimally displaced at presentation. Ultimately, mathematical formulas were developed using these significant independent variables to create a probability of fracture instability. Although not yet validated, this study is a first in its attempt to identify independent variables that affect the radiographic outcome in distal radial fractures. The formulas derived from this study may prove to be useful tools in determining conservative vs. surgical management of these fractures during emergency department evaluation.
