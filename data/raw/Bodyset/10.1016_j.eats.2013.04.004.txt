Tibial intercondylar eminence fractures that are displaced and non-reducible require open or arthroscopically assisted repair. Ideally, fracture reduction and fixation would be performed with a technique that has low morbidity, allows easy visualization and reduction, provides firm fixation, does not violate the proximal tibial physis, avoids metal hardware, and does not require a second procedure for implant removal. The suture bridge technique, used in the shoulder for rotator cuff tears and greater tuberosity fracture repair, has the ability to produce high contact pressures with rigid fixation. We describe an all-inside and all-epiphyseal arthroscopic suture bridge technique for tibial intercondylar eminence fracture repair performed with PushLock anchors (Arthrex, Naples, FL). One or 2 anchors preloaded with No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex) are placed in the posterior fracture bed, followed by fracture reduction. The suture limbs are shuttled through and around the anterior cruciate ligament and over the fracture fragment in crossing fashion and are secured by use of additional anchors placed at the anteromedial and anterolateral fracture margin. The anchors are placed obliquely to avoid the proximal tibial physis in the pediatric population. Anatomic reduction and secure fixation allow more aggressive rehabilitation and faster restoration of joint function.Tibial intercondylar eminence (spine) fractures occur most frequently in the pediatric and early adolescent ages but can also be seen in the adult population. In the pediatric population with open physes, this fracture is the equivalent of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear with the injury occurring at the relatively weak, incompletely ossified tibial epiphysis. The original classification system described by Meyers and McKeever Nondisplaced (type I) and mildly displaced type II fractures that are amenable to closed reduction are treated with cast immobilization. Displaced fractures frequently cannot achieve adequate closed reduction because of interposition of the intermeniscal ligament between the avulsed fragment and the tibial bony bed. Fracture displacement and disruption of the normal ACL tibial attachment block full knee extension and can cause symptoms of functional instability. Surgical fixation of tibial eminence fractures is indicated for type III and IV injuries, type II fractures that cannot be adequately reduced, and late displacement of type I injuries. The surgical treatment options have evolved from open techniques using wires, screws, or sutures to arthroscopic techniques, with the most common being arthroscopic screw or suture fixation. The use of suture bridge fixation for the repair of both bony and soft-tissue pathology has been extensively studied, primarily in the shoulder for repair of the rotator cuff and greater tuberosity fractures. Arthroscopic tibial intercondylar eminence fracture repair is performed for patients with indicated fractures—types III and IV, non-reducible type II, and late displacement of type I injuries—after informed consent is received (Video 1). The surgery is performed as an outpatient procedure with the patient under general anesthesia. The patient is placed in the supine position. A standard setup with a lateral post or arthroscopic leg holder that allows for knee flexion is used. Use of lower limb exsanguination and a pneumatic tourniquet is useful but is left to the discretion of the surgeon. Standard anterolateral and anteromedial working portals are established, hemarthrosis is evacuated, and a complete diagnostic arthroscopy is performed. Treatment for associated meniscus tears or articular cartilage injury is addressed before the intercondylar eminence fracture. The ACL is carefully inspected because associated partial intrasubstance tears are not atypical and may result in plastic deformation with ligament laxity. The fracture fragment is probed and elevated, with the surgeon inspecting for comminution that might influence reduction or fixation. The tibia fracture bed is cleared of hematoma and fracture debris. If necessary, partial synovectomy, limited fat pad debridement, and placement of a traction suture around the intermeniscal ligament are performed to allow adequate visualization and facilitate reduction of the avulsed bone fragment into its bed ( Fracture fixation is performed with a polyetheretherketone or bioabsorbable 3.5-mm PushLock anchor (Arthrex) preloaded with 1 or 2 strands of No. 2 FiberWire (Arthrex). Accessory high anteromedial and anterolateral portals are created and positioned to allow access to the entire tibia fracture bed at a sufficient angle to keep the awl and anchors within the epiphysis, while avoiding scuffing of the femoral condyle articular cartilage. Disposable cannulas are used. For type III and IV fractures, the 3.5-mm PushLock awl is used to create a pilot hole at the edge of the posterior fracture bed and 1 double-loaded anchor or 2 single-loaded anchors are placed. A suture retriever is then used to shuttle the sutures in a crossing pattern through and around the ACL adjacent to the fracture fragment. The awl is again used to create pilot holes in the anteromedial and anterolateral tibia fracture bed. The fracture fragment is reduced and held in position with a probe. The 3.5-mm PushLock anchors are loaded with the free ends of the suture and inserted to create the suture bridge. If the fracture has an intact posterior hinge (type II), the posterior anchor step is omitted. Instead, a suture shuttle device is used to pass 2 No. 2 FiberWire sutures, placed in a locked cinch-knot loop, through the anterior ACL adjacent to the fracture fragment. The sutures are tensioned and anterior anchors are placed in the previously described fashion ( Postoperatively, the knee is placed into a knee immobilizer. Determination of weight-bearing status and when to initiate range-of-motion exercises is made based on the stability of fixation and patient reliability. Typically, children remain immobilized and are allowed partial weight bearing using crutches for 2 weeks. Gradual range-of-motion and isometric quadriceps strength exercises with partial weight bearing are then begun. Closed-chain strengthening and full weight bearing begin 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. Progression is made to nonimpact functional exercises. Reliable adolescent and adult patients begin immediate range of motion and strengthening using an accelerated ACL protocol. Return to normal activities including sports is allowed when the patient is asymptomatic, examination shows full range of motion and restoration of quadriceps strength, and the fracture is healed on radiographs. Suture bridge fixation has most extensively been studied for rotator cuff repair. First described by Park et al. The use of suture bridge fixation has expanded beyond rotator cuff repair. Kim et al. The only other growth plate–sparing technique in the literature, described by Vega et al., Potential postoperative complications are similar to those reported for other techniques, including loss of knee motion, fracture nonunion, fracture malunion, and persistent knee laxity. The all-inside, all-epiphyseal arthroscopic suture bridge technique for tibial intercondylar eminence fracture repair with PushLock anchors can be used in both the adult and pediatric patient. This procedure has low morbidity, allows easy visualization and reduction, provides firm fixation, can be effective in either comminuted or non-comminuted fractures, preserves the proximal tibial physis in pediatric patients, avoids metal hardware, and does not require a second procedure for implant removal. Postoperative rehabilitation can be accelerated within the restraints of fracture healing and patient reliability.
