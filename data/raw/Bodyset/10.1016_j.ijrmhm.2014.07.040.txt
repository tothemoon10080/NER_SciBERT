                     +B2O3
                     +Mg system to synthesize molybdenum boride have been investigated. The phase transformation and structural evaluation were studied by means of differential thermal analysis (DTA) techniques, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermodynamic evaluations indicated that the reaction was highly exothermic and should be a mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR). According to DTA results, for unmilled sample, the reaction's sequence includes the following reactions: MoO3 reduction→B2O3 reduction→molybdenum boride formation. For 3h-milled sample, the temperature of exothermic reaction decreased significantly and all the reactions occurred, simultaneously. Based on XRD results, the mechanochemical products including MgO and mix of molybdenum boride phases were achieved after 4h of high energy ball milling. SEM and TEM observations confirmed that the range of particle size was within 100nm.In recent years, transition metal borides are widely used in industry because of some outstanding properties such as high hardness, high-temperature strength, corrosion resistance, high melting points, chemical stability, wear resistance and electrical properties Mechanochemical activation as a type of in-situ method is a solid state powder processing which involves inducing chemical reactions in a mixture of as-received powders at room temperature or at least much lower temperatures. An increase in the kinetic of reactions during high energy milling can be a result of microstructural refinement, repeated cold deformation and fracture of particles. In recent years, the mechanochemical technique has been widely used to fabricate interpenetrating phase composites with nanosized microstructures In this study the formation of molybdenum borides was studied using Mg, and cheap and readily available oxide materials, namely MoO The precursor materials were magnesium (Merck, 99.7% purity, particle size 40 For the fabrication of the nanocomposite, a distinct amount of magnesium was mixed with B The precursor materials were milled in a planetary ball mill for various times at room temperature. Details of ball mill machine and milling conditions are given in In this study, the amounts of the remaining B XRD analysis was carried out using Cu-K The reaction process and features were also investigated by thermal analyses (DTA; model BÄHR 503). A small amount of the reactants weighing about 50 Considering the basis of reaction thermodynamics can contribute to understand the basic information about reactions and to estimate their behavior and formation of the possible phase compositions during the mechanochemical process. The possible reduction reactions that may occur in the Mg–B According to the thermodynamic data In the next stage, the elemental boron and molybdenum can form mix phases of molybdenum boride including: MoB, MoB Depending on the milling conditions and enthalpy of reaction, mechanochemical reactions are divided into two categories: progressive reaction and mechanically induced self-sustaining reaction (MSR). In the first type, the synthesis of final products extends to a very small volume slowly during each collision between the milled material and the grinding medium that contributes to comminution, mixing, and defect formation The value of Based on thermodynamic data, the In order to identify reactions' sequence in the MoO The thermal analysis result for the MoO For a complete reduction and formation of molybdenum according to the reaction Therefore, the reduction sequence of MoO Finally, thermal analyses of MoO Although the information obtained from the DTA experiment is valuable to help in unraveling the reaction mechanism, it may not be fully reliable since the experimental conditions differ considerably in the DTA and mechanochemical processes, which could have significant influence on the reaction kinetics and mechanism  It is worth to mention that unlike the thermal behavior of Mg–B During the mechanochemical process, all the reactions occur instantaneously, which is elucidated whether the formation reaction occurred in the overall mechanochemical process is induced by the reaction between Mg and B The typical XRD patterns of as-blended and mechanically milled B  It can be concluded that during milling of Mg, B The reduction reactions' sequence of the MoO The morphology of powders after MSR reaction, 4 High energy ball milling technique was successfully applied for the mechanosynthesis of magnesia According to thermal analysis of the unmilled sample, the MoO The phase detection illustrated that the mechanochemical process of Mg/B The SEM micrographs illustrated that after 4
