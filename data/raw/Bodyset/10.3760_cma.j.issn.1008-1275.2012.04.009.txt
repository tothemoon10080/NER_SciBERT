Hoffa fracture is an uncommon injury.In the literature, lateral condylar Hoffa fracture is mentioned as a more common injury pattern than medial condylar Hoffa fracture. The mechanism of injury and method of treatment is not very well described in the literature. We are presenting a rare case of comminuted medial condylar Hoffa fracture with ipsilateral patellar fracture. The mechanism of injury has not been described in the literature. Lag screw fixation, which is the most acceptable method of treatment, is not possible due to comminution. We explain the possible mechanism of injury and fix the fracture with L-but-tress plate.
