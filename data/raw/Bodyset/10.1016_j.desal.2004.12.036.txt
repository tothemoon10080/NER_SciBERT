The transport of cadmium (II) from a high-salinity chloride medium across a flat-sheet supported liquid membrane containing Cyanex 923 in Solvesso 100 supported on a PVDF membrane into a strip solution with water was investigated. Permeability coefficients of metal increased with decreasing the pH of feed from 2.0 to 0.5. It also increases with increasing carrier concentration in the membrane phase, whereas the permeation is dependent on the organic phase diluent but independent of metal concentration in the feed phase. The performance of the present system against other carriers was also studied.
