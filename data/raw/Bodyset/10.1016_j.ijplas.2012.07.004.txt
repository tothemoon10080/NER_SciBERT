In this paper, the experimental response of oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper under multiaxial loading conditions is presented, along with quasi-static and dynamic response under uniaxial compression loading. The multiaxial experiments were performed under non-proportional loading conditions, where the sample was subjected to uniaxial loading for a predetermined strain followed by biaxial loading. These experimental results provide a comprehensive data set for constitutive modeling of the material response at finite strains, over a wide range of strain-rates and temperatures. The observed strain-rate and temperature dependent responses under uniaxial loading are shown to correlate closely using the Khan–Huang–Liang (KHL) constitutive model; the model is shown to be in close agreement with other published experimental results [Khan, A.S., Liang, R., 1999. Behavior of three BCC metal over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures. International Journal of Plasticity 15, 1089–1109; Nemat-Nasser, S., Li, Y., 1998. Flow stress of F.C.C polycrystals with applications to OFHC Cu. Acta Materialia 46 (2), 565–577]. This constitutive model is further demonstrated to predict the observed material response accurately, using the material constants determined from uniaxial loading results during proportional and non-proportional loading experiments. The micro-texture characterization of as-extruded, annealed and deformed samples was performed to investigate the effect of temperature and strain-rate on texture evolution of OFHC copper. Grain average misorientation (GAM) was used to reveal the deformation heterogeneity and orientation gradients in deformed samples.During many manufacturing processes and other applications, the material is subjected to large deformations under multiaxial loading conditions. However, multiaxial experiments are difficult to perform and therefore, numerous experimental studies under uniaxial loading conditions were reported ( Several constitutive models have been developed over the years to predict plastic deformation of materials over a wide range of strain-rates and temperatures. These constitutive models have been generally classified into two major groups; physics based models (   At even higher strain-rates (10  Sung et al. (2010) proposed an empirical constitutive model to correlate the experimental responses of various grades of DP alloys at different strain-rates and temperatures. The experimental data presented was within the quasi-static domain of the strain-rate. The proposed model appears to correlate the experimental responses of various grades of DP steels reasonably well. However, the capability of the model to correlate the work hardening behavior of metals subjected to dynamic loading still needs to be addressed. The proposed model has 8 material parameters that involve determining of the initial parameters using other constitutive models like Power Law and Voce Hardening law.          During the past decade, numerous studies have been reported on shock loading and pressure–shear experiments ( Experimental studies during non-proportional multiaxial loading have been less frequent, if not rare, and are very much needed to understand material response under such loading, as well as to develop accurate constitutive models. It is the objective of the current study to investigate OFHC copper under non-proportional multiaxial loading conditions. It is very much needed as the various studies ( OFHC copper (99.99% pure) was used for this study. OFHC copper has a FCC structure with an atomic packing factor of 0.74. The specimens for compressive loading were obtained from an extruded bar stock of 12.7 The main advantage of compression over tension experiments are the level of strains that can be achieved in an investigation. Thus, quasi-static monotonic compression experiments were performed at room temperature at strain-rates ranging from 10 Quasi-static compression experiments at different temperatures were performed. The temperature ranged from 233 to 755 Dynamic compression experiments were performed on OFHC copper using a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The typical strain rates that can be achieved using this technique range from 200 to 10 The strain rate jump experiment was performed at room temperature. At first, the compression experiment was performed at a quasi-static strain-rate of 10 The free end monotonic torsion experiments at room temperature were performed at Von-Mises equivalent strain rates of 10 The dynamic torsion experiment was performed using the modified torsion Kolsky bar. The schematic of the dynamic torsion experimental setup is shown in The biaxial compression experiments were performed on rectangular block specimens. The typical specimen dimensions were 19 Micro-texture analysis was conducted for as-extruded (S1), annealed (S2) and deformed (S3–S8) OFHC copper samples. The KHL model ( Using the experimental results at different strain-rates (constant temperature), and at different temperatures (constant strain-rate), the initial material constants were determined. These initial constants are refined using the MATLAB least squares and the constrained optimization procedure to obtain the final set of optimized constants, shown in  In order to verify that there is no significant thermal softening at a strain-rate of 10      We further examine the existing experimental results on similar alloys of OFHC copper. In Also included in this study are the experimental results from the earlier published work by    Here,   The results presented in this study included very comprehensive responses under uniaxial and biaxial compression and torsional loading to understand the material behavior of OFHC copper at different strain-rates and temperatures. OFHC copper showed higher temperature sensitivity than strain-rate dependence under all the loading conditions. The KHL model was used to correlate and predict the measured responses. The optimized constants were used to correlate the experimental responses under uniaxial compression at different strain-rates and temperatures. Using these constants, the strain-rate jump experiment was predicted. The KHL model was able to predict the measured response exceptionally well for this case, as well as, for the case of uniaxial to biaxial compression. The quasi-static and dynamic loading response under torsion was found to be appreciably softer than the measured responses under compression. EBSD technique was used to analyze the micro-texture of as-extruded, annealed and deformed OFHC copper samples. Micro-texture analysis revealed that deformed samples composed of a strong 〈110〉 texture component regardless of deformation temperature and strain rate. EBSD analysis also revealed that the fraction of twin boundaries (Ft) slightly increases and the fraction of grain average misorietation (GAM) lower than 2° (Fg) increases as deformation temperature increases. The results indicate that a homogeneous plastic deformation occurs during the unaxial compression as deformation temperature increases. The sample deformed under strain-rate of 10
