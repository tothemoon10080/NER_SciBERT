Gold leaching in thiosulphate media has attracted renewed interest of many researchers over the last three decades due to fast kinetics in the presence of some oxidants/ligands and its adaptability to gold ores which are unsuitable for direct cyanidation. The acidity (pH) and the concentrations of copper(II), ammonia, thiosulphate and polythionates produced by the reaction between copper(II) and thiosulphate and other added background reagents including chloride, carbonate, sulphite, sulphide, phosphate and cations such as silver(I), lead(II) and counter ions of thiosulphate salts affect the rate per unit area and extent (%) of gold dissolution. The literature data on the beneficial and detrimental effects of background reagents on gold dissolution from rotating discs, suspended foils and particles of gold ores/concentrates are reviewed. The reaction mechanism(s) with applications to leach systems are also reviewed and discussed on the basis of the Lewis acid-base and hard–soft properties and interactions of metal ions and anions. These interactions determine the ability of background reagents to affect the residual copper(II) concentration and EH, surface reaction with gold by catalytic action and/or by preventing the formation or removing the passivating layers on gold. The anodic oxidation of gold in ammonia free thiosulphate solutions is also enhanced by the presence of copper(II). This has been confirmed by electrochemical studies at pH 7 and 12 and stirred reactor leaching tests of gold in oxygenated thiosulphate solutions. The presence of copper in the form of ions, metal or oxide enhanced the rate of gold dissolution ( One of the major issues in thiosulphate leaching is the reaction between Cu(II) and S The degradation products of S Drawbacks such as the toxicity of ammonia, pregrobbing by clay minerals, consumption of reagents due to side reactions of copper(II) with thiosulphate and/or host minerals, and the detrimental effects of the degradation products of thiosulphate and/or host minerals on downstream processing have impeded the development of a thiosulphate leaching system ( The pre-oxidation of sulphide ores with oxygen, prior to the introduction of thiosulphate, can be beneficial in some cases ( Metallic iron and ferric ions decrease gold leaching efficiency due to passivation of the gold surface by iron hydroxides ( A better understanding of the effect of various background reagents on leaching performance is useful for the development of thiosulphate gold–silver processing options using economically viable and effective reagents. The aims of this paper are to: briefly review the ion properties/interactions which are responsible for the stability of ions participating in gold leaching and main side reactions, briefly review the current understanding of the main reaction schemes/mechanisms for thiosulphate/gold oxidation by copper(II), briefly review the effect of background reagents and thiosulphate degradation products on residual copper(II) concentration and the rate of gold dissolution per unit surface area, and rationalise the literature data on the effect of background reagents on gold leaching on the basis of various interactions of background reagents with key components in solution and/or at the gold surface. Simple cations and anions interact with weakly polarized water molecules (hydration) by ion-dipole and hydrogen-bond interactions, respectively. According to the concept of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) proposed by Although there is no direct linearity between the softness and hardness of ions, these two terms are related to the polarizability and electrostatic field strength (ze/r cations: (i) M(g) anions: (i) A(g) Step (ii) involves the hydration of the gaseous ion in water by ion-dipole interactions, donation of an electron pair (H Aqueous cations (soft or hard) act as Lewis acids by accepting non-bonding electrons from ligands (Lewis bases) to form coordinative bonds. The Lewis acidity of an ion (Kamlet-Taft parameter, α) describes the ability to donate a hydrogen bond or accept an electron pair, and the Lewis basicity (β) describes the ability to donate an electron pair (  Anions of higher softness in Based on the relative values of softness, S The close softness values of 0.44 and 0.41 for the monovalent ions Au Whilst Cu(II) reacts with host sulphide minerals lead(II), Ca(II), Na The softness of complex species such as Cu(NH The precipitation of CuS according to Eq.  According to Unlike the anion effect summarised in  Rates of dissolution of gold per unit surface area (R The measured rate of thiosulphate leaching of pure gold by dissolved oxygen in aerated solutions is an order of magnitude lower than cyanidation based on the results reported by previous researchers ( The reported rate data summarised in ligand (cyanide, thiosulphate, ammonia, thiourea, sulphide or chloride), oxidant (oxygen or Cu(II)), the presence or absence of silver(I), alloyed silver, or polythionates, and the change in cations of the thiosulphate salts and chloride salts from Na Some results are plotted in  In non-ammoniacal solutions of near neutral pH (6–7), the increase in Cu(I) (Set, K), chloride (Set, L), or thiourea (Set, M) enhances the rate of gold dissolution. However, AuAg(2%) alloy has a lower rate than pure gold in the presence of 5 A detailed analysis of anodic oxidation of gold in ammonia free thiosulphate in the absence of copper(II) has shown that the anodic oxidation takes place via the adsorption of the MS  In the case of thiosulphate oxidation by copper(II) in ammoniacal solutions the reaction orders with respect to the key reagents are: [Cu(II)] A background ligand L (=  Despite the high residual Cu(II) in  Despite the fast dissolution of gold at the higher thiosulphate concentration in The β the beneficial effect of Pb(II) at low concentrations in the detrimental effect of Pb(II) at high concentrations is a result of passivation of the gold surface by PbO ( In the absence of silver, both massive and colloidal gold have comparable, but very low rates of dissolution in oxygenated (non-copper) thiosulphate solutions ( The beneficial effect of high copper on R The results shown in Thus, based on the HSAB rule NH  As noted in  The formation of AuCl   Results of leaching studies by The detrimental effect of excess Pb(NO In contrast, even a small % of PbO has a large detrimental effect indicating the passivation of the gold surface ( In the absence of PbS, the addition of Na  As noted in In all cases silver extraction remains lower than gold but generally follows the gold extraction curve. The formation of Fe(OH) Higher additions of SHMP over 0.8 In other cases higher additive concentrations increase both gold and silver, where the addition of 0.13  A summary of the TSC after 24 or 48 all additives lower the TSC compared to leaching without additives, the TSC decreases with increasing concentration of additives and the decreasing leaching time from 48 to 24 the general order of TSC is: none Low TSC in the presence of EDTA leads to higher rate of gold dissolution in Gold dissolution by ammoniacal thiosulphate is a result of the reaction between gold, thiosulphate and ammoniacal copper(II) ions. The reaction between thiosulphate and ammoniacal copper(II) produces polythionate/sulphide ions which block or passivate the gold surface with S/CuS and cause detrimental effects on gold dissolution. A comparison of the rates of anodic/chemical dissolution of pure gold and gold–silver alloys/ores/concentrates in the absence or presence of the main reagents and additives rationalises the beneficial/detrimental roles of different additives: Thiosulphate degradation via Cu(NH Direct involvement of co-ligands in the anodic surface reaction accelerates gold dissolution in the order NH Depending upon their Lewis acidity or softness, some cations (M Other cations may improve gold dissolution via the formation of mixed-metal ion complexes M(I)Au(I)(S Pyrite and pyrrhotie in large quantities (16%) assist the catalysis of thiosulphate oxidation and cause high thiosulphate consumption and low gold extraction from ores. In comparison, even low quantities of PbS, PbO, Pb(NO Low Cu(II) addition is advantageous as it lowers thiosulphate consumption, prevents the formation of passivating products, and results in 100% gold extraction despite the slow rates which require prolonged leaching. The dissolution of silver and gold–silver alloys is faster than pure gold. Although the leaching curves for silver from ores/concentrates generally follow the same trend as gold, silver leaching is lower than gold, indicating the possible involvement of Ag Financial assistance and support from the
