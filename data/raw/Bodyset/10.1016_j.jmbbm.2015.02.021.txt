In the present study, functionally graded coatings of HA/TiO2 nanoparticles and HA-TiO2 nanocomposite coatings with 0, 10 and 20wt% of TiO2 were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition on Ti–6Al–4V substrate. The functionally graded structure of HA/TiO2 coatings was formed by gradual addition of HA suspension into the deposition cell containing TiO2 nanoparticles. Micro-scratch test results showed the highest critical distances of crack initiation and delamination, normal load before failure and critical contact pressures for functionally graded coating. It was observed that the improvement of adhesion strength and fracture toughness of functionally graded coatings would be due to the reduction of thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between Ti–6Al–4V substrate and HA. The results of potentiodynamic polarization measurements showed that the graded structure of the coating could efficiently increase the corrosion resistance of substrate.Hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca In the current study, the compositionally gradient structure of HA-TiO Hydroxyapatite (Merck, USA) and TiO Ti–6Al–4V substrate as the working electrode, and 316L stainless steel as the counter electrode, were immersed in the suspension with a fixed distance of 10 After deposition, the green coatings were dried in air for 24 The microstructural characterization and elemental composition of the coatings were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope (VEGA\\TESCAN) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Phase composition of the coated surfaces was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips PW 1480), in the 2 Besides, a novel microscratch technique was applied to assess the fracture toughness from the recorded forces and depth of penetration ( Electrochemical corrosion behavior of the samples was conducted in SBF solution (  The surface microstructure and the line scanning analysis of Ca, P and Ti elements at the cross sectional view of FG sample are shown in  It is possible to recognize the The implementation of a simple analytical linear elastic fracture mechanics model of the scratch test provides a means to determine the fracture toughness ( According to Eq. According to crack propagation theory, the fracture path follows the trajectory of points of minimum strain energy and deviates due to successive sudden jumps at each void ( The potentiodynamic polarization curves of H, H10T, H20T and FG samples in the SBF solution are illustrated in The results corresponding to FG and H20T samples imply a significant decrease in the corrosion current density ( In the present study, the functionally graded and composite HA-TiO
