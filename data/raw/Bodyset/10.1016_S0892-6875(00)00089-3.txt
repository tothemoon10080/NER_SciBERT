Froth dynamics, i.e. the stability and mobility of the froth, are crucial indicators of various important features of flotation systems. For example, it is desirable that the froth collapses as soon as possible after it is skimmed off the cell in order to curtail losses in throughput. On the other hand, if the froth is too prone to collapse, it will not be sufficiently stable to support its load prior to skimming. Likewise, the mobility of the froth gives similar information on the performance of the flotation cell. For example, a sharp contrast can be observed between dry viscous (immobile) froths and watery runny froths with high mobility. Several authors have recently shown that analysis of the structure of the froth in a flotation cell can be used to assess the performance of the cell. This implies that there is a close relationship between the bubble size distribution in the pulp and froth phases.
                  Until very recently, it was not possible to verify this hypothesis direct, since reliable measurements of bubble size distributions in especially the froth phase could not be obtained. With recent improvements in the machine vision technology originally developed at the University of Stellenbosch, it is now possible to measure bubble size distributions and stability in froth structure with a high degree of accuracy. Unlike previous methods, these improved algorithms can provide a detailed map of flow patterns in the froths, which can give a significantly better idea of operating conditions in the flotation cell. Consequently, in this experimental study the bubble size distribution in the pulp phase of a laboratory flotation cell was measurement with a capillary tube system (UCT bubble size analyser), while the bubble size distribution in the froth phase was measured by use of digital image analysis. The relationship between these bubble size distributions in the pulp and froth phases is discussed.
