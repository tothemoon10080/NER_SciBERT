This chapter describes the Ausmelt and Isasmelt smelting processes. Ausmelt and Isasmelt matte smelting was originally designed for use in tin smelting. Both Ausmelt and Isasmelt smelting are based on the technology developed at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in 1970. Their furnaces and operating procedures are similar. The smelting is done in vertically aligned cylindrical furnaces, âˆ¼3.5 m diameter and 12 m high. Most of the energy for smelting is obtained from oxidizing the concentrates of iron and sulfur. The principal product of the furnace is a matte or slag mixture. It is tapped into a hydrocarbon fired or electric settling furnace. The products after settling are 60% copper matte and 0.7% copper slag. The main advantages of this process over other flash smelting processes are its small footprint, which makes it easy to retrofit into existing smelters, and its small evolution of dust. The whole set-up of the furnace is provided in the chapter.
