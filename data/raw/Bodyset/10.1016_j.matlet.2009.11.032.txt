Aluminum based composites reinforced with B4C particles were prepared by cryomilling and subsequent hot pressing steps. The cryomilled powders dispersed with 5wt.% or 10wt.% B4C particles were hot pressed under a pressure of 600MPa at 350Â°C. Microstructural studies conducted on the composites indicated that homogeneous distribution of the B4C particles in the Al matrix and a good interface between them had been achieved. According to the results of reciprocating wear tests carried out by utilizing alumina and steel balls, wear resistance increased with increasing B4C particle content.Aluminum matrix composites reinforced by ceramic particulates (SiC, B In this work, unlubricated reciprocal sliding wear behaviour of B Al/B Microstructural characterization was conducted on a light optical microscope (LOM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) after preparing the samples according to standard metallographic procedures. The phases were identified with Cu K Wear tests were carried out at normal atmospheric conditions (room temperature and 50% relative humidity) on a reciprocating wear tester under a normal load of 1.5 Microscopic examinations ( The results obtained from the hardness measurements and wear tests made by measuring the wear track areas calculated from the 3D-profile images ( The increase of bulk hardness and relative wear resistance of the examined samples with increasing the B LOM and SEM images of the wear tracks developed on the surfaces of the composite with 10 The key findings of this study can be summarized as follows: Microstructural studies conducted on the B Hardness and wear resistance increased with an increase in the B This work was partially funded by the
