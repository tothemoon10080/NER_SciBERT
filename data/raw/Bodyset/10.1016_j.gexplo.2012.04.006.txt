An assessment is presented of existing data on the most important copper and cobalt complexes and sulphides applied to reactive transport modelling. The most important complexes in ore-forming hydrothermal solutions at 150°C are CoCl(H2O)5
                     +, CoCl4
                     −2 and CoCl2(H2O)2(aq) for cobalt, and CuCl2
                     − and CuCl3
                     −2 for copper. Reactive transport modelling was carried out to simulate the transport and precipitation of copper and cobalt sulphides in sediment-hosted stratiform ore deposits, such as the Central African Copperbelt. A limitation is the lack of thermodynamic data for carrollite (CuCo2S4). Initially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and cattierite (CoS2) precipitate in a reducing host rock. Pyrite dissolves in the horizon where both minerals form and it precipitates in adjacent rocks. The continuous supply of copper and cobalt causes formation of the metal-rich sulphides bornite (Cu5FeS4) and linnaeite (Co3S4). Chalcopyrite and cattierite precipitate further in the flow direction. In this model, the dissociation reaction of chalcopyrite and bornite are:
                  CuFeS2(s)+2H+
                     =Cu2+
                     +Fe2+
                     +2HS−
                  
                  Cu5FeS4(s)+2H+
                     =4Cu+
                     +Cu2+
                     +Fe2+
                     +4HS−
                  
                  However, if the dissociation reactions only include Cu+ and Fe3+, simulations show the precipitation of only chalcocite (Cu2S), which is explained by the low concentration of trivalent iron in solution. The dissociation reactions are:
                  CuFeS2(s)+2H+
                     =Cu+
                     +Fe3+
                     +2HS−
                  
                  Cu5FeS4(s)+2H+
                     =5Cu+
                     +Fe3+
                     +4HS−Cobalt is used in many industrial and laboratory applications such as in alloys, paints, ink, ceramics, glass, catalysts and radiation. It occurs in relatively few types of ore deposits and is predominant in the Central African Copperbelt ( The aim of this study is to assess the existing data, to apply a reactive transport model using the available data and to discuss the limitations of the data and model. Two geochemical simulators have been used in this study: Phreeqc ( One of the main limitations with geochemical simulators is that geochemical databases are not continuously updated according to the newest data published in the specialised literature. Therefore, firstly a review of equilibrium constant data of the main complexes and minerals should be performed. Not only Cu Cobalt is mainly transported as Co(II) chloride complexes in ore-forming hydrothermal solutions ( The main Fe Chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite are the most important copper sulphides in primary hydrothermal deposits ( The reactions envisaged for the precipitation of chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite are: Important cobalt minerals include cattierite (CoS The equilibrium constants of these reactions at 150 In Cu-rich deposits, such as the Central African Copperbelt, carrollite is the dominant cobalt-bearing mineral ( Reactive transport modelling is carried out to get a better understanding of the transport and precipitation of different copper and cobalt sulphides with time. The conceptual model is based on the geological setting and metallogenesis of sediment-hosted Cu–Co deposits in the Central African Copperbelt ( The stratiform copper deposits in the Central African Copperbelt show a complex zonation and paragenesis ( Numerous ore deposit models have been proposed during the last hundred years (see for an overview The geochemical simulator Retraso ( The computer programme Retraso offers the possibility to take into account complexes in aqueous solutions and the precipitation and dissolution of minerals, both assuming local equilibrium conditions and using kinetic laws. The default thermodynamic database is that of EQ3/6 ( The conceptual model consists of two sedimentary layers, which reflect non-mineralised Roches Siliceuses Cellulaires (RSC) overlying mineralised dolomitic shales and siltstones and silty dolomites of the Lower Orebody ( The dominant copper species in solution at 150 In the first model, copper reactions In the second model, reactions The first model does not simulate the typical occurrence of chalcopyrite and bornite in the sediment-hosted ore-deposits, nor the paragenetic sequence observed in the Katanga Copperbelt deposits (e.g. Cattierite is the dominant cobalt mineral in the simulation. The apparent replacement of cattierite by linnaeite in layer 1 at the contact with layer 2 is due to the continuous supply of cobalt, which causes formation of Co-rich sulphides (Co In the second model pyrite dissolution and chalcopyrite precipitation are followed by bornite. In model 2 the chemical reactions considered are The replacement reaction of pyrite by chalcopyrite would imply the supply of two electrons according to the following reaction: The oxidation state of cobalt in cattierite is divalent. The oxidation state of cobalt in linnaeite has to our knowledge not been constrained by X-ray spectroscopy. Based on comparison with the valence of sulphur in carrollite, member of the thiospinel minerals of the linnaeite group, the total oxidation state of the 4 sulphurs in linnaeite could be − In the geochemical modelling of steady state fluid flow and chemical reaction during supergene enrichment of porphyry copper deposits, A comparable evolution through time in the precipitation and replacement of ore minerals has been observed in volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits ( Reprecipitation replacement reactions can nicely be simulated in hydrothermal experiments ( Also from a quantitative point of view the numerical model provides insight into the mineralization process. The mineral content observed in both models corresponds to the metal content observed in sediment-hosted ore deposits, i.e. > During the last decade, due to numerous studies our knowledge of copper and cobalt chloride complexes has significantly increased. Also a better insight on the valence of copper and cobalt in different sulphides has evolved. Copper is monovalent in sulphides. The latter has significant implications for reactive transport modelling in which copper is often considered as divalent such as in chalcopyrite. In the present modelling, the precipitation of chalcopyrite and bornite is simulated considering one divalent copper. This is interpreted as the replacement of pyrite by chalcopyrite followed by bornite, as is typically observed in sediment-hosted deposits of the Central African Copperbelt. This emphasises the need to consider replacement reactions in the modelling. However, considering trivalent iron in both chalcopyrite and bornite, chalcocite is always the thermodynamically stable copper sulphide due to low concentration of Fe We are grateful to Joël Brugger and an anonymous reviewer for their stimulating comments and constructive discussions and the associate editor Agustin Martin-Izard for the editorial handling.
