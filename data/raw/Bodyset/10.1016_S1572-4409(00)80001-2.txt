Mechanical activation of solid substances is one of the component of the modern scientific discipline of mechanochemistry. At present, mechanochemistry appears to be a science with a sound theoretical foundation which exhibits a wide range of potential application. Amongst the commercially operating processes: modification of the properties of building materials, a new method of fertilizer production, activity enhancement and regeneration of catalysts, new methods of producing slow-dispensing medical drugs, control of reactions in chemical technology and preparation of advanced materials. Mechanical activation is of exceptional importance in mineral dressing and extractive metallurgy and this area forms the topic of this book and is the result of more than twenty years of research and graduate teaching in the field. This book Extractive Metallurgy of Activated Minerals designed for researchers and operators in the areas of extraction metallurgy, mineral processing, mineralogy, solid state chemistry and material science as well as for university students of this orientation. It is hoped that this book will encourage newcomers to the mechanochemistry to do useful research and discover novel applications in this field.
