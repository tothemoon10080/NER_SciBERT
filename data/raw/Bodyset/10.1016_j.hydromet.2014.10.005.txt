The present study investigated the purification of nickel sulfate by solvent extraction with Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid) and mixtures of Cyanex 272 with Versatic 10 (neodecanoic acid). Batch scale tests were carried out using a laboratory multicomponent aqueous sulfuric solution with metal ion concentration similar to those typically found in High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) liquors, following the iron removal step (in g.L−1): [Ca] =0.50; [Co] =2.10; [Cu] =0.25; [Mg] =3.50; [Mn] =0.55; [Ni] =75.0; [Zn] =0.06. This solution was first placed in contact with organic phases containing only Cyanex 272 (T =50°C; A/O ratio =1). Subsequently, the effect of two operating variables pH of the aqueous solution (1.5 to 7.0) and concentration of Cyanex 272 (5, 10, 15, and 20%v/v) were investigated. It was verified that nickel could be selectively separated from zinc, cobalt, copper, and manganese, at pH =3.9 and [Cyanex 272] =20%v/v, but not from calcium and magnesium. Therefore, to purify nickel from such alkaline earth metals, organic phases containing Cyanex 272 (20%v/v) and Versatic 10 (5, 10, and 20%v/v) were then evaluated. Approximately 80% of the nickel could be purified using Cyanex 272 (20%v/v) and Versatic 10 (10%v/v), thus obtaining a clean final solution containing at least 60g.L−1 of nickel.Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid) has become the reagent of choice for the separation of cobalt and nickel from acid sulfate liquors, such as those produced in the High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) processing of nickel laterites. In fact, Co/Ni separation factors for alkyl phosphinic acids are much higher than those found for alkyl phosphoric and alkyl phosphonic acids, such as D2EHPA and PC88A, respectively ( According to D2EHPA: Fe PC88A: Fe Cyanex 272: Fe It could be observed that while Co-Ni separation was facilitated by Cyanex 272, the separation of nickel from alkaline earth metals, such as calcium and magnesium, is more difficult. Therefore, it would be plausible to previously remove calcium and magnesium using D2EHPA; however, according to Many studies propose to separate nickel and/or cobalt from other metals using synergistic solvent extraction ( The synergistic effect of Versatic 10 (neodecanoic acid) mixed with LIX63 (5,8-diethyl-7-hydroxy-6-dodecanone oxime) and TBP (tributyl phosphate) in the separation of cobalt and nickel was investigated by The separation of nickel over calcium was significantly improved by adding 0.5 The separation of nickel from calcium and magnesium was investigated by The present work investigated the main operating variables for the purification of nickel sulfate from multicomponent aqueous solutions by solvent extraction using Cyanex 272 and mixtures of Cyanex 272 and Versatic 10. This study was performed using laboratory aqueous solutions with metal ion concentrations similar to those typically found in the HPAL liquors, following the iron removal step. A multicomponent sulfuric aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving a weighted mass of each metal sulfate salt (Synth, analytical grade, > The aqueous and organic phases (300 Tests were performed in two steps. In the first step, the multicomponent aqueous solution was contacted with organic solutions containing only Cyanex 272. In these tests, the operating variables pH of the aqueous phase (1.5 to 7.0, with increments of approximately 0.5) and the concentration of Cyanex 272 (5, 10, 15, and 20%v/v) were investigated. In the second step, the aqueous phase was placed in contact with the organic solutions containing Cyanex 272 (at a fixed concentration of 20%v/v) and Versatic 10. In these tests, the operating variables pH of the aqueous phase (4.0 to 7.0, with increments of approximately 0.5) and concentration of Versatic 10 (5, 10, and 20%v/v) were investigated.  In general terms, the following metal ion extraction sequence with pH was obtained as shown in The difference in pH Based on the experimental pH The degree of separation (or selectivity) between two metals (M1 and M2) with Cyanex 272 can be also measured by using the separation factor (β According to Eqs.   Similarly, as verified in the extraction curve of calcium with Cyanex 272 ( To evaluate the purification of nickel from calcium and magnesium, calculated separating factors (β  The multicomponent aqueous solution containing nickel at concentration levels similar to those from HPAL liquors can be selectively purified with respect to zinc, copper, manganese, and cobalt, using 20%v/v of Cyanex 272 at pH Cyanex 272 proved ineffective in separating nickel sulfate from alkaline earth metals calcium and magnesium; The mixture of Cyanex 272 (20%v/v) with Versatic 10 (10%v/v) proved to be suitable to separate nickel sulfate from calcium and magnesium at pH = The authors wish to thank CNPq (CT Mineral, Processo 550243/2011-9), CAPES, FAPEMIG, INCT Acqua (Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia em Recursos Minerais, Água e Biodiversidade,
