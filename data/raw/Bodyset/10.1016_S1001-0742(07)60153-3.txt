Abstract
                  The biosorption of copper by the brown seaweed Sargassum baccularia, immobilized onto polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads, was investigated with fixed-bed experiments. Laboratory-scale column tests were performed to determine breakthrough curves with varying flow rates and feed concentrations. A theoretical fixed-bed model, known as the Bohart-Adams equation, was evaluated in simulating the experimental breakthrough curves. The Bohart-Adams model qualitatively predicted the breakthrough trends. PVA-immobilized seaweed biomass beads were amenable to efficient regeneration with aqueous solution containing the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The biosorbent retained most of its original uptake capacity over three cycles of use. The excellent reusability of the biosorbent could lead to the development of a viable metal remediation technology.
