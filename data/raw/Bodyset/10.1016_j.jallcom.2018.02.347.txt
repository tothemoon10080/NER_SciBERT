MoS2 vertically standing nanosheets were prepared by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition using molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (C2H6S2) as precursors. The sulfur source was chosen as a less toxic alternative to the well-established hydrogen sulfide (H2S). These films were deposited between 500 and 800 °C resulting in different surface morphologies, from nanoparticles to vertically standing nanosheets. A highly (002) oriented 2H-MoS2 film was obtained at 700 °C. The effect of the microstructure on the catalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of the MoS2 films was investigated. The Tafel slope varied from 68 to 94 mV/dec, showing that the microstructure of the films had an influence on their final electrochemical performance. Water contact angle analysis was used to study the surface wettability of the films, obtaining values from 60 to 121.2°. These results exhibited a quite consistent trend with the Tafel slope, indicating a significant effect of wettability and nanosheets edge exposure on the HER performance.Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMS) such as MoS Li et al.

This peak corresponds to Mo To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance for HER of the MoS Analyzing electrochemical performances for the HER in acidic media, the Tafel analysis is applied to define the possible steps occurring on the electrode surface [ Electrochemical hydrogen absorption: Electrochemical desorption: Chemical desorption: Previous reports have found that when the Tafel slope value of 30, 40 or 120 mV/dec is achieved, the rate-determining step will be Tafel, Heyrovsky or Volmer step, respectively [ According to The films composed of nanoparticles ( (002)-oriented MoS This work was supported by
