Currently, in countries with ample ore resources such as Mexico, the benefit of polysulphide associations has become in a topic of industrial interest due to the gradual depletion of high grade deposits; thus promoting the research and development of new technologies on flotation, which must be adhered to the strict environmental regulations. The industrial application of non-pathogenic bacteria in mineral processing has generated a new research perspective in beneficiation of minerals with poor response to traditional schemes of flotation. In this communication, the effect of
