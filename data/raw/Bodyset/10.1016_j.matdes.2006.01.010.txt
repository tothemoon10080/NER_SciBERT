An experimental investigation on instantaneous strain hardening behaviour of aluminium – 3.5% alumina powder metallurgy composite preforms for three different stress state conditions, namely, the uniaxial, the plane and the triaxial has been carried out. Sintered aluminium–alumina composite with three different aspect ratios (height to diameter ratio), namely, 0.35, 0.56 and 0.72 and two different initial preform relative densities of 0.80 and 0.90 were prepared, sintered at 550±10°C under the cover of protective indigenously developed ceramic coating for a period of 90min in an electric muffle furnace and cooled inside the furnace itself. Sintered but mildly machined disc specimens were cold deformed under axial tests using mirror polished flat dies. The instantaneous strain hardening exponent (n

                     ) and the instantaneous strength coefficient (K
                     
                        i
                     ) were determined for each aspect ratios for all three different stress state conditions and the results were analyzed in the present work. The analysis of the experimental results has shown that the instantaneous strain hardening exponent (n

                     ) are greater for the triaxial stress state condition irrespective of the initial preform densities and the aspect ratios when compared to uniaxial and plane stress state conditions.Penetration of powder materials in different branches of industries stipulates the increase of interest to analysis of powder behaviour under the forming processes. These processes include operations of compaction and sintering which are predominantly targeted at the manufacturing of complex shaped parts. The compaction operation is mainly used to solve the problems of controlling the density distribution and to predict the appearance and further behaviour of cracks and damages. However, strain hardening is the phenomenon which takes place at room temperature because of the plastic deformation of metals. The strain hardening exponent is the parameter which explains about the behaviour of strain hardening of materials. Deformation characteristics of sintered powder materials was investigated by Kuhn and Downey Earlier most of the investigations were aimed at assessing the mechanical properties of the materials such as elastic modulus, yield stress, ultimate tensile strength and elongation. However, the other characteristics of the stress–strain curves, such as work-hardening exponent and strength coefficient have not been discussed in depth. These parameters are expected to play a very vital role in carrying out the plastic deformation of porous materials. Narayanasamy and Pandey The aim of the present work is to present an experimental study on the strain-hardening behaviour of aluminium – 3.5% alumina composite material under three dimensional stress conditions, namely, uniaxial, plane and triaxial. The instantaneous strain hardening exponent ( Atomized aluminium powder was procured from M/s, The Metal Powder Company, Madurai, India. The aluminium powder was analyzed for its purity and was found to be 99.7% pure with 0.3% insoluble impurities. The alumina powder was produced as explained elsewhere The mathematical expressions used for the determination of various upsetting parameters, namely, stresses, strains, the strain hardening exponents and the strength coefficients for various stress state conditions such as uniaxial, plane and triaxial. These are briefly described in subsequent sections. During the upsetting of P/M preforms under frictional conditions, it is expected that the average density would increased. It is well established that the friction enhances densification and at the same time decreases the height reduction at fracture. The state of stress in a homogeneous compression process according to Abdel-Rahman and EI-Sheikh The axial true strain ( The strain-hardening exponent value ( It is assumed that the consecutive compressive loads were specified as 1, Now by dividing Eq. According to Narayanasamy and Pandey Since the radial stress Using the Eqs. According to Narayanasamy and Ponalagusamy Since       Based on the critical analysis of the experimental and calculated data parameters the following conclusions have been drawn: Stresses, namely, the effective, the hoop and the mean or the hydrostatic are found to be tensile in nature under triaxial stress state condition. Mean or hydrostatic stress is compressive in nature under plane stress state condition. Lower aspect ratio preforms have exhibited enhanced level of stresses for the initial preform density of 0.80. However, for the higher initial preform density (0.90), the above observation is different at higher axial strains. The instantaneous strain hardening exponent ( The geometric hardening and the matrix work hardenings are found to be shifted to the higher axial strains for the cases of higher aspect ratio preforms. The instantaneous strength coefficient ( The instantaneous strength coefficient (
