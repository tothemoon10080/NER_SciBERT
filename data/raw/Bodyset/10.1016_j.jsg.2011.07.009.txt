Numerical simulations are a fundamental tool to access the typical conditions attained during earthquake instabilities and to simulate the large number of dissipative processes taking places during faulting. In this study we consider a single-degree-of-freedom spring-slider system, a simplified fault model which can describe the whole seismic cycle and the dynamics of a fault with spatially homogeneous properties. We assume a rate- and state-dependent friction in which we incorporate the effects of pore fluid pressure, thermally-pressurized as a consequence of the frictional heat produced during sliding. We explore, in a single framework, the role of the time variations of the porosity, permeability or both, ultimately leading to changes in hydraulic diffusivity, which has been recognized as one of the key parameters in thermally-pressurized faults. Our synthetic ruptures show that the changes in the hydraulic diffusivity only due to porosity variations do not markedly affect the earthquake recurrence (cycle time), the traction evolution and the thermal history of the fault. On the contrary, when the evolutions of both the porosity and the permeability are accounted for, the cycle time is significantly reduced. This result has a clear implication in the context of the hazard assessment.Recent laboratory experiments conducted at high slip velocities (about 1 m/s, thus comparable with cosesimic rates) and at moderate normal stresses (1–25 MPa, e.g., Both these two mechanisms, the thermal pressurization and the flash heating, have been adopted in the theoretical modeling of earthquake faulting ( Within the coseismic time scale (during which the stress is released and the seismic waves are excited by the earthquake source) the temporal evolution of the porosity tends to counterbalance the effect of the thermal pressurization and it is able to change the evolution of the traction within the cohesive zone ( In this paper we will consider the effects on the traction evolution of the time variations of the hydraulic diffusivity. In turn, the latter are caused by temporal changes of porosity and permeability, from which In the present study we will consider the spring-slider (or mass-spring) analog fault model, where a block of mass The traction In this work, accordingly to previous papers ( In a thermally-pressurized, fluid-saturated fault zone The isothermal coefficient of compressibility of the fluid is defined as the inverse of the bulk modulus of elasticity of the fluid; namely: Also the dynamic fluid viscosity can change due to temperature variations. If the fluid is pure water, an empirical description of this variation is expressed by the following relation: In the special case of temporally-constant porosity (i.e., for In the numerical experiments presented and discussed in this paper the adopted parameters are listed in The porosity of a porous material (rock or sediment) is the dimensionless ratio between the current fraction of voids (pore volume; By considering the adopted initial conditions of the system (see Compared to As an overall conclusion, we have seen that time variations of hydraulic diffusivity only due to porosity changes (we recall that The permeability physically represents a measure of the ability of a porous rock or an unconsolidated material to transmit fluids. It is often expressed through the hydraulic conductivity ( Unfortunately, though permeability measurements were performed in different rock types (e.g., Local variations of the rock permeability have been inferred from observations of natural faults and from laboratory samples ( The second evolution for In this paper we have considered the spring-slider dashpot model to numerically model the whole cycle of a fluid-saturated seismogenic fault, obeying a rate- and state-dependent friction. In particular, we assumed that the fault is described by the Linker–Dieterich’s constitutive model (equation Rock–fluid interaction is an important phenomenon connected with tectonic instability, in that faulting processes affect the fluid pressure and the fluid pressure concurs to approach faulting conditions (e.g., The main focus of the present paper is on the time variations of the hydraulic diffusivity. Actually, Permeability and porosity evolve during the seismic cycle also for chemical effects (e.g., fault healing and sealing due to mineral precipitation). The effectiveness of these healing processes is evident in field studies of exhumed seismogenic faults but also recognized in the evolution of the Due to the point-like nature of the presently adopted fault analog model we disregard any complication arising from the spatial heterogeneities of Our numerical experiments show that the time variations of the hydraulic diffusivity only caused by the evolution of the porosity (we have assumed in this paper that Moreover, the time variations of the permeability alone, in agreement to the On the contrary, we have shown that the incorporation of variations of both porosity and permeability (thought the implementation of the Kozeny–Carman’s model; equation As a further development of this work it would be interesting to test different evolution equations for the porosity (see Part of this work originated from the insightful discussions I had the pleasure to have during the workshop “Physico-chemical processes in seismic faults” held in Padova, November 2010, founded by Progetti di Eccellenza, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo (CARIPARO).

As mentioned in section The resulting hydraulic diffusivity changes, as expected from equation Let we consider the pore fluid pressure evolution in the special case of temporally-constant porosity. Under this hypothesis equation The elasto-dynamic problem for our 1-D fault system is solved numerically by using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm with auto-adaptive time stepping ( We simply recall here that the analytical solution The scale length of equation The quantity Formally, to obtain the analytical solutions The hydraulic diffusivity As mentioned in section
