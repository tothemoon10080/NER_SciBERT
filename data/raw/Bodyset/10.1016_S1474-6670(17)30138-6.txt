Coal flotation is a nonlinear process with extreme static characteristics and dynamics described by the first order inertia with time delays. The control process is designed to maximize the concentrate yield of desired quality (ash content) which is equivalent to maximization of ash content in tailings. The control of the process presented in the paper has been based on a fuzzy algorithm of the reagent dosage control as a function of the solids concentration in the feed and its flow rate. The rule base of the algorithm can be corrected during the process of identification of the relation between ash content in tailings and amount of the reagent added. The concept of the control system and results of industrial and simulation tests have been presented in the paper.
