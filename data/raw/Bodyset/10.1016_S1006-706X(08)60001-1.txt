To avoid the nonuniform phenomena of heat and mass transfer of metallurgical powdery materials caused by conventional heating method, the temperature rise characteristics of carbon-containing chromite ore fines in the microwave field were investigated using microwave heating in a microwave metallurgical furnace. The experimental results show that the carbon-containing chromite ore fines have better temperature rise characteristics in the microwave field at a frequency of 2. 45 GHz. After heated in the microwave field of 10 kW, the temperature of 1 kg carbon-containing chromite ore fines rose up to 1 100 °C in 7 min, at a temperature rise rate of 157. 1 (°C · min−1 · kg−1), whereas the temperature of 1 kg carbon-containing magnetite ore fines rose only up to 1 000 °C in 10 min, at a temperature rise rate of 100 (°C · min−1 · kg−1). With increasing carbon-fitting ratios and by adding calcic lime, their heating effects changed regularly.
