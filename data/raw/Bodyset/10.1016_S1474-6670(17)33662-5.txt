The history of University of Miskolc and the Department of Automation are introduced. An overview is given about the subjects. “Industrial process control” and “Automation” are the most important subjects of the department. The theoretical education is complemented by laboratory exercises. Three laboratories are dedicated for these purposes, where conventional controllers, modern control theories and PLC technologies are available. A “Totally Integrated Automation System” has been realized. It consists of different technology models, PLC-s, industrial communication and process visualization systems. There is a distance connection to the laboratory of the Logistic Department through the university’s LAN network.
