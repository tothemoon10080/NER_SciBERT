The chapter discusses the effects of cutting on initial geometric imperfections of cold-formed steel stub columns with lipped C-section. Cold-formed steel columns are sensitive to initial geometric imperfections. The process of cutting a cold roll-formed steel lipped C-section to the specified length may lead to a cross-section distortion and cause initial geometric imperfections due to the release of residual stresses. Two kinds of roll-formed steel lipped C-sections of grade G450 are cut into stub columns, and the longitudinal and sectional initial geometric imperfections are measured with a laser transducer. The measured data prove that for the stub columns cut off from a long roll-formed steel lipped C-section member, the longitudinal geometric imperfections for different points in the section have different extent of changing as compared to the uncut member. The maximum changing values of the longitudinal imperfections happen at the up ends of the two flanges, while small change occurs in the middle of the webs. Little changes exist at the intersectant lines between the web and the flanges.
