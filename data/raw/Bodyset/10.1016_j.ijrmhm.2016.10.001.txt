WC-5wt%Ni coatings were fabricated onto 3CR12 stainless steel plates using low pressure cold spray deposition. The powder feed rate of the volumetric feeder was varied at 50% (23.6rpm, 6.8±1gmin−1), 75% (35.7rpm, 10.1±0.9gmin−1), and 100% (58.9rpm, 15±1.1gmin−1), and the resulting influence on the mechanical properties of the coatings was investigated. The results were analyzed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution and linear regression analysis. A new parameter to quantify WC particle refinement is proposed. A powder feed rate of 75% produced the best coating properties, achieving a high hardness (2.56GPa), low porosity (0.55%), high interfacial toughness (12.61MPam0.5), high Young's modulus (69.23GPa), and good fracture toughness (2.81MPam0.5). This feed rate appeared to be the optimum deposition parameter to produce dense coatings, achieving a high level of Ni plastic deformation and a high amount of refined WC particles, which are too small to cause significant erosion during impact, and are therefore better able to be retained by the ductile binder.Cold gas dynamic spraying has been employed to produce versatile coating applications in several industries over the past few decades In this study two different powders namely pure Ni (particle size distribution of − The coating specimens were prepared using standard metallographic procedures and polished to a 1 Crack density ( Each measured elemental composition of the EDS technique was then used to determine the Young's modulus (  Then, E To determine the critical load (F Niihara's The diagonal ( The above-mentioned analyses were performed on fifteen specimens from each spraying condition, with the final results being analyzed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution shown in Eq.
