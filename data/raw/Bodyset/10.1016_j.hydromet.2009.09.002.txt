The effect of Mn2+ ions on current efficiency (CE), deposit morphology and polarization behaviour during electrodeposition of zinc from acidic sulphate solutions was investigated. In the conditions studied, Mn2+ ions had no significant effect on CE over the concentration range of 1–10gdm−3. However, a decrease in CE of more than 35% was obtained at 50gdm−3. The cathodic polarization curves and the corresponding kinetics analysis demonstrated that this decrease in CE at higher concentrations of Mn2+ ions was due to the strong depolarizing effect of MnO4
                     − ions and other oxidized products of manganese. Moreover, the kinetics analysis of anodic polarization suggested that the presence of Mn2+ ions catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction. The addition of Mn2+ ions was also observed to change the surface morphology and deposit quality of the electrodeposited zinc, affecting the crystallographic orientation by significantly inhibiting the growth of (002) and (100) planes.It is well known that the zinc electrodeposition process is particularly sensitive to the presence of various metallic impurities in the electrolytic bath ( However, divalent manganese is quite different from the other metallic impurities. The amount of manganese contained in zinc concentrates can vary considerably and some manganese is advantageous for leaching and electrolysis. About 1.5–3 Manganese can also decrease the harmful influence of the other metal impurities.
