A contemporary review of adsorption chromatography must embrace aspects of fixed-bed, batch suspension and fluidised-bed contacting of complex feedstocks with adsorbents chemically derivatised with ligands with binding specificities for target bioproducts. Advances in the design of adsorbents, ligands and contactors have facilitated opportunities for integrated processing of unclarified feedstocks to benefit purity and yield of macromolecular products. In the face of competition from apparently simpler, yet productive, technologies (e.g. precipitation, crystallisation and aqueous solvent extraction), further advances in chromatographic purification of macromolecules and nanoparticulates demand close collaboration between inventors and/or manufacturers of new products and the suppliers of chromatographic hardware and consumables.The term liquid chromatography was originally coined to describe the fractionation of mixtures of solutes by means of differential, multistage partition between a mobile liquid phase and a second solid (or liquid) stationary phase. The definition remains classically sound, but in contemporary parlance has broadened to embrace additional aspects of analytical and preparative separations of chemical and biochemical moieties. Such fractionation typically exploits significant structural differences between products and unwanted impurities expressed as general molecular characters (charge, hydrophobicity, size, etc) or more specific features additionally characteristic of macromolecular products, such as surface domains and/or unique binding sites. Modern chromatographic practice has been characterised by the widespread adoption of liquid–solid partition systems exploiting the contacting of product-rich liquid feedstocks with (commonly) porous solid phases. These are derivatised with specific chemistries to facilitate the predominantly selective adsorption of products rather than a differential, competitive adsorptive partition between products and impurities. Such selective adsorption, as in the interaction between an antibody protein and immobilised protein A, is commonly described (together with subsequent desorption) as chromatography, whereas the term process chromatography effectively embraces all the practices described above undertaken in up-scaled, preparative operations as an integral part of the manufacture of defined products. The present review addresses the broadest possible definition of process chromatography as applied to a product range embracing both macromolecules and bionanoparticulates (e.g. proteins through viral vectors to plasmid DNA). It concentrates upon adsorptive processes rather than high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and largely avoids reference to established size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (but see The adoption of process chromatography in the proprietary up-scaled manufacture of valuable biocommodities prescribes that detailed discussion of the success, constraints and future development of such operations is not commonly found in the public literature. The present review thus draws upon impressions gained from attendance at state-of-the-art conferences in the period 1999–2001, cited herein as meeting abstracts, as well as relevant commercial and academic literature published in a similar time frame Overall, it is clear that process chromatography (in fixed-bed, batch and fluidised-bed contactors as reviewed herein) remains the method of choice for selective fractionation and concentration of macromolecular commodities and the new expanding portfolio of nanoparticulate bioproducts. However, concerns are growing with regard to the capital and consumable costs of such processes (hardware, adsorbents, buffer costs, etc) together with the maintenance costs of the validated cleaning and re-use of expensive adsorbent materials (extensively presented in The commonest application of process scale chromatography exploits up-scaled application of fixed-bed or column contactors There continues to be an intense search for new selective ligands that are (commonly disregarded) robust in the face of the stringent challenge of conditions imposed by operational cycles (adsorption, washing, desorption) and essential intermediate cleaning and sanitisation (regeneration) pro-cedures. Despite many elegant examples from contemporary research, such as the work of Nygren and colleagues A good example of the latter would be the application of peptide ligands sourced from combinatorial chemistry or phage display libraries that replicate or mimic the localised binding interactions of larger molecules A further development has been the identification of mixed mode and hydrophobic charge induction ligands Additional to the selection and immobilisation methodologies applied to chromatographic ligands are considerations of accessibility to products and the impact of the degree of deployment (i.e. percentage utilisation) in performance upon working capacities and productivities (i.e. product mass recovered per unit mass of ligand). Developments in the harnessing of techniques of confocal scanning laser and micro-Raman microscopies In process chromatography, convective flow governs the transport of products in the extra-particle void of the packed adsorbent, whereas diffusion (influenced by product size and particle diameter) governs transport within adsorbent particles. Particle size and bed-depth influence the pressure drop across, and flow rate through, the contactor together with any system tolerance for suspended solids (cells, cell debris, precipitates, etc). It is generally a mandatory requirement that upstream clarification of feedstocks destined for fixed-bed chromatography be achieved by discrete unit operations of centrifugation, microfiltration and/or depth filtration. There continues to be an interest in the development and exploitation of adsorbents (both beaded and monolithic configurations) possessed of very large mega- or gigapores (up to 800 nm diameter) that accommodate high convective flow rates to the benefit of process throughput Enlarged pore structures may also bestow a tolerance of particulates in unclarified feedstocks, or the accommodation of nanoparticulate products such as adenovirus or plasmid DNA Chromatographic capacity is clearly governed by the reactive surface area available for product adsorption offered by the material construction of the adsorbent, and the depth and diameter of the contactor into which it is packed. Considerations of biocompatibility have meant that adsorbents have been predominantly constructed from biopolymers such as dextran, agarose and cellulose (or their synthetic mimics), which commonly compress under applied hydrostatic pressures unless heavily cross-linked by chemical treatments during manufacture. An alternative approach to particle strengthening has been to exploit rigid, mineral oxide particles based upon dioxides of silicon, titanium, zirconium or hafnium whose beaded macroporous structures may be filled with biocompatible hydrogel derivatives suitable for high-capacity protein adsorption However, with compressible elastic homohydrogel adsorbents, there has (despite extensive chemical cross-linking) been an inherent limitation upon the depth of bed packing that can be efficiently operated, and fixed-bed contactors have been conventionally up-scaled with respect to bed diameter. Dimensions of a metre or more place severe constraints upon quality of packing of adsorbents and the design of contactor end plates. These govern the even distribution and collection of fluid flowthrough and the concomitant maintenance of molecular fractionation and concentration (i.e. minimal zone mixing) achieved within the bed (variously discussed in The high cost of adsorbents and associated operating consumables is demanding a reconsideration of operational strategies. Here, instead of intermittent operation of large contactors with discrete bulk batches of impure product, smaller adsorbent contactors might be more intensively and economically operated in back-to-back processing of subbatches before pooling of recovered product The mixing of adsorbent media with product-rich feedstocks in simple slurry-contacting procedures can be an effective way to positively adsorb target products. Charged adsorbents can be recovered by simple settling, centrifugation or filtration operations, and subsequently washed, desorbed and regenerated for re-use in similar batch suspension procedures. Adoption of appropriate decantation washing procedures permits this capture to be achieved in the presence of cells or cell debris, as with whole fermentation broths, cell disruptates or coarsely clarified extracts (discussed in The availability of cheaper materials might service a market niche for single use adsorbents subsequently disposed of to avoid the economic burden of validated cleaning and regeneration before conventional re-use. Subtractive adsorption—wherein the adsorbent is deployed in a batch suspension contactor to capture process or product antagonists such as viral or prion contaminants The inclusion of the topic of batch adsorption in a review of process chromatography is justified here by the emergence of two procedures that may overcome practical problems encountered where rapid processing of crude feedstocks is required. These may be unsuited to fixed-bed contactors by virtue of their large volume or the presence of suspended solids (e.g. unclarified or partially clarified fermentation broths and cell disruptates). The first development is an integrated process, termed suspended-bed chromatography The second contemporary application of batch procedures that deserves highlighting is termed high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS Perhaps the greatest potential advance in practical capabilities available to the bioprocess engineer has been the development of expanded-bed or fluidised-bed chromatography. Described in 1993 as ‘the first new process operation in decades’ A pragmatic, working definition of classified FBA describes the process of product capture upon selective adsorbents (in the manner of selective chromatography), characterised by a distribution of particle diameters and enhanced densities of construction, and operated in a fluid velocity field that facilitates an increase of effective bed expansion from the settled state at zero or low fluid velocities. The increase in bed voidage enables the less hindered flowthrough of biological particulates (as contained in whole fermentation broths, cell disruptates and biological extracts) than that possible in a fixed bed, without significant diminution of chromatographic fractionation and performance (discussed in However, after an initial period of intense research into methodologies A common observation appears to be that presently available adsorbents and contactors cope best with biomass concentrations of whole broths or cell disruptates equivalent to 10–15% wet weight whole cells (pre- or post-disruption) if reasonable fluid throughput is to be achieved (200–300 cm/h; discussed in There is a tension, however, between the desire to increase particle density yet decrease particle diameter to minimise the path length for product diffusion if full and rapid utilization of adsorbent capacity is to be achieved. This raises interesting questions regarding the physical design and mode of deployment of the density enhancing materials commonly combined with biocompatible polymers in the manufacture of adsorbent solid phases. One approach simply mixes small, dense particles with polymers such as agarose as a preliminary to fabrication in a bead emulsification process The manufacture of proteins from fermentation feedstocks commonly proceeds by a series of unit operations deployed in a sequence to achieve solid–liquid fractionation (after cell harvest and/or cell disruption as appropriate) followed by product concentration, fractionation and formulation as demanded by the specifications of end use. The overall product yield of a process is governed by the numbers and individual yields of discrete operations, amongst which various numbers of process chromatography steps (as broadly defined herein) will be deployed to achieve the necessary fractionation of product from impurities. It is widely recognised that effective integration of such processes will benefit the overall yield and efficiency of manufacture Process integration is widely and variously interpreted in terms of three levels of sophistication. In the first, effective sequencing and dovetailing of operations is exploited to benefit the overall process The operation of a fluidised-bed adsorber directly integrated downstream of a cell disrupter to achieve online capture of intracellular products is an analogous application of DPS. Here, the primary capture of l-asparaginase and G3PDH has been demonstrated, respectively, from cell suspensions of Many of the new products of biotechnology are nano-particulate in nature (20–300 nm particle diameter) as exemplified by viral and non-viral gene therapy vectors In this context, the physical properties of pellicular absorbent might confer useful process advantages The fractionation power of process chromatography in all the operational guises presented here (fixed-bed, batch and fluidised-bed contactors operated discretely or in fully integrated processes) offers an attractive means of effectively separating molecular, macromolecular and nanoparticulate bioproducts from unwanted contaminants. A future requirement will increasingly be process compatibility with transgenic feedstocks derived from animal milk, egg white or plant tissues (discussed in However, the investment and running costs of process chromatography are a matter of concern (discussed in In response to these challenges, practical chromatographic solutions are emerging from both academic and commercial research laboratories. In particular, the development of enhanced density/high-performance adsorbents applicable to precisely integrated bioprocesses confirms the power of the technique when generically harnessed to the manufacture of a wide variety of product types. It is essential that manufacturers of process chromatography adsorbents and contactors work closely with the inventors and contract manufacturers of new products and processes to ensure that the necessary tools are made available for the critical task of purifying bioproducts and bringing them to market.
