The carpus complexity explains the great difficulty of the traumatism coverage. Lesions are prevailed by perilunate dislocation, scapholunate dislocation and scaphoid fractures. The other hurts are trivial. Symptoms are pain and loss of wrist strength, reversible for an acute and well treated lesion. Too often, these ligament injuries are late diagnosed. For deadline upper to 6 weeks, the ligamentary repair is vain. These complex and mature lesions are potentially highly arthrosic on the radiocarpal and mediocarpal joints. Improvement of wrist surgery permits to mitigate these chronic lesions. Various surgical techniques allow preserving a functional wrist; wrist arthrodesis is not any more the only solution for these arthrosic wrists. For a decade, the arthroscopy contributed to better understand the traumas of carp but also to better heal them. For acute or chronic ligament injuries without degenerative osteoarthritis, arthroscopy is the processing of future. This technique requires a long learning curve and the various arthroscopic techniques must be validated.
