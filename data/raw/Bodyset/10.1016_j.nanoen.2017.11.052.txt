Understanding how lithium-ion batteries function down to the atomic level during charge and discharge cycling can provide valuable guidance to optimize structure-property relationships and to design and understand new electrode materials. Lithium insertion and reactions with the electrodes during charge and discharge cycling can occur via metastable structures with complex ordering and related non-equilibrium phenomena. Remarkably, these processes remain still poorly understood despite their significance in the operation of lithium battery systems in critical technologies. In this communication, we present the dynamics of lithium insertion into Co3O4 and the evolution of metastable phases as probed by in-situ transmission electron microscopy, in concert with first principles density functional theory calculations. We show that the initial lithium intercalation reaction occurs with the formation of several metastable and intermediate phases, followed by a sequence of conversion reactions that perturb and expand the cubic-close-packed oxygen array, ultimately generating an end-product of finely dispersed cobalt metal clusters within a Li2O matrix. The calculated non-equilibrium lithiation pathways corroborate with the experimental lithiation voltages, and explain the significant hysteresis that occurs during electrochemical cycling. The data provide new insights into the complexity of solid state lithium electrochemistry in metal oxides that are relevant to advancing lithium battery technology.Lithium insertion reactions contribute significantly to the electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries that currently dominate the worldâ€™s growing rechargeable battery industry, while conversion reactions hold significant promise for the next generation batteries, due to their large capacities Traditional Li-ion battery electrodes, such as layered LiCoO The reaction of lithium with cobalt oxides and iron oxides, such as Co A severe hysteresis (~ 1.0 V) has been observed in the voltage/capacity plot of cycled Li/Li Specifically, we have studied the room temperature, electrochemical discharge behavior of Co Co A nanobattery design was built inside TEM by using the nanofactory STM-TEM holder, which can provide a positive/negative bias between two electrodes in the circuit.
