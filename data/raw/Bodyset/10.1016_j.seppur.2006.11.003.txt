The photodegradation of orange II by TiO2 supported on three adsorbents namely MCM-41, Montmorillonite and β-Zeolite was studied under different conditions. The surface properties of the catalysts varied with solution pH and strong adsorption of orange II occurred at low pH (below pHPZCof the supported catalysts), while the maximum photodegradation rate occurred at an optimum pH range of 4–5 for the supported catalysts as compared to 2.5 for the unsupported TiO2 (Degussa P25). Although the adsorption and subsequent photodegradation of orange II were better for the supported catalysts compared to the unsupported TiO2, complete mineralization occurred only in presence of small amount of ozone, but at lower power consumption as compared to Degussa P25. The results indicate that TiO2 supported on porous adsorbents is a potential catalyst system for the continuous removal of complex organics from water.Heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO Strategies of enhancing the adsorption of substrates on the catalyst surface have been focused on the use of various porous solid supports, such as activated carbon The synthetic dyes are resistant to biological treatment, and can produce harmful byproducts during hydrolysis, oxidation, or other chemical reactions taking place in the wastewater Orange II and titanium tetra Orange II concentration and total organic carbon (TOC) of the solution were measured by UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1601, Shimadzu) and a TOC analyzer (5000A, Shimadzu) with ASI-5000A autosampler, respectively. The concentration of H The dark adsorption and photodegradation experiments were performed in a semi-batch swirl flow reactor The prepared catalysts were characterized fully using X-ray diffraction, SEM, XPS and BET analyzers and the details were presented earlier The morphology of the supported catalysts was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM coupled with an EDX microprobe furnished a semi-quantitative elemental analysis of the surface indicating that Ti was present almost all over the supports with uniform dispersion. The pore volume and specific surface area were determined using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm and multi-point BET analysis. The electrical charge of the solid surface controls the surface property of the particles and greatly affects its adsorption behavior. The dark adsorption kinetics of orange II at different pH for the supported catalysts and unsupported TiO As shown in The adsorption constants of TiO Initially, control tests on orange II with pure adsorbents in presence of 365 As shown in In order to determine the extent of mineralization of orange II, TOC value of the solution was measured during the photodegradation and The major intermediates formed during photodegradation of orange II are The enhancement of photodegradation rate by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and ozone is attributed to two factors: (i) both hydrogen peroxide and ozone act as electron acceptor to reduce the recombination rate of the photogenerated hole-electron pairs: e The reaction rates of orange II and TOC degradation were found to increase with the addition of H However, it was observed that photodegradation rates of both orange II and TOC decreased with the increase in hydrogen peroxide dosages, and in fact were inhibited at concentration 0.04 Monitoring H The photocatalytic degradation of orange II over TiO The authors wish to acknowledge the funding for the research from the National University of Singapore.
