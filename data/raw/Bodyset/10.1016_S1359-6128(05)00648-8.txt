This review highlights the main merger and acquisition deals that took place during 2004. Consolidation has become a defining market trend within the pump industry over recent years, driven by the mature nature of the pump sector and by opportunities to expand geographically, add product and grow the customer base. In between Grundfos's acquisition of Phillip Hilge in January and Dover Resources' purchase of Almatec in December, the pump landscape has changed considerably in 2004. And the deals keep coming. Effective 1 January 2005, Grundfos acquired Alldos, ensuring that 2005 is already off to a strong start on the acquisition front.
