An improved process for the leaching of vanadium from vanadium slag assisted by electro-oxidation was developed to increase the leaching ratio of vanadium. Factors associated with the leaching process were investigated, and a high vanadium leaching ratio (>70%) was achieved under the optimal leaching condition of 40wt.% H2SO4, 250g/L solid concentration, anode current of 0.4A, operating potential of 2.8–3.0V, and electrode spacing of 20mm at 75°C for 4h. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the spinels and silicate were the major phases in the vanadium slag, and vanadium was in the form of FeV2O4 (namely of FeO·V2O3). Scanning electron microscopy studies indicated that the spinels were broken into small pieces and vanadium was exposed on the surface, leading to facile oxidation and high vanadium leaching ratio, and demonstrated that electro-oxidation could significantly enhance the leaching process.Vanadium is conventionally regenerated from recovered materials, such as vanadium titanium magnetite, spent catalyst, fly ashes from oil industry and vanadium slag ( Enhancing the leaching process by employing electro-oxidation is an excellent alternative method because higher valent vanadium (VO The present work focuses on the electro-oxidation hydrometallurgical leaching process with H The vanadium slag was obtained from Pan Gang Group Company, Sichuan Province, China. The main chemical compositions were determined by X-Ray Fluorescence and listed in All aqueous solutions were prepared with distilled water. Other chemicals including H The leaching experiments were performed in a 500 The calculations for the leaching ratio were based on the following equation: Where The effects of temperature on the vanadium leaching ratio of different leaching ways were examined at 55–95°°C, and the results ( The effects of sulfuric acid concentration on vanadium leaching ratio of different leaching ways are shown in The role of leaching time on the leaching ratio of vanadium is shown in The influence of current (0.2–1.0 The vanadium slags before and after electro-oxidation leaching were characterized by XRD and the results are shown in SEM images ( The mechanism of electro-oxidation assisted leaching of vanadium slag in acidic conditions is shown in Ore suspending particles are directly oxidized when they collided with the anode. The productions of Mn Other anode productions (e.g. iron oxidizations) can oxidize vanadium indirectly. Other cathode productions (e.g. H The reactions on anode: The reactions on cathode: Moreover, Mn As well as ferric can oxidize vanadium: In this process, the leaching ratio is improved due to oxidation of M(V The electro-oxidation with oxidants leaching method effectively developed an optimized process to enhance vanadium slag leaching and demonstrated a leaching ratio of 75.64% at 75°°C for 4 This work was financially supported by
