A method is proposed to calibrate the well known population balance model to batch grinding test results using a data reconciliation approach. The method uses empirical representations for the breakage and selection functions. The main difference between the proposed method and conventional calibration approaches is related to the fact that the feed size distribution is estimated as well as the product size distributions observed for various grinding times. The method is illustrated with data from a batch grinding test.Batch grinding tests are useful to study the effect of operating variables, such as the ball and lifter size and shape, rotation speed and slurry density ( Batch grinding tests are conducted by preparing a feed sample from which a sub sample is taken for sieving. A selected weight of the feed sample is loaded into a grinding mill that is rotated for a given time and unloaded to get a sample of the ground material for size distribution. The sieved sample is put back with the charge and the procedure is repeated for another grinding time period. The batch grinding process is described using the PBM as: The solution to Eq. The model calibration and data reconciliation criterion is formulated as: The criterion of Eq. The application of the calibration procedure to the data of The observed and estimated feed and product size distributions are given in A method is proposed to calibrate the population balance model to batch grinding tests using a data reconciliation approach for which the feed and grinding product size distributions are reconciled with the calibrated model. The procedure is statistically correct as it allows the estimation of the feed size distribution that contains measurement errors as for the product size distributions.
