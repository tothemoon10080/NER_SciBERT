It is well known that the properties of the finished component are of most interest to the engineers working with the superplasticity. The occurrence of superplasticity at a specific elevated temperature depends upon the value of the strain rate sensitivity parameter ( Professor Hiroaki Ohsawa Careful examination of the strain rate sensitivity parameter defined in Regarding the physical dimension of
