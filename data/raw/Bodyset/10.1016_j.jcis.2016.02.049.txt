In this paper, we report a highly sensitive amperometric H2O2 sensor based on silver nanowires (AgNWs) modified screen printed carbon electrode. The AgNWs were synthesized using polyol method. The synthesized AgNWs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The average diameter and length of the synthesized AgNWs were found as 86±5 and 385nm, respectively. Under optimum conditions, the AgNWs modified electrode shows a stable amperometric response for H2O2 and was linear over the concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 704.8μM. The non-enzymatic sensor showed a high sensitivity of 662.6μAmM−1
                     cm−2 with a detection limit of 29nM. The response time of the sensor was found as 2s. Furthermore, the AgNWs modified electrode exhibited a good recovery of H2O2 (94.3%) in the human blood serum samples.An accurate and reliable detection of hydrogen peroxide (H The iron redox enzymes are widely used as a selective probe for the detection of H Herein, we report a selective and sensitive amperometric detection of H Silver nitrate, sodium chloride and ethanol were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Ethylene glycol (EG), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) with Mw Cyclic voltammetry and amperometry The AgNWs were synthesized by polyol method with little modification of previously reported literatures The AgNWs dispersion was prepared by dispersing of 1  The synthesized AgNWs was characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy and XRD. The electrocatalytic activity of as synthesized AgNWs towards H The electrochemical behavior of AgNWs modified electrode was further investigated in PBS containing 200 The effect of pH on the reduction peak current of H  The selectivity of the AgNWs modified electrode towards H In order to evaluate the practical ability of the fabricated sensor, the AgNWs modified electrode was evaluated for the detection of H The operational stability of the sensor was evaluated by amperometry and the results are shown in In conclusion, an amperometric H This project was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
