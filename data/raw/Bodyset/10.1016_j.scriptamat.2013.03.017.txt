TiC nanoplatelet-reinforced titanium composites were synthesized through a novel fabrication approach that combines resol nanosphere (10–30nm) coating with conventional powder metallurgy. The resulting TiC nanoplatelets, 28–130nm thick, are self-assembled, well aligned in each individual grain but randomly orientated throughout the microstructure. The as-sintered Ti–TiC composites exhibit outstanding compressive properties, with ultimate strength=2.54GPa, yield strength=1.52GPa and strain to fracture=44.4%, stronger than all other advanced Ti materials reported to date. Both Ti–TiB and Ti–TiC MMCs are currently reinforced with micrometric TiB or TiC. Nanometric ceramic reinforcements, including nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibres and nanoplatelets, have the potential to further noticeably improve the mechanical properties of the MMCs at a smaller volume fraction compared to micrometric reinforcements However, to date, neither in situ nor ex situ conventional ingot metallurgy or powder metallurgy routes have proved to be promising in the fabrication of nanometric Ti–TiB or Ti–TiC MMCs Along with reinforcement dimensions, volume fraction and dispersion, the alignment of the reinforcements in the matrix has long been recognized to be another key issue that affects the strengthening efficiency This work reports on the fabrication and characterization of a nanometric Ti MMC which shows outstanding compressive properties, superior to all other advanced Ti materials reported to date, including Ti-based bulk metallic glasses Hydride dehydride (HDH) Ti powder (particle size: <150 The morphology of the coated and uncoated Ti powders was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Neon 40EsB; Philips XL30) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The sintered density was measured using the Archimedes method  TEM revealed that the matrix is hexagonal α-Ti and the reinforcement is non-stoichiometric TiC The Ti–TiC MMC shows microstructural similarities to the lamellar Fe–Fe The Ti–TiC MMCs fabricated show outstanding mechanical properties and an extended linear hardening regime beyond the high yielding strength (see The ultrahigh strength of the novel Ti–TiC composites arises from the interstitial content and grain refinement, as well as the locally aligned TiC nanoplatelets. Their contributions can be estimated based on the hardness increment (1466 In summary, we have developed a new type of self-assembled, locally aligned TiC nanoplatelet-reinforced Ti matrix composites with outstanding compressive properties. The fabrication method consists of coating the Ti powder with resol nanospheres (10–30
