Thanks to their lightweight, low cost and high flexibility, electroactive polymers (EAPs) have attracted the attention of both research and industrial communities. In particular, electrostrictive polymers have been widely used for the development of large strain actuators such as artificial muscles. However, the polarization and strain abilities of such materials are highly dependent on the sample thickness, for example because of a non-uniform space charge distribution caused by interface effects. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model taking into account the thickness effect on the actuation abilities of dielectric electrostrictive polymers, based on a continuous variation over the depth of the permittivity that can be seen as a surface effect. It is shown that this approach allows taking into account several effects, such as permittivity maximization for an optimal thickness. In addition, the paper introduces a simple relationship between the equivalent permittivity and the polarization saturation that limits the strain, allowing a good performance assessment of the actuation abilities of such devices. Dielectric measurements made on 20∼220μm thick films demonstrated the validity of the proposed model, showing maximal permittivity around 100μm, and strain ability assessments carried out on films ranging from 20 to 95μm exhibited the highest strain response for the same thicknesses for low electric field excitations, and for lower thicknesses as the electric field is increased because of saturation effect, which was well predicted by the pseudo-empirical approach.The need of low-frequency, large strain actuators (for instance for robotic applications, artificial muscles or micropumps) and sensors has placed a particular interest on electroactive polymers (EAPs - Two mechanisms may usually be involved in electrostriction: either the strain is induced by ionic displacement, or by dielectric forces. Although the latter effect features moderate strain, it can be operated at higher frequencies while ionic displacement presents very high time responses. Hence, a large amount of work has been devoted in increasing the electromechanical response of dielectric-actuated electrostrictive materials, such as the use of irradiated samples However, several studies have shown that the electromechanical response of EAPs is strongly dependent on the thickness of the sample The paper is organized as follows. This section proposes a semi-empirical model of the thickness dependence of the dielectric permittivity based on a non-uniform space charge distribution, caused by the existence of interfacial polarization effects due to the presence of heterogeneities in the materials, as suggested by Su et al. In order to take into account the interfacial polarization that occurs at the surface of the material, the principles of the proposed model consist in considering a non-uniform space charge distribution that leads to the expression of the permittivity variation in a similar way to two skin effects with opposite signs such that:      Then, from the local expression of the dielectric constant, it is possible to express the macroscopic apparent permittivity  For very thin films ( In other words, the initial increase of the permittivity is explained by space charge distribution in the vicinity of the interface. Such a distribution may however lead to destructive interferences (and thus reduced permittivity) as the film thickness decreases because the latter is not large enough to allow a complete distribution of the space charges. On the other hand, the decrease of the permittivity after the optimal thickness is actually occurring because space charges are totally distributed near the interfaces. Therefore, only dipolar polarization, which presents much lower permittivity than interfacial polarization induced by space charge distribution near the surface, occurs in the core of the material, yielding a decreased equivalent permittivity. Physically speaking, the space charge distribution occurs because of a partial blocking of charge carriers at the interface between the electrode and the sample The purpose of this sub-section is to compare the proposed semi-empirical model with experimental permittivities obtained on pure poylurethane (PU) films with different thicknesses. PU films were obtained from polyether-type thermoplastic granules (58888 TPU-Estane) using solution cast method The obtained samples were then placed between two circular brass disks that acted as electrodes. Triangle-shaped voltage at 0.1 In order to compute the permittivity from the strain measurements, the low electric field, linear constitutive equation of electrostriction giving the strain    The value of the constant Then, from the value of  Once the experimental permittivities obtained, the previous model has been applied in order to check the validity of the pseudo-empirical approach.  The second part of this paper is to evaluate the actuation abilities in terms of strain for varying thickness of the sample for low and high electric field values. Although it is generally thought that the higher the permittivity, the better the performance, a polarization saturation effect actually occurs for high electric field values because of a saturation of the dipolar orientation The saturation effect for medium electric fields   Hence, for low electric field values, the dependence of the strain with the squared permittivity is conserved, but for high electric fields, the polarization and strain are no longer evolving:  In the followings it is considered that the saturation electric field, which is also strongly thickness-dependent, varies with the permittivity following a power law as:  As expected, previous strain measurements exhibited a strain saturation effect that can be attributed to a saturation of dipole orientation within the polymer matrix (polarization modification by heating through Joule effect is negligible because of the high equivalent parallel resistance of the polymer – typically greater than 100 From the theoretical fitted data, the predicted absolute strain values as a function of the applied electric field for each sample can be plotted using Eqs. The permittivity variation over the depth obtained from the proposed model is depicted in However, because of the permittivity dependence with the saturation electric field, the choice of an electrostrictive material for actuation lies in a trade-off between the low electric field response, where the highest permittivity is desired (and where the thickness has therefore to be set to its optimal value) in order to get the maximum strain variation, and the maximum absolute strain at the saturation of the polarization (high electric field response), which also depends on the saturation electric field that varies in an opposite way than the dielectric constant. According to Eqs.  This paper proposed a pseudo-empirical approach for modeling the thickness effect on the actuation abilities of dielectric electrostrictive polymers. Based on a continuous, non-linear variation of the space charge distribution and thus of the local dielectric constant over the depth of the material considering both a permittivity increasing and a permittivity decreasing effects with different penetration depths, it has been shown that such an approach allows relating the optimal thickness that maximizes the permittivity, and hence the low electric field response of electrostrictive actuators. In addition, the relationship between the dielectric constant and the electric field value where the electrostrictive response saturates has been investigated and experimentally validated, showing that the higher the permittivity, the lower the saturation field and thus the maximum strain, denoting a trade-off between the low electric field response (dependent on the permittivity) and the strain saturation at high electric fields.
