There has been a tremendous increase of cultured products containing probiotic bacteria in the past two decades. In order to produce probiotic products which, show health benefits, bacterial cells should be present in a viable form at certain numbers during the shelf life of the product. Microencapsulation of bacterial cells is currently gaining attention to increase viability of probiotic bacteria in food systems. There have been several encapsulation techniques that are already used such as spray drying, spray-cooling, fluid-bed agglomeration and coating, freeze and vacuum drying, emulsion-based techniques, coacervation, extrusion-based techniques, adhesion to starch granules and compression coating in terms of encapsulation of the probiotics for their use in the fermented and other functional food products. Recently, alternative techniques; e.g., electrospraying and electrospinning techniques have emerged for efficiently encapsulation of probiotic bacteria. This work reviews a methodological approach for encapsulation techniques including their pros and cons as well as choice of appropriate technology in terms of final yield and level of cell viability.
