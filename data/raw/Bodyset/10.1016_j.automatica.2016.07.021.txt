In this paper, a new optimization problem is addressed for node selection that has application potentials in input/output switches for sensors in control system design and leader determination in social networks. The purpose of the addressed problem is to develop a strategy for selecting a subset of nodes as controlled nodes in order to minimize certain objective function consisting of the convergence speed and the energy of control action, over a finite time-horizon. For networks with fixed controlled nodes, an upper bound of the objective function is obtained which is shown to be convex and independent of the time-horizon. For networks with switched controlled nodes, a greedy algorithm is proposed to reduce the computation complexity resulting from the length of the time-horizon, where the nodes selection is carried out over divided small time-intervals. The cost gap is also analyzed between the strategy of optimizing over the whole time-horizon and the strategy of optimizing over the small intervals. Finally, the proposed nodes selection strategy is validated through simulations and two regions are found in which the number of optimal controlled nodes is determined.Consensus-based dynamical networks have proven to be an effective yet flexible framework for modeling the multi-agent information sharing problems involving cooperative tasks with examples including wireless sensor navigation, spacecraft formation control, mobile robot rendezvous and unmanned aerial vehicle flocking. The last decade has witnessed surged research interest on the consensus problem and a rich body of results has been reported in the literature, see e.g. In parallel with the controllability problem of multi-agent systems, the nodes selection problem has been a research focus over the past few years due to the fact that a suitable selection of the nodes would have a major impact on the effectiveness of adopting control technologies in real-world applications. For example, in the area of control system design, it is vitally important to select appropriate input/output sensors so as to maintain the desired control performances. In social networks, needless to say, selecting the right leaders is the key to ensure efficient spreading of the information to the whole network. The nodes selection problem has been recently studied for leaderâ€“follower systems and many results have appeared, see In this paper, we consider a class of cooperative tracking problem ( It is widely recognized that the main challenge in selecting nodes stems from the Boolean constraints which give rise to a combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we introduce an iterative method to relax the Boolean constraints to a convex hull by replacing the  Consider a network described as an undirected graph In the network, each node updates its state as Here, By collecting all the states of the nodes, we define In this paper, we are interested in designing an algorithm to determine It is worth mentioning that the reachability problem of the cooperative tracking protocol have been studied extensively. The following result follows from the existing results in   Under the assumption that  Note that the reachability of the cooperative tracking protocol In the following, we endeavor to study the nodes selection problem by answering the following fundamental question:   As can be seen from In this case, the controlled nodes are fixed during the whole time horizon and the selection matrix Letting   Since It follows from By  The main improvement of formulation (  To the best of our knowledge, the studies for the nodes selection in a dynamical network topology are less. Recently, the work ( For a large-scale network, the Boolean combinatorial problem In problem As discussed above, we have relaxed the fixed nodes selection problem as a suboptimal convex optimization problem. In practice, node faults and communication disruptions occur frequently, and this motivates us to investigate the switched nodes selection problem, where the controlled nodes are switched at each time step. Similar to the analysis for fixed nodes selection, we rewrite the cost function to be minimized as By induction, we have Obviously, when Thus, we can address the optimization problem  Recall that the objective function in Subsequently, a question is how to measure the gap of   Similar to Starting at time Similarly, we have Using  For the fixed nodes case, the gap analysis between the non-convex and the resulting convex problem is not provided, which is largely dependent on the enlarging techniques employed in the transformation process. In the area of combinatorial optimization, some existing methods are used to analyze the gap between non-convex optimization problem and its convex relaxation by sub-modularity, see In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy for the nodes selection problem via simulation study. We choose an undirected network with First, we study the selection of fixed controlled node in the case when Moreover, it is worth mentioning that nodes Next, let us investigate the relationship between the minimum value It can be seen from In this paper, we have considered the selection problem of controlled nodes with the goal of minimizing the objective function that caters both the energy of control actions and the convergence speed. We have addressed the nodes selection as a combinatorial optimization problem, and further reformulated it using a convex relaxation based on a reweighed
