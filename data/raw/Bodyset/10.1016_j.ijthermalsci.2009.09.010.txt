Unsteady mass transfer between two rigid spheres in tandem and a surrounding fluid flow with reversible second-order chemical reaction on the surface of the spheres has been analysed. The spheres have the same diameter and initial concentration. The dispersed phase reactant and product are insoluble in the continuous phase. The continuous phase reactant and product are insoluble in the dispersed phase. Axisymmetric, slow, viscous flow (Stokes flow) around the spheres was considered. The mass balance equations were solved numerically in spherical/bispherical coordinates systems by a finite difference nonlinear multigrid method.

Because most ion exchangers are practically insoluble in the aqueous phase, the chemical reaction between the ion exchanger and the extracted component is assumed to take place on the interface. In almost all cases of practical interest, the chemical reaction is second-order, reversible. Mass transfer from/to a single drop with chemical reaction on the surface of the drop was analysed theoretically (to our knowledge) only in The analysis of carrier-extraction from two rigid spheres in tandem is the subject of this work. To our knowledge, this problem was not investigated until now. The forced convection heat/mass transfer around two/three spheres in tandem was analysed theoretically in Consider the steady, axisymmetric, creeping flow of a Newtonian incompressible fluid past two rigid spheres of equal diameter during the mass transfer, the volume and the shape of the spheres remain constant (this implicitly means that the diameter of the spheres remains constant); the physical properties are constant; no phase change occurs; the system is isothermal; the only diffusion mechanism is the Fick diffusion mechanism; cross-diffusion effects are neglected; the effects of free and Marangoni convections are negligible. The ion exchangers used frequently in carrier-extraction are tensioactive substances. From this reason, the assumption of spheres with rigid surfaces can be considered quite acceptable. For mass transfer inside the spheres we used the axisymmetric spherical coordinate system ( Under these assumptions, the dimensionless mathematical model equations (the radius of the spheres is considered the length scale, the free stream velocity inside the spheres in the surrounding fluid ( A reference diffusion coefficient, The boundary conditions to be satisfied are: spheres center ( free stream ( symmetry axis ( interface ( The quantities of interest used to characterize the unsteady mass transfer are: (1) spheres and surface of the spheres dimensionless concentrations and (2) local and overall instantaneous Sherwood numbers. The dimensionless spheres average concentrations of the species The values of the dimensionless stream function were calculated numerically in The numerical method used to solve the discrete parabolic equations is the parabolic nonlinear multigrid (MG) algorithm The dimensionless equations The value considered for Before presenting and discussing the results obtained in this work, it should be mentioned that: (a) for Stokes flow around two equal-sized spheres in tandem, the stream function is symmetric about an axis perpendicular in The main aim of any work dedicated to heat/mass transfer around two (at least) bodies submerged into a flowing fluid is to find the rules of interaction. In all the previous articles dedicated to the heat/mass transfer from two spheres in tandem, the values of the the increase in spheres spacing decreases the interaction effects. The target of the present process is the extraction of species The first numerical simulations were made considering the diffusivity ratios equal to one,  The present Concerning the influence of the increase in for very small values of for for the rules mentioned previously do not change for The previous statements describe globally the interaction. The elementary steps (stages) of the process are: for very short times, in the diffusion regime, the interaction effects are not present; the mass transfer rates for both spheres are the same; the first interaction effects were observed for species the chemical species The next step of the present work is the analysis of the influence of the initial concentration ratio In Stokes–Einstein or Eyring theories, the diffusion coefficient of a solute into a solvent depends on its molar volume. In almost all cases of practical interest in carrier-extraction, the product The presence of the chemical species This work investigated numerically the carrier-extraction from two spheres in tandem. The spheres have the same diameter, initial composition and physical properties. Stokes flow around the spheres was assumed. The influence of spheres spacing on the mass transfer inside the spheres was investigated for moderate values of the The present numerical results show that: (1) the increase in spheres spacing increases the mass transfer rate inside the spheres; (2) for very small values of spheres spacing the mass transfer rate inside the spheres is practically the same; (3) the increase in the spheres spacing increases the difference between the mass transfer rate inside the spheres; the mass transfer rate inside the upstream sphere is greater than inside the downstream sphere; (4) for
