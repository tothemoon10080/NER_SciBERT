The authors regret < There is only one mistake in Fig. 10. Please see the PDF file for the paper, and replace the yellow words in Fig. 10 by “the lower-layer parameters (ϕ and δt) are 6° and 2.0 s, 23° and 1.1 s, 2°, and 1.2 s, 27°, and 1.2 s. For the upper layers, ϕ and δt are 66° and 1.2 s, 72° and 0.75 s, 70° and 0.95 s, 79°, and 0.55 s, respectively. >.  Fig. 10 Examples of SWS azimuthal variations obtained from four stations in the study area. The red lines are the optimal splitting parameters obtained from grid searching under a two-layer model. For stations GEMT, YLVX, AGRB, BAYT, respectively, “the lower-layer parameters (ϕ and δt) are 6° and 2.0 s, 23° and 1.1 s, 2°, and 1.2 s, 27°, and 1.2 s. For the upper layers, ϕ and δt are 66° and 1.2 s, 72° and 0.75 s, 70° and 0.95 s, 79°, and 0.55 s, respectively. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. We change this the text because the number that mentioned in the caption of Fig. 10 are not consistent with values in Fig. 10 itself.
