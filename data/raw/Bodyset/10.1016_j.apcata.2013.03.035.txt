Three porous amorphous silica minerals, including diatomite, opal and porous precipitated SiO2 were adopted to prepare supported TiO2 catalysts by hydrolysisâ€“deposition method. The prepared compound materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through morphology and physical chemistry properties of the resulting TiO2/amorphous SiO2 catalysts, it was proposed that the nature of silica supports could affect the particle size and the crystal form of TiO2 and then further influence the photocatalytic property of TiO2/amorphous SiO2 catalysts. The catalytic properties of these porous amorphous silica supported photocatalysts (TiO2/SiO2) were investigated by UV-assisted degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). Compared with pure TiO2 (P25) and the other two TiO2/amorphous SiO2 catalysts, TiO2/diatomite photocatalyst exhibits better catalytic performance at different calcined temperatures, the decoloration rate of which can be up to over 85% even at a relatively low calcined temperature. The TiO2/diatomite photocatalyst possesses mixed-phase TiO2 with relatively smaller particles size, which might be responsible for higher photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the stable and much inerter porous microstructure of diatomite could be another key factor in improving its activity.In recent years, semiconductor TiO Recently, amorphous SiO This study chose non-metallic typical porous silica minerals including diatomite (DE), opal (OP) and porous precipitated SiO The diatomite (Jilin province, China), opal (Liaoning province, China) and porous precipitated SiO The preparation of TiO The specific surface areas and pore size distribution of the samples were determined on a constant volume adsorption apparatus (JW-BK, JWGB Sci. &Tech) by the N Photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared catalysts was evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in aqueous solutions under UV irradiation using a 300 The photocatalytic properties of three TiO The specific surface area and pore structure parameters of the original supports and the three TiO XRD patterns of the three TiO The calculated results indicate that the crystalline sizes of anatase TiO  TEM images of the prepared TiO  XPS technique was carried out to study the chemical state of the Ti and O elements on three different supports.
