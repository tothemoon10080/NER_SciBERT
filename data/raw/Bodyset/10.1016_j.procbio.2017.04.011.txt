Bioprocesses based on the use of enzymes can be employed for the obtainment of ferulic acid by its solubilization from corn cob, which is a natural source of this phenolic compound. In order to overcome the limitations caused by the recalcitrance of biomass, the application of pretreatments is advisable. The utilization of high hydrostatic pressure on the enzymatic release of ferulic acid from corn cob with three feruloyl esterase extracts was studied applying pressurization at 600MPa as a pretreatment in combination with a mild thermal treatment at 130°C/2h. Additionally, pressurization at 200MPa during the enzymatic hydrolysis step was assessed to increase the ferulic acid yield. The results showed that the application of a high pressure pretreatment at 600MPa/40°C/15min to thermally treated corn cob increased by 20% the ferulic acid release in comparison with the thermal treatment for Ultraflo® L, but not for the Aspergillus extracts. Pressurization at 200MPa during the hydrolysis stage affected differently the enzymes stability and ferulic acid release depending on the extract and the pretreatments applied, showing that the effects of pressurization are complex and must be assessed in each case.Amid growing environmental concerns, which have become a priority within the international political agenda, residual biomass has attached considerable attention as an alternative potential source of high valuable compounds for being a natural, renewable, available and economical resource Ferulic acid is primarily esterified to arabinosyl residues of the arabinoxylan chains in hemicellulose. The esterified ferulic acid has a relevant role in the structure of the lignocellulosic matrix cross-linking hemicellulose chains via ester linkages of ferulic acid dimers and interconnecting the hemicellulose chains with lignin via ester-ether bonds. Because of that, the hydrolysis of the ester linkages between ferulic acid and the arabinoxylan chains contributes significantly to the disruption of the lignocellulosic matrix while releasing ferulic acid, a marketable compound. The hydrolysis of the ferulate ester linkage is an equilibrium reaction with a thermodynamic equilibrium constant clearly displaced to the side of the products In any case, the highly cross-linked and close structure of the lignocellulosic materials Several strategies have been applied for fractionation and solubilization of the different components of the lignocellulosic materials including: physical treatments as milling or extrusion to reduce the particle size, physico-chemical treatments as steam pressure or steam explosion to simultaneously reduce the particle sized and promote partial breakdown of the molecular structures, and chemical treatments with acids, alkali reagents, ammonia or hydrogen peroxide to cause a greater rupture/disintegration of the components of the lignocellulosic matrix High hydrostatic pressures consist in the exertion of a high pressure in the order of MPa transmitted by an aqueous liquid in a closed system. Such pressures only affect non-covalent interactions, thus influencing the conformations of the macromolecules as polysaccharides and proteins. In this sense, there are some works that have explored and shown the utility of high hydrostatic pressurization as a pretreatment to alter the structure of the lignocellulosic network and enhance the subsequent action of different enzymes on lignocellulosic materials In other hand, pressure can also affect positively those chemical equilibria and reaction rates when there is a reduction of the volume of reaction and activation. For this reason, pressurization could also help in enzymatic processes The aim of the current work was to evaluate the effect of high hydrostatic pressure in combination with a mild thermal treatment on the enzymatic hydrolysis release of ferulic acid from corn cob. The corn cob was submitted to different high hydrostatic pressure pretreatments alone or in combination with thermal pretreatments. A commercial enzymatic cocktail called Ultraflo Corn cob from the campaign of 2010 was collected in Mondariz (Pontevedra, Spain), and dried at room temperature. Comminution was firstly done in an electric shredder MTD 220E (Saarbrücken, Germany), then milled in a IKA Milled corn cob aliquot (2.50 Thermal pretreatment was performed using a steam sterilizer (Trade Raypa SL, Barcelona, Spain) at 130 The high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) pretreatments were carried out in a Stansted high pressure system model S-FL-850-9W (Stansted Fluid Power LTD, Stansted, U.K.) with a thermostated double-jacketed pressuring chamber and a vessel of A commercial enzymatic cocktail called Ultraflo The feruloyl esterase and xylanase activities of all the enzymatic extracts assayed are shown in The enzymatic hydrolysis was performed in the same bottles where the samples were previously pretreated, in order to avoid mass losses during transfer of the content to another container. Hydrolysis started by adding the enzymes in sterile conditions in a ratio of 0.044 Two different conditions were applied: hydrolysis at atmospheric pressure or hydrolysis under pressure. Hydrolysis at atmospheric pressure was done in an Optic Ivymen rotary shaker (Comecta S.A., Madrid, Spain) at 150 After the enzymatic hydrolysis, samples were centrifuged at 2755 All reactions were carried out at least by triplicate. High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) (Agilent, model 1200, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent Zorbax SB-Aq C18 column (4.6 The degree of hydrolysis of xylan was estimated through the determination of the carbohydrate reducing ends by applying the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method Feruloyl esterase and xylanase activity were determined in enzymatic extract as well as before and after the hydrolysis under normal (atmospheric pressure) and pressured conditions of raw and pretreated corn cob. Feruloyl esterase activity was assayed by determining the ferulic acid released from 1.33 One unit (U) of enzymatic activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 High hydrostatic pressurization was tested in combination with a mild thermal pretreatment for the enzymatic release of ferulic acid from corn cob by the commercial enzymatic cocktail Ultraflo Ferulic acid concentrations determined in the solutions obtained after different pretreatments and Ultraflo In order to assess the effect of both thermal (TT) and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) pretreatments alone, additional control tests were performed by submitting corn cob pretreated only by the thermal or the high pressure at 40 To study whether the positive effect on ferulic acid release of the combination of pretreatments (TT Considering that during the enzymatic treatment for ferulic acid release a collateral hydrolysis and solubilization of the hemicelluloses by the xylanases takes place, the intensity of xylan hydrolysis was analyzed measuring the carbohydrate reducing ends in the hydrolyzates ( First, it must be noted that although the different pretreatments supposed a slight solubilization of carbohydrates from the lignocellulosic matrix, the levels of carbohydrate reducing ends in the liquid phase were negligible compared with those obtained after hydrolysis. As expected considering that thermal treatment involves matrix swelling so that the enzymes attack is made feasible Pressurization had a strong negative effect on hemicellulose hydrolysis. In spite of the marked differences in xylanase activity between Ultraflo The reason for this behavior is not completely clear since there is hardly any information about changes in lignin and hemicellulose during high hydrostatic pressure treatments. Nevertheless, the very low degree of xylan hydrolysis in all the pressurized experiments could be related, at least partially, to changes in the supramolecular structure of the hemicellulose-cellulose matrix of corn cob that could have taken place at high hydrostatic pressure, as described by Oliveira et al. According to these authors, the application of high pressures in the order of 300 Anyway, it is interesting to highlight that the enzymatic release of ferulic acid ( There are previous works describing the beneficial effects of pressurization during enzymatic processes for different types of enzymes and depending on the conditions of pressure and temperature for each protein To avoid enzyme denaturation, pressurization at moderate pressure (200 Pretreated corn cob submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis with Ultraflo When pressurization was applied as a pretreatment, either alone or in combination with the thermal treatment, the enzymatic release of ferulic acid was enhanced when the hydrolysis was also performed under pressure. This beneficial effect of pressurization during the enzymatic stage was especially significant in the case of the corn cob pretreated only with HHP. The hydrolysis under pressure allowed increasing the levels of ferulic acid by 50% with respect to the hydrolysis without pressurization, which was the condition that led to the lowest concentration of ferulic acid obtained in this work ( Pressurization during hydrolysis was then studied with the The analysis of the residual feruloyl esterase activity in all the hydrolyzates done with Ultraflo Nevertheless, it is interesting but complicate to explain why the FAE residual activity of Ultraflo Although the previous experiments showed that the hydrolysis of xylan was almost negligible when pressurization at 600 High hydrostatic pressure as the only pretreatment for corn cob does not seem to be beneficial for the subsequent enzymatic release of ferulic acid in the conditions here assayed. However, an enzyme dependent synergistic effect between pressurization at 600 This research was supported by the
