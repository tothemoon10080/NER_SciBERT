 Mike Streat never dropped the ball! Once he received it, he held on to it responsibly, lifted and exhibited it proudly to others, and, most importantly, carried it forward. This is indeed Professor Michael Streat's legacy as the founding editor of the Understandably, the editorship of I have known Mike for nearly 20 years. I learnt slowly but surely that Mike's professional accomplishments, as laudable as they are, are far outweighed by his personal warmth and friendship he extends to anybody who comes in contact with him. Although Mike spent all his academic life on a tiny island (they call it Great Britain!), this personal attribute helped him develop, nurture and strengthen international collaboration with researchers from many different countries – Turkey, Israel, South Africa, Poland, Mexico, India, and others. For many of his collaborators, Mike is still a trusted friend and a mentor as well. Mike is officially retired, but still quite active in both research and selective teaching. We expect to see more of Mike at international meetings and research conferences in coming years and wish him and his extended family the best of health in coming years. Before closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the contributors and reviewers. Last but not the least, I am immensely thankful to Wolfgang Holl, a member of the editorial board of the journal and a long-time friend, who agreed to serve as the co-editor of this special publication and enthusiastically shouldered a great deal of its responsibility. I trust that this special issue will represent a fitting tribute to Mike Streat – a scholar, an educator and a universal friend.
