The Bi For p-type Bi In the present paper, we have prepared p-type 20% Bi High purity (>99.99%) Bi, Sb and Te shot and granules were washed with 10% nitric acid, acetone, and distilled water to remove the surface oxide layer. To make single crystals, the appropriate amounts of Bi, Sb and Te were weighed for 20% Bi To prepare the excess Te-doped 20% Bi The Seebeck coefficient (  From the equilibrium Seebeck coefficient in The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity measured at room temperature for the 20% Bi Thermal conductivity of the 20% Bi Using the fact that the Seebeck coefficient of p-type Bi
