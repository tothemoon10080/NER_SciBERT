When process non-linearities are responsible for the deterioration of linear controller performances, usually the linear approximation of the model is updated as the operating conditions change. The alternative approach, which is used in this paper, is to directly incorporate the non-linear phenomenological simulator of the process into the controller. To assess the method, the control of a cooling zone of an iron oxide pellet-sintering furnace, a multivariable process containing strong gain variations, has been simulated. The structure of the predictive controller is based on the internal model control scheme. The observer part of the control loop uses the non-linear phenomenological dynamic model of the process, while the controller part uses either the steady-state or the dynamic non-linear model for output predictions.
