Methane is very difficult to be detected by conventional thick film tin oxide sensors because the gas has the strongest bond strength among hydrocarbon gases. To develop highly sensitive methane gas sensors some alkaline constituents are added to SnO2 powder. The additives act as crystallite growth inhibitors upon heat treatment. SnO2 powder is impregnated with K, Ca and Mg. The highest sensitivity was obtained for Ca-SnO2 sensor when it was heat-treated at 700°C for 20min. The sensitivity has been increased in the order of Mg-, pure, K-, and Ca-SnO2 sensors, corresponding to the reverse order of the crystallite sizes in those sensors. Additionally, Ca-SnO2 sensors with Pt electrode located at upper and lower parts of the sensitive film exhibit 10% difference in sensitivity, indicating that CH4 can easily penetrate very small intraparticle voids.SnO Three additives such as K, Mg, and Ca are selected as crystallite growth stabilizer of SnO In order to develop a highly sensitive methane sensor, SnO The paste was dried at 110°C for 24 The sensitivity Crystallite sizes of M-SnO The effect of calcination temperature on the crystallite growth of pure and Ca-SnO  To find out the optimal heat-treating condition for highly sensitive Ca-SnO Effect of sintering time on methane sensitivity is rather small. It could be concluded that optimal sintering condition is 700°C, 20 The location of Pt electrodes influences the gas sensitivity because of difficult penetration of gas into small pores in sintered SnO 0.1
