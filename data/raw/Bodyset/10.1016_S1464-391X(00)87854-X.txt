A dicing machine is generally thought of in the compounding industry as being restricted to the production of rubber as distinct from plastics pellets, but this idea is mistaken. In fact the dicer, introduced in the early 1950s, largely predates strand and underwater pelletizers and represents an alternative to these for application to almost all plastics materials as well as rubber. Alan Smith reports.
