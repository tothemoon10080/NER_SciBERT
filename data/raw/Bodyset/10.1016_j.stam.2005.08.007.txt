The present study involves combined measurements of microtexture and dynamic ultra micro hardness (DUH) in hot extruded AA8090 aluminum alloy and its composite reinforced with 8vol% SiCp. Both the materials show strong crystallographic fiber textures—〈111〉 and 〈001〉. The dynamic micro hardness shows a clear pattern of difference between these two fiber textures, 〈111〉 oriented grains being harder and stiffer. The difference in θ/d between the fibers, where θ and d are the average cell misorientation and cell size, respectively, was marginal in the alloy and thus cannot explain the observed hardness difference. The hardness difference can be explained from the difference in Taylor factors between the respective fibers. Elastic stiffness values estimated from microtexture and DUH follow a similar trend qualitatively.
