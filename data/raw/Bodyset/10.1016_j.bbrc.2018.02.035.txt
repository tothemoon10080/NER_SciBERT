Featured as ectopic mineralization along blood vessels, vascular calcification is a major risk factor for a number of prevalent diseases including atherosclerosis. As recent studies identify vascular calcification as a tightly regulated process recapitulating embryonic bone formation, in this study, RNA-seq data generated from rabbit models with inherited or induced hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis were used, to investigate bone formation related signals and biological processes in atherosclerotic vascular calcification. Evident activation of bone formation was found, together with presence and functioning of bone resorption cell osteoclasts, which were found to possibly also promote bone formation in this disease. Resistance of bone formation and calcification were also found, through down-regulation of pro-ossification regulators and up-regulation of protective inhibitors and Wnt antagonists. Levels of activation and resistance of bone formation differed between the two disease models, suggesting different underlying mechanisms and corresponding treatments. In addition, loss-of-function of protective inhibitors KL and SOST, and possibly crucial role of GPNMB were also highlighted for treatment or further study.Characterized as ectopic deposition of calcium and phosphate crystals or even bone-like tissue in blood vessels, vascular calcification is a major risk factor in aging and prevalent diseases such as atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus [ In addition, recent decades of studies have identified vascular calcification as a regulated process recapitulating embryonic bone formation, rather than passive mineral deposition [ European rabbit ( Despite the common usage of rabbit models in atherosclerosis researches, studies regarding vascular calcification are rare. In this study, transcriptional researches on WHHL and Chol-fed rabbit models were conducted, and special focuses were given to bone formation related genes and pathways, especially the presence and functioning evidences of osteoclasts. In addition, in vivo function patterns of established vascular calcification inhibitors and promoters were also investigated. Three strains of rabbits, WHHL, Japanese white (JW) and New Zealand (NZW) were used ( RNA sequencing and gene expression quantification of rabbit models were performed in the former study [ Auxiliary data related to calcification and bone formation were collected in order to draw comparison between atherosclerotic calcification, VSMC calcification and bone formation. Preprocessed microarray data of VSMCs, mesenchymal cells, induced calcified VSMCs at day 2, 8, 12 and 25 (CVSMC-2/8/12/25), and induced osteoblasts at day 2, 8, 12 and 25 (OB-2/8/12/25) were obtained from GEO (GEO: In order to assess tissue level composition and variation in the mixed RNA sampled from rabbit aorta, a hypergeometric test based tissue composition analysis was designed. Analyses based on DEG log2-fold change and normalized gene expression were conducted separately. Tissue markers (top DEGs in each tissue) were collected from HOMER database [ KEGG and GO based overrepresentation analysis were conducted by R package ClusterProfiler with its default settings (FDR<0.2) [ In this study, both heritable and diet-induced atherosclerotic vascular calcification were studied, using two distinct rabbit models, WHHL and Chol-fed ( Apart from that, in overrepresentation analysis and tissue composition analysis, several interesting evidences were found ( Firstly, strong bone-related signals can be observed. In overrepresentation analysis, GO terms of ossification and extracellular matrix (ECM) were appreciably enriched, and KEGG pathway of osteoclast differentiation was enriched from up-regulated genes, indicating drastic bone formation related activities and possible matrix mineralization related ECM remodeling in the calcified lesion. In tissue composition analysis, in terms of gene expression, bone tissue markers were not enriched in the control groups, but significantly enriched in the diseased groups (FDR<0.05), together with an appreciable increase in gene expression; in terms of gene expression variation, bone tissue markers were significantly enriched in both disease models (FDR<0.01), suggesting evident occupation and variation of bone related genes and thereby biological components and function in the calcified aorta. Secondly, reduced constitution and loss of function of muscle related components can be inferred, as a substantial number of top GO terms enriched from the down-regulated genes were directly related to muscle, muscle contraction and contractile fiber. Down-regulation and decreased enrichment significance of gene expression of muscle tissue markers can also be observed. In addition, remarkable down-regulation of specific VSMC markers were also found ( Thirdly, activation of immune and inflammation related biological processes or functions were found, which is consistent with the established inflammation hypothesis of atherosclerosis etiology [ To further investigate bone formation related mechanisms in atherosclerotic vascular calcification, specific bone formation related gene groups or pathways were examined. Firstly, as atherosclerotic vascular calcification was reported to resemble endochondral ossification, transcriptional factors (TFs) modulating different stages of endochondral ossification were investigated [ Secondly, in endochondral ossification stage markers [ Thirdly, as Wnt signaling pathway plays an essential role in promoting bone formation, gene expression patterns of bone formation related Wnt pathway components and antagonists were studied [ Fourthly, as pyrophosphate serves as a general local biomineralization inhibitor, and phosphate is the major ingredient of hydroapatite, the local ratio of phosphate and pyrophosphate (Pi/PPi) is a crucial factor in favoring or against matrix mineralization. Pi and PPi related genes were investigated [ Surprisingly, in the three best-known phosphate related key regulators of vascular calcification, ENPP1, ABCC6 and NT5E, ENPP1 and ABCC6 presented negligible expression change, pointing to unaffected function as ectopic mineralization inhibitors; while NT5E presented no expression change but appreciable upstream regulator function inhibition, indicating concurrent anti-mineralization process in the calcifying aorta. Widely acknowledged as bone resorbing cells, osteoclasts were proposed as potential treatment targets of vascular calcification [ In vivo function patterns of established vascular calcification inhibitors and promoters were also studied [ Other candidate genes characterized by drastic expression changes or high expression values were also listed. Among them, GPNMB, POSTN, SRGN, FN1, IBSP and TNC are highlighted as they are also essential bone formation related genes and might serve critical function in atherosclerotic vascular calcification ( Despite of the generally similar expression patterns and functional profiles, evident differences between the two rabbit models were also observed. Appreciably more DEGs as well as greater fold change were presented in Chol-fed rabbits, indicating severer disease responses ( Firstly, in the tissue composition analysis, distinct patterns of gene expression variation were found. While only a unique peak of up-regulation of bone tissue markers were presented in the WHHL model, a distribution of both up- and down-regulation in the Chol-fed model can be observed ( In this study, transcriptional researches on WHHL and Chol-fed atherosclerosis rabbit models were conducted to search for mechanisms and relevant genes in atherosclerotic vascular calcification. Generally similar disease landscapes between the two models were demonstrated, featured by drastic changes in bone related genes, evident activation of immune and inflammation related genes and possible degeneration of muscle and VSMC related genes. Specific bone related genes were further investigated. Evident activation of endochondral ossification were found in both models, and detailed expression patterns of bone formation related genes and biological processes were demonstrated. Meanwhile, resistance of bone formation were also found in both models, especially in the form of inhibition of canonical Wnt pathway, which should shine a light on the treatment. Despite that, different levels of pro- or anti-ossification activities were presented between the two models, suggesting more typical bone formation in the heritable atherosclerotic calcification, and stronger resistance to abnormal bone formation in the high cholesterol diet induced calcification. Therefore, different underlying mechanisms and treatments regarding the two kinds of diseases were suggested. Notably, there is still a paucity of similarity regarding vascular calcification between rabbit models and human, which should be focused in future studies. In addition, in order to investigate roles of loss-of-inhibitors and gain-of-promoters in the etiology of vascular calcification, as normally there are abundant local ectopic matrix mineralization inhibitors in non-bone tissues, and also due to the lack of in vivo function patterns of regulators discovered from gene knock-out studies, expression patterns of established vascular calcification promoters and inhibitors were studied. Both contribution of inhibitor loss and promoter gain were found, while the causality between them remains unsolved. Notably, most inhibitory regulators were found intact in terms of expression, including the best-known inhibitor MGP and phosphate related inhibitors ENPP1 and ABCC6 [ Apart from that, presence and functioning of osteoclast in vascular calcification were found, especially the possible function in promoting osteoblast differentiation via clastokines, and expression patterns of relevant genes were depicted for the first time. Those findings pointed to an intricate function of osteoclast as not only mineral reducer but also possible promoter, even crucial regulator in the disease, as it functions in the natural bone formation and resorption balance [ Moreover, as osteoclasts also present a tight connection with the immune system and are sensitive to inflammation signals [ This work was supported by the  Transparency document related to this article can be found online at The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
