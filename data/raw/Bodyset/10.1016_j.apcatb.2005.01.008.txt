The degradation of linear alkylbenzensulphonic acids (LAS) by means of H2O2 and O2 as oxidant was investigated by mass spectrometry identification and characterization of partial oxidation products. Polar water-soluble compounds were analyzed by LC/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI), and the volatile products were trapped by means of headspace solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) and investigated by GC/MS with EI and CI ionization. The shortening of LAS alkylic chain and the oxidation of the terminal part to carboxylic acids or the insertion of oxygen atoms to give hydroxylic derivatives, were observed. The reaction leads also to volatile aldehydes, with H2O2, and acids and lactones, with O2. On the basis of demolition product structures a relevant difference in selectivity between H2O2 and O2 was pointed out, obtaining important information on the reaction mechanism.In the domestic and industrial wastewater, surface active agents are present in significant amounts due to the detergents used for all kind of washings (textiles, fibres, food, prints, cosmetic, pharmaceuticals) Surfactants are characterized by a low degradability that makes them resistant to the biological treatment The biodegradability of refractory surface-active agents can be considerably enhanced through non-biological chemical processes. In particular a number of new technologies, so-called advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), have emerged, that should be capable of converting organic pollutants into harmless chemicals AOPs, based on the production of highly reactive radicals intermediates, are used for the pretreatment of wastes containing antibacterial compounds or for the elimination of pollutants which can be degraded with difficulty, leading to high COD and TOC values even after the biological treatment Among AOPs, a convenient and widely employed degradation method is the Fenton reaction In previous papers The characterization of oxidation products, whose environmental effect are unknown, is important to evaluate the effectiveness of the oxidation processes and to monitor the degradation intermediates and their possible toxicity In order to improve the efficacy and the eco-friendly of the Fenton processes, in previous investigations the applicability of different oxidation systems was evaluated, in particular to avoid sludge formation due to the precipitation of residue ferric ions as hydroxide: (i) by using heterogeneous and recyclable iron catalysts, in the presence and absence of solar irradiation A relevant extent of LAS mineralization (62%) was obtained in the same condition of Fenton oxidation and by means of sunlight In the present work we take into account the identification, by means of GC/MS, for volatile compounds, and LC/MS, for non-volatile and polar compounds, of LAS partial degradation products, observed in the reactions with H All solvents were HPLC grade and obtained from Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy). LAS (100%) was kindly provided from DECO Scrl (Bagnacavallo, Ra, Italy). The experimental conditions for the oxidations with H The samples for electrospray analysis were prepared by dilution (1/100 for H ESI product ions were produced by collision-induced dissociation (CID) of selected precursor ions in the collision cell of the PE Sciex API III The identification of the volatile degradation intermediates was carried out by using HS-SPME Alternatively, using O Subsequent thermal desorption from the fibre into the GC injector (Varian 1079, Walnut Creek, CA, USA), was performed at an injector temperature of 250 The gas chromatograph (Varian 3800) was coupled to a Varian Saturn 2000 Ion Trap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in full-scan conditions for both Electron Ionization (EI) and Chemical Ionization (CI) using isobutane as reagent gas. Experimental conditions for electron ionization mode were: ion trap temperature, 150 Considering the observed uncompleted degradation of LAS by H In negative ion mode ( Using Fenton's reagent the oxidation leads almost exclusively to CO The degradation process yields products with lower molecular mass than the precursor, giving rise to a peak series at The analysis of the fragmentation pattern of some representative ions gives information about their structure. The MS/MS spectrum, in negative ion mode, of the ion at The ion is characterized by the presence of sulphonate group, as confirmed from the loss of SO The formation of compounds with higher molecular mass than LAS was remarked, too. Mass spectra (negative ion mode) show signals at As previously observed for lauryl sulphate The oxidation reaction by O According to mineralization data By measuring Other oxidation intermediates were revealed as low intensity peaks giving an homologue series at Since during the oxidative reaction the formation of compounds with a strong odour had been observed, the investigation was subsequently devoted to the identification of volatile oxidation products by GC/MS, as described in the experimental section.  The TIC of the unreacted surfactant, as a blank, was obtained, by exposing for 30 The mass spectra obtained in both EI and CI modes were analyzed for each degradation product in order to obtain information about their molecular masses and their fragmentation patterns The analysis of reconstructed ion chromatograms (RICs), acquired in CI mode, revealed the presence of homologous series of compounds having molecular masses in the range 114â€“198 The identification of these compounds was achieved by comparing their mass spectra with the best fits found in the NIST98 and Wiley6 libraries. The results of these investigations suggested that the main volatile oxidation intermediates, independently of experimental reaction condition, were linear aliphatic aldehydes The mass spectra and the chromatographic behaviour of the identified products have been compared with those of reference samples On the basis of the structure of the identified products it was possible to deduce the following information about the mechanism of the degradation process and to point out difference in reactivity and selectivity between H As already seen, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals attack on alkylic chain of LAS leads, via abstraction of hydrogen and insertion of oxygen atoms ( By using O The process yields volatile low-polarity aliphatic compounds deriving from the loss of the aromatic portion and oxidation of alkylic chain. According to In the presence of O The mineralization, which involve only a fraction of the starting surfactant under the given conditions, is due to a further degradation process yielding lower molecular mass products and finally conversion to CO The use of H The demolition products have different structure in dependence of the oxidant used. The formation of polar compounds containing hydroxylic and/or carboxylic group, and volatile low-polarity compounds, having aliphatic aldehyde or carboxylic acid and ester structure were obtained as partial LAS degradation products, respectively by using H According to mineralization data and LAS conversion In the presence of H The structural identification of partial demolition intermediates, using electrospray and GC/MS provided information about the oxidation mechanism. On the basis of the results obtained, we can also conclude that the reduction of COD observed after a Fenton oxidation treatment is due, at least in part, to an increase of the oxidation state of the pollutants. Mass spectrometry is clearly a powerful method for the analysis of pollutants and their oxidative degradation intermediates, and as an aid in evaluating the effectiveness of the removal processes and in understanding the oxidation pathway.
