A new type of crystalline sorbent was prepared by the reaction of polyethyleneglycol (PEG) with phosphomolybdic (PMo) and phosphotungstic (PW) heteropolyacids. The morphology of the obtained sorbents was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It has been shown that a complexing reaction occurs between PEG and the heteropolyacids. By using these sorbents, the adsorption behaviors of rare earth elements in nitric solution were studied. The effects of temperature, contact time, nitric acid and initial metal ion concentration on the adsorption were investigated. In 0.1–5.0 mol L−1HNO3, the adsorption percentage decreases with the increase of acid concentration. H,PEG400,PW and H,PEG400,PMo exhibited a different selectivity for rare earth metals, with H,PEG400,PW adsorbing in the order of La3+

                     >Pr3+
                     >Gd3+
                     >Sm3+, and H,PEG400,PMo in the order of Y3+
                     >La3+
                     >Pr3+
                     >Gd3+
                     >Sm3+. The experimental maximum adsorption capacities of the sorbents are in the range of 90–225 mg g−1 for Y3+, La3+, Pr3+, Sm3+ and Gd3+. In all cases, the maximum adsorption capacities of H,PEG400,PW are near to those of H,PEG400,PMo. The equilibrium data were evaluated according to the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms and the Langmuir equation gave a better fit and modeled the adsorption well.Heteropolyacids and their salts are inorganic polynuclear complex compounds with homogeneous and determined cavity cage structure, interconnected by center atoms (heteroatom) and ligands (multi-atoms) through an oxygen atom (   Compared with crown ethers, PEG is more common and much cheaper. Therefore the application of heteropolyacid complexes obtained from PEG for selective metal ion adsorption, has better prospects than those obtained from crown ethers. Due to its excellent adsorption properties, high chemical and irradiation stability, as well as easy preparation, the H,PEG heteropolyacid complex has been considered as a candidate for lanthanides reprocessing ( Various polyethyleneglycols (PEG) with molecular weights of 200–800 g mol By reference to literature ( With respect to PEG with a given molecular weight, the preparation temperature in the range 0–80 °C had little influence on the weight of the obtained precipitate. However, when the temperature was over 80 °C, no precipitate was formed, although after cooling to the room temperature, some precipitates crystallized out. It was also found that the amount of solid phase precipitated by PEG400 was slightly better than those of PEG200, PEG300, PEG600 and PEG800 and the weights of H,PEG400,PW were higher than those of H,PEG400,PMo for reasons unclear. XRD analysis was carried out on a DX-1000 X-RAY diffractometer at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 25 mA with Cu–Kα radiation, employing a scanning rate 0.06° s In order to assess the adsorption performance of the H,PEG400 complexes, La H,PEG400,PW and H,PEG400,PMo prepared at different temperatures were investigated to determine any effect of preparation temperature on their adsorption properties. The experimental adsorption equilibrium results showed that there were no significant differences on La The morphology of the prepared sorbents was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD patterns of the H,PEG complexes and corresponding heteropolyacids ( A series of contact time experiments for La Experiments carried out in the temperature range of 0–50 °C showed no significant difference on La The removal of metal ions from aqueous solutions by adsorption is dependent on the solution acidity since it affects the adsorbent's surface charge, degree of ionization and speciation. The effect of nitric acid concentration on the sorption of Y The separation factor ( For a simple system containing a single metal ion and a reference ion like Na  Equilibrium relationships between the adsorbent and adsorbate are usually described by the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms which define the ratio between the quantity adsorbed and that remaining in solution at a fixed temperature at equilibrium and show the sorption capacity of the adsorbent. The Freundlich model stipulates that the ratio of solute adsorbed to the solute concentration is a function of the solution. The empirical model was shown to be consistent with exponential distribution of active centers, characteristic of heterogeneous surfaces. The Freundlich equation, which was applied for the adsorption of Y This expression can be linearized to give: The widely used Langmuir isotherm has found successful application in many real adsorption processes and assumes complete monolayer coverage bound on the surface at high equilibrium metal ion concentration. It is expressed as: The corresponding Freundlich and Langmuir parameters along with correlation coefficients are listed in H,PEG400 complexes prepared by the reaction of PEG with phosphomolybdic and phosphotungstic heteropolyacids are crystalline and have similar structure and morphology. The adsorption of rare earths decreases with increasing of nitric acid (0.1–5.0 mol L
