This new book is commended to those interested in the fundamentals of separation and concentration of colloidal particles. The book is organized around a three-tier table of contents, containing eight parts, each consisting of one or more chapters and a series of sub-categories. Part 1, an introduction, contains two chapters on flotation and colloidal processes. Part 2, Dynamics of Particles and Bubbles, comprises six chapters devoted to hydrodynamics, particle settling velocity, bubble rise, and water velocity, particle motion in flotation, and bubble–particle interaction, respectively. Part 3, four chapters on Bubble–Particle Encounter Interaction, discusses encounter efficiency, motion of particles diverted by bubbles, theoretical approaches, and experimental methods. Part 4, Bubble–Particle Attachement Interaction, describes in ten chapters various contact time theories, disjoining pressure, surface forces, such as van der Waals, electrical double-layer, non-DLVO surface forces, thinning of liquid films, film rupture, three-phase contact expansion, experimental methods of investigation, and modeling of attachment efficiency. Part 5, Stability of Bubble–Particle Aggregates, discusses force analysis as well as energy analysis of particle-meniscus stability and bubble particle stability, and the strength of bubble–particle aggregates. Part 6, three chapters, discusses froth structure, froth drainage, and macroscopic processes in froth. Part 7 describes kinetic models for flotation, and the effects of particle size in flotation. Part 8 concludes with a survey of industrial processes involving flotation. The book is well written and illustrated. Symbols appearing in the equations are defined at the end of each chapter. There are about 800 references, and a thorough subject index.
