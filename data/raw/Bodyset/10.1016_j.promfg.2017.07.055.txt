Honing is a precise abrasive machining process with high standards for the resulting form, dimension, and surface quality. Additionally, honing further improves geometrical tolerances of the machined workpieces, especially when compared to the drilling process. In order to achieve a high adherence it is essential that the honing tool and the workpiece interact accordingly. The following paper will describe the static and dynamic correlations of the process forces of a honing tool equipped with one honing stone and two guiding stones for bores with small diameters (less than 20mm). When working with bores of such small diameters, a direct measurement of the process forces with an integrated sensor is usually difficult to realize. Therefore, a theoretical model will be used to calculate the process forces within the honing tool. Missing coefficients of friction or tangential force coefficients (TFC) within the system will be determined with the help of an external test bench. Moreover, guiding stones made of hard metal with two different types of surfaces will be investigated and then compared with conventional guiding stones. The following measurement results are based on a MATLABÂ® simulation calculating the forces of the honing and guiding stones.
