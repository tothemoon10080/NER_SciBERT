To avoid the influence of fluorine on the extraction of beryllium, separating fluorine from high-fluorine beryllium ore was discussed in this study. The factors affecting on fluorine removal, such as roasting temperature, roasting time, dosage of the additive in roasting process, and the variety and concentration of acid in the leaching process, were separately investigated. The intermediates and final products were identified by XRD. Under the following roasting and leaching conditions: heating temperature 800°C, treatment time 120min, additive dosage of Na2CO3 by 60% weight, leaching by distilled water at 50°C for 30min and acid (1.7mol/L HNO3) at 60°C for 60min, the percentage of fluorine and beryllium oxide was 1.6%; heating temperature 800°C, treatment time 180min, additive dosage of Na3PO4 by 50% weight, leaching by distilled water at 50°C for 30min and acid (1.7mol/L HNO3) at 60°C for 60min, the percentage of fluorine and beryllium oxide was 7.12%. Both of the results with additive Na2CO3 and Na3PO4 can meet the requirement of the industrial production of beryllium after the pretreatment, while Na2CO3 is more efficient. Results also indicated that nitric acid was more reactive than sulfuric acid.Beryllium is a lightweight, naturally-occurring metal that is found in beryl, phenacite, chrysoberyl and bertrandite ores, its concentration is about 6 There are many studies about the treatment of beryllium from varied beryllium ores, most of them are about beryl or gadolinite with high content of beryllium (beryllium oxide, 10%–12%) ( Generally, it is required that the percentage of fluorine and beryllium oxide is less than 10% in industrial production ( The selected-beryllium ore was procured from a beryllium industry company in Hunan province of China. Sodium carbonate (Na Sodium carbonate (Na The roasted products were leached by distilled water and acid. The samples of roasting ores were leached by distilled water at 50 The influence of a variety of acids on fluorine removal in the leaching process was investigated. Nitric acid and sulfuric acid were used and the concentrations of acid were 1.7 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using PW-1830 X-ray diffraction spectrometer (Philips, PANalytical B.V., Holland) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ To research the effect of fluorine removal from high fluorine beryllium ore, four exploratory experiments were conducted which considered the feasibility of the reaction between calcium fluoride and sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, and the component changes of high-fluorine beryllium ore by roasting without additive, water-leach and acid-leach. Two experiments were conducted by roasting high fluorine beryllium ore at 850 The other two experiments were carried out by roasting calcium fluoride (10 However, sodium carbonate can spontaneously react with calcium fluoride when silica is present at temperatures 600 As there is silica by 35.65% weight in the high fluoride ore, the chemical reaction The XRD analysis of the ore is shown in The heating temperature is one of the most important factors on fluorine removal, because it not only impacts the roasting reaction rate but also the existing form of additive sodium carbonate (melting point 851  The effect of additive dosage of Na The XRD patterns of the products after roasting and leaching are shown in According to the experimental results, the chemical reactions taking place in the roasting and leaching process are given as follows. For calcium fluoride and sodium carbonate: in the roasting process, reaction in the leaching process, For calcium fluoride and sodium phosphate: in the roasting process, in the leaching process, The influence of a variety of acids on fluorine removal in the leaching process was investigated. The experimental results are summarized in From the results obtained in The influence of the concentration of acids on fluorine removal in the leaching process was investigated. The XRD patterns of the products after acid-leach with 1.7 From As a summary of the study on fluorine removal from high-fluorine beryllium ore, a flow sheet of roasting and leaching pretreatment process is presented in According to the experimental results, the main factors influencing the separation of fluorine from high-fluorine beryllium ore are heating temperature and treatment time, while dosage of the additive plays an important role when the ores were roasted with additive Na
