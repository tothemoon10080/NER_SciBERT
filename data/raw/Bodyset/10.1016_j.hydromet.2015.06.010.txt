The present study investigated the removal of calcium from sulfate solutions containing magnesium and nickel using aqueous two phase systems (ATPS) at room temperature. In an attempt to evaluate the application range of this separation method, batch scale tests (bottom/top phase weight=1) were carried out using synthetic test solutions at two concentration levels (low and high). The test solution of high concentration used as the bottom phase consisted of a solution containing [Ca]=0.44g·L−1, [Mg]=1.42g·L−1 and [Ni]=80.0g·L−1, whose concentration level is similar to those typically found in high pressure acid leach liquors. The test solution of low concentration used as the bottom phase consisted of a solution of sodium tartrate in which a given volume of the solution of high concentration was added, resulting in a dilution of approximately 80 fold. The performance of some cationic extractants (Cyanex 272, 1N2N and PAN) at changing concentrations and the effect of the pH of the aqueous system (1, 6 and 11) were investigated in the dilute condition. This study found that, when ATPS operated in at least 3 contact stages, it proved to be a highly efficient and selective method to separate calcium from magnesium and nickel, using no extractant and at low pH values (around 1–2) for both dilute and concentrated solutions. The extraction of nickel depends on the pH and the type/concentration of extractant, while the extraction of magnesium was not affected by the studied operating variables.Nickel is a widely demanded metal nowadays, with more than half of the world's total production used in the manufacture of stainless steel. The production process of this metal originates from sulfide and/or lateritic ores, the latter stemming from a complex chemical composition and with a higher availability in Brazilian mineral reserves. Other metals may appear together with nickel, such as cobalt, magnesium, manganese, copper, calcium, iron, among others ( The industrial production of nickel from lateritic ores involves initial stages of mining and ore processing, followed by hydrometallurgical processing. This last step includes high pressure acid leaching (HPAL), using sulfuric acid as the leaching agent, followed by precipitation for the removal of iron, such as hematite or jarosite ( The step of purification and concentration of the nickel liquor is most commonly performed using the solvent extraction technique ( Despite the wide applicability of solvent extraction on hydrometallurgical systems, the technique requires the use of volatile organic solvents, which are flammable in some cases. Moreover, this procedure is unable to extract hydrophilic species and is highly susceptible to the formation of emulsions. It is also worth noting that aromatic organic solvents have a carcinogenic potential ( In this context, aqueous two phase systems (ATPS) represent a promising alternative technique for the selective extraction of metal ions ( As a separation technique, ATPS present certain advantages, including the possibility of using commercially available reagents without a toxic and/or flammable nature, and that are, in some cases, biodegradable ( A sulfuric aqueous solution containing calcium, magnesium, and nickel was prepared by solubilizing sulfate metal salts (Synth, analytical grade, purity The ATPS was prepared by mixing the electrolyte aqueous solution (dilute or concentrated solution) with an aqueous solution containing the triblock copolymer L64 ((EO) The overall composition of the ATPS investigated in this work, as well as their top and bottom phases, is shown in To carry out the extraction tests, the ATPS were obtained by mixing equivalent weights (2 For staged extraction tests, the ATPS was obtained by mixing equivalent weights (15 The percent extraction curves of calcium, magnesium, and nickel are shown in According to the results shown in One explanation for the selective removal of calcium in the absence of an extractant is possibly related to the low solubility of CaSO Another possible explanation for the higher extraction of calcium in the absence of an extractant is most likely related to the model proposed by Through calorimetric measurements, For the ATPS studied in this work, the pseudopolycation is formed by L64 molecules solvated by Na The extractions of magnesium and nickel remained practically constant at approximately 10% for the entire concentration range of the Cyanex 272 and PAN extractants studied in this work ( The combined effect between the pH of the aqueous system and the concentration of the PAN extractant is shown in Regarding the salt in the bottom phase, the tartaric acid is a diprotic weak acid (pK In this context, it appears to be more plausible to attribute the extraction of calcium to some form of interaction between the Ca The effect of the bottom/top phase weight ratio (w Tests using the concentrated aqueous solution containing calcium, magnesium, and nickel as the bottom phase of ATPS were carried out at pH According to the results shown in The aqueous two phase systems (ATPS) proved to be an attractive alternative method to selectively remove calcium from sulfate aqueous solutions containing magnesium and nickel. This method has shown the following characteristics: (i) no extractant reagent is required, (ii) calcium can be fully removed from highly acidic conditions (pH The authors wish to thank
