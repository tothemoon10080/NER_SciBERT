We herein report elemental migration during the hydrothermal treatment of zinc-containing electric arc furnace dust (Zn-containing EAFD). Initially, the Zn-containing EAFD was characterized and the crystalline phases of Zn, lead (Pb), and chromium (Cr) were determined to be mainly in the form of (Zn,Mn)Fe2O4, PbO (PbSO4), and Cr2O3 (CrO3/CrO4
                     2−), respectively. Subsequently, the elemental migration and transformation behavior during the Zn hydrothermal extraction process using ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) was studied in detail. Results indicated that under optimum leaching conditions, Zn, Pb, calcium (Ca), and manganese (Mn) were extracted with high leaching efficiencies of 97.4%, 98.3%, 93.4%, and 97.5%, respectively. Furthermore, suitable adjustment of the leaching solution pH resulted in the simultaneous precipitation of Fe, Zn, Mn, and Pb ions in the form of the stable spinel ferrite MFe2O4 (M: Zn, Mn, and Pb), which was recovered following calcination of the precipitate at 1000°C for 2h. Meanwhile, the majority of Fe, total Cr, and silicon (Si) existed as Fe2O3, Cr2O3, and SiO2, respectively, in the leaching residue, which can be recycled in the steel mill.Zinc-containing electric arc furnace dust (Zn-containing EAFD) is classified as hazardous waste according to the US Environmental Protection Agency ( Interestingly, as the Zn content in Zn-containing EAFD samples obtained from China is relatively low (i.e., 3–17 Due to various systems of operation and different scrap grades obtained from steel mills, the chemical compositions and mineral phases of the Zn-containing EAFD can vary immensely ( Analytical reagent grade FeCl A flow diagram representing the extraction of Zn from Zn-containing EAFD is provided in Pretreatment of the Zn-containing EAFD was performed by putting aqueous or HCl solutions of various initial concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 FeCl 2 Determination of the chemical compositions of the Zn-containing EAFD, treated EAFD, and leaching residue was carried out by X-ray fluorescence (XRF-1800, Japan). In addition, the phase structures of the Zn-containing EAFD, treated EAFD, leaching residue, and spinel ferrites were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Japan, Rigaku) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Germany, Zeiss) combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The valences of Pb and Cr were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6 Furthermore, determination of the concentrations of metal ions in the leaching solution was conducted by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, America, Varian). The extraction efficiency The chemical composition of the Zn-containing EAFD depends on the quality of steel scrap processed, type of steel being produced, operating conditions, and degree of dust return into the process (  To further determine the crystalline forms of the elements present in the Zn-containing EAFD, the dust was washed with HCl solutions of various concentrations (i.e., 0–1.5 Although many reports discuss the characterization of Zn-containing EAFD ( As shown in As shown in Thus, based on the above analyses, the main mineralogical phases and their approximate contents in Zn-containing EAFD could be assigned as summarized in As outlined in the flow representation of the Zn extraction process ( During the experimental process, we noted that the water washing solution was a transparent yellow color with a pH of ~ At temperatures > The above equations indicate that hydrothermal temperature, time, and the FeCl The effect of R   Moreover, the XRD patterns of the leaching residues are given in  Moreover, the XRD patterns of the leaching residues are presented in The various extraction efficiencies and elemental contents in the leaching solution and residue obtained under the optimal Zn extraction conditions (hydrothermal reaction at 220 Finally, the elemental migration behavior over the entire treatment process is summarized in We herein investigated the elemental migration behavior of various metals during the hydrothermal treatment of zinc-containing electric arc furnace dust (Zn-containing EAFD). The Zn-containing EAFD was characterized and the crystalline phases of the various elements (Zn, Mn, Fe, Pb, Cr, Si, and Ca) were confirmed as (Zn,Mn)Fe This work was financially supported by the
