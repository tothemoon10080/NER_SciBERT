The effect of Si content on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the heat-treated Al–6.5Cu–0.6Mn–0.5Fe alloy was investigated using image analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and tensile testing. The results show that the mechanical properties of Al–6.5Cu–0.6Mn–0.5Fe alloys decrease slightly when the Si content is below 1.0%. This can be attributed to the comprehensive effect of microstructure evolution, including the increase of nano-sized α-Fe, the coarsened grain size, and an increase in Al2Cu content at the grain boundary. When the Si content is 1.5%, the mechanical properties of the Al–6.5Cu–0.6Mn–0.5Fe alloys decrease significantly, and this can be attributed to the agglomerated second intermetallics, which is resulted from the formation of excess Si particles.
