The aim of this paper is to obtain the momentum transfer coefficient between the two phases, denoted by f and p, occupying a bi-disperse porous medium by mapping the available experimental data to the theoretical model proposed by Nield and Kuznetsov [1]. Data pertinent to plate-fin heat exchangers, as bi-disperse porous media, were used. The measured pressure drops for such heat exchangers are then used to give the overall permeability which is linked to the porosity and permeability of each phase as well as the interfacial momentum transfer coefficient between the two phases. Accordingly, numerical values are obtained for the momentum transfer coefficient for three different fin spacing values considered in the heat exchanger experiments.Chen et al. Two common assumptions are made in all of the abovementioned works. Firstly, the momentum transfer coefficient is assumed to be a homogenous constant velocity-independent value. Secondly, the numerical value of the momentum transfer coefficient is neither known nor related to porous media properties like porosity and permeability (of each phase). These both are questionable in the absence of rigorous mathematical, numerical, or experimental data. As such, the aim of this paper is to fill this gap in the literature by mapping the theoretical model developed by Ref. In an interesting study, Kang et al. Development of Eq. The overall permeability is, according to Ref. Note that Note that Eqs. The Experimental results are used to evaluate the theoretical model developed in Ref. Support from
