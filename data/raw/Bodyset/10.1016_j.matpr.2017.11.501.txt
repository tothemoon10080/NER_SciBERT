The dry sliding wear behaviour of Cast and Powder Metallurgy (PM) based Aluminium (Al) and Aluminium-Silicon alloy (LM6) were investigated by pin on disc as per ASTM G99 standard for varying load, speed and distance. Wear rate is decreased in LM6 for varying speed but increased for Al. Presence of Si particles in LM6 resists the deformation and avoids the loss of material because of welding between the particles, but in Al, larger areas of welded particles slipped between the mating surfaces enhances the wear. The PM-LM6 has good density, low thermal expansion, better stiffness properties shown higher wear resistance.
