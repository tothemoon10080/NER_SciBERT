Three-dimensional numerical computations have been carried out to investigate the dynamics inside proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and its performance using Star-CD solver, the computational fluid dynamics software. Theoretical results in polarization curves quantitatively corroborate the experimental findings previously reported in Jung et al. [2]. Also, effects of various process conditions such as relative humidity, stoichiometric ratio at anode and cathode channels, and cell configuration on the performance of fuel cell have been further scrutinized. It has been revealed that the moderately high stoichiometric ratio at cathode channel and single serpentine geometry improve the cell performance and also the humidity change at cathode makes the cell voltage variation high, comparing with the humidity change at anode.Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as one of the promising energy sources for stationary and portable applications has been extensively explored by many researchers in industry and academia due to its superior characteristics like high power density, simple operation, high efficiency for energy conversion, and so on Bernardi and Verbrugge Based on the abovementioned brief background, we attempted to estimate the performance of PEMFC unit cell from three-dimensional (3-D) simulation techniques incorporated with a CFD software, i.e., Star-CD solver with ES-PEMFC module A computational fluid dynamics software based on a finite volume method, Star-CD (version 3.26) with ES-PEMFC module has been employed in this study to successfully solve transport phenomena and electrochemical reactions in PEMFC As exhibited in  Cell voltages at constant current density of 0.6 Effect of cell configuration on the performance has been currently scrutinizing to establish optimal single cell design. As the first case, the polarization curve using a single channel flow-field serpentine is compared with the standard case in Dynamics and cell performance in single proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack have been investigated using three-dimensional CFD simulation. Cell performance by simulations has been successfully compared with previous experimental one This study was supported by the
