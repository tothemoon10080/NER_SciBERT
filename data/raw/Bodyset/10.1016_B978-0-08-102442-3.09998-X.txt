Andrew J Ruys is a professor of Biomedical Engineering and has served as director of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Sydney since 2003. He holds a bachelor's degree (Honours 1—1987) and doctorate (1992) in Ceramic Engineering. Professor Ruys has over 200 academic publications, and has been awarded over 30 competitive research grants totalling over $5 million. He has worked in bioceramics and advanced ceramics research for over 30 Professor Ruys serves on three editorial boards, and is a reviewer for 24 scientific journals. He has been teaching bioceramics, industrial ceramics, biomaterials, medical device technology, dental materials, chemistry, physics, and general engineering, a total of 27 different university units of study in the last 30 His experience is unique, spanning as it does three decades in ceramics, bioceramics, and industrial advanced ceramics, with an ongoing association with alumina for that entire time. He leads a large multidisciplinary research team in bioceramics, and has supervised 25 PhD students to completion as well as about 200 Honours students, during his academic career. His academic research has covered a broad range of areas, intersecting with almost every area covered in this book. Professor Ruys has been involved in alumina ceramics research since 1987 ( Published the seminal paper on alumina micro-slip casting, and subsequent papers on this theme [ Published the seminal paper on thixotropic casting, and subsequent papers on this theme [ Gelcasting [ Tapecasting [ 3D printing [ Hydrostatic shock forming [ Zirconia-toughened alumina (ZTA) [ Metal-ceramic functionally graded materials, including alumina [ Metal fiber-reinforced alumina and other ceramics [ Professor Ruys has been involved in alumina biomaterials since the 1990s, and biomaterials in general since the 1980s.
