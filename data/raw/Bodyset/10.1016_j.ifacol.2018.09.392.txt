Multi-source mechanical signals at different locations of the ball mill system have different contributions for constructing mill load parameter forecasting (MLPF) model. It is necessary to select suitable multi-source mechanical signals and their frequency spectral feature subsets. Aim at these problems, a new MLPF approach based on LASSO algorithm and selective ensemble (SEN) modeling strategy by using multi-source single-scale mechanical frequency spectrum is proposed. At first, Fast Fourier transformer (FFT) is used to obtain single-scale frequency spectrum of these multi-source (channel) mechanical signals. Then, SEN-LASSO modeling approach based on candidate regularization parameter set is used to obtain single-scale frequency spectral feature subsets and to build single-channel SEN MLPF model jointly. Finally, SEN strategy is employed again to construct the final MLPF model by selecting and combining these single-channel SEN MLPF models. Simulation results based on a laboratory-scale ball mill validate effectiveness of this approach.
