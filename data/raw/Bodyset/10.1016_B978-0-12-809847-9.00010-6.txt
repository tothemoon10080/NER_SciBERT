Type X collagen is a network-forming collagen. Type X collagen is mainly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes in cartilage, with expression usually limited to the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate and in the calcified zone of articular cartilage of long bones, where type X collagen seems to facilitate calcification. More than 30 different mutations have now been characterized. The most common mutation is Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. There are emerging biomarkers of type X collagen, which have been shown to be elevated in rheumatological disorders affecting bone and cartilage.Biomarkers of Type X Collagen References Type X collagen is a network-forming collagen. Type X collagen is mainly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes in cartilage. The expression is usually limited to the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate and in the calcified zone of articular cartilage of long bones. In healthy conditions of adults type X collagen constitutes about 1% of the total amount of collagen in cartilage Increased extracellular deposition and expression are found in joint degenerative diseases as the chondrocytes become hypertrophic The biological function of type X collagen seems to be to facilitate calcification and to play a role in the normal distribution of matrix vesicles and proteoglycans within the growth plate Type X collagen serves as a marker of the terminally differentiated, hypertrophic chondrocytes. Gene transcription and translation products are thereby used for determination of chondrocyte growth and differentiation Inactivation of the COL10A1 gene in mice was first reported not to affect the phenotype, which suggests that only mutated versions of the gene give rise to skeletal problems
