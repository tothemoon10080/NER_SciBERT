Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc. (Zingiberaceae) has long been used as a folk medicine. The essential oil of its dried rhizome was isolated using simultaneous steam-distillation and solvent-extraction apparatus and its fractions were prepared by silica gel column chromatography. Totally, 36 compounds were identified in the essential oil, including 17 terpenes, 13 alcohols and 6 ketones. The yields of Fractions 2 and 3 were 83.66 and 10.71%, respectively. Epicurzerenone and curzerene were found in the first and second highest amounts (24.1 and 10.4%). At 20 mg ml−1, the essential oil of C. zedoaria was moderate to good in antioxidant activities by three different methods, good in reducing power and excellent in scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical but low in chelating effect on ferrous ion. However, after fractionation, with regard to all antioxidant properties assayed, fraction 4 showed consistently better effects than the essential oil did. The compound in fraction 4 responsible for better antioxidant properties might be 5-isopropylidene-3,8-dimethyl-1(5H)-azulenone. To our knowledge, however, little information is available about the constituents of the essential oil of The dried rhizome of Ground sample (100 g) was placed in a modified Likens-Nickerson apparatus. The solvent mixture (50 ml) of The yellowish-brown essential oil was applied onto a silica gel-60 (55 g, 3–200 μm, Merck) column (i.d. 1.5×50 cm) and eluted sequentially with various solvents (100 ml each), Constituents in the essential oil and its fractions were analysed using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) coupled to a HP 5973A MSD mass spectrometer (EI mode, 70 eV). A CP-Wax 52CB fused silica capillary column (i.d. 0.25 mm×60 m, 0.25 μm film thickness, Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) was used and interfaced directly into the ion source of the MSD. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min Components were identified on the basis of gas chromatographic retention indices, mass spectra from Wiley MS Chemstation Libraries (6th ed., G1034, Rev. C.00.00, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and the literature ( The antioxidant activity was determined by the 1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbituric acid (DETBA) method ( A modified thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) method was used to measure the antioxidant activity of the essential oil and its fractions in terms of inhibition on lipid peroxidation ( The antioxidant activity was also determined by the conjugated diene method ( The reducing power was determined according to the method of The scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was determined according to the method of Chelating effect was determined according to the method of For the essential oil or its fractions, three samples were prepared for assays of every antioxidant attribute. The experimental data were subjected to an analysis of variance for a completely random design, as described by Using the simultaneous steam-distillation and solvent-extraction method, the essential oil content in the dried rhizome of The gas chromatographic profiles and compositions of the essential oil and its fractions were presented in Epicurzerenone was high in the essential oil and found in fractions 2, 3 and 4 ( Gas chromatographic profile and percent composition of the essential oil were similar to those of the supercritical carbon dioxide extracts from Using the DETBA method, the essential oil showed a high inhibition of peroxidation (76.3–87.1%) at 10 to 20 mg ml Using the TBARS method, the essential oil showed a moderate inhibition of peroxidation (46.3–73.1%) at 10–20 mg ml Using the conjugated diene method, the essential oil showed a moderate antioxidant activity (56.7–70.3%) at 10–20 mg ml Using three different methods to measure the antioxidant activities, two antioxidants, BHA and α-tocopherol, evidently consistently showed excellent antioxidant activities at concentrations as low as 0.1 mg ml The reducing power of the essential oil increased with increased concentration ( The scavenging effect of the essential oil on DPPH radical linearly increased from 12.7 to 90.5% as concentrations increased from 0.1 to 15 mg ml The chelating effect of the essential oil on ferrous ion was 8.7% at 0.01 mg ml  At 20 mg ml This research work was supported by the National Science Council, Republic of China (Grant no. NSC 89-2626-B-241-003) and the Scientific Council, Hung-Kuang Institute of Technology (HKHSC 89-04).
