We present 2 cases of a capitellum fracture with concomitant triceps avulsion fracture. Common radiologic features of these injuries include a comminuted fracture of the capitellum with extension to the lateral portion of the trochlea, absence of posterior lateral condyle comminution, and a triceps avulsion fragment that is avulsed in a posterolateral direction.
