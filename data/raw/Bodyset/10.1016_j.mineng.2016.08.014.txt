It is recognised that grinding media wear can represent up to 50% of the operating costs of a given tumbling mill. Over the years, a number of works have explored the development of different ways and means to both understand grinding media wear as well as model and predict it. The focus of the present work is to examine the differences in microstructure, hardness, abrasion and impact toughness of grinding media from eight different manufacturing sources. Results will be presented for 125mm diameter media typically used for SAG mills. A discussion will address any issues highlighted by the results than may contribute to predictive wear model development as well as indicate possible directions for future research.In mineral processing, the two main operating costs are related to energy consumption and wear. Energy consumption in comminution processes especially as it related to efficiency has been the focus of much research and application. Current efforts aim at developing guidelines and potentially standards for energy based grinding performance metrics ( The focus of the present paper will be to examine the components related to the mechanical properties of the media. Specifically, the focus will be on 125 Ten different SAG mill 125 Subsequently, the media samples were then prepared in order to accomplish the different tests for microstructure, impact fracture toughness, abrasion testing and hardness. All samples were cut under wet conditions such that a number of samples were obtained without microstructure modification including three from different radial positions in the ball as illustrated in The hardness profile was achieved by conducting a series of tests along the center line of the 125 The results are presented in the following order: microstructure, impact toughness, abrasive wear and hardness. The microstructures of all grinding media investigated in this work are shown in At optical microscopy magnifications, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the characteristics of quenched and tempered martensite. Only the martensite laths can really be resolved, but it is still difficult to differentiate between martensite morphologies. Carbides and retained austenite cannot be resolved. These characteristics need to be defined by electron microscopy and X-ray analysis, if necessary. A literature review is required to ascertain whether the degree of tempering, or changes in martensite morphology, affect wear. Certainly the degree of tempering affects toughness, and is well documented. There appears to be inclusions (black particles) in all the grinding media samples. These need to be quantified at some point since these may affect the toughness of the grinding media.           A summary of the microstructure results can be found in The results of Charpy tests are presented in the form of impact energies or the toughness of three locations within the steel media ( The photos of the halves of broken CVN specimens in In general, the study of the fracture surface of the halves of the broken Charpy V-Notch impact specimens showed clearly that no ductile fracture evidence was found on the fracture surfaces of all Charpy test specimen. According to the brittle fracture criteria, all the tested specimen fracture in a brittle manner because the impact energies (toughness) of all specimens are below the brittle fracture impact energy of 20 It is interesting to note that for the two high carbon/high chromium content media, the fracture toughness is the lowest. Abrasive wear was determined using a steel wheel abrasion test (SWAT) as described in the Hardness tests for all the media included in this study were conducted using Rockwell Hardness type C test to draw the hardness profile from the center to the surface of all the media selected for this study. The hardness profile was achieved by conducting series tests along the center line of the steel slice used to machine Charpy test specimens ( Despite that at the surface all media have approximately the same hardness, there appears to be 2 general populations of steels. Population #1 defined by media D5, E5, F5, H5 show a hardness increase from center to surface and a lower average hardness. On the other hand, population #2 defined by media A5, B5, C5, G5, I5, and J5 which shows little variation from center to surface. In general, the population #1 behaviour indicates a reduced hardenability (i.e. ability of the steel to form martensite across the section of the steel media by quenching). Hardenability is a result mainly of the Cr addition, although C can be influential as well. However, it is notable that the Cr levels of population #2 are all higher than those of population #1. In population #1, the highest Cr is 0.68 in H5 while in population #2, the lowest Cr is 0.75 in G5. Note that the lowest hardenability, as indicated by the lowest center hardness, is E5, which has the next to the lowest Cr level (0.63). The lowest Cr level is in F5 (0.33) but, within population #1; F5 has the highest C level, which may be offsetting the low Cr level. Based on the chemical composition it may be expected that the media with the highest C and Cr content (C5) has the potential to have the highest hardness and abrasive resistance values. However, as mentioned earlier, it does not belong to the same compositional family as the other steels, and the properties cannot really be compared to the other steels. However, C5 does not have the highest hardness. The following analysis will explore possible relationships between: Hardness and abrasion. Hardness and impact toughness. Abrasion and impact toughness. Hardness and Cr, Mo, Ni content. Impact toughness and C content. Chemical composition and performance.  Hardness and abrasion According to As a result, one would expect that abrasion wear would decrease with increasing hardness. However, plotting the abrasion wear results as found in Based on these results and assuming that these grinding media would not break in impact, one could expect to see most of this grinding media will show good abrasive resistance over the diameter of the balls. However, for D5, E5, F5, and H5 media samples, one might expect abrasive wear to increase as the media wears down. The correlation between hardness and abrasive wear has already been investigated by a number researchers ( Hardness and impact toughness It is commonly accepted that hardness is generally inversely proportional to impact toughness; an assertion which is supported by some literature ( However, plotting the impact toughness as illustrated by the Charpy V notch test results found in Abrasive wear and impact toughness Generally, impact toughness should decrease with decreasing abrasion wear as in the work illustrated by Hardness and Cr, Mo, Ni content From the literature ( Impact toughness and C content It is understood that impact toughness tends to reduce as carbon content increases ( Chemical composition and performance Examining how one chemical component at a time affects media toughness, hardness or abrasion values does not provide an understanding as to how the different steel media components work together to affect media performance. In order to underline this point, consider the noise in the data presented in A review of the literature indicates that the use of chemical composition to predict material behaviour has been investigated in a few works ( A similar model development for grinding media performance could be possible by leveraging the observation that there seems to be a strong relationship between carbon content and impact toughness ( In the case of impact toughness, “y” would be toughness in joules, “x” would be the weight percent of carbon while A and b would be constant determined from the trendline correlation (2.8341 and −0.933 respectively). One could further propose that the carbon content (C) could be corrected by the content of the other chemical components ( In this proposed form of the carbon correction, zero chemical content of a particular component would reduce to “1” ( The reference value (x Using the reference values and exponents found in Using the resulting model, it was possible to compare the model prediction with the measured media performance as illustrated in Notwithstanding these interesting results, it is important to take a moment to consider the use of hardness, abrasion and toughness as adequate metrics to predict the wear performance of media in an industrial context. With respect to hardness, it is a metric frequently used to compare one media type to another. However, the results presented in With respect to wear by abrasion, the SWAT is one of many abrasion type tests that could be used to quantify abrasive wear. In addition, the SWAT has also been used to quantify abrasive wear in steel media prediction ( With respect to impact toughness, the use of the Charpy test may be controversial in the context where all samples are brittle. However, the results and associated analysis indicates that maybe there is value in the results a Charpy V-notch test produces. Further analysis would be required especially in comparison with drop ball test results coupled to results from industrial applications. It is important to underline that Eqs. The focus of this paper was to examine 125 The main observations based on the test results and associated analysis indicate that: Abrasive wear tends to be a function of media hardness for media with an chromium content of less than 0.7% and independent of hardness for media with chromium content greater than 0.75%. Charpy impact toughness results are strongly correlated to carbon content that can be corrected with the chemical composition of the media. Hardness and abrasion wear are somewhat correlated to the chemical composition. It is important to underline that heat treatment was not considered in this analysis. Furthermore, it is well understood that these empirical models are only valid for the media used and the testing conditions used. And despite the shortcomings associated with empiricism, the media performance models do indicate how such performance is a function of the interaction and interdependencies between chemical components. Lastly, it is important to underline that lab scale abrasion testing and impact toughness testing provide some insight into the wear performance of grinding media. However, corrosion was not included and no effort was made to correlate the results presented here with industrial results. This project was initiated and completed between the years 2007 and 2012. It was supported by an undisclosed company interested in understanding better the factors affecting steel media wear. Consequently, the authors would like to thank this company for the support of this work. Furthermore, the authors would like to thank both Metso and Hatch for allowing us to publish and present this paper.
