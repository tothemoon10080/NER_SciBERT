The asphalt mixture as the basic construction material in roads is described with specific deformation parameters. These are negatively influenced by temperature, and this is one of the problems which cause short pavement lifespan. Increasing temperature affects the behavior of bitumen-bonded materials from elastic to viscous state. Observation of this problem was made in this study by measuring the phase angle during dynamic bending tests. Temperature dependence of the phase angle was observed for three different temperatures and five chosen frequencies. Another aim of the study was to observe the relationship of the phase angle to the fatigue lifespan for one specific temperature and frequency. The evaluation was done using the classical AASHTO method as well as the chosen dissipated energy ratio method.
