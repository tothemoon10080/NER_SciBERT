The antimony-doped SnO2 nanocrystallite was synthesised by the co-precipitation reaction and subsequent calcination from the antimony(III) chloride and tin(IV) chloride. The crystal size, pore size distribution and properties of the nanocrystalline powders were examined by differential thermal analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and desorption isotherm(Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method). Calcination of the precipitate powder at 650°C led to the formation of Sb–SnO2 nanocrystallite of ∼6nm in crystal size. Most of the pores in the nanocrystallite are about 5–10nm in diameter. Effect of doped antimony on the crystal size of the nanocrystallite is discussed.SnO In this paper, the synthesis of antimony-doped SnO The antimony chloride (SbCl The nanocrystallites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Simultaneous differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out using an RSZ thermal analysis system in air at a heating rate of 10°C/min. α-Al The precursor of antimony-doped SnO Thermal analysis of the sample was carried out after the drying process of 105°C for 2  It is shown that the average crystal size of sample decreases with increasing amount of doped antimony. From the above analysis, it is not clear whether the doped antimony exists as Sb The pore size distribution of the Sb–SnO The antimony-doped SnO This work was supported by the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (no. 59925412).
