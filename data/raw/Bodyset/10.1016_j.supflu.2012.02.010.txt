Pretreatment of biomass substrates is critical in their use for generating monomeric sugars for conversion to transport fuels, such as bioethanol. In this study, high pressure reactive pretreatment and hydrolysis of cellulose- and hemicellulose-containing substrates, principally corn stover and switchgrass, were conducted over the temperature range of 150–190°C utilizing carbon dioxide pressures ranging from 150 to 450bar. Experimental protocol was guided by the development of an orthogonal design criteria consisting of temperature, CO2 pressure, time of pretreatment-hydrolysis, and substrate particle size. High pressure carbonation of the subcritical water-biomass mixtures were conducted in a small batch reactor and the resultant hydrolyzate mixtures were analyzed for sugar content using SEC and HPLC-RI detection. Also, the resultant hydrolyzates after carbonated water pretreatment were further hydrolyzed using commercial enzymes to saccharify the remaining oligomeric sugars to xylose and glucose. The resultant % sugar content of the carbonated water – versus dilute mineral acid – pretreated biomass mixtures were compared as well as the corresponding final enzymatically saccharified hydrolyzates for switchgrass and corn stover. High pressure carbonated water pretreatment yielded 9–13% less sugars than the sulfuric acid-derived hydrolyzate and relatively 6–10% less sugars were found in the final carbonated water treated hydrolyzates after further enzymatic treatment. It was also found that carbonated water pretreated switchgrass hydrolyzate required 33% lesser amount of enzyme for saccharification when compared to that obtained using dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment. The supercritical carbon dioxide dissolved in water provides an environmentally benign and “green” pretreatment method for depolymerization of the sugars present in biomass substrates and to facilitate further saccharification without the necessity of base neutralization, or pH adjustment prior to application of enzyme-initiated hydrolysis.Pretreatment of biomass substrates is considered a critical step in the process of development of sustainable and renewable biofuels, such as bioethanol, which is produced from the fermentation of monomeric sugars derived from polysaccharide constituents, cellulose and hemicellulose, found in the biomass substrates Gas-based pretreatment/comminution methods have employed carbon dioxide The application of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO Several reports have appeared in the literature in which SC-CO Several investigators have measured the dissolution of high pressure CO Based on the above considerations, we initiated a multi-year study designed to exploit the effect of high SC-CO The corn stover and cob ( Depol™ 692L (Biocatalysis Ltd., Caen Coed, Wales, UK), a mixed carbohydrase exhibiting both cellulase (800 Throughout the study, ultrapure deionized (DI) water was obtained from a Milli-Q Synthesis Model A10 unit (18.2 The process schematic for batch high pressure carbonated water pretreatment of biomass substrates is given in The sulfuric acid hydrolysis was carried out according to the method of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Analytical Procedure (LAP) The pH of the biomass hydrolyzate obtained from both carbonated water and sulfuric acid pretreatments were measured using a Mettler-Toledo Seven-easy system fitted with an InLab Science-Pro electrode (Columbus, OH). Depending on the measured pH values, the hydrolyzates were appropriately neutralized with potassium hydroxide solution to maintain a pH between 4 and 6. Varying amounts of the hydrolyzates (0.2–1.4 Initial characterization of all hydrolyzates obtained from both neat subcritical water and carbonated subcritical water were done by high performance size exclusion chromatography (SEC). A modular SEC system was used consisting of a Waters Model 510 pump unit (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA), a Waters Model 2414 refractive index (RI), accompanied by a Waters Model 717 plus auto injector, comprised the analytical chromatography system. A set of Shodex SEC columns: OH-pak SB-802HQ and SB-804 HQ, SB-G guard column (Shoko America, Colorado Springs, CO) were used to fractionate the above hydrolyzates. To accurately reproduce the SEC hydrolyzate profiles, a Waters Model column oven containing the Shodex columns was set at 30 Aside from using the SEC profiles to assess the relative shift in the molecular weight distribution for the cellulose and hemicellulose biomass components, an initial procedure was developed to assess the relative monomeric sugar yields for glucose and xylose. Pure glucose and xylose standard solutions were prepared to run on the above SEC system consisting of the following concentrations: 2 In addition to the SEC characterization of the hydrolyzate solutions, analysis of the individual sugars was also confirmed using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisting of a Dionex Model P-580 pump (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA), a Dionex Model ASI-100 autosampler, along with a Shodex Model RI-101 refractive index detector and a Dionex Model 100 PDA photo diode array detector. A Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (250 The effect of carbonated water in pretreating the biomass substrates was studied using two different orthogonal experimental designs. Initial experiments were performed with an experimental design formulated based on the following variables: CO Based on the inference from the initial experiments, another set of orthogonal design was formulated to study the effect of carbonation on the biomass hydrolysis in hot water at a greater residence or reaction time. This new design was applied to study the hot carbonated water hydrolysis of switchgrass and corn stover at a constant particle size of 75–106 As previously discussed in Section It can be seen from Initial studies indicated that, compared with the traditional diluted sulfuric acid hydrolysis, the xylose and glucose's percentage recovery of corn cob, corn stover and switch grass were 61.4 and 61.8, 42.8 and 72.5, 28.3 and 32.9, respectively, illustrating that the hot carbonated water pretreatment is a promising pretreatment method for biomass hydrolysis. The SEC profiles for corn stover, switch grass and corn cob hydrolyzates obtained from hot water pretreatment at various orthogonal design conditions are shown in It can also be seen from From these initial studies, further experiments were required to further demonstrate the efficacy of carbonated water pretreatment of biomass substrates. This specifically included an increase in the residence time especially for the hydrolysis of switchgrass. Since corn-based substrates were hydrolyzed similarly by carbonated water, further experiments were only done on corn stover. Experiments to further demonstrate the efficacy of hot carbonated water pretreatment of switchgrass were done at temperatures: 160, 170 and 180 The second set of experiments performed to study the efficiency of hot carbonated water pretreatment of corn stover used the following experimental conditions: temperature of 150, 160 and 170 The carbochemical yield was also measured in the hydrolysates using in-line UV spectrophotometry as discussed in Section The Depol 692L enzymatic loading (E) for the saccharification of the switchgrass and corn stover hydrolyzates obtained after pretreatment with carbonated water and dilute sulfuric acid are shown in  As indicated previously, Depol 692L is a mixed enzymatic cocktail consisting mainly of cellulase and pectinase. In order to assess the effect of the other components in the enzyme cocktail, the corn stover hydrolyzate obtained after pretreatment was independently treated with pure cellulase at similar enzymatic loadings used for Depol 692L. The glucose and xylose yield from enzymatic hydrolysis using a pure cellulase on corn stover hydrolyzate obtained with carbonated water is given in Though enzymatic saccharification of corn stover hydrolyzate using Depol 692L and pure cellulase did not show any particular savings in the amount of enzyme used, there was, however, slight variation in the effect of these enzymes on the total glucose and xylose yield. The glucose and xylose yield from the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover at two different loadings are shown in Similar trends was also seen in case of switchgrass where using pure cellulase yielded about 28.8% less xylose and 7% more glucose compared to Depol 692L after carbonated water pretreatment. It was found that enzymatic saccharification of switchgrass after carbonated water pretreatment using pure cellulase yielded about 32.6 The reported studies utilizing supercritical carbon dioxide dissolved in water for the pretreatment and depolymerization of sugars present in biomass substrates such as corn stover and switchgrass offers some additional benefits aside from lowering the required amount of the enzyme needed to saccharify cellulose and hemicellulose such as (a) alleviating the need for neutralization of the acidic medium after pretreatment has been completed; and (b) in situ optimal pH adjustment via carbonic acid prior to enzymatic hydrolysis. It has been demonstrated from two different experimental designs and using multiple analyses that it is possible to vary the efficiency and selectivity of the products obtained from carbonated water pretreatment of biomass by varying process conditions especially temperature and pressure.
