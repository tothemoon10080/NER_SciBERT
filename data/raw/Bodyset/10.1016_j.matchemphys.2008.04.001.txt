Thorny BaCO3 dendritic structures were successfully synthesized by a simple PEG-assisted method. The results revealed that reaction conditions, such as aging time, and the concentration of the PEG, are important factors which determines the morphologies and growth process of the final products. The obtained barium carbonate was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). As a result, it was found that the morphologies are different in different reaction system.Recently, there has been an intensive focus on synthesizing higher ordered inorganic crystals or hybrid inorganic/organic materials with a specific size, shape, orientation, organization, complex form, and hierarchy PEG, BaCl In a typical synthesis, the preparation of BaCO The structure and chemical composition of all BaCO In order to further investigate the formation process of the thorny BaCO In summary, we have found a simple and mild solvent treatment method to prepare thorny dendritic structures of BaCO This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation of China (No. 20171001) and the Naturescience fund of the Bureau of Education of Anhui Province in China (No. 2005KJ369ZC).
