Due to the lack of reliable and/or inexpensive hardware sensors in cement grinding, development of software sensors is particularly significant for control and monitoring purposes. In this study, a nonlinear distributed-parameter, full-horizon observer is designed, which allows the contents of the mill to be described in terms of hold-up and particle size distribution. When measurements are available at relatively high sampling rates and at, at least, two spatial locations along the mill, fast observer convergence is obtained. However, in practical situations where measurements can be collected at the mill outlet only and with a relatively low sampling rate, the observer convergence deteriorates and, as the sampling rate decreases, performance becomes similar to an asymptotic (simulation) observer. The robustness of the software sensor can be improved by on-line identification of some time-varying parameters, such as the material grindability. These several concepts are discussed and tested in simulation based on a realistic process model.
