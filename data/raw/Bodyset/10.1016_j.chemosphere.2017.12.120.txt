In this work, synthetic wastewater polluted with ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (Bmim) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf2) undergoes four electrolytic treatments with diamond anodes (bare electrolysis, electrolysis enhanced with peroxosulfate promoters, irradiated with UV light and with US) and results obtained were compared with those obtained with the application of Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation (CWPO). Despite its complex heterocyclic structure, Bmim+ cation is successfully depleted with the five technologies tested, being transformed into intermediates that eventually can be mineralized. Photoelectrolysis attained the lowest concentration of intermediates, while CWPO is the technology less efficient in their degradation. However, the most surprising result is that concentration of NTf2
                     - anion does not change during the five advanced oxidation processes tested, pointing out its strong refractory character, being the first species that exhibits this character in wastewater undergoing electrolysis with diamond. This means that the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals mediated oxidation and the direct electrolysis are inefficient for breaking the C-S, C-F and S-N bounds of the NTf2
                     - anion, which is a very interesting mechanistic information to understand the complex processes undergone in electrolysis with diamond.Over the last two decades, hundreds of papers have demonstrated the outstanding performance of the electrolysis of different types of wastewater with diamond anodes. Very high current efficiencies, exceptional robustness and lack of refractory species can be considered as the three most important labels for this technology ( To attain these conclusions, thousands of products have been tested, ranging from very high-molecular weight dyes ( Taking into account these points, this work reports the results obtained during the electrolysis of an ionic liquid, the salt 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (Bmim) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf Analytical grade BminNTf Bmin Electrolyses were carried out using the experimental setup and methodology described elsewhere ( Synthetic wastewater was prepared by dissolving 419 mg L Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation (CWPO) experiments were performed with a Fe/γ-Al Oxidation experiments were carried out in batch in 400 mL glass batch reactor with temperature control and a magnetic stirring velocity of 500 rpm. The catalysts were used in powdered form (dp < 100 mm) and at 1 g L  As it can be observed, the complete mineralization of the synthetic wastes is not attained by any of the technologies tested. Nonetheless, the trends observed suggest that it would be possible to achieve a complete TOC removal by increasing the operation time during the electrochemical treatments. In addition, great differences can be found among the different electrolytic treatments, indicating the great significance of mediated oxidation processes promoted in each of them. At this point, the most efficient result is obtained with the addition of sulfates to the synthetic waste and this clearly points out the significant role of persulfate and sulfate radicals formed by its activation in the electrolysis with diamond anodes (Eqs. This better performance is especially relevant at very low TOC concentrations, where it clearly overcomes the results obtained by sonoelectrolysis, which behaves as the most efficient technology for higher TOC concentrations. This behavior is directly related to the nature of the organics present in wastewater ( Hence, BmimNTf In comparing the removal of Bmim, results are not surprising. As expected, the CWPO is the fastest process for the removal of the raw ionic liquid. In this case, only the oxidation by hydroxyl radicals is expected, which is known to be very efficient for molecular structures like the heterocycle Bmim However, the most interesting result is the refractory behavior of the NTf  A last important observation is related to the nitrogen speciation, which is illustrated in Bmim From this work, the following conclusions can be drawn: The concentration of the anion bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is kept constant during the five oxidation tests carried out, being the first time that it is reported a refractory behavior in electrolysis with diamond anodes. Hydroxyl radicals, direct electrolysis and radical sulfate/persulfate oxidation are not able to break the C-F, C-S or S-N bounds of the NTf Cation 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium can be fully oxidized by electrolysis with diamond electrodes, leading to the complete mineralization and to the formation of ammonium and nitrates ions. Concentrations of intermediates formed depends on the particular technology used being photoelectrolysis the technology which shows the lowest concentration, that is, the almost direct transformation of the Bmim The efficiency in the treatment of ionic liquid BmimNTf Authors gratefully appreciate financial support from the
