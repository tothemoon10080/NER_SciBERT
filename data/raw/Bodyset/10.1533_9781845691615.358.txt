 Carcass dressing operations leave varying proportions of meat adhering to bones: the world total has been estimated to be 2 million metric tons ( When bones of high marrow content are processed, the lipid and haem concentration of the product is increased. These circumstances worsen the tendency of the mechanically recovered meat to undergo oxidative rancidity ( Typical data on the composition of meat recovered either mechanically or manually from bones are given in The well-known susceptibility of enzymic reactions to high pressure, and the effects of the latter on the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins ( It had been shown by Various explanations have been advanced for the tenderizing action of high pressure. Respecting the general effects of high pressure and temperature on proteins, whereas electrostatic bonds and hydrophobic interactions are susceptible to the former, they are less affected by high temperature. However, covalent bonds and SH groups are labile at high temperature but more resistant to high pressure (  Pressurization of muscles having a high ultimate pH has little effect on the proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is only in muscles which undergo appreciable post-mortem glycolysis that proteolysis of these proteins occurs under pressure and thus implicates enzymes of lysosomes in their breakdown ( Pressures of the order of 400 In a study comparing the effect of various combinations of high pressure and heating, Using NMR imaging, Apart from its tenderizing effect, the high-pressure treatment of meat, if it could be applied in industry, would greatly accelerate operations in abattoirs by making possible the production of vacuum-packed, tenderized meat from the hot-deboned carcass. It would be less easy, however, to apply the procedure to post-rigor meat since the need for heat would yield a cooked appearance. Through its effect in accelerating or inhibiting post-mortem glycolysis, pressure treatment could be employed to produce meat of any desired pH in the normal range ( Of more immediate practical importance is the solubilizing action of high pressure on myofibrillar proteins ( The application of high pressure changes the colour of pork and beef ( Under high pressure, the proteins of muscle produce gels, which are different from those caused by high temperature; and, in the future, these differences may well be exploited in altering the texture of meat products to develop novel attributes of desirability for the consumer ( Although it has been reported that pure fats and oils are stabilized against oxidation by exposure to high pressure ( The above considerations refer to the application of Various developments since the Second World War have caused many meat consumers to favour lean steaks rather than meat from joints, with its associated fat. Because of the high cost of steaks from the relatively limited locations in the carcass which yield meat of the desired characteristics, attempts to produce, from the less expensive cuts, portions of meat having the desirable organoleptic attributes of traditional steaks have been marked since 1970. The high content of connective tissue in such meat has necessitated its comminution or subdivision by mechanical means, and its subsequent reforming or restructuring into steak-like portions. The process permits the control of product colour, texture and fat distribution. The size of the comminuted pieces has determined which term is appropriate, but in the present context ‘reforming’ will be employed. Restructured meat products have been extensively reviewed in a volume edited by Reformed meat can be prepared from fresh and cured meat by the procedure of tumbling or massaging (as now used for hams; cf. The relatively small muscles of the less expensive locations in the carcass, such as the distal parts of the limbs and the neck, naturally vary in their biochemical and chemical constitution ( Although the incorporation of salt (as would be anticipated from The term surimi originally referred to a Japanese product made from mechanically-deboned white fish which was subsequently refined by removal of water-soluble proteins (including enzymes and pigments) and salts. Surimi thus has an enhanced content of myofibrillar protein in comparison with the original fish and is important as a functional ingredient in the food industry. Moreover, because enzymes and haem pigments have been removed, it has an enhanced stability. After a similar leaching process, minced pork, beef and mutton have been shown to yield useful functional products ( Reformed meat requires the incorporation of relatively high levels of lipid to develop the same degree of juiciness as intact meat ( Although the high water-holding capacity of pre-rigor meat would seem to be an advantage in the manufacture of reformed meat, the comminution process would cause the swift onset of rigor mortis, unless the meat was comminuted in the presence of salt immediately post-mortem (cf. The comminution process permits the incorporation of non-meat ( The incorporation of 0.4 per cent of the platelet protein F XIIIa which is a transaminase, with 0.2 per cent phosphate and 1 per cent sodium chloride, has been shown to yield marked textural advantages in binding meat pieces in restructured products. The enzyme can be produced on a large scale, as a recombinant protein, by The pressure required in reforming the comminuted meat will be determined by the initial characteristics of the meat, its temperature and the machinery used. It ranges from 2–7 The severe shortage of protein of high biological value in developing countries, and the high cost of meat in those which are not fortunate economically, has fostered great interest in the possibility of fabricating protein-rich foods from plant sources in a palatable form. Artificial meat-like products, which have controlled texture, flavour, colour and nutritive value ( Texturization of recovered proteins has been achieved by three principal methods – fibre spinning, thermoplastic extrusion and heat gelation ( Among the vegetable proteins which have been exploited in this way are the glutens of wheat and the globulins of groundnut, cottonseed, peanut, sesame, yeast In thermoplastic processes the proteinaceous material (often defatted soya flour, not further purified) is fed into the hollow barrel of an extruder where a tapered screw forces it, under high pressure and temperature, towards a narrow orifice into the exterior. Under these conditions, starch components gelatinize, proteins partially denature and the tractile mass is restructured and aligned. These prefabricated products combined with other food components, colouring and flavour can be made up as simulated meats ( Because of the intrinsic cheapness of proteins from vegetables and microbial origin and (depending on the source) the absence of nutritional disadvantages, there is bound to be a great increase in their use as substitutes for expensive proteins of animal origin. Clearly there is also an increasing possibility that the recommended levels of substitution could be exceeded, and a concomitant need to establish means of quantitatively determining the origin of proteins in food products (Food Standards Although the titre of protein-bound, connective tissue-free, 3-methylhistidine appears to be very similar between corresponding skeletal muscles of species as different as whales, rabbits and domestic meat animals, and between the muscles of the prime cuts of the carcass, it is low in smooth muscle ( The authenticity of meat products, in terms of their meat content, and in relation to non-meat components and permitted or non-permitted offal, the species from which they were alleged to have been derived and the processing treatment received by the meat (e.g. freezing, ionizing irradiation, mechanical recovery, ageing), is still a matter of ongoing concern in national and international trade. The parameters analysed, and the modes of analysis used, in determining such authenticity, were reviewed by Recently, monoclonal antibodies against the thermostable muscle protein, troponin I, have been successfully employed to differentiate species and to distinguish muscular tissue from gelatin and the proteins of blood and milk ( For some consumers (such as vegetarians) an organoleptically attractive, mutritious product, entirely free from meat, would be a desideratum. One commercially successful commodity of this nature is manufactured from the RNA-reduced cells of a In view of the frequent drawbacks of low acceptability, absence of organoleptic quality and high cost in meat-like products prefabricated from vegetable or bacterial  A general prerequisite for the upgrading of offal proteins is their recovery from the source. When proteins are in suspension or solution they can be recovered by flocculation, ion exchange chromatography or ultra-filtration ( The functionality of blood plasma proteins can be largely retained by partial freeze-drying ( In the past, when attempts were made to recover solid slaughter wastes for feeds or fertilizers, or to recover fat, neither the nutritive value nor the functional properties of the proteins were considered. Azeotropic distillation, controlled enzymic Proteins can be recovered in good yield from bovine, ovine and porcine lungs and stomachs ( Insofar as there is a growing market for protein hydrolysates (as flavour enhancers, functional ingredients or merely as nutritional additives to foods of low protein quality), it is of interest that these can be readily produced by controlled enzymic treatment ( As in the case of proteins from non-meat sources (cf. Fibres containing 17–18 per cent protein can be spun from such sources. Those spun from stomachs and lungs tend to have less mechanical strength than those from blood plasma, but since they have higher contents of isoleucine and methionine (which are deficient in the latter), both textural and nutritional benefits can be achieved by spinning fibres from mixed sources ( There are advantages in spinning fibres from mixtures of offal protein and polysaccharides such as alginate ( Not surprisingly, spinning is associated with a significant reduction in the number of micro-organisms originally present in the offal from which the fibres are prepared. Spun protein fibres were found to be microbiological sterile for at least 3 years at 0 Although cereal, soya and other plant proteins can be thermoplastically extruded, this is not possible with proteins recovered from offal when these are used alone ( Lipid–protein interactions are important determinants of the structure of offal protein. Thus, their suitability for thermoplastic extrusion (in association with a carrier such as soya protein) is greatly altered by the amount of residual lipid in the extracted protein. The controlled removal of lipid from the latter by the use of fat solvents of different polarity causes systematic and extensive changes in the texture of the products subsequently prepared from the proteins by thermoplastic extrusion (  Since the proteins which can be readily extracted from stomachs and lungs are derived mainly from smooth muscle in these tissues, and since the latter closely resembles striated muscle in composition ( Whilst the use of prefabricated meats from animal or vegetable sources in convenience foods, for special diets and as complementary feeding in underdeveloped areas, may be expected to increase steadily, most authorities agree that they will not displace the demand for carcass meat in the foreseeable future. This is not only a question of eating quality. It reflects recognition that, notwithstanding their lower capacity for producing protein than vegetables or bacteria, meat animals represent the only economically feasible means of utilizing the protein in plant sources growing on poor ground. And it must be recognized that a great proportion of the world’s land surface is only fit for grazing and not for cultivation. As
