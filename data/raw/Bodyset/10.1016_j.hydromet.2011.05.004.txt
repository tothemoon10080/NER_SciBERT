The chemical stability of LIX®63 (hydroxyoxime) in the presence of the carboxylic acid Versatic 10 and tributyl phosphate (TBP) was assessed under synthetic nickel laterite extract (pH 5.5) and strip conditions in the absence and presence of organic additive TXIB (the diester 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol diisobutyrate). Anomalous cobalt extraction behaviour resulted in lower than expected cobalt uptake. Hydroxyoxime half lives were found to range from 26 to 68weeks and 102 to 229weeks under extract conditions at 45 and 35°C, respectively, and 72 to 86 and >200weeks under strip conditions. Decreasing hydroxyoxime half life under extract conditions appeared to be associated primarily or solely with increasing copper complexation. The presence of TXIB had no appreciable effect on hydroxyoxime stability.
                  Investigation into the unexpectedly poor cobalt loading observed in the stability study samples resulted in the observation of unusual, ‘N’-shaped cobalt extraction isotherms. This phenomenon was found to be attributable to ongoing displacement of complexed cobalt by nickel when insufficient anti-hydroxyoxime was available. Increasing the hydroxyoxime concentration overcame this issue.Although its origins can be readily traced back to work done in the 1960s and 1970s ( at a given temperature, hydroxyoxime degradation occurs more readily under extract conditions relative to strip conditions; increased operating temperature results in faster degradation of hydroxyoxime; increased metal loading, particularly cobalt and/or manganese, results in faster degradation of hydroxyoxime. The work also resulted in several hydroxyoxime degradation products being identified, namely 5,8-diethyl-7-hydroxy-6-dodecanone (acyloin), 5,8-diethyl-6,7-dodecanedione (diketone) and 5,8-diethyldodecan-6-oxime-7-one (‘keto-oxime’), and an understanding of the operating conditions favouring each particular degradation product. It has also led to the development of an analytical procedure to distinguish Due to slow extraction and stripping kinetics, the LIX 63/Versatic 10 synergistic system was deemed not particularly suitable for Ni extraction ( Reagent stability studies always require assessment under relevant operating conditions. The presence of TBP in the organic phase, coupled with the use of markedly different aqueous solutions relative to the El Boleo system, made reassessment under these operating conditions necessary. Some prior work had been undertaken, and suggested that TBP had little or no effect on hydroxyoxime stability under strip conditions ( Three synthetic aqueous feed solutions-nickel laterite, Co-free laterite and Mn-free laterite were prepared using technical grade sulphate salts of Ni, Co, Cu and Mg, and analytical grade CaCl A bulk precursor organic solution (6.00 A solution (3.33 A solution (3.33 A solution (0.30 All organic solutions were washed four times with an aqueous 50 Experimental conditions used in the present work are summarised in For all experiments, the organic/aqueous mixtures were placed in hexagonal glass jars (70 Organic samples (3–4 A Varian 3800 gas chromatograph fitted with a DB-1 fused silica capillary column (30 To enable the detection of the hydroxyoxime extractant, samples (85 Organic (200 The synthetic nickel laterite aqueous solution and TXIB-free organic solution used in the present work were comparable to those used previously As a result of the lower than expected cobalt uptake, the current stability trials do not properly replicate the intended nickel laterite conditions. Despite this, the present results were still able to be used to assess the impact of changes in metal (particularly Ni and Cu) loading levels, temperature and the presence of TBP and TXIB on hydroxyoxime stability. Increasing the A:O ratio resulted in increased total metal loading ( Hydroxyoxime levels determined throughout the trial of the organic samples agitated at 45 The range of hydroxyoxime half lives as a function of mixing conditions (extract or strip), A:O ratio and TXIB content is summarised in The relationship between hydroxyoxime half life, A:O ratio, TXIB content and metal loading levels for the extract experiments was assessed statistically.
