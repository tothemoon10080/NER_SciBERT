A Compendium of Geochemistry is essentially a well-structured and well-explained compilation of geochemical statistics. The huge range of the topics from solar system chemistry to element distributions in human tissue are underpinned by the author's deep understanding of physical chemistry. After a quick in depth tour of physical chemistry in chapter one the following three chapters, almost half the book, address solar system chemistry and the chemistry of meteorites. This reflects a strong academic bias and although clearly explained detracts somewhat from its applicability to the applied geochemist. Information on the bulk earth, igneous rocks, oceans and biological systems fill the remaining chapters which are an excellent source of geochemical data. The final chapter on the biosphere and homosapiens provides explanations of the chemistry of plants and average man and concludes with an interesting section on the geochemical impact of fossil fuel combustion. As stated in the preface the book does not contain detail information on isotope chemistry or atmospheric chemistry but with such an all-encompassing title this is worth reiterating. The author should be congratulated on his efforts in compiling such a diverse range of geochemical data and in the clarity of his explanations. What he has produced is an excellent reference text; a first stop for anyone seeking bulk geochemical data, which at Â£47 is reasonable value for a book of this type.
