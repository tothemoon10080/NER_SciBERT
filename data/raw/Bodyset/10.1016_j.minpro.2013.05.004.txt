The Bond- and the Hardgrove methods are widely used for the determination of brittle materials' grindability. Generally, the determination of the Bond work index of inhomogeneous materials can be carried out with high deviation using the conventional grindability apparatuses and methods, because of the highly different grindability of components. In the industry the feed of the grinding apparatuses frequently has components with high grindability-difference. The design and operation of the mills can be highly affected by the above mentioned properties. A possible solution can be the combined application of the Bond-method with the determination of the component's weight ratio in the product. The Bond measurement should be performed until the steady state conditions of grindability (G) and chemical composition of the components are reached. To prove the applicability of the above mentioned idea systematic Bond, Hardgrove grindability tests and Karra simulations were carried out of binary mixtures. The experimental results showed that the application of the combined procedure is proven in order to have a more accurate and reliable calculation of the Bond work index of composite materials, especially when the components have significant difference in the grindability and composition. The measurements also showed the possibilities and limits of the grindability tests and calculation methods.The determination of the composite materials' grindability is a complex task. The Bond work index of inhomogeneous materials can be measured generally with high deviation, because the components have highly different grindabilities. The Bond work index can be determined by many ways, some of them are as follows: with the traditional standard method in a (1) Bond-ball mill or in a (2) Hardgrove mill with the conversion of the Hardgrove method's result to Bond work index by an empirical formula, (3) with the more work-saving Karra algorithm (compared to the standard Bond method), where the Bond work index is estimated from the results of the Bond method's first two cycles. Significant difference is shown by the different measurement methods in the case of the certain materials' grindability. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out comprehensive experiment series, which compare the results of different test and calculation methods and open up the possibilities and limits of each test. Both the national and international literature (            The Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) of mineral mixtures was examined by Based on the study of the available literature, it can be concluded that many papers deal with the investigation of binary mixture grinding, but only some of them deals with the specific grinding energy test methods. These papers manly focus only on one test method, so it is necessary to make comparative investigation and open up the possibilities and limits of the test and calculation methods. Traditional Bond ball mill (Ø305 Bond measurements were performed according to the conventional way given by For simulation of the Bond grindability test Karra's algorithm was used according to 2 for fines in the prepared feed if XY 1 for fines in the prepared feed if XY The equations for work index in ball mill is calculated as follows During the laboratory investigation Hardgrove and Bond experiment series were carried out using corundum–limestone and clinker–limestone binary mixtures. As for the sample materials' selection the significant grindability difference and the industrial application were taken into account. The Bond experiments were carried out using 0; 25; 50; 75 and 100% limestone content, the Hardgrove experiments were performed using 0; 12.5; 25; 50; 75; 87.5; 100% limestone content. The material composition of each grinding cycles' product was determined by measuring the loss on ignition (L.O.I.) in order to follow up the different grinding velocities of the composite-components. The loss on ignition was determined after 20 During the Bond measurements the 80% passing particle size of products was determined after each grinding step. The particle size distribution of products was determined by a Horiba LA-950 laser particle size analyzer. Water dispersion medium and 20 As the result of the grindability tests, the Bond work index of mixtures was determined the following ways: Traditional Bond measurement (W Conversion from the Hardgrove index (W Karra algorithm (W Weighted average of the initial material's Bond work index, according to the composition of feed (W Volume average of the initial material's Bond work index, according to the composition of feed (W Weighted average of the initial material's Bond work index, according to the composition of the last Bond grinding cycle's feed (W Volume average of the initial material's Bond work index, according to the composition of the last Bond grinding cycle's feed (W In the first step of the Bond series the individual components' Bond work index was determined separately. As a result, an appropriate starting point was received for the evaluation of the mixtures' Bond work index. The Bond work index of the components from the traditional Bond measurement (W The corundum has an extremely high Bond work index, this provided a basis for the composite material production from components with high grindability difference. The results of the mixtures' Bond measurement in accordance with the grinding cycles (n) can be found in The first mixture contains 75% limestone and 25% corundum in weight, the results of these measurements can be seen in It is observed that in the first and second grinding cycles the initial 75% limestone content increased significantly to the rate of 86–89%. During the subsequent cycles the limestone content of < Meanwhile the 80% passing particle size increased continuously from the initial 48 The Bond work index of the mixture is 16.3 In the next mixture the limestone and corundum are mixed half and half, the results of the measurement can be seen in It is observed that initially the limestone content of the product increased significantly compared to the original 50%; its value in the first cycle is 72%. During the subsequent grinding cycles the limestone content of < Meanwhile the 80% passing particle size increased continuously from the initial 53 The Bond work index of the mixture is 21.6 The third limestone–corundum mixture consists of 25% limestone and 75% corundum, the results of the measurement can be seen in It is observed that the initial, 25% limestone content is more than doubled; its value in the first cycles' product became 53.5%. During the subsequent grinding cycles the limestone content of < Meanwhile the 80% passing particle size increased continuously from the initial 60 The Bond work index of the mixture is 26.3 The results of the Bond measurements using limestone–corundum mixtures are summarized in The phenomenon is all about that the grinding velocity of limestone is significantly higher than that of corundum. This leads to the sudden growth of the relative limestone content In addition it was observed that: Based on the above results the Bond work index estimated from the first two grinding cycles with Karra-algorithm is underestimated in all cases, as well as the difference between the measured and estimated Bond work indices increased with the increasing weight ratio of the harder to grind component in the composite. Similarly, the difference between the measured Bond work indices and the calculated work indices W When the composition of the last Bond grinding cycle's feed was taken into account to the calculation, the results show different tendencies. The mixtures' Bond work index was overestimated by the calculation as a weighted average W The relative limestone content The composition of actual feed based on the absolute values, the more different from the initial value, the higher the easy to grind component's ratio in the feed. In the case of the relative values the situation is opposite (see The result of the Bond measurement with 75–25% limestone–clinker mixture can be seen in Meanwhile the 80% passing particle size of the product increased continuously from the initial 55.6 The Bond work index of the mixture was 14.1 The result of the Bond measurement using 50–50% limestone–clinker mixture can be seen in The 80% passing particle size of the product increased continuously from the initial 66 The Bond work index of the mixture is 15.4 The result of the Bond measurement with 25–75% limestone–clinker mixture can be seen in The 80% passing particle size of the product increased continuously from the initial 69.3 The Bond work index of the mixture is 18.4 The results of the Bond measurements with limestone–clinker mixture are summarized in Based on the above results the Bond work index estimated from the first two grinding cycles with Karra-algorithm gave relatively good result compared to the measured Bond work index. The highest error was given in the case of 25% clinker content. The difference between the measured Bond work indices and the calculated work indices W The relative limestone content The results of the Hardgrove measurements and the material composition of products can be seen in The grindability index determination with the Hardgrove test is based on the weight of the ground material finer 75 Essential question is what the material composition of this product is and if it is corresponding to the composition of the feed. In The easier-to-grind limestone, the material with higher grinding velocity, significantly enriched in the < The difference between the limestone content of the product < The most significant difference from the initial material in the product is shown in the case of the 50–50% limestone–corundum material composition. The Bond work index calculated from the Hardgrove index and their weighted average can be seen in It is observed that: In line with the composition difference, as well as consequently from the mode of the Hardgrove measurement, namely that in the Hardgrove method the determination of the grindability index is based on the weight of the ground material < It can be seen in In the case of the Hardgrove measurement of limestone–clinker mixtures similar trends can be seen as presented above ( The value of the Bond work index calculated from the Hardgrove index differs from the work index measured in the Bond mill and also differs from the result of Karra estimation. The degree of difference is significantly lower than that of limestone–corundum mixtures. The highest difference is observed between the work indices calculated from Hardgrove index and the conventional measured Bond work index with 50–50% mixture content, here the relative difference is 15.3%. The explanation of the above phenomena is the same as before. However, it is clear that the enrichment of limestone in product (finer 75 In this case the mixture's Bond work index is given with a low difference (almost negligible) by the Karra algorithm compared to the result of the conventional method. Bond and Hardgrove laboratory grindability tests were carried out using limestone–corundum and limestone–clinker mixtures in different compositions. In all experiment series the material composition of the product was determined by loss on ignition (LOI) measurement. The Bond grindability tests were carried out not only until the steady state conditions of grindability coefficient Comparing the Bond work index values of the different methods as a function of the material composition, the following conclusions can be drawn: In the processes of various grindability tests the same phenomenon occurs, namely the grinding velocity of limestone is significantly higher than that of the corundum or clinker, this leads to the sudden growth of the limestone content in the initial finer 106 Based on the performed Bond measurements it can be observed that in all six mixtures with different compositions the easy-to-grind component (limestone) enriched initially significantly in the product < The closed circuit Bond method is considered to be the most reliable. When the grindability difference is high, the examination of the chemical composition of feed and the finer 106 The lowest Bond work index values were given by the estimation from the Hardgrove measurements (HGI). This method had the highest relative difference compared to the conventional Bond measurement, the major reason is that the conventional Hardgrove method operates as a batch mill, that makes possible for the easier to grind material to be enriched significantly in the product < In the case of high grindability difference the calculation with the Karra algorithm was not led to reasonable result, the Bond work index was estimated with high error. In the case of low grindability difference the Karra algorithm can be used for the estimation of the mixtures' grindability. The error of the Bond work index estimation significantly increased by the increasing ratio of the harder to grind (corundum, clinker) component both in the Karra-algorithm and in the calculation from Hardgrove-index. Knowing the component's Bond work index, the estimation of the mixture's Bond work index as a weighted average gave significant difference even in the case of low grindability difference. However the calculation as a volume average could be used with a relatively low error. grindability coefficient [g/rev] Bond grinding cycle number [pc] limestone content [%] limestone content of the product [%] limestone content of the feed [%] 80% passing particle size [μm] Bond work index measured with the traditional Bond test [kW Bond work index calculated with the Karra algorithm [kW Bond work index computed from the Hardgrove measurements result [kW relative limestone content in the product of the Bond measurements first grinding step [-] relative limestone content in the feed of the last Bond grinding step [-] Bond work index calculated from the Bond work index of the components as a volume average based on a composition of the last feed [kW Bond work index calculated from the Bond work index of the components as a volume average based on a composition of the first feed [kW Bond work index calculated from the Bond work index of the components as a weighted average based on a composition of the last feed [kW Bond work index calculated from the Bond work index of the components as a weighted average based on a composition of the first feed [kW difference between the Bond and Hardgrove measurements [kW maximal difference between the composition of feed and product in the case of the Hardgrove measurement [%] The authors' kindly appreciate the cooperation of Zoltán Pap and Viktor Török in the execution of the experiments.
