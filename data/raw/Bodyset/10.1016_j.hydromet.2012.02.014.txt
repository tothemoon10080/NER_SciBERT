The present work is devoted to simultaneous ion exchange recovery of platinum(II, IV) and rhodium(III) from sulfate–chloride solutions, freshly prepared and stored over 3months, on commercial macroporous anion exchangers with different chemical structures. The sorption was carried out from solutions with 2.0; 0.1 and 0.01mol/L

                     . The initial concentrations of platinum and rhodium in contacting solutions were 0.05–5.0mmol/L. Sorption and kinetic properties of selected anion exchangers were investigated and the basic parameters of ion exchange capacity, recovery, distribution coefficients, separation factors, process rate, diffusion coefficients and half-exchange times were calculated. It was shown that the anion exchangers possess high sorption ability towards platinum and rhodium during their recovery from freshly prepared and stored sulfate–chloride solutions. The optimal molar ratio of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids was determined as 1:1. It was shown that freshly prepared sulfate–chloride systems have the same efficiency during simultaneous

In case of stored systems, the sulfate–chloride solutions compare favorably with chloride ones.The unique properties of platinum group metals (PGM) foster their wide application in technical engineering, construction of vehicles and equipment, chemical industry, oil refining, medical practice and art of jewelry. One of the largest consumers of PGM is the automobile industry, where platinum, palladium and rhodium are essential components for catalytic filters–neutralizers of exhaust gases ( However, the depletion of natural PGM resources leads to the development of their production from secondary sources — spent automobile catalysts, catalysts from chemical industry, electronic scrap, etc. ( It should be noted that in most cases, the ionic state of industrial PGM solutions is complex chloride forms ( It is known that the most complete recovery of PGM from hydrochloric acidic and chloride solutions can be achieved using sorption methods ( For our investigation, we selected the anion exchangers which exhibited the best sorption properties during simultaneous platinum and rhodium recovery from chloride solutions ( The initial rhodium stock solution with concentration 9.709 The initial platinum stock solution with concentration 9.669 The working platinum and rhodium solutions with concentrations 0.05–5.0 The content of platinum and rhodium in the working solutions and in solutions after sorption was determined by a spectrophotometrical method with tin(II) chloride ( Sorption of noble metals was carried out under batch experiment conditions at (20 The efficiency of sorption recovery of platinum and rhodium was estimated by means of recovery degree ( The content of platinum or rhodium in the resin phase was calculated from the difference between initial and equilibrium concentrations in solution, taking into account resin mass and volume of contacting solution. The sorption isotherms were plotted by varying the molar ratio of resins to the amounts of platinum or rhodium in contacting solution and then, based on these curves, we have calculated the apparent constants of ion exchange equilibrium according to the law of mass action ( In accordance with this law, the anion exchange equilibrium can be written in general form as follows: Then the apparent constant of this equilibrium ( As follows from The kinetic behavior of ion exchangers towards platinum and rhodium was investigated by “limited bath” method ( Then the kinetic curves The interpretation of results on kinetics was carried out according to Boyd's method ( If the process is controlled by gel diffusion, the function All the results obtained were subjected to statistical processing according to conventional procedures ( The sulfate solutions of PGM contain their varied ionic forms — hydrated ions, polymeric aqua hydroxocomplexes and complex polynuclear aqua hydroxosulfates ( Depending on isolation conditions, the compounds of rhodium(III) sulfate at constant ratio The “yellow” rhodium sulfate is isolated from sulfate solution at When rhodium sulfate solutions are stored at room temperature from 24 At present, all the studied platinum sulfate compounds can be classified among anionic di- or polynuclear aqua and aqua hydroxosulfates of platinum(II) or platinum(II, IV) ( Therefore, the sulfate solutions of platinum and rhodium are characterized by variety and intricacy of their species as well as by their kinetic inertness. It was mentioned above that sorption recovery of noble metals from such media does not lead to desired results even using the complex-forming ion exchangers. That is why the activation of these systems (e.g. by means of autoclave-cured chlorination) is necessary ( As We have obtained the electron absorption spectra of freshly prepared and stored over 3 It should be noted that the “yellow” rhodium sulfate has an absorption maximum in spectrum at 410–415 It can be seen from Therefore, the sulfate–chloride solutions (both freshly prepared and stored) contain the same complexes as the corresponding chloride solutions. The maximum at 217 The results on sorption recovery of platinum and rhodium from freshly prepared sulfate–chloride solutions are summarized in The decrease in acidity of contacting solution increases the sorption ability of all the investigated sorbents. It can be explained either by increase in complexation ability of anion exchangers Purolite S 985 and AM-2B, or by decrease in competing effect of chloride and sulfate ions during The molar ratio of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids in contacting solution does not have a considerable effect on platinum recovery ( Using this ratio as well as acids concentration of 0.01 It can be seen also from the data presented in It should be also noted that simultaneous recovery of platinum and rhodium from freshly prepared and stored sulfate–chloride solutions on Purolite S 985 proceeds practically on the same level as their sorption from chloride systems ( We have calculated the factors of separation of platinum and rhodium during their recovery from sulfate–chloride solutions, which are presented in It can be seen from these data that all the separation factor values exceed 1 during Isotherms of sorption of platinum(II, IV) and rhodium(III) from sulfate–chloride solutions, freshly prepared and stored, on the anion exchangers investigated are shown in Based on sorption isotherms, we have calculated apparent constants of ion exchange equilibria in sulfate–chloride systems, which are summarized in Then we have investigated the kinetics of ion exchange recovery of platinum and rhodium from sulfate–chloride solutions, freshly prepared and stored, on anion exchangers studied. The calculated kinetic parameters are given in It can be seen from presented data that the resins possess good kinetic properties. They are on the same level in case of freshly prepared sulfate–chloride solutions as the properties of these resins during The kinetics type during simultaneous sorption of platinum and rhodium from sulfate–chloride systems was determined according to the classical Boyd's model with the corresponding criteria ( The average diffusion coefficients ( Therefore, the efficiency of investigated sulfate–chloride systems is no less than the efficiency of chloride systems and the studied anion exchangers Purolite S 985 and Purolite A 500 as well as AM-2B can be recommended for simultaneous recovery of platinum (II,IV) and rhodium (III) from sulfate–chloride solutions.  It was shown that the anion exchangers investigated possess good sorption properties during recovery of platinum(II, IV) and rhodium(III) from sulfate–chloride freshly prepared and stored solutions. The sorption ability of anion exchangers increases with the decrease in acidity of contacting solution and does not practically depend in case of platinum recovery on molar ratio of hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas the rhodium sorption depends substantially on this ratio. It was determined that the molar ratio It was shown that separation factors of It was determined that the ion exchangers investigated possess good kinetic properties and the rate of ion exchange is limited by gel diffusion. The kinetic parameters (process rate, diffusion coefficients and half-exchange times) were calculated and showed faster sorption of The results allow to conclude that in the whole the efficiency of sulfate–chloride systems is high and compares favorably with chloride systems in case of stored solutions.
