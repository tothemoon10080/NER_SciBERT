The purpose of this investigation was to explore the effect of low-temperature pyrolysis on the wettability and floatability of the long-flame low-rank coal particles. Changes in surface functional groups of long-flame coal were measured before and after pyrolysis and the surface free energy of the coal particles was calculated by the van Oss–Chaudhury–Good theory. As the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 500 °C, the total surface free energy γS and the base part

                      indicated a significant increase in hydrophobicity of the long-flame coal after pyrolysis. In addition, the wetting heat of the coal became less negative, indicating significant restriction of the hydrophilicity of the coal surface. The zeta potential of the coal was measured before and after pyrolysis; pyrolysis significantly affected the coal’s zeta potential, which became less negative as the pyrolysis temperature was increased. Thus, the electrostatic repulsion between bubbles and coal particles decreased after pyrolysis, and therefore the attachment time of bubbles to coal particles decreased by up to 72.73%. The flotation recovery of the coal particles increased by up to 38.20% as the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 500 °C.Coal is an important energy source in some countries, especially China In this research, the changes in wettability and floatability of long-flame coal (a low-rank coal) before and after low-temperature pyrolysis were studied. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements were performed to reveal the surface property changes. The surface free energy of mineral particles can affect the wetting of mineral particles during bubble–particle attachment and mineralization Long-flame low-rank coal obtained from Shendong, China, was used in this investigation. To reflect the influence of pyrolysis on the surface properties and flotation response of the coal, low-ash coal was obtained from the as-received coal samples by the float-and-sink method and used in experimentation. The low-ash product was crushed to a particle size of <0.5 mm and the <74 μm particle size fraction was 24.68%; this crushed material was tested as the final coal sample. Proximate physical characterization results for the final coal samples are presented in Low-temperature pyrolysis was performed in a furnace under a controllable atmosphere. The terminal pyrolysis temperatures of 300, 400, and 500 °C were selected and the pyrolysis time of 30 min was used throughout. For each pyrolysis experiment, the coal sample was placed in a quartz container under 180 mL/min N An FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS5, Thermo Fisher) with the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm The sessile drop technique was employed to carry out the contact angle measurement. Prior to the contact angle measurement, the coal samples were firstly ground to <74 μm and then pressed under a 40 MPa pressure using a tablet machine to form a plate. Subsequently, a drop of desired solution was produced, and then was conducted to contact with the coal plate. The contact angle value could be obtained by capturing the droplet image using a drop shape analyzer (DSA100, Krüss GmbH, Germany). For each experiment, a set of 3 times measurements were performed and the average value was adopted. The wetting heat of the coal before and after pyrolysis was measured using a microcalorimeter system (C80, Setaram, France). For the wetting heat measurements, the coal samples were first ground to <74 μm. Then, 8-mg samples were sealed in stainless steel cells under aluminum foil films that divided the cells into two parts each. Next, 2 mL deionized water was placed in the upper part of the stainless steel cell. Then, stainless steel cells with and without coal samples, as test and reference cells, respectively, were placed in the calorimeter. The aluminum foil film was pierced when the system reached equilibrium. Subsequently, the wetting heat was analyzed using the software accompanying the C80 microcalorimeter system. To quantitatively evaluate the influence of pyrolysis on the hydrophobicity of the coal, the inhibiting efficiency IE(%) was calculated according to the following equation Zeta potential measurements of the coal samples before and after pyrolysis were performed using the ZetaPALS system (Brookhaven, USA). The coal samples were firstly ground to <30 μm The attachment time measurements between bubbles and coal particles before and after pyrolysis were conducted using the 2015EZ Induction Timer Instrument (manufactured by Alberta University, Canada). It has been reported that the bubble–particle attachment time was sensitive to the particle size. In the influence of bore water on the coal flotation performance reported by Ozdemir et al., three different coal particle sizes (0.106 × 0.038 mm, 0.25 × 0.106 mm and 0.5 × 0.25 mm) were employed for the bubble–particle attachment time measurements The bubble size (1.25 mm), the initial distance between the bubble bottom and coal particle bed (0.2 mm), the approach and retraction time of the bubble (10 ms), and the amplitude of air bubble motion (3 V) were held constant in this experiment. The contact time for which the pickup efficiency was 50% was defined as the attachment time. Each experiment was repeated 10 times at different positions of the particle bed and the mean value was reported. Flotation testing was performed in a 40-mL micro-flotation cell at 50 g/L solid concentration to investigate the flotation response of the long-flame coal samples before and after pyrolysis. For each experiment, 2 g coal was firstly pre-wetted with deionized water in the flotation cell at the impeller speed of 1800 rpm for 2 min. Then, diesel oil (6000 g/t) and 2-octanol (400 g/t) were added to the flotation cell in succession. The conditioning times for diesel oil and 2-octanol were 3 and 2 min, respectively. Subsequently, air flow at 60 mL/min was introduced and the froth product was collected during 3 min flotation time. The concentrate and the tailing were filtered and dried. Because low-ash coal was used in the investigation, the ash contents of the flotation products were not analyzed and the concentrate yield was used as the sole index to assess the flotation results. Each experiment was conducted twice and the mean value was reported. FTIR spectra of the long-flame coal before and after pyrolysis are shown in The surface free energy of mineral particles is a crucial parameter that affects the mineral particle wetting process during mineralization The total solid surface free energy comprises polar components (i.e., Lewis acids and bases) and non-polar components (i.e., Lifshitz–van der Waals forces) based on the van Oss–Chaudhury–Good theory Based on the Dupré equation, the interfacial free energy between the solid and liquid can be expressed as: By combining Eqs. When the interfacial tension of the three-phase system of solid, liquid, and gas equilibrates, the Young equation Combining Eqs. According to Eq. The surface free energy parameters of the liquid probes are presented in Microcalorimetry with higher accuracy was selected instead of the contact-angle measurement to characterize the coal wettability The heat flow curves of the raw and pyrolyzed coals are plotted in Zeta potential measurements of the long-flame coal before and after pyrolysis were conducted; the corresponding results are presented in Flotation is a selective separation process in which hydrophobic mineral particles are captured by rising air bubbles in the flotation system and transferred to the froth zone. The floatability of the particles can be measured by the bubble–particle attachment time, which is an important parameter reflecting the adhesion probability during the collision of air bubbles and mineral particles. A short attachment time corresponds to high attachment efficiency The flotation results of the long-flame coal before and after pyrolysis are plotted in The effects of low-temperature pyrolysis on the wettability and floatability of long-flame coal were investigated. The major conclusions based on this research are summarized as follows: The hydrophilic oxygenated functional groups of the low-rank coal were cracked with the increased pyrolysis temperature, indicating that the hydrophobicity of the coal was effectively enhanced after the pyrolysis process. The surface free energy was calculated to identify the wettability change of the long-flame coal before and after pyrolysis based on thermodynamics. With the increase in pyrolysis temperature to 500 °C, the total surface free energy γ The zeta potential measurements showed that pyrolysis strongly affected the long-flame coal’s zeta potential, which became less negative as the pyrolysis temperature was increased. Thus, the electrostatic repulsion between the bubbles and the coal particles decreased with pyrolysis. The bubble–particle attachment time decreased by up to 72.73%, from 165 ms to 45 ms, as the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 500 °C. The low-temperature pyrolysis process enhanced the flotation performance of the low-rank coal. For raw low-rank coal, the concentrate yield after 3 min of flotation time only reached to 40.36%. However, the pyrolysis process at 500 °C could produce a product with the flotation concentrate yield of 78.56% after 3 min of flotation time.
