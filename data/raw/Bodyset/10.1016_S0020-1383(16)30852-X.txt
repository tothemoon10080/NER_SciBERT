Background
                  Proximal humerus fractures are common injuries and nonsurgical treatment has proven to yield good to excellent clinical results. A small percentage of these fractures go on to delayed or nonunion and the incidence and risk factors for this complication are poorly understood. We hypothesize that adjacent joint stiffness of the glenohumeral joint might lead to an increased rate of nonunion for proximal humerus fractures.
               
                  Methods
                  A search of the entire Medicare database from 2005 to 2011 was performed to identify 38,754 patients who sustained a proximal humerus fracture including 13,802 with co-existing ipsilateral shoulder osteoarthritis (OA) and 24,952 with co-existing diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A cohort of 301,987 patients served as a control. Medical co-morbidities and fracture complications were compared between the cohorts.
               
                  Results
                  The incidence of delayed union at 3 and 6 months for OA and RA groups were significantly increased compared to control at 0.79% and 1.74%, and 0.67% and 1.86%, respectively (p < 0.001). Nonunion rates were also significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the OA and RA cohorts at 9 months and 1 year with incidences of 2.39%, 2.89% and 2.59% and 3.08%, Respectively. The incidence of nonunion in the control cohort at the same time points was 1.13% and 1.35%.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The coexistence of shoulder OA or a diagnosis of RA nearly doubled in the incidence of proximal humerus nonunion. This is the first study investigating this association in the shoulder and should be considered along with traditional nonunion risk factors in the treatment algorithm.Nearly two million fragility fractures occur each year and are beginning to reach epidemic levels [ Treatment options for PHF in the elderly span a wide range including nonsurgical, percutaneous pinning, tension band wiring, open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with locked plating, humeral head hemiarthroplasty, and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. While numerous, the ideal treatment for this injury has yet to be determined. The treatment decision is often multifactorial. The physician takes into account the complexity of the fracture, patient activity level, medical comorbidities, and quality of life. Systemic reviews and meta-analysis have yet to provide a strong recommendation for surgical over nonsurgical treatment, with a 10–29% complication rate with surgical treatment [ Initially, up to 89% of these injuries will be treated nonsurgically [ The entire 2005–2011 Medicare Standard Analytic Files were queried using Pearl Diver Technologies (West Conshohocken, PA). This study was deemed exempt for institutional review board (IRB) approval at our instruction since the database did not contain any protected health information (PHI). Patients with a proximal humerus fracture, shoulder osteoarthritis (OA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9 Overall, 13,802 patients with PHF and OA (Group OA), 24,952 patients with PHF and RA (Group RA), and 301,978 control patients (PHF without OA or RA) were identified. The most common demographic in the control group was 85 and over (25.3%) and female gender (73.3%). This demographic was also most common in Group 1 and Group 2 ( Patients in Group OA had a significant increase in the rates of 27/28 Elixhauser medical comorbidities ( The incidence of proximal humerus fracture nonunion at 1 year follow up in the control cohort was 1.3%. The incidence of delayed union at 3 and 6 for Group OA and Group 2 were 0.79%, and 1.74%, and 0.67% and 1.86, respectively. All numbers were significantly increased compared to the control cohort of 0.29% and 0.81% ( Historically, rates of proximal humerus fracture nonunion were reported as high as 20% and attributed to nonsurgical management [ Previous studies investigating risk factors for PHF nonunion have focused on fracture location [ To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study investigating the role of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis as a risk factor for PHF nonunion after nonsurgical treatment. Nonunion rates were found to be increased for both the OA and RA groups over the control cohort at all-time points. Coexisting ipsilateral OA or RH likely predisposes patients to a stiffer, less-mobile glenohumeral articulation forcing more motion through the fracture site. This effect is well described in the distal humerus, where stiffness at the adjacent elbow joint is felt to contribute to nonunion by transferring the motion that would normally be dissipated by adjacent joint to the fracture site [ Strengths of this study include utilization of a large national database to generate large patient cohorts to achieve adequate power. Many of the previous studies examining PHF nonunion include cohorts ranging from 10 to 25 patients at a single institution. Patients included in this study are from multiple treatment centers and are not limited to one treatment philosophy. Use of 100% of the Medicare database is particularly applicable to investigating PHF as these patients are generally above age 65 years old. The use of this database also allows extensive recording of patient comorbidities with the Elixhauser medical comorbidity index. There are several limitations of this study. The first is that analysis of the Medicare Standard Analytical Files (SAF) does not include any radiographic images or reports. Details regarding the fracture classification, displacement, delayed union, nonunion, and status of the glenohumeral articulation arthritis were based solely off coding at the time of patient encounter. Certainly, the degree of fragment displacement and metaphyseal comminution has been shown to place the blood supply at risk to the humeral head and result in nonunion. The severity of the PHF and the glenohumeral arthritis were not able to be determined for patient stratification. The second limitation is that the SAF do not include laterality. While RA is a systemic disease that generally affects the shoulders symmetrically and OA is bilateral nearly 50% of the time [ In conclusion, the incidence of proximal humerus fracture nonunion after nonsurgical treatment was approximately 1.3% in the Medicare population. The coexistence of shoulder OA or a diagnosis of RA nearly doubled in the incidence of proximal humerus nonunion, to 2.89% and 3.08% respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association between GH arthritis and PHF nonunion. Further investigation is warranted to investigate this association, as these may be risk factors that merit consideration in the treatment algorithm.
