In the past several decades considerable emphasis was placed on investigation of flotation properties of industrial minerals. The interest in process development for beneficiation of various industrial minerals also comes from the growing need to recover economic minerals from lower grade ores. In general terms these ores in which the minerals exist as ores are associated with, complex, silicates do not respond to the concentration methods used to treat higher-grade less complex mineral silicate ores. The literature on beneficiation of silicate-containing ore is highly fragmented, and have been published in a number of journals and books between the 1980s and 1990s. This volume of the book is devoted to the beneficiation of most important industrial minerals. The book contains details of fundamental research work carried out by a number of research organizations over several decades. For more industrial minerals included in this book, plant practices are presented. The objective is to provide the practical mineral processor, faced with the problem of beneficiation of difficult-to-treat ores, with a comprehensive digest of information available. Thus enabling him to carry out his test work in a more systematic manner and to assist in controlling operating plants. The book will also provide valuable background information for research workers, university students, and professors. The book will also provide comprehensive references of world literature on the subject. A new technology for a number of industrial minerals developed by the author is also contained in Volume 3 of the book.
