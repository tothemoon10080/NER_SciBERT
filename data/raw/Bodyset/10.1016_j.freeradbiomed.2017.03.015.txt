Ascorbate mobilizes iron from equine spleen ferritin by two separate processes. Ascorbate alone mobilizes ferritin iron with an apparent K

                      ≈1.5mM. Labile iron >2μM, complexed with citrate (10mM), synergises ascorbate-dependent iron mobilization by decreasing the apparent K

                      to ≈270μM and raising maximal mobilization rate by ≈5-fold. Catalase reduces the apparent Km(ascorbate) for both ascorbate and ascorbate+iron dependent mobilization by ≈80%. Iron mobilization by ascorbate alone has a higher activation energy (Ea=45.0±5.5kJ/mole) than when mediated by ascorbate with labile iron (10μM) (Ea=13.7±2.2kJ/mole); also mobilization by iron-ascorbate has a three-fold higher pH sensitivity (pH range 6.0–8.0) than with ascorbate alone. Hydrogen peroxide inhibits ascorbate's iron mobilizing action.
                  EPR and autochemiluminescence studies show that ascorbate and labile iron within ferritin enhances radical formation, whereas ascorbate alone produces negligible radicals. These findings suggest that iron catalysed single electron transfer reactions from ascorbate, involving ascorbate or superoxide and possibly ferroxidase tyrosine radicals, accelerate iron mobilization from the ferroxidase centre more than EPR silent, bi-dentate two-electron transfers. These differing modes of electron transference from ascorbate mirror the known mono and bidentate oxidation reactions of dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide with di-ferrous iron at the ferroxidase centre. This study implies that labile iron, at physiological pH, complexed with citrate, synergises iron mobilization from ferritin by ascorbate (50–4000μM). This autocatalytic process can exacerbate oxidative stress in ferritin-containing inflamed tissue.Iron is an essential mineral required for synthesis of iron-containing proteins, including haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochromes Ferritin is a multimeric iron storage protein consisting of a mixture of 24 heavy (FHC) and light (FLC) polypeptide chains with combined weights of 474 Nonpolar channels, predominantly lined with leucine lie within the six four-fold subunit intersections of the ferritin shell The initial reaction of ferrous iron with ferritin involves dioxygen reacting with two vicinally bound ferrous ions at the ferroxidase centre (FOC), present only in FHC, in a sequential electron transfer process to reduce dioxygen to hydrogen peroxide The unstable bridged oxy-diferric complex undergoes hydrolysis, which results in proton release and is the basis of the mineralization process. As iron loading proceeds, a higher proportion of oxygen from water takes part in the reaction and net hydrogen peroxide production is reduced to zero: At still higher iron loads This differs from the Fenton reaction in which water solvated ferrous iron is oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to produce ferric iron and hydroxyl radical. The one-electron reduction of O The sum of reactions in Eq. This process is facilitated when ferric iron is chelated with citrate or adenine nucleotides or EDTA Or and this reaction may also occur within the ferritin core. It has been reported that ferric citrate complexes can auto-reduce and take part in redox cycling Although lysosomal proteolytic degradation of the ferritin shell with consequent iron release occurs A subsequent one-electron reduction of ferric to ferrous iron and also producing dehydroascorbate (DHA) can be obtained by oxidation of AFR An alternative mechanism may involve electron transference by tunnelling through the protein via an electron transport chain. Haem, too large to pass into the ferritin via the pores, can act as an electron donor The spontaneous rate of ascorbate oxidation Ascorbate is generally considered as an efficient antioxidant of nearly every oxidizing radical, e.g. R This reaction can be either retarded or accelerated by complexation with reagents such as desferrioxamine or citrate, respectively The mechanisms by which combinations of metal ion, dioxygen, and ascorbate produce superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals are contentious These secondary reactions initiated by ascorbate, oxygen, and metal ions can be inhibited by superoxide dismutase and catalase and thereby can alter the rates of ferritin iron mobilization Many studies have shown that ascorbate increases the rate of iron release from ferritin by reducing core ferric to ferrous iron However, ascorbate-dependent release of iron from ferritin is not considered to provide a major contribution to pathological oxidation reactions because its concentration is deemed generally to be too low to generate high iron mobilization rates Our second aim was to observe how hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and ascorbate anion and radical affect rates of iron mobilization from ferritin The following chemicals and enzymes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., UK. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) bovine recombinant, expressed in Ferrozine produces a strongly coloured complex with ferrous iron that is stable over normal physiological pH ranges The EPR spectra of ascorbate free radical (AFR) were recorded with Bruker spectrometers (ER200D and Elexsys 500 (Bruker Spectrospin, Wissembourg, France)) operating at 9.85 The reagent solutions contained in a sealed sample cell comprised ascorbate, labile iron and equine spleen ferritin in citrate buffer (1 The ascorbate radical concentration was estimated using coarse quantification of the EPR signal with 4-hydroxy-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) as an external standard and accurate simulation of the individual spectra with the program developed by Rockenbauer and Korecz The rates of ascorbate radical production from ascorbate (250 Solution samples in citrate buffer at pH 7.0 and 24 Unpaired Student's Ascorbate (0–10 Release rates of iron from ferritin increase as ascorbate concentration increases from 0 to 10 The iron sensitivity of ferritin is controlled by the complexation with citrate. With citrate (10 Whilst changing buffer pH from 6.0 to 8.0, with zero ascorbate, there were negligible effects on ferritin iron release. Also, Fe(II) 10 Ferritin iron release was monitored at 4 The synergistic iron and ascorbate activity in mobilizing ferritin iron implies that with ascorbate present, the mobilized iron, will further auto-catalyse ferritin iron mobilization. A longer latency prior to attaining a steady state rate of iron release is likely to be more evident with low ascorbate and iron concentrations. This prediction is confirmed in As mentioned in the introduction, Zn(II) blocks iron flow via the three-fold ferritin channels, Hydrogen peroxide (300 Labile FeSO Sigmoid kinetics have been reported for ferritin Fe(II) oxidation of mutant forms of human H-chain ferroxidase and nucleation sites of human mitochondrial ferritin The inhibitory effects of hydrogen peroxide on ascorbate dependent ferritin iron mobilization with varying labile iron concentrations are corroborated in Thus, labile iron increased the apparent efficacy of ascorbate as a mobilizer of ferritin iron, Superoxide dismutase is expected to suppress the influence of superoxide anion on redox cycling of Fe(II/III) catalysed by ferritin. The effects of ascorbate (0–20 The ascorbate-dependent Superoxide dismutase (SOD) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of ascorbate-dependent iron release from ferritin, as has been previously observed Superoxide generated by xanthine oxidase oxidation of xanthine or hypoxanthine is known to mobilize ferritin iron The smaller relative increase in iron mobilization by ascorbate (1 Catalase catalyses two-electron disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen and has been observed previously to increase slightly the rate of ferritin iron mobilization by superoxide generated by xanthine oxidase Catalase (10 These results signify that ferritin's ferroxidase centre is shielded from the reducing activity of low ascorbate concentrations ≤1 XO, in addition to generating superoxide, also produces hydroxyl radical, uric acid, a radical scavenger, and urate (uric acid) radical Much controversy exists as to the chemical species monitored by the chemiluminescence reporters Lucigenin In the absence of ferritin, background autochemiluminescence is negligible. Ferritin prolongs CL, so the signals were observed for periods of 20–30 EPR methodologies are commonly regarded as the “gold standard” for detection of radicals in biological systems Steady state ascorbate radical concentration is dependent on its formation by ascorbate oxidation in the presence of dioxygen, as catalysed by free iron, or copper ions Electrons donated by either AscH The EPR ascorbate radical signal with iron (10 Raising the initial ascorbate concentration from 0 to 1000 As has been previously observed Ferritin's reactivity with ascorbate radical was determined by observing the altered rates of ascorbate radical decrease The following discussion aims to interpret the results reported here in terms of mono- and di-electron transfers to diferric iron 2Fe(III) at the ferroxidase centre of ferritin. The reduction of FOC 2Fe(III) is taken as the limiting step for iron release from ferritin. The redox potential E This study corroborates previous work showing that ascorbate increases the rate of iron mobilization from ferritin ( Superoxide is a well-documented agent of single electron iron release from ferritin It has been suggested that, at neutral pH, AscH Ascorbate radical is formed, slowly, by spontaneous oxidation of ascorbate (Eq. Ascorbic acid oxidase in the presence of dioxygen oxidizes ascorbate to form AFR Both exogenous and endogenous hydrogen peroxide slow the rate of iron mobilization by one electron transfer from ascorbate, as is evident from The autoluminescence studies illustrated in The results observed with EPR methods corroborate the view that single electron transport from ascorbate radical occurs rapidly with ferritin ( As well as being a promoter of ascorbate radical generation ( In addition to single electron transfer reactions, two electrons can be transferred from appropriate donors to acceptor sources These reactions are dependent on either dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide as two electron oxidizing agents that bridge di-iron or di-copper complexes, as illustrated diagrammatically in the During iron uptake by apoferritin a “blue” intermediate is formed with an absorption maximum at 625 The biphasic nature of the chemiluminescence response to raised ascorbate with Fe(II) (25 The enhancement of the ferritin chemiluminescence signal by catalase The experimental support for the view that two-electron reductive reactions of iron mobilization from ferritin differ from single-electron reactions is summarised as follows: The The pH sensitivity of iron mobilization in the presence of ascorbate is approximately fourfold lower with iron present than without iron ( The activation energy E The I.C. Catalase reduces the apparent K Even high ascorbate concentrations (10 Labile iron (40 The results reported here show a synergy between low concentrations of labile iron and ascorbate as reducing and mobilizing agents of iron from the ferritin core. This explains why ascorbate alone is not notably pro-oxidant Raised levels of total iron have been detected in synovial tissue and fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis Since autocatalytic iron release from ferritin by ascorbate occurs within the pathophysiological concentration ranges of ascorbate and labile iron and is retarded by effective chelation therapy such as desferrioxamine We are very grateful for the financial support from the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
