An alternative analytical exact solution for the discrete-size kinetic equation of grinding in cumulative-fraction-passing mode was formulated as a matrix equation and tested successfully for predicting the transient evolution of the cumulative particle-size distribution and also for back-calculating the selection and breakage function parameters. The compact matrix form of the equation makes it computationally simple, and easy to extend the treatment to continuous mills. The solution should be particularly useful for parameter estimation purposes as it is expected to reduce the variability of the estimates because of the monotonic nature of the cumulative size distributions.The most commonly used approach for the formulation of grinding equations that describe the transient evolution of the particle-size distribution in batch ball mills and other types of tumbling media mills is based on writing particle mass balances on an appropriate number of discrete particle-size intervals. A complete set of mass balance equations representing first-order breakage in a fully mixed batch grinding mill is as follows: It has been found convenient to use functional forms for size-discretized selection and breakage distribution functions. A commonly used functional form for the selection functions given by The following empirical equation for the breakage distribution functions in cumulative form given by The individual breakage distribution functions In grinding practice, particle-size distribution data are commonly expressed in cumulative mass fractions finer than (or retained over) certain sizes. Although it is a simple computational procedure to convert discrete mass fractions to cumulative fractions, it is still desirable to seek solution algorithms for the grinding equation in cumulative form, especially for the reason of back-calculating the parameters of the functional forms of The size-discretized cumulative batch grinding equation can be written as: The objective of this paper is to formulate an alternative analytical exact solution in matrix notation for the cumulative batch grinding equation that can be readily extended to continuous grinding systems. The efficacy of the new solution is verified by comparing its computational accuracy with computer-generated data from the conventional differential-fraction grinding equation, and also by testing its applicability in back-calculating the selection and breakage distribution function parameters from experimental data. The size-discretized time-continuous cumulative batch grinding equation, Eq. A solution for such a system of first-order constant-coefficient differential equations may be obtained by analogy with the general form given by The elements of the lower triangular transforming matrix are given by For continuous grinding if the transport of all particles can be adequately characterized by a single residence time distribution model of the perfect-mixers-in-series form, the steady state mill discharge cumulative size distribution can be obtained from Eq. The treatment can be readily extended to a continuous mill with unidentical segments that may have different values of In order to verify the new solution, product size simulation and breakage parameter back-calculation studies were done. For the purpose of testing the computational accuracy of the new solution, the differential-mass-fraction grinding equation, Eq. A non-trivial test for the verification of the new solution is to back-calculate breakage parameters from experimental data. For this purpose, 0.850  The comparison of the selection and breakage function parameter estimates from the present study and the experimentally determined values ( A new analytical solution in matrix notation was developed for the grinding equation in the cumulative-fraction-passing-size mode and tested successfully for simulation and parameter estimation purposes. The new formulation with its compact matrix form can be easily implemented even with spreadsheet softwares, all of which, nowadays, have matrix computation functions. The solution equation can be readily extended to describe continuous grinding mills with residence time distributions by simply changing the elements of the diagonal matrix
