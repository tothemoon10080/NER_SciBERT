Magnetic flocculation is a phenomenon observed in fine-magnetite-particle suspensions and encountered in fine-particle processing and separation. The chain-like flocs of magnetite particles result from the strong magnetic attractive force among magnetic particles. Weak magnetic particles can also form aggregates in an external magnetic field of sufficiently high intensity. Ferromagnetic particles can incorporate into aggregates of nonmagnetic particles by attractive but nonmagnetic surface forces originated from van der Waals and double-layer interaction, polymer bridging (polymer flocculation), or hydrophobic interaction (hydrophobic aggregation). Nonmagnetic particles adhere to ferromagnetic particle because of attractive surface forces to form mixed aggregates endowed with magnetic property. The mixed aggregates may undertake further coaggregation and grow bigger by magnetic attraction. Technology incorporating ferromagnetic particles into aggregates of nonmagnetic or weakly magnetic particles by surface forces, polymer bridging, or even physical attractive forces is referred to as “magnetic coaggregation.”
