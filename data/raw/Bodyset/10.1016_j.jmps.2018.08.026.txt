Unstable frictional slip motions are investigated with a rate and state friction law across the transitions from stable, quasi–static slip to dynamic, stick–slip motion, and finally to, inertia dominated quasi–harmonic vibration. We use a novel numerical method to capture the full dynamics and investigate the roles of inertial and quasistatic factors of the critical stiffness defining the transition to instability, Kc
                     . Our simulations confirm theoretical estimates of Kc
                     , which is dependent on mass and velocity. Furthermore, we show that unstable slip motion has two distinct dynamic regimes with characteristic limit cycles: (i) stick–slip motions in the quasi–static (slowly loaded) regime and (ii) quasi–harmonic oscillations in the dynamic (rapidly loaded) regime. Simulation results show that the regimes are divided by the dynamic frictional instability coefficient, η = MV
                     2/σaDc
                      and stiffness of the system K. The quasi–static regime is governed by the ratio K/Kc
                      and both the period and magnitude of stick–slip cycles decrease with increasing loading rate. In the dynamic regime, slip occurs in harmonic limit cycles, the frequency of which increases with loading velocity to a limit set by the natural frequency of the system. Our results illuminate the origin of the broad spectrum of slip behaviors observed for systems ranging from manufacturing equipment to automobiles and tectonic faults, with particular focus on the role of elasto–frictional coupling in dictating the transition from slow slip to dynamic instability. We highlight distinct characteristics of friction–induced slip motions (stick–slip and friction–induced vibration) and show that the dynamic frictional instability coefficient (η) is a key parameter that both defines the potential for instability and determines the dynamic characteristics of instability.Friction plays a key role in the mechanical behavior of systems that involve slipping contacts. In many situations, the transition from stable to unstable slip motion is of primary interest. When such systems are loaded slowly, frictional motion often occurs as repeated episodes of quasi–stationary contact followed by rapid slip, which defines the classical ‘stick–slip’ instability ( The conditions for the stability transition from stable to unstable sliding with rate and state friction are presented by Modern constitutive laws for sliding recognize the importance of frictional slip rate and past states of the sliding surfaces. These effects form the basis for the rate and state friction constitutive laws ( For frictional systems that are loaded slowly, both analytic and laboratory observations of stick–slip magnitude show a strong inverse relationship with the logarithm of loading rate (i.e. magnitude decreases with increased velocity) ( Here, we use a novel numerical solution to address the full spectrum of slip modes for a system with rate and state friction and 1D elastic coupling ( In the framework of RSF, frictional resistance is dependent on slip velocity The evolution of friction following a perturbation imposed during steady sliding is modulated by time via contact aging processes and slip. Although a multitude of processes may affect friction evolution, two evolution laws have received the most attention ( The two evolution laws behave similarly for small perturbations around steady state ( In a frictional system with one dimensional elastic interaction, the force balance governing motion is  For quasi–static motion, The second bracketed term in The parameter The simulations are conducted using a recent solution that provides increased numerical stability over the full range of deformational modes - from stable sliding to fully dynamic, unstable motion ( Rate and state friction at each numerical step is calculated using We conducted two sets of numerical experiments. The first set is conducted for For a constant elastic stiffness The critical velocity represents a stability condition, such that for loading at subcritical rates ( We conducted numerical simulations of the frictional response to step changes in loading velocity using sub- and supercritical velocity steps ( The friction responses for the three cases studied ( The convergence behaviors of the two near critical cases are compared in the phase plane diagram ( We conducted multiple simulations to further examine the transition from stable to unstable motion ( The periodic limit cycles demonstrated in We studied a suite of cases to illustrate how limit-cycles vary with loading velocity and dynamical parameters and summarize results using the magnitude of the limit cycle oscillation ( Our results define two distinct regimes, with stick-slip motion occurring for loading velocities below a critical value and harmonic oscillations occurring above ( The transition from quasi–static stick–slip to quasi harmonic oscillations can be described by the emergence of dynamic instability coefficient The dynamic characteristics of frictional instability show clear differences between the two regimes illustrated in It is clear that inertia plays a key role in distinguishing the two regimes. In It is also instructive to evaluate the two frictional instability regimes in terms of event frequency ( We find that a quasi–harmonic oscillation emerges when The resulting friction is shown in The potential for the emergence of a dynamic instability increases significantly with slip velocity. Our analysis indicates that friction-induced vibration (harmonic oscillation) can potentially emerge in any system exhibiting velocity weakening friction ( The dynamic frictional instability coefficient ( Quasi–harmonic oscillations can also be observed in natural fault slip, as, so called, harmonic tremor. Harmonic tremors are frequently observed where applied loading rate or slip rate on the fault is temporarily increased, for example, by subsurface magma transfer (volcanic tremor) ( We show that frictional stability on high velocity slipping contacts is indeed controlled by inertia and related to dynamic effects. Furthermore, we observe that these dynamic effects determine the dynamic characteristics of the resulting unstable slip motions: stick–slip and quasi–harmonic oscillation. Magnitudes of shear stress oscillations decrease with increased velocity in the quasi–harmonic (stick–slip) regime while, it significantly increases with velocity in the dynamic (quasi–harmonic oscillation) regime. Frequency increases with increased velocity but there exists a frequency limit at the natural frequency of the system.
