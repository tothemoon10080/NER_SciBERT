The paper proposes a method to reconcile industrial data with mass balance constraints in a context where species leaching occurs, and assuming steady-state operating conditions. The various data levels correspond to the various phases and species within the phases: for instance slurry, ore, aqueous and carbon phases, particle size classes, mineral species, chemical species, chemical or mineral species within particle size classes. An industrial example is given where grinding and leaching processes of a gold ore are considered.
