In recent years, the liquefaction potential of waste materials has been investigated to increase the yield of coal conversion processes and the quality of liquid fuels from coal. The results have shown that the coprocessing of coal with biowaste materials increases liquefaction yields. In this study, the effects of liquefaction of Soma lignite with sawdust as a coprocessing agent, on total conversion, oil+gas total yields, asphaltene yields and preasphaltene yields were investigated at five different temperatures, 300, 325, 350, 375 and 400°C, 40 atm initial cold pressure, 1/1 (wt/wt) sawdust/lignite ratio and 3/1 (vol/wt) tetralin/(lignite+sawdust) ratio values.Due partly to hydrogen cost, the liquefaction of coal is not economically competitive compared to petroleum technology. A way to reduce the cost of the liquefaction process may be the reduction of hydrogen consumption and a better usage of hydrogen supply through the utilization of different waste materials. Environmentally friendly solutions may be also obtained by taking advantage of the high chemical potential of these materials More markets are expected to develop for low-cost energy substitutes, due to uncertain supplies of crude oil. Some of these substitutes may be biowaste materials with high advantages of wide distribution and renewability potential. Among these, cellulosic wastes constitute more than half of landfill volumes Lignocellulosic waste materials can also be well used as coliquefaction agents for conversion of coal to liquid fuels. The waste material may improve the overall economics of coal liquefaction by fullfilling one or more of the roles of an expensive solvent. An ideal coliquefaction agent, to allow for a significant economic effect on coal liquefaction process, should be available in an unlimited supply and it should be too expensive to dispose off. Also, to ensure good processing properties, it should contain components that can function as hydrogen-transfer agents for free radicals Most of the research works done for alternative energy sources have shown that in general, coprocessing of coal with biomass-type wastes has a positive effect on the liquefaction yields and product quality. Coughlin and Davoudzadeh In this work, Soma lignite was liquefied with tetralin (Merck grade) under pressurized hydrogen atmosphere. Sawdust obtained as a SEKA (Dalaman, Turkey) paper industry waste was used as a coliquefaction agent. The lignite samples were ground to −60 mesh size and the sawdust samples were ground and sifted to a particle size between 0.1 and 0.5 mm. The samples were dried under vacuum at 105°C for 2 h. The proximate and ultimate analysis data for lignite and sawdust samples are given in Liquefaction experiments were carried out in a 250-ml magnetically stirred and electrically heated stainless steel Ernst Haage 1220 type autoclave. The wall temperature of the autoclave was measured by a digital thermometer with a NiCr–Ni thermocouple, and it was controlled to within ±3°C. Experiments were performed at five different temperature values — 300, 325, 350, 375 and 400°C. For individual runs, 20 g of lignite or 15 g of sawdust were mixed with 60 or 45 ml of tetralin respectively; and for coprocessing runs, 10 g of lignite and 10 g of sawdust were mixed with 60 ml of tetralin in a reaction autoclave. The autoclave was pressurized with hydrogen at 40 atm, heated to the desired reaction temperature in about 30 min and held at this temperature by mixing for 1 h. After reaction, the autoclave was cooled overnight to room temperature. When cool, the final pressure value was recorded. The gas products were collected for analysis and the remaining slurry was washed with toluene and fractionated by Soxhlet extraction into oils (hexane solubles), asphaltenes (hexane insolubles, toluene solubles), preasphaltenes (toluene insolubles, tetrahydrofuran solubles) and residues (tetrahydrofuran insolubles). The yields of the coliquefaction experiments were calculated as: Gas (G), %=[∑G Asphaltene (A), %=[A/(L+SD)]×100 Preashaltene (PA), %=[PA/(L+SD)]×100 Oil (O), %=100−(G+A+PA+R)% Total conversion (TC), %=100−R% In this work, the coliquefaction behaviour of Soma lignite with sawdust was investigated with respect to variation of process reaction temperature, in hydrogen atmosphere, with tetralin as solvent and no catalyst. The lignite and sawdust samples were first liquefied alone and sawdust was found to be more reactive in tetralin than lignite, as has been previously found in literature Lignite gas yields decreased from 8.15% at 300°C to 7.26% at 325°C, but increased from 9.86% to 12.86% as temperature was increased from 350°C to 400°C Increasing the temperature from 300°C to 400°C increased the oil yields from 3.38% to 31.35% for lignite, from 47.71% to 75.06% for sawdust and from 20.93% to 46.87% for lignite–sawdust mixture. No synergism effects were observed for coprocessing As temperature was increased from 300°C to 400°C, the oil plus gas yields of lignite, lignite–sawdust mixture and sawdust increased from 10.80% to 42.32%, from 28.90% to 61.96% and from 56.20% to 88.68%, respectively The asphaltene yields of lignite alone increased with temperature from 3.01% to 19.22% Sawdust preasphaltene yields greatly decreased from 16.85% to 0.22% as temperature was increased from 300°C to 400°C Total conversions increased significantly with temperature from 18.25% to 70.17% for lignite, but only slightly from 90.80% to 95.35% for sawdust, when temperature was increased from 300°C to 400°C In this work, total conversions of lignite were negatively influenced by the addition of sawdust. However at 325°C, the addition of sawdust to the liquefaction medium showed a positive synergistic effect on oil plus gas total yields of lignite. Again, the highest increase in total conversion was obtained by coprocessing lignite with sawdust at 325°C. Therefore, under these conditions, 325°C can be considered to be a more appropriate temperature value for coprocessing of lignite with sawdust.
