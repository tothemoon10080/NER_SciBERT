Starches were extracted from freshly harvested potatoes (12 cultivars, grown in Perthshire) and the properties of the starches of six cultivars were compared with starches extracted from the same samples but stored at 5, 25 or 55°C for 7 days before extraction. The amylose (total) content of the freshly extracted starches from tubers stored at 5, 25 or 55°C was on average 27.9±2.3, 28.3±1.7, 29.2±2.2 and 28.8±1.5%, respectively, with corresponding phosphorus representing 60±16, 64±9, 61±5 and 63±9mg100g−1. The unit chain distribution by chromatography of the amylopectin molecules from the starches extracted from the different conditions was very similar with an average degree of polymerisation (DP) of 26±2 where the two major fractions (F1 and F2) represented 54±2 and 19±1, respectively. Peak gelatinisation temperatures (T
                     p) and enthalpies (ΔH) for the freshly extracted starches and from tubers stored at 5 or 25°C were very similar (63.3±1.5°C and 18.6±0.8Jg−1; 63.1±1.0°C and 17.7±1.5Jg−1 and; 62.9±0.7°C and 18.7±1.1Jg−1, respectively) although starches stored at 55°C were annealed, where T
                     p represented 71.1±1.1°C and ΔH 18.1±1.4Jg−1. These in situ-annealed starches were comparable in terms of gelatinisation characteristics to annealed freshly extracted starches where on average, T
                     p represented 72.7±1.0°C and ΔH 20.8±1.0Jg−1. Annealing of tubers in situ prior to processing might be beneficial with respect to developing new potato-based products.Annealing processes (and comparisons with ‘heat–moisture treatments’) with respect to starch (especially potato) structure and properties have been discussed in detail and reviewed by others elsewhere Recently Potato tubers were grown and starches were extracted as described previously Whole tubers were annealed at different temperatures within incubators for 7 days. For incubations at 5 and 25 Compositional analysis of the native starches have been described previously In common with the native starches Starch gelatinisation parameters were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the proportion of double helices by Analytical variation was typically with a coefficient variation (cv) of 1% or better although the determination of gelatinisation enthalpy , crystallinity (X-ray diffraction) and proportion of double helices (NMR) was <5%. It is apparent from The increase with respect to gelatinisation temperatures is classical in terms of annealing effects on starches For the annealed starches, no significant differences could neither be detected in terms of proportions of double helices by NMR nor amount of crystallinity by XRD (figures not shown for annealed starches) which represented ∼64 and ∼26%, respectively for native When starches were ‘stored’ within whole tubers (six cultivars only) at different temperatures (5, 25 and 55 With respect to the chain distribution of amylopectin ( The different temperature storage regimes had little effect on the proportion of double helices (NMR) or crystallinity (XRD) and were comparable to the freshly extracted starches To confirm that the tubers stored at the different temperatures had experienced temperature/moisture regimes appropriate to modify the physical characteristics of the starches, they were also characterised by differential scanning calorimetry ( To compare the gelatinisation temperatures of the freshly extracted starches with those annealed in vitro and those annealed in situ, regression analysis was conducted ( The primary aim was to see if annealing could be achieved in situ with potato tubers. This was achieved by storing tubers at 55
