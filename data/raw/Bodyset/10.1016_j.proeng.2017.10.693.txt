The paper reviews specific operational features of the friction-type traction gear typically used in track-guided vehicles when applied to the drives of rotating machines. A design of the friction-type traction gear that uses a circular rail is presented. The provided layout drawing shows the position of the traction gear wheels against the circular rail as well as the pattern of forces acting on the traction gear. Basic geometrical, kinematic, and force dependences are established for the traction gear mounted on a circular rail. Based on the performed analysis, the recommendations regarding the use of friction-type traction gears as drives for the rotating machines are provided.
