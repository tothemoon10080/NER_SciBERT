This paper investigates the effect of cutter clearance angle on variation of depth of cut and cutting process with an actuated disc cutting (ADC). ADC is a cyclic cutting method with two main characteristics: (i) a disk-shape cutter is used to attack the rock in an undercutting mechanism; and (ii) the cutter is dynamically actuated as it is moved across the rock. Hence, the cutting process of such system is periodic, each recurrence known as actuation cycle. The first ADC model, developed in 2016, represented an idealization of the technology with a flat disc cutter, where no clearance angle was considered. The evolution of the contact between the disc and the rock was, therefore, computed only on horizontal x-y plane, ignoring the effect of normal component of the force acting on cartridge. This article reports on a study that incorporates the cutter inclination angle in derivation of cutter/rock interface laws. It extends the proposed kinematic and geometry based model to take into account the variable depth of cut in estimating the forces associated with cutting in one actuation cycle. Experiments were conducted using Wobble to test the predictions of the improved model at various operating conditions. The model predictions are matched with the experimental results and effects of various factors are analysed.Mechanization of hard rock fragmentation in mining has been a challenge for many years. Whilst mechanical cutting systems are an integral part of soft rock mining, e.g. shearers in coal mining, their application in high strength rocks are limited to short cross cuts or where precision is necessary. Excessive cutter wear, unanticipated vibrations and mechanical failures are some of the factors hindering efficiency of these technologies and impeding their widespread applications in hard rock mining. Hard rock failure is an energy intensive process. Large portion of the machine power is, therefore, consumed for fracturing the rock, leaving small portion available to improve production rate. When larger engines and heavy machines are employed to cover the shortfall in advance rate, the mechanical components become vulnerable as their capacity is exceeded, leading to excessive wear and failure. To address this problem, the focus of research and development in recent decade has been to identify cutting methods that require less energy for breaking strong geo-material. The lower rock fracture energy frees up larger portion of input power to be used for enhancing production rate. Over the past two decades, undercutting discs have been of interest for hard rock cutting applications due to lower reaction forces and higher resistance to wear ( A simplified actuated disc cutting system, ADC, was first introduced by Whilst some of these systems are commercially available ( An ideal ADC consists of a cartridge to apply linear velocity A fixed Cartesian coordinate system ( The derivation of Eq. The nominal motion of the disc cutter and the nominal geometry of the cut are entirely defined by the parameters Conventional drag cutting, hence, corresponds to the simultaneous limits As explained in the earlier publications ( Introducing scaled coordinate system ( The motion of the disc cutter (translation and actuation) leaves a cut on the rock, whose right boundary The effect of inclination angle The contact area between the cutter and the rock ( Two contact phases can generally be defined in an ADC, based on the position angle The transition angles At each phase, contact length In phase II, the left end of the contact arc Having The rate at which ADC penetrates into the rock along the contact arc Normalizing In the limit of drag cutter Three-dimensional (3D) view of the cutter/rock engagement in an actuated disc cutter indicates that the contact between the cutter and the rock ( The force from cutting is in general the superposition of a cutting force Decomposition of Let Assuming constant pressure on each element As explained, Since Similarly, the normal to the surface element The tangential component of the cutting force is assumed to be governed by the frictional contact and the roll/slip process taking place at the interface between the cutter face and the rock. Since the disc cutter is free to rotate around its axis, during steady rolling of the cutter (no slipping), there is no friction force at the interface; hence By neglecting the tangential component of the cutting force, integration of Eq. The components of the derived overall cutting force After neglecting the frictional forces acting on the contact, scaling the    For the other cases with large When Two modes of failure are defined for geomaterial breaking in interaction with cutting tools: (i) ductile mode of failure, characterized by the development of a damaged zone followed by plastic flow of material; and (ii) brittle mode of failure that involves initiation and propagation of cracks ( Results from tests conducted in the ductile mode of failure show a linear relationship between The concepts of fracture mechanics apply, however, in the brittle mode of failure ( In this section, the force predictions from the model are evaluated through a series of rock cutting experiments conducted using CSIRO's unique custom-made ADC test-unit, dubbed as Wobble ( Experiments are conducted on Savonniere limestone due to its uniform and homogeneous structure. The physical and mechanical properties of this rock are listed in The main control variables in the experiments were The theoretical cutting force Similarly, the magnitude of the theoretical normal force By incorporating the cutter clearance angle in a previously proposed ADC model ( The force model was, hence, revised to accommodate the variation of depth of cut within an actuation cycle. The comparison between the predicted and measured horizontal and normal cutting force variation profiles during an actuation cycle demonstrated a very good agreement between the model predictions and Wobble experimental data with specific energy coefficient A very good match was also observed between independently calculated horizontal The authors wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.
