Experimental work in glacial geomorphology is focused almost entirely on processes in the thin shear zone at the beds of sliding glaciers, where ice at its pressure–melting temperature moves over either rigid rock or deformable till. Experiments with rotary shear devices illuminate constitutive behavior there, central to the dynamics of fast-moving glaciers, and provide a foundation for interpreting the sedimentary record of glacier slip and associated sediment transport. Results from experiments designed to study ice sliding over a rigid wavy bed, shear deformation of till, and plowing of clasts across the surface of a till bed point to a common conclusion: drag at the bed can decrease with increasing slip velocity, thereby concentrating driving stress elsewhere and promoting rapid glacier flow. This rate-weakening behavior at glacier beds is in contrast to the viscous slip resistance assumed in ice-sheet models and most efforts to determine distributions of basal drag from glacier surface velocities. Ring-shear experiments in which various basal tills and more idealized materials are sheared to high strains provide quantitative insight into grain size evolution, mixing at contacts between basal tills, microstructure development, particle-fabric development, and development of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. Preferred orientations of principal magnetic susceptibilities provide the most dependable and complete description of till shear patterns. When applied to basal tills of the geologic record, magnetic till fabrics measured along thick till sections and calibrated experimentally indicate that deformation of the bed by two lobes of the Laurentide ice sheet was shallow (<1m), patchy, and occurred as till progressively accreted. Rates of sediment transport by bed shear were thus significantly less than estimates based on models that invoke deep, pervasive shear of the bed. The lack of an experimental tradition in glacial geomorphology leaves many research avenues open for exploration but also increases the challenge of demonstrating the relevance of experimental results to theoretical and field-based studies.Laboratory experiments in geomorphology are increasingly viewed as scaled-down efforts to study landform evolution. For example, Although we too would like to see experimentation in our field assume a prominent place alongside theoretical and field studies, we question whether study of landscape evolution should necessarily be the driving force for experimentation in geomorphology. Many geomorphological processes, of course, have profound importance outside the context of landscape evolution and affect human welfare over time scales that are — relative to those of most evolving landscapes — immediate. For example, in the study of glacial processes, experiments designed to shed light on slip dynamics at glacier beds can improve numerical models of flow acceleration of marine-terminating glaciers. Accelerations of such glaciers over the last few decades have been a major contributor to increasing rates of sea-level rise ( Virtually all experiments in glacial geomorphology have been designed to investigate processes in the thin shear zone at the beds of glaciers that result from glacier slip. In this zone, ice at its pressure–melting temperature either slides over rough bedrock (i.e., hard bed) or moves on a deformable layer of wet sediment, usually till (i.e., soft bed). This experimental focus on glacier-bed processes is easy to appreciate: they are usually inaccessible to readily interpretable field measurements, can activate the most dynamic behavior of glaciers (e.g., Herein we describe experiments that bear on the constitutive behavior of the ice–water–till–rock system at glacier beds and on the products of movement there preserved in the geologic record — research that parallels in some ways extensive experimental work on crustal faulting (e.g., Two kinds of rotary devices are used to study motion at glacier beds and its effects. One kind of device ( Shearing displacement is unlimited to allow the development of steady shear resistance or speed. Shearing is in a zone oriented perpendicular to gravity, as is close to being true subglacially. This orientation is essential for studying some subglacial processes in which body forces are relevant (e.g., till deformation) and rules out Couette-type devices (e.g., Shearing is capable of being actuated by applying either a steady shearing rate or shear stress and measuring the other parameter as a dependent variable. Having the option of either rate- or stress-controlled experiments broadens the range of processes that can be studied and the range of accessible parameter space. A vertical stress normal to the shear zone is applied and kept steady, while the volume of the sample chamber is allowed to change, as demanded by expansion or contraction of either cavities at the ice–bed interface or till pores. Water within cavities or till pores is allowed to move into or out of the sample chamber as they change their volume. Experiments are therefore Sample chambers containing ice with an underlying bed or exclusively till are sufficiently large to accommodate essential bed properties, such as nonmatrix-sized grains within till (i.e., pebbles) and hard beds with sufficiently large roughness elements to allow testing of constitutive rules for sliding. Scaling limitations are discussed in Walls of sample chambers are either transparent or contain windows that allow direct observation of motion. The ISSS must, in addition, keep the ice ring ( Glacier sliding over a rough bedrock surface commonly accounts for most of a glacier's surface velocity ( Some theoreticians, however, have also long suspected that separation of ice from the lee of bed obstacles — a process for which there is considerable geomorphic ( Experiments with ISSS, using a sinusoidal bed designed so that stoss surfaces have radially uniform slopes ( Elastic deformation of subglacial till accounts for negligible glacier motion but can provide a rare means of estimating local shear stress on the bed from records of deformation provided by tiltmeters (e.g., Experiments have been central in demonstrating that till — as a two-phase material consisting of rock grains in frictional contact and pore water of negligible shearing resistance — does not obey a fluid rheology if sheared at glacial rates. At sufficiently high strains in its so-called critical state, once till has attained a porosity and shearing resistance that are steady under the ambient effective stress, experiments with various devices indicate that idealizing till as a Coulomb plastic is a good approximation ( Experiments also indicate, however, that transient deformation of insufficient magnitude for porosity to have adjusted to the ambient effective stress can lead to more complicated behavior than the critical-state relationships of Ring-shear experiments also demonstrate how feedbacks between slip and pore pressure can weaken the ice–till interface and accentuate slip there. Field measurements with instruments in the soft beds of glaciers indicate that when effective stress is falling or low, the tendency is strong for basal motion to be focused at or very near the bed surface ( Interpretations of the sedimentary products of glacier slip historically have overwhelmingly relied on geologic inferences from the sedimentary record (e.g.,  Results demonstrated that the grain size distribution did indeed become fractal with progressive crushing and abrasion of grains, and with sufficient shearing attained a steady-state fractal dimension of ~ Microfossils in some sediments, for example marine sediments that contain populations of pennate and centric diatoms, allow comminution associated with bed deformation to be assessed. Ring-shear experiments with sediments from the Ross Sea indicate that shearing increases the relative abundance of centric diatom tests to values > Basal tills in a sedimentary succession may display mixing across their contact proportional to the magnitude of bed shear, thereby allowing mixing to serve as a proxy for strain magnitude. This hypothesis was tested with the ISU ring-shear device by shearing layers of beads of different colors and tills with different shale-particle contents ( Results indicated that mixing can be successfully modeled as a diffusive process, using Fick's second law written in terms of cumulative shear strain rather than time. Mixing did indeed increase with shear strain, but the diffusivity decreased significantly with cumulative strain such that diffusive mixing became progressively less rigorous as strain accrued. Random vertical displacements of particles associated with shear are unlikely to give rise to inherently non-linear diffusive mixing. Thus, this decrease in diffusivity with increasing strain may have reflected either the initial roughness of the contact between layers or strain localization as shear progressed, both of which could have yielded more vigorous, uniform mixing during the early stages of shear ( Microstructures in deformed tills, studied optically in thin sections, have been used extensively to make inferences about stresses, pore-water pressures, and deformation within former subglacial till layers of the geologic record, nearly always without the benefit of experimental results to help guide interpretations (e.g., Experiments carried out to high shear strains with different tills indicate that this index does tend to increase monotonically with strain. Deformation of basal tills of the geologic record causes preferred orientations of particles (fabrics) and magnetic anisotropy that results from preferred orientations of some ferromagnetic mineral grains (e.g., magnetite). Field studies have resulted in at least four hypotheses for fabric development resulting from subglacial shear of till: (i) it causes weak fabrics parallel to the shearing direction ( This lack of common understanding provides clear motivation for experimentally studying particle and magnetic fabric evolution as a function of shear-strain magnitude and orientation ( Experiments with isolated, pebble-sized, prolate clasts, initially oriented normal to the shear plane (vertically) in putty and various tills, illustrate the kinematics of particle rotation in a shearing bed ( Thus, with sufficient strain shear deformation of till with initially near-random particle orientations results in strongly clustered fabrics, with particle long axes oriented parallel to the shearing direction and plunging mildly upglacier ( Fabrics based on the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of multiple intact till specimens (~  In experiments with ISSS ( In ring-shear experiments, aimed at studying bed deformation and associated processes, the largest grains in the till studied need to be removed — typically grains larger than 6–8 Removal of the largest particles from till may indeed, however, increase the steady-state strengths of particle and AMS fabrics that develop during shear. Deflection of till as it shears past large clasts would be expected to reduce the preferred orientation of smaller grains, although the extent of this effect upon removing only a few percent of the total till mass in experiments is difficult to predict. Data from preliminary experiments with an extremely coarse-grained till ( Overall, although the necessarily reduced scales of experiments will always require that experimental results complement, rather than substitute for, field and theoretical approaches, scaling problems are less severe for these experiments than in scaled-down studies of landscape evolution in which sediment transport by turbulently flowing water is a central process. As noted, ice-sheet models, which are in part aimed at helping to predict glacier accelerations and associated sea-level rise, almost invariably have a boundary condition at the bed in which drag there increases monotonically with increasing sliding speed ( Experiments with rotary devices, to date, whether focused on hard-bedded sliding ( By adjusting the basal boundary conditions of flow models that can fully describe the three-dimensional state of stress in ice sheets, efforts should be made to explore the possible effects of rate-weakening at the bed on ice flow. Similarly, modelers who require inversions for basal drag based on control methods, rather than assuming viscous deformation resistance at the bed, should consider inverting directly for basal shear stress (e.g., Rate-weakening also has implications for modeling of bedrock erosion and sediment transport. Viscous deformation resistance during basal slip is invariably assumed in models of large-scale glacial erosion in orogenic belts, in which the speed of sliding over a hard bed must be calculated to determine rates of bedrock erosion ( The actual implications of constitutive relations determined from experiments will depend on the extent to which theoreticians are willing to embrace experimental results, sometimes at the expense of convenience. Consider the formulation of models that attribute subglacial bedforms, such as ribbed moraine and drumlins, to a flow instability at the ice–till interface ( Understanding of the dynamics of the shear zone at the beds of sliding glaciers is improved by knowledge of its kinematics. Studies of motion at the beds of modern glaciers through boreholes yield only local kinematic information, and remotely sensed geophysical data are commonly subject to a liberal degree of interpretation. The third approach — studying well-exposed basal tills of the geologic record — also unfortunately involves considerable interpretation. Experimental results can complement field studies by improving interpretations of basal till characteristics. Experiments on till grain comminution and mixing, although they provide insight into the mechanics of these processes, need to be interpreted cautiously as indicators of bed deformation. Comminution experiments indeed help clarify the relationship between grain size evolution and the changing character of stress concentrations and comminution mechanisms with progressive bed deformation ( More encouraging for inferring shear-strain magnitude is the prevalence of microshears ( Most helpful for inferring bed-deformation kinematics are preferred orientations of particles and of principal magnetic susceptibilities. Experiments provide some simple facts about fabric evolution and its relationship to shear-strain magnitude and orientation: Strong, steady-state, fabrics based on clast long axes and Steady clast long-axis and The Jeffery model of particle rotation, which predicts weak flow-parallel fabrics and transverse fabrics at high strains, should not be used to help interpret till fabrics. Fabric development in till depends most sensitively on strain magnitude and orientation ( AMS fabrics are both more accurate and contain more information about deformation kinematics than traditional grain fabrics, although the method works best in fine-grained tills. These precepts are just beginning to be used to infer magnitudes and patterns of bed deformation beneath past ice sheets. For example, in a basal till of the Lake Michigan lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet, These data indicate that the bed deformed heterogeneously in isolated patches ( Deformation patterns like those depicted in Lacking entirely from experimental contributions to glacial geomorphology and badly needed are experiments with ISSS ( Additional hard-bedded experiments with ISSS are also warranted. The effect of different bed geometries on the relationship between drag and sliding speed needs to be explored (e.g., Indeed, experimental work has been so limited in glacial geomorphology that pathways for making solid progress with a device such as ISSS are not difficult to identify. The more difficult challenge is ensuring — through well-designed experiments, convincing analyses, and clear exposition — that this progress is embraced by theoreticians and field workers. Construction of ISU ring-shear device and ISSS and most of their subsequent use has been supported by grants (
