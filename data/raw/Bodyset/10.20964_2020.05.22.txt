The electrochemical activities of polyaniline (PANI) in different manganese (Mn) salt solutions were studied. The experimental results show better electrochemical activity for PANI in the manganese chloride (MnCl2) solution. Additionally, the electrochemical reaction performance of PANI was enhanced by the addition of lithium chloride (LiCl) in the MnCl2 electrolyte. Doping with manganese ions (Mn2+) also improved the conductivity of MnCl2. Porous carbon felt was used as the three-dimensional (3D) matrix for electrochemical sedimentation. The deposition efficiency was greatly improved by the addition of zinc ions (Zn2+) in the electrolyte. With a concentration of 0.5 M Zn2+, the deposition efficiency of Mn was 93%. With the Mn-doped PANI particle suspension as the cathode material and the 3D Zn-Mn alloy as the anode, the flow battery was tested at different charge and discharge current densities. The discharge capacity density reached 153 mAhÂ·g-1 at 15 mA cm-2, and the average discharge voltage was more than 1.2 V, which indicates that the present cell is promising for use as high-performance rechargeable battery or energy storage.
