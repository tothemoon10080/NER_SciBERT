Analyses of three oriented rock samples collected in the footwall of a major normal fault in Central Italy provide insights into textural properties of a lithified carbonate fault core. Data from lithified fault rocks are very rare and we document here the grain size distribution in a fault core at an unprecedented scale range, which complements already existing observations obtained from sieve, sedimentation and/or laser diffraction methods in loose deposits. X-ray powder diffraction analysis shows that the samples, which are located at a mutual distance of few tens of meters, are exclusively made of calcite. Mesoscopic samples and polished thin sections oriented normal to the fault plane have been analysed with high resolution scanner (HRS), transmission optical microscopy (TOM) and scanning electron microscopy in back-scattered mode (BS-SEM). Textural features of tectonised calcite crystals have been quantified using image analysis on digitalised photographs at magnifications from 1:1 to 9000:1, documenting size dimensions of grains from cm to sub-μm. The obtained D values have average values of 1.65 in 2D, overlapping with those independently obtained by box-counting methods in the core of the same fault by previous authors. Textures of calcite clasts in tectonised and lithified rocks can be appropriately quantified by the analytical protocols proposed here. This work represents the first multi-scale image analysis, from sub- μm to cm sizes, of the core portion of a normal fault that cut into carbonate rocks. Our study provides a template for similar investigations to be carried on other faults that will help to better understand the relations between fault textures and deformation processes.Rock textures and fabrics include the types, abundance, sizes, shapes and number of phases per volume of solid, and the orientation patterns of these features ( However, quantification of textures of faulted rocks and particularly of those near the main displacement surface can face severe difficulties depending on their petrography and physical state, i.e. cohesive Owing on these limitations, 3D features of tectonised clasts in lithified rocks are by far commonly derived by analysis of 2D sections, either polished slabs and/or thin sections ( To overcome these difficulties, we explore a new multi-scale analytical protocol(s) and check its consistency by analysing three lithified and monomineralic rock samples collected on the San Benedetto Gioia dei Marsi (SBGM) fault. This major normal fault cuts carbonate rocks in the Central Apennines of Italy. The three samples come from the fault footwall, some few tens of cm from the fault plane, the so-called fault core The analyses allow us to obtain: 1) 2D images normal to the fault plane of tectonised calcite clasts and their quantitative textural features in a size range from cm to sub-μm; 2) a comparison of textural outcomes provided by optical and electronic microscopic tools at similar scale of observation; and 3) the variation of clasts textures along the fault core. Procedures and results of multi-scale image analysis highlighted in this work, show that imaging encopassing sub-μm to cm size range represents a fundamentally useful approach to achieve a full quantification of textures produced by normal faulting in carbonate rocks in cases where the fault core is lithified. The San Benedetto-Gioia dei Marsi fault (SBGM) is part of the Fucino normal fault system, located on the eastern flank of the Fucino basin, one of the largest intermontane tectonic depressions of the central Apennine of Italy ( Since the Late Pliocene-early Quaternary, the central Apennines were affected by active normal faulting with a regional NE-SW trending extensional axis ( Many normal faults of the central Apennines are considered seismogenic sources potentially able to generate M 6.5–7 earthquakes ( The SBGM fault started its tectonic activity since Middle Pliocene ( We studied the SBGM fault in the Venere quarry, where it has an average strike and dip of N120°/50° and exhibits striations on the fault plane that indicate dip slip motion. Moving away from the SBGM fault plane into the footwall, the first ten cm of the shear zone form a lithified core. This core passes to a damage zone where rocks are pulverised for several tens of meters, then to a fractured strip with thickness of meters to tens of meters and finally to an undisturbed host rock (    Tectonic clasts at intermediate magnifications were acquired either by transmission optical microscopy (TOM) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), under back-scattered mode. The TOM is a Zeiss Axioscope optical microscope installed at the Dipartimento di Ingegneria & Geologia of the University G. d’Annunzio (Chieti, Italy). The SEM is a Jeol-JSM 6500F field emission scanning electron microscope, equipped with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) probe, hosted at the HPHT Lab of Experimental Volcanology and Geophysics of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) in Rome (Italy) ( From 2 to 6 adjacent and slightly overlapped TOM digitalised images were attached, providing details of relatively large areas as close as possible to the SBGM fault plane. These tectonic clasts imaged on attached and adjacent micro-photographs by TOM at 25X and 100X were printed, their contours again traced manually on transparent sheets, coloured in black (binarised) and then digitalised ( Analogously, many adjacent and slightly overlapped SEM micro-photographs at 95X (“SEM many attached 95X″) were collected following a grid on a selected area comprising the SBGM footwall below the fault plane on thin section, such as to collect images of a significant number of relatively large clasts (  Thereafter, the clasts were reproduced in false colours and segmented, to automatically count them ( The area abundance and number of clasts per size ranges per area have been scaled and normalised among different magnifications. A detailed description of the procedure is reported in the following paragraph and resumed in The XRPD data straightforwardly indicate that the V5, V14 and V12 rock samples are composed almost entirely of calcite ( 2D calcite tectonised-clasts imaged by HRS, TOM and/or SEM at variable magnifications are identified, displayed and measured from centimetric to sub-micrometric sizes ( All measured long and short axes of equal-area ellipses associated with each tectonised calcite clasts from 10 In the following, only the calcite tectonised clasts measured in the selected ranges reported in The log-log plot of clast size The three-dimensional A second, intriguing and most straightforward comparison of our bi-dimensional The samples V5, V14 and V12 show the presence of several truncated clasts at different magnifications ( The qualitative and quantitative multi-scale outcomes presented here fully capture textural features of calcite clasts acquired in response to the deformation history suffered by the lithified SBGM fault core and plane. The application of the proposed analytical and data reduction protocol furnished here on other lithified fault cores and planes can be a valuable tool to relate textural features and deformation histories. The salient points of this study can be summarised as follow: actual textures of tectonised calcite clasts can be imaged and statistically measured only applying 2D imaging methods from 1:1 down to several 10 quantitative textures of tectonised carbonate clasts acquired by TOM and SEM methods are virtually identical; images by TOM necessitate long and tedious manual work, whereas SEM analysis is more prone to rapid automatic counting of clasts with limited manual steps. However, TOM is applicable to any fragile-deformed carbonate material, whereas SEM images can sometimes be useless (e.g., our V12 sample); in lithified faulted rocks imaged clasts can be obtained only as 2D projections of actual 3D shapes; nonetheless, grain-size distributions and log the the analytical protocol shown in this study has to be used to characterise the textural features of lithified carbonate fault planes and cores, such as to relate textures of tectonic clasts with deformation history.
