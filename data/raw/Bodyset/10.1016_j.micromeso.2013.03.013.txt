A novel hybrid sol–gel templating route employing hyperbranched polymers for the production of nanostructured silica with tailored porosity and high specific surface area values is proposed based on the use of hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) both as a reactive template and as a macromolecular “porogen”. The procedure developed involves dissolution of hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine), PEI, of two different molecular weights (5,000 and 25,000), in N,N-dimethylformamide or chloroform serving as solvents of different polarity and addition of 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl isocyanate as a silica precursor which is also reactive towards PEI’s amino groups. The obtained triethoxysilyl functionalized macromolecules after hydrolysis and subsequent polycondensation reactions lead to the formation of a novel silica network architecture. By firing this hybrid material a silica powder of nanoporous structure and advanced textural properties is obtained. Synthetic reactions are monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, while the silica network formed after firing is characterized by TGA, low and wide-angle XRD, TEM and N2 adsorption techniques. The influence of several parameters, i.e., molecular weight of PEI, PEI/silica precursor molar ratio and solvent polarity on silica’s porosity is studied. Depending on the synthesis conditions, this novel templating route proved effective for the successful imprinting of mesoporous cavities into silica structure. In this way, nanostructures with tailor-made properties were obtained exhibiting specific surface area values varying from ∼600 to 1100m2/g and pore diameters up to around 5nm.The design of nanostructured materials with distinct framework and controllable pore size distribution has drawn immense attention over the last years owing to their potential applications in the fields of catalysis, water purification, electronics, optics, etc. The term dendritic macromolecules, refers to a class of organic macromolecules with highly branched structure reminiscent of a “tree” (=“dendron” in Greek) consisting, mainly, of dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers. Their structure can be described as consisting of a central point or core from which emanates a network of branches, derived from the polymerization of repeating monomer units (usually of the type AB Up to now, dendrimers due to their appealing features, such as their innovative architecture and monodisperse nature, were employed to produce microporous and mesoporous structure with single macromolecules In this work, a novel hybrid sol–gel route employing hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine), PEI, that serves not just as a pore-forming agent or as a neutral template as in the above reported works, but also as a reactive template forming covalent bonds with an appropriate chosen silica precursor, is being described. PEI is a highly branched cationic polymer, that is inexpensive and readily available in several molecular weights The use of PEI as a type of structure directing agent combines two important advantages given that the proposed strategy can produce under facile and non-expensive experimental conditions mesoporous silica of high surface area with tailored pore structure, while due to the presence of PEI integrated into the silica matrix can also result in functionalized silica. Due to the large number of functional amino groups of PEI and its property to encapsulate metal ions or various organic molecules, the so-produced silica before or after the template removal could find various applications such as in water purification Poly(ethyleneimine) hyperbranched polymers of two different molecular weights, i.e., PEI5 (Hyperpolymers INC, Mn The pattern followed for the synthesis of triethoxysilylated PEI hyperbranched polymer and their subsequent hydrolysis to the respective silanols and following polycondensation into siloxane bridges ( The obtained triethoxysilyl derivatives were allowed in open air for 24 or 96 FTIR spectra were obtained employing a Nicolet 6700 Fourier Transformed Infrared spectrometer equipped with an Attenuated Total Reflectance accessory (ATR) with a diamond crystal (Smart Orbit™, Thermo Electron Corporation, Madison, WI). Samples were firmly pressed against the diamond and spectra were recorded at 4 The FTIR spectra of the silylated PEI networks were recorded after curing at 90 Hydrolysis of the ethoxysilane groups to SiOH groups (step 2 in Finally, the formation of the silica network due to condensation of silanols to Si–O–Si bond formation (step 3 in Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) of silica materials was performed under flowing air, up to 700 Detection of carbon residues in silica matrix after calcination at 700 Microstructural properties of the as developed silica materials, subjected to several thermal treatments, were examined through X-ray diffraction analysis. In Further, the structure of the different samples prepared after calcination at 700 The nature of the solvent employed has also a significant effect, as samples prepared in DMF demonstrate in all cases sharper reflections and at lower angle values compared to samples prepared in CHCl Estimation of specific surface area and pore size distribution was performed with N In This behavior is also validated by the differential pore size distributions (PSD) calculated employing the Nonlocal Density Functional Theory (NLDFT) model  Therefore, as it can be deduced from N The results of N In the present study, the development of nanoporous silica structures with advanced textural properties through a novel hybrid sol–gel route employing hyperbranched poly(ethylene)imine polymers as reactive templates is presented. The effect of several synthesis parameters such as type of solvent, PEI molecular weight and Si:PEI molar ratio on the pore structure characteristics of the final product is clearly shown. The results suggest that the as-developed templating route is an effective way for the successful imprinting of mesoporous cavities into silica nanostructure enabling to develop porous powders of tunable pore structure with high specific surface area and pore volume reaching values of up to 1090 Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
