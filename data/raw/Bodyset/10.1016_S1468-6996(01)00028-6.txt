Mg–Al–Si–Ca and Mg–Zn–Ca base alloys were rapidly solidified by melt spinning at the cooling rate of about a million K/s. The melt-spun ribbons were aged in the range 100–400°C for 1h. The effect of additional elements on microstructural change and precipitation hardening after heat treatment was investigated using TEM, XRD and a Vickers microhardness tester. Age hardening occurred after aging at 200°C in the Mg–Al–Si–Ca alloys mainly due to the formation of Al2Ca and Mg2Ca phases, whereas in the Mg–Zn–Ca alloys mostly due to the distribution of Mg2Ca. TEM results revealed that spherical Al2Ca precipitate has the coherent interface with the matrix. Considering the total amount of additional elements, Mg–Zn–Ca alloys showed higher hardness and smaller size of precipitates than Mg–Al–Si–Ca alloys. With the increase of Ca content, the hardness values of the aged ribbons were increased. Among the alloys, Mg–6Zn–5Ca alloy showed the maximum value of age hardening peak(H
