Aluminum thin films were deposited on mild steel substrates at substrate temperatures of 80°C and 100°C at a constant sputtering power of 300 W by radio-frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering method. The films were then characterized for microstructure and mechanical properties by optical surface profiler (OSP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-scratch tests. The results showed that films deposited at 80°C consisted of long and layered structures with porous oxides whereas those deposited at 100°C were characterized by finer structures with porous and amorphous network of oxide-dominant structures. The XRD diffractograms revealed amorphous structures for both samples and lower roughness for samples deposited at 100°C. The behavior of the surfaces under extremely high micro-scratch loads (0-30 N) was characterized by piling up of the amorphous materials on the edges of the scratch track (100°C) and lateral and track-in cracking along the scratching direction (80°C). The results suggest the significance of substrate temperature on the adhesion characteristics of aluminum thin films.
