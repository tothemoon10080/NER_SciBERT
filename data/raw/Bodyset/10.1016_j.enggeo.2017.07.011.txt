The mechanical and hydraulic properties of a jointed rock mass are strongly affected by the characteristics of joints within the intact rock mass. In this study, a constitutive model for jointed rock masses is developed by incorporating the contributions of both the joint and its surrounding rock mass. The behaviour of the joint is represented by a new coupled damage-plasticity cohesive-frictional model taking into account its dilation evolution and the reduction of both strength and stiffness, while the surrounding rock behaviour is assumed to behave elastically. The interactions between the joint and the surrounding rock are described by a set of kinematic enhancements and internal equilibrium equations across the interface of the joint. The formulation of the proposed model is presented along with its implementation algorithms and validation with experimental data. The enhanced kinematics facilitates the incorporation of both behaviour and orientation of the joint, together with the size and behaviour of the surrounding rock, allowing capturing key characteristics of jointed rock mass responses under mixed-mode loading conditions at different spatial scales.The mechanical and hydraulic properties of a rock mass are strongly affected by the presence of discontinuities such as joints, fractures or faults. The effects of these features, generally referred to as joints, can be very significant in many problems in geology or geophysics, mining or petroleum engineering, hydrogeology and waste management, therefore, it is important to be able to locate and characterise them remotely within a rock mass using geophysical methods ( It is well recognised that understanding the mechanical behaviour of rock joints plays a very important role in designing rock structures such as underground excavations, rock slopes (  One of the difficulties in analysing jointed rock masses is its diversity in natural characteristics. Because rock mass is a natural material, rock joints are formed under different stress states and continuous loadings from dynamic movements of the upper crust of the Earth such as tectonic movements, earthquakes, glaciation cycles. This complex and long history of formation makes the in situ characteristics of rock joints hard to be determined. Experiments on rock joints are mostly based on small specimens corresponding to a certain location within the rock mass. The geometry and roughness of the joints are usually presented by the joint roughness coefficient (JRC) which is often estimated by visibly comparing to standard profiles ( In the past decades, many studies have been carried out to characterise the effects of the scale on the mechanical behaviour of jointed rock masses. A relatively comprehensive review of statistical scale effects on jointed rock behaviour from previous studies is presented in the work done by The review presented above shows the importance of both mechanical behaviour and geometrical details of joints as well as surrounding intact rocks in governing the responses of a jointed rock mass, together with the challenges in incorporating them in a computationally efficient approach for practical purposes. In this study, we adopt a balanced approach in which only essential details, including mechanical and geometrical features of both the joint and the surrounding intact rock, are included in a kinematically enriched constitutive model. The enhanced kinematics provides more flexibility to the constitutive model for accommodating both the mechanical behaviour and geometrical details at two scales: the scale of the joint, and the scale of the rock mass containing the joint. The terminology “double-scale” is hence adopted as it reflects the key characteristics of the proposed approach in bridging the two spatial scales, and facilitating the analysis of a jointed rock mass at the constitutive (material) level. While it is reasonable to assume elastic behaviour for the surrounding intact rock, the joint responses are represented by a new damage-plasticity cohesive-frictional model. The proposed cohesive model uses only a single combined yield-failure surface, which gradually transforms from initial yield to ultimate failure with residual frictional strength, under the evolution of asperity damage. This enables the modelling of a joint at different stages of deformation under mixed-mode loading conditions. In particular, key inelastic responses including residual deformations, strength and stiffness reduction, evolution of dilation due to asperity damage, and unilateral behaviour upon unloading-reloading are accounted for. The paper is organised as follows. In a rock mass, the size of the rock mass is in the order of meters while the size of a joint width usually is in the order of millimetres, therefore the joints can be treated as a weak plane of rubble between two beds of rock ( Without losing generality, the constitutive model is developed for a material volume  On the other hand, the behaviour of the joint and the bulk material are connected to the overall response of the volume element Using Eqs. A generic relationship between the rate of traction and the rate of displacement jump can be written as: After some arrangements of the above equation, the rate of displacement jump can be derived as: Using the above-mentioned conditions ( As seen in the above formulation, both of the joint and the surrounding rock responses contribute to the constitutive model through a set of kinematic parameter and internal equilibrium conditions across the boundary of the joint. This helps to incorporate the elastic response of the bulk material and the inelastic loading of the joint in the overall response of the volume element. The stress-strain relationship Eq. To model the behaviour of the joint, a new cohesive model based on a coupled damage-plasticity framework is proposed. The model focuses on reproducing important features of the post-peak deformation and damage development of cohesive fracture under mixed mode loading conditions in both tensile and compressive regimes. These include strength and stiffness reductions, irreversible displacements, residual frictional strength at the failure state and the evolution of dilation under the effects of asperity degradation. All these features were either missing or not addressed at length in The typical responses of a rock joint in the case of shear under constant normal stress and the case of compression were summarised by It can be seen from the formulation of tractions that the responses of the rock joint before yielding is linearly elastic, governed by elastic stiffness Along with the tractions-displacement jumps relation, a loading function for the damage development and plasticity is needed in order to determine whether the behaviour of the joint is in elastic or inelastic (plastic-damage) regime. A loading function is also necessary for computing the elastic/plastic displacement parts, as well as the evolution of tractions during loading/unloading. The proposed loading function is written in the following form: The shape of the loading function and its evolution following the development of the damage variable is illustrated in As non-associated flow rule is needed for a constitutive model of rock joint to better describe the dilation and plastic deformation of the interface ( To complete the cohesive model, an evolution of damage variable As presented, a tractions-displacement jumps relationship, a non-associated flow rule together with the evolutions of internal variables (i.e. damage The first step before using the proposed model for any simulation is to calibrate parameters used in the model. In other words, the model needs to be adjusted to fit with a specific type of the material as well as the length-scale of the interested problem before being used for simulation. This section presents the calibration of the model's parameters against experimental data of shearing under Constant Normal Load (CNL) owing to its wide availability in the literature. In terms of physical meaning, the shear elastic stiffness Based on the residual shear stress, the internal friction coefficient The next calibration is the dilation parameter Finally, the value of parameter From Eq. Firstly, the governing Eq. By taking derivative of this equation, the incremental form of this relation is then obtained as From Eq. The consistency condition requires that the obtained tractions for the next iteration By substituting Eqs. From As seen from The increment of the traction from the current point A to trial point B is elastic Noted that in the above equation, the elastic part when moving from B to C is equal to zero due to the fact that it was already used to move from A to trial point B as presented. By substituting Eqs. From this scalar factor, increments for other internal variables can be calculated following Eqs. Once the relation between the tractions and the relative displacements at the joints is established, it can be implemented into the double-scale model described in In the implicit algorithm, the stress and joint tractions are firstly computed with the assumption of elastic joint behaviour. An iterative procedure is then applied to correct the current stress and tractions to ensure that the traction continuity is obtained with a certain pre-defined tolerance. This enables the algorithm to yield relatively accurate results with larger steps compared to the explicit algorithm. To serve this purpose, a vector of residual traction is defined in the global coordinate system as By using the first order Taylor expansion of the residual vector at a state of the last iteration This corrective displacement is then used to calculate corrective traction The process of correcting the stress and tractions is performed until convergence is obtained. The traction continuity is thus satisfied at that point. The pseudo implicit algorithm for stress update is presented in Implicit stress update input: Compute Compute trial displacement Compute trial stress Compute local trial traction                A number of examples are presented in this section to illustrate the performance of the proposed model for analysing jointed rock behaviour. The main focus of the current paper is the rock joint shear under constant normal load (CNL). The material properties from published data and the model's parameters obtained from the calibration are summarised in The current double scale model is based on the stress-strain relation of a volume element It is noted that in all examples, besides the peak and residual strengths used to calibrate the yield and failure surfaces, a single data set including shear stress-shear strain response and dilation behaviour at a given normal pressure was used for the calibration of other model parameters. The calibrated parameters are then utilised to predict the mechanical response of the joint under other normal pressures. The behaviour predicted by the model is compared with those obtained from experimental studies as well as previous models by other authors. The first example is a simulation of the direct shear test of granite mortar replicas, carried under various constant compressive normal stress The shear stress - shear displacement responses predicted by the proposed model are plotted in It is noted that the patterns of the stress and the dilation evolution from the model are relatively similar to those from experiments. In specific, the shear stress-displacement curve brought by the model includes 4 phases. Firstly, it begins with a linear elastic part where contact area between two sides of the joint increases. In this stage, the specimen also experiences contraction owing to the misfit of the two crack sides. This contraction mostly depends on the nature of the joint surfaces and their contact with each other. The value of the contraction is usually small compared to the dilation ( The second example to be considered is a shear test of precast rock joints from replicas, which was recently conducted by The shear stress against shear displacement and dilation behaviour predicted by the model are plotted in From the results plotted in Next, the model is validated with data set from an experiment conducted by The numerical shear stress-shear displacement results of the test are plotted in The possession of a length scale in the constitutive structure, as can be seen in the model description in The deterministic size effect of a jointed rock mass behaviour is due to relative size of the rock joint and its surrounding intact rock. The thickness and behaviour of the joint contained within a rock mass are invariant and irrespective of the size of the rock mass, leading to the scaling of the behaviour of the jointed rock mass with its size. In the proposed model, apart from the inclusion of the characterised length To illustrate the scale effect in the model, the jointed rock mass in the first experiment (carried by In addition to the simulation at constitutive level (one element based simulation) as described in the previous sections, numerical simulations using finite element method (FEM) consisting of several elements are also carried out to verify the performance of the proposed size-dependent constitutive model. For the FE (finite element) simulations, the proposed constitutive model is implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS in the form of a user-defined material model (UMAT). In this simulation, a layer of elements (the red layer shown in The corresponding stress - displacement responses under shear predicted by the proposed constitutive model and the FE analysis are plotted in It can also be seen in The paper presents a double-scale approach for modelling the shear behaviour of jointed rock mass under constant normal load (CNL) condition. In the model, the mechanical behaviour of the joints and the surrounding rock are incorporated into a constitutive model where their interactions are controlled by a set of kinematic parameters and static conditions across the joint interface. By doing so, the contributions of these two components are naturally taken into the constitutive model along with their interactions. This helps give the model a better description of the jointed rock mass in different loading cases. Another advantage obtained by incorporating the joint in the rock mass is that the joint orientation and the scale effect could be taken into calculation in a continuum constitutive model. A coupled damage-plasticity cohesive model is proposed to describe this inelasticity of the joint in mixed-mode loading condition. By using a single unified loading function, the newly proposed cohesive model can naturally capture the behaviour of the joint from initial yielding to final failure. The proposed model is then validated against experimental results of jointed rock. The numerical results show a good agreement between the proposed model and experimental data, as well as numerical results in previous studies. In addition, the coupling between surrounding rock and joint together with their relative size and orientation of the joint enable the double-scale approach to naturally capture the scale effects of jointed rock mass behaviour. This shows the potential of the proposed approach in modelling rock mass at larger scales. The promising features of the proposed approach and the cohesive model show that they have potentials for modelling the hydro-mechanical coupling in hydraulic fracturing ( Giang D. Nguyen and Ha H.
