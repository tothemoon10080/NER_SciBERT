BaTiO3 was synthesized by solid state reaction between BaCO3 and TiO2 at 1150°C. XRD analysis of the powder confirmed the formation of phase pure tetragonal powder. The particle size of BaTiO3 powder was of the order of 0.7µm. In order to study grain growth kinetics of BaTiO3, isothermal sintering was carried out at 1200, 1250 and 1300°C for the time durations of 2, 4 and 6h at each of these temperatures. Average grain size increased from 0.4µm to 1.1µm on increasing time and temperature of sintering. Corresponding to the temperatures of 1200, 1250 and 1300°C, grain growth exponents obtained using phenomenological kinetic grain growth equation decreased in the order of 9.77, 4.61 and 3.08 indicating rapid coarsening with increased temperature. Grain growth exponents as high as 4.61 and 9.77 can be regarded as the result of mixed diffusion while grain growth exponent of 3.08 can be the result of pore controlled lattice diffusion. Activation energies calculated in correspondence of grain growth exponents of 9.77, 4.61 and 3.08 were 1307±65, 567±30 and 439±20kJ/mol respectively.Barium titanate is a ceramic widely used in electronic industry because of its high dielectric constant and low tangent losses. It is often used as basic ferroelectric material in electronic components such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC), positive temperature coefficient thermistors (PTC), electro-optic devices, memory applications, sensors and actuators etc. The isothermal rate of grain growth is expressed by phenomenological kinetic grain growth equation: Results on grain growth studies, reported in the literature on BaTiO Barium titanate powders were synthesized using barium carbonate (BaCO In order to synthesize barium titanate, starting materials were first mixed in methanol to make slurry and yttria stabilized zirconia balls/powder ratio was kept at 5:1 and the mixture was ball milled for 48 XRD pattern of BaTiO   The phenomenological kinetic grain growth equation can be written in the form From the slope of the ln If Eq. The apparent activation energy corresponding to grain growth process can be calculated from the gradient of the Arrhenius plot of ln( The values of BaTiO Authors would like to acknowledge
