We consider a secure remote state estimation problem where the observations transmitted from the sensors to a remote estimator could be intercepted by an eavesdropper. To prevent the eavesdropper from acquiring the system states, we propose an encoding–decoding mechanism by combining linear transformation and artificial noise to ensure the exact values of observations unavailable to the eavesdropper but available to the estimator. Further, we propose an algorithm by which the eavesdropper may infer the approximate values of the observations and thus to further estimate the system states. We reveal how the amplitude of the artificial noise affects the accuracy of the eavesdropper inference, which helps the designing of the encoding–decoding mechanism. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the derived results.Recently, the vast development of computing, control, communication and network technology has greatly expanded the scale of the interconnections among the devices and facilities in Cyber–Physical systems (CPSs) ( To defend a CPS from eavesdropping attacks means to protect the privacy of the data transmitted. Many works have been done in privacy-preserving. Mo et al. in In this paper, we inspect remote state estimation in the presence of an eavesdropper. The state estimation, in which the estimator gives the system states by observing the system outputs, is one of the fundamental applications in CPSs (as in Inspired by the works in  We propose an encoding mechanism, which is a combination of linear transformation and artificial noise. This mechanism pre-process the sensor observations of a linear dynamic system to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining the exact value of the observations. The linear transformation only involves the multiplication of a 2 × 2 matrix and the artificial noise is generated by analog devices. Hence, the method does not require high computational cost. Besides, unlike the encryptions in We consider a possible situation where the eavesdropper can infer the approximate value of the observations under the encoding mechanism. We show the relationship between the amplitude of the artificial noise and the accuracy of the approximation of the eavesdropper, which can be a guideline when deploying the secrecy state estimation facilities. This paper is structured as follows. In Section  We inspect the state estimation problem of a dynamic system with a remote estimator. In the presence of an eavesdropper, the system observations are at risk of being exposed to an unauthorized third party. The objective is to design a strategy to protect the information security of the remote estimation network. In this section, we specify the background of the problem by giving the mathematical description about the system model, and by outlining the communication topology in which the nodes and links are defined. Consider a linear discrete time-invariant system driven by Gaussian noise series. The dynamic equation is described as When the time stack of observations Given the system model in Section          Given the system model and communication topology in Section  For sensor Use a multiplexer to integrate the observation For sensor The encoder multiplies Upload  The calculation of the inverse of  In cryptography, the unpredictability of a random sequence is fundamental to ensure the efficiency and reliability of an encryption algorithm ( When the encoding mechanism in In this subsection, we focus on the extra energy consumption problem of the encoding mechanism mentioned in We now summarize the energy-saving encoding mechanism in Algorithm 1. The decoding mechanism corresponding to Algorithm 1 will be altered by  Algorithm 1 includes two cases: the number of sensors The connection structure of sensor group   To further decrease the energy consumption, an intuitive thought is to include more sensors into a divided group so that a noise generator can be shared by more sensors. However, in this mechanism, including more than two sensors into a group might breach the privacy of the system states. An example in In signal processing, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is defined as the ratio between the power of the signal and the power of noise. Given the encoding matrix It can be seen that, for each dimension of  Supposing that a settled SNR threshold Another concern of this paper is the reliability of the encoding mechanism in Algorithm 1. We seek the situation where the eavesdropper can get full or part of information about the system states from the encoded signals, thus to avoid such situations when deploying the encoding–decoding mechanism. To formulate the problem, we first have the following assumptions to clarify the eavesdropper’s capabilities.  Suppose that the eavesdropper knows the following information:  the system dynamic equation in the observation equation in the distribution of the exact initial system state the encoding mechanism in Algorithm 1 and suppose that the data transmitted on the channel can be acquired without error and history acquisition  We assume that  For any positive number This section aims at finding solutions to the problems raised in As issued in   In this scenario,   In this scenario, the system dynamic equation can be written as  When the system in In    Refer to The objective of this subsection is to inspect the issue in    Refer to  It can be seen from The above analysis and In order to calculate With  The eavesdropper can extract the approximations  Algorithm 2 does not ensure the accuracies of outputs The eavesdropper runs Algorithm 2 on every grouped sensors and obtains We assume that the eavesdropper is embedded with a Kalman filter to estimate the system states using the inferred observations. Even there is one observation that is not inferred, the estimation can still proceed because a Kalman filter has no requirement on the dimensions of the observation ( It is worth noticing that when Now we can give an answer to In this section, we present simulation experiments to illustrate the privacy-preserving performance of the encoding–decoding mechanism and the deduction accuracy of the eavesdropper. We consider the case where two sensors The overall system parameters are set as below and the following numerical experiments are conducted based on these parameters.  To examine the encoding performance, we compare the real observation and its corresponding signal transmitted on the channel by showing  In this subsection, we inspect the accuracy of the deduction conducted by the eavesdropper. It has been mentioned in Section  To further evaluate the deduction performance, we compare the accuracies of state estimation between the eavesdropper and the destination. The accuracy of state estimation of the destination is described by the estimation error covariance  Both Finally, to have an intuitive view on the accuracy of the deduced estimation, we show the real-time error  In this paper, we have proposed an encoding mechanism that combines invertible linear transformation and artificial noises for remote state estimation in order to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining the states of the observed system. We have calculated the lower bound of the artificial noise under certain SNR threshold. A deduction algorithm for the eavesdropper to infer the encoding matrix has also been developed. We have examined how the variances of the artificial noises influence the deduction accuracy. The results have shown that under the given deduction algorithm, Future works can be focused on the following two topics: (1) To develop an encoding mechanism with time-varying encoding matrices so that the eavesdropper cannot perform deduction by statistical analysis. The key is to solve the synchronization problem of the encoding matrices between the source and the destination. (2) To find the optimal filtering algorithm for the eavesdropper to acquire more accurate state estimation. The key is to determine the distribution of the deduction error in that the deduction process contains nonlinear operations.
