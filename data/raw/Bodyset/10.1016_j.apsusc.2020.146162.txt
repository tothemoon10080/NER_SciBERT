High performance and low cost electrode materials are vital for sustainable application of today’s supercapacitors. As one of the nitrogen-rich biomass wastes, soybean pod was applied to synthesize porous carbon by alkali activation. The effects of alkali/carbonized soybean pod mass ratio (1–5) on surface area and electrochemical performances were investigated. At optimal reactant ratio of 4, the outstanding surface area of soybean pod carbon material was recorded as 2612 ± 64 m2 g−1. The soybean pod carbon displayed parallel tube array structure with nitrogen content of 1.52 ± 0.06%. Using symmetrical electrodes with a voltage of 1.8 V in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at 0.5 A g−1, the specific capacitances of as-prepared and commercial carbon were 352.6 ± 16.2 and 242.7 ± 12.5 F g−1. During long life of 50,000 cycles, such a soybean pod carbon exhibited larger capacitance retention of 94.2 ± 3.0% than 84.7 ± 2.7% of commercial one. With high mass loading of 20 mg cm−2, the robust and flexible soybean pod carbon electrode revealed a superior areal capacitance of 4.70 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, and the value could still retain as 4.38 F cm−2 after 10,000 cycles. It could be indicated that the soybean pod carbon was a potential and renewable candidate to construct inexpensive and advanced energy storage devices.Facing the energy consumption problem, the demand for new energy is increasing rapidly. As a typical energy storage device, supercapacitor (or ultracapacitor) has attracted considerable attention during last decades Porous carbon electrode is a key component of EDLC The specific capacitance of carbon-based EDLC is commonly as ~200 F g Herein, we used the waste SP to prepare SP-based carbon (SPC) electrode for low cost and large areal capacitance supercapacitor ( Detailed procedure was described in NETZSCH thermal analyzer (STA449c) was used to examine thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric (TG-DTG) via heating SP from 30 to 1000 °C under 10 °C min Symmetrical electrode materials were made by SPC, acetylene black (Lizhiyuan Battery) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Lizhiyuan Battery) aqueous solution (60 wt%), with a mass ratio of 8:1:1. Ethanol was added into mixture with ultrasonic and stirring treatment for 20 min.
