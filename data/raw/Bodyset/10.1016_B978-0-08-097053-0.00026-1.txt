 A solution is derived from the cumulative recoveryâ€“cumulative total solids (or weight) recovery ( This property is exploited in the derivation of  We can now define some features of the plot. Weight recovery (or yield) at By inspection, when metal recovery is 1 (100%) at pure mineral grade then the weight recovered, Thus Operating point From the construction, we can consider point Separation efficiency: Based on the definition above Derivation in terms of By similar triangles we can write  Consequently: General case: Substituting for The result, starting from the above definition of separation efficiency, is thus equivalent to Maximum separation efficiency: The maximum can be found by trial and error from the available recovery data for the two components, as illustrated in
