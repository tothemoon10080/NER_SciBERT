The formation of oxide inclusions in one of the carbon steel productions of Mobarakeh Steel Complex of Isfahan has been evaluated. Several samples from different steps of steel production were taken, from are furnace, ladle furnace, tundish, and continuous casting mold. Moreover, samples of slab and hot rolling products were prepared. The samples were investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopes equipped with the EDS system. According to the results, the number, composition, and kind of inclusions were directly influenced by the production variables. It was found that when the amount of dissolved oxygen was high (say more than 0.002 5%), the dissolved aluminum was able to reduce silicon oxide and react with the dissolved oxygen simultaneously, whilst, the dissolved aluminum could reduce the magnesium oxide only when the oxygen content was below 0.000 5%. Based on this research, a mechanism for forming the complex inclusions was suggested. It was also found that if the aluminum is added to the melt as late as possible, a cleaner melt with fewer inclusions is prepared; this method will be more effective, especially in the case of complex inclusions.
