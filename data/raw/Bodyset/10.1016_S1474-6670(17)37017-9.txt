The experience of instrumenting and developing the control and information systems in a pilot SX/EW plant is presented. The plant is located at the Process Control Laboratory, Santa Mar√≠a University, in Chile,. The control system is organized at three levels in an architecture including field controllers, PLC and PC networks. The main objectives are to develop and test intelligent tecniques in an hybrid system, and to study measurement and supervisory control problems. It is expected to produce reliable results that will contribute to improve the efficiency of this emerging and important process.
