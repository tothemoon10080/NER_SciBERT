The fault detection problem is studied in this paper for a class of linear Networked Control Systems (NCS) with intermittent communication. The aim is to generate residual signals which, in the fault free case, are supposed to be identical to zero. In practice, this condition is usually not guaranteed due to various factors such as measurements noises, model uncertainties and, for NCS in particular, data dropouts. The proposed approach here for residual generation can guarantee both robustness to noise as well as packet dropout and sensitivity to fault. An illustrative example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed method.
