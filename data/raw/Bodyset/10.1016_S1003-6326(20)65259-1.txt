The structure of the quaternary Al-(2−4)wt.%Ca-Ni-La system near the aluminum corner has been studied using computational analysis in the Thermo-Calc program and experimental studies (electron microscopy, microprobe analysis and X-ray diffraction). Based on the phase equilibria data obtained, the experimental projection of the liquidus surface and solid state phase-field distribution of the Al-Ca-Ni-La system have been proposed. Microstructure studies reveal that the alloys with the 2-4 wt.% Ca, 2−4 wt.% Ni and 1-3 wt.% La ranges have an ultra-fine hypoeutectic structure with 30% volume fraction of eutectic intermetallics, which allows one to classify these alloys as natural Al-matrix composites. The ultra-fine eutectic structure produces significant strengthening, the magnitude of which can be well described using the modified Orowan looping mechanism model. Small additives of Zr and Sc (0.2 and 0.1 wt.%, respectively) lead to significant strengthening (by ~25%) due to the formation of L12 type phase (Al3(Zr, Sc)) nanoparticles during annealing of the alloy at 350-400 °C. Due to the high volume fraction of eutectic intermetallics, the new alloys have low coefficients of thermal expansion and high thermal stability of the structure and mechanical properties.
