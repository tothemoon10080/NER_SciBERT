A porous structure of ZnFe2O4 was prepared by combustion. The effects of the self-propagation reaction and calcination temperature on the morphological and electrochemical energy storage properties of ZnFe2O4 were studied. The results show that with the combustion reaction of the dry gel at 169.8 °C, the crystallinity and grain size of the pure phase ZnFe2O4 are positively correlated with the increase of calcination temperature. Due to its highly porous structure and good crystallinity, the calcined ZnFe2O4 at 700 °C shows the best electrochemical performance. The first specific discharge capacity reaches 1482.4 mAh g-1, and the reversible capacity after 50 cycles is still 1319.4 mAh g-1. The rate performance test indicates that the 700 °C sample has a very good reversible capacity and an excellent rate performance over a wide current density range. At a high current rate of 1600 mA g-1, the reversible capacity can be kept above 900 mAh g-1. The above results indicate that the combustion method is indeed a simple and efficient method for preparing ferrite, and the obtained material has good electrochemical properties.
