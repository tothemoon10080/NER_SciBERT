Clinical summary
                  The surgical repair of comminuted ilial wing fractures (comprising a long oblique fracture with ventral multiple fragmentation) in three cats using composite internal fixation is reported. The technique comprised the use of pins, screws, wire and polymethylmethacrylate. All cases had an excellent outcome with uneventful bone healing. One case had a very mild reduction in pelvic canal diameter postoperatively. There was no evidence of implant loosening or migration in any cat on follow-up radiographs.
               
                  Practical relevance
                  This technique provided a quick and highly adaptable means of stabilising this fracture configuration, as well as restoring pelvic symmetry, when limited buttressing support and bone stock were available cranial and ventral to the acetabulum. This method of fixation may have biomechanical advantages over lateral or dorsal plating techniques for this particular type of fracture configuration.
