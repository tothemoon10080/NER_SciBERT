A rock breakage test has been developed that can help predict autogenous (AG) and semi-autogenous (SAG) mill performance in situations where only limited quantities of rock samples are available. The test was originally developed to make use of quartered (slivered) core but whole core, half core and lump material can also be used. Original core diameters in the range 27–85 mm are suitable. The samples, once broken, can be used subsequently for Bond ball mill work index or batch grinding tests, therefore limiting overall sample requirements.
                  The test generates an index (DW
                        i
                     ) that can be used to estimate the throughput of AG and SAG circuits through a combination of power-based and model-based approaches. The model-based approach makes use of the direct relationship between the DW
                        i
                      and the JK rock breakage parameters A and b. The power-based route uses correlations which have been developed between the DW
                        i
                      and the specific energies of a very wide range of operating AG and SAG circuits. Its usefulness also extends to rock mass characterisation in mining applications, as it is also correlated with the point load index/UCS. It is therefore ideally suited for mine-to-mill studies where it can be simultaneously used to predict comminution circuit performance and to augment input to blast fragmentation models. This makes it a useful tool for orebody profiling in greenfield, brownfield and established operations as, in conjunction with a mine’s block model, a detailed picture can built of the blast fragmentation and comminution circuit response.It is generally recognised that the most accurate means for predicting the specific energy of an autogenous (AG)/semi-autogenous (SAG) mill circuit is to pilot the circuit using a 6 Although drill core is much less expensive to obtain than bulk samples, drilling campaigns are still expensive and hence as far as possible the drill cores should be put to multiple uses. This usually means halving or quartering them, with the result that only very small quantities may be available with which to carry out comminution testwork. The laboratory rock breakage test must therefore be able to accommodate this limitation. With these problems in mind a new laboratory test has been recently developed together with a variety of approaches that use the results to predict AG/SAG mill behaviour. The test (referred to as the SMC test) was originally developed to make use of quartered (slivered) core, which is cut into a number of identical pieces ( Once the core has been cut into the required number of pieces they are divided into five equal lots. Each lot is then broken in an impact device using a range of closely controlled energies. A suitable impact device is the JKMRC’s drop-weight tester ( The use of modelling and simulation has become routine in the design and optimisation of AG and SAG mill circuits. One of the most widely used models for this purpose is the so-called “variable rates” model ( The standard JK drop-weight test normally needs about 75 kg of material and hence its use is normally precluded for small drill core samples. However, the DW Apart from being able to predict throughput and power draw of AG/SAG mills, modelling and simulation also enables a detailed flowsheet to be built up of the comminution circuit response to changes in ore type. It also enables optimisation strategies to be developed to overcome any deleterious changes in circuit performance that are predicted. This is particularly useful during the design stage as the chosen circuit can be tested under a range of conditions to see whether the circuit will meet its production targets. Strategies can then be developed to overcome any potential problems. These can include both changes to how mills are operated e.g. ball load, speed etc. but also changes to feed size distribution through modification to blasting practices and primary crusher operation. Blast fragmentation models are needed for this purpose. These models require information on rock mass competence such as provided by the point load strength ( The power-based approach to design uses a methodology which, given certain ore breakage characteristics, predicts the specific energy for a particular AG/SAG mill circuit. The multiplication of the specific energy by the target throughput gives the required power draw of the mill. A mill is then selected which can draw the required power under the chosen operating conditions eg ball charge and speed. The choice of an appropriate measure of the ore breakage characteristics and an associated technique for predicting the specific energy is obviously very important for this approach to work. A potential appropriate measure of an ore’s breakage characteristics is the DW The result from analysing the data was an equation of the form:  DW      The ability of the equation to fit the data is shown in A new rock breakage characterisation test has been developed which is able to make use of very small quantities of sample such as quartered drill core. The test generates a strength index (DW The usefulness of the DW
