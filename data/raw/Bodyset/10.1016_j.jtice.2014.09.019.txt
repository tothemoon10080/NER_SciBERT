This study focused on kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamics of Acid Blue 25 (AB25) dye biosorption from aqueous solution using the shell of Penaeus indicus shrimp as a biosorbent. Optimum sorption conditions were identified by varying solution pH, biomass dosage, initial dye concentration, contact time, salinity and ionic strength. Equilibrium data were well fitted by the Temkin, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models, while the pseudo-second order model best described kinetics. Thermodynamic data showed that AB25 dye biosorption onto shrimp shell was a feasible, spontaneous and exothermic one. The biosorption capacity increased with decreasing the sorbent particle size and with the addition of salts (NaCl, MgSO4, KNO3 and KH2PO4). The high sorption capacity of P. indicus shell obtained in this study suggests its use as an effective, low-cost biosorbent for the removal of acid dyes from wastewaters.Water is one of the prime necessities for sustenance of life, but the increased industrial and agricultural activities in the past has resulted in the pollution of natural water resources around the world. Today, one of the most important global concerns is to save the planet and to make the future of mankind safe by saving natural water resources Dyes, which are responsible for generating colored wastewater, are considered the most undesirable pollutants in addition to bases, acids, toxic inorganic and organic dissolved solids Coagulation, flocculation, ion exchange, membrane separation and oxidation processes have been widely used to decolorize wastewaters. In general, physical and chemical methods for remediation of colored effluents are often very expensive and do not always effective Among several dye removal techniques, adsorption is an efficient one to remove different kinds of dyes from water and wastewater. This process is simple to design, easy to operate, cost effective, eco-friendly and insensitive to toxic substances, and usually utilizes low-cost adsorbents such as fly ash, bottom ash, zeolite, rice hull, peanut hull, orange peel and bacterial cells. Much attention has recently been paid in seeking cheap, locally available and effective biosorbent materials such as biopolymers The chromophores in anionic and non-ionic dyes mostly consist of anthraquinone or azo groups. Due to fused aromatic rings, anthraquinone-based dyes are particularly resistant to degradation, and their persistence in wastewaters is growing at the present time. Acid Blue 25 (AB25) is an anthraquinone dye that is widely used in wool, nylon, silk, paper, ink, detergent, wood, fur, cosmetics and biological stain The aim of this study was to investigate the use of The target dye used in the present study as a sorbate was Acid Blue 25 (purity >95%), an anthraquinone compound with molecular formula C All the solutions were prepared by diluting repeatedly 1000 The biosorbent was the raw chitin shell from the shrimp Batch experiments were performed to determine the effects of various process parameters such as solution pH (2, 6.5 and 11), biosorbent dosage (0.1–0.4 The effect of the solution pH on AB25 dye biosorption capacity was evaluated at three different pH values, namely 2, 6.5 and 11. Before experiments, the solution pH was measured by means of a pH meter and adjusted by the addition of 0.1 The yield of AB25 dye removal ( Equilibrium experiments were carried out by using 0.1 The sorbent biosorption capacity at equilibrium, The most common isotherm models were applied in the present study, namely the Temkin, Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin–Radushkevich ones. The Temkin isotherm model is described by the equation The Freundlich model is described by the equation The Langmuir model Another equation used in the isotherm study is that proposed by Dubinin and Radushkevich on the basis of the Polanyi biosorption potential and Dubinin's minipore filling theory From the value of The mean sorption energy gives information about the biosorption mechanism, and more specifically about its physical or chemical nature. If it lies between 8 and 16 Biosorption kinetic experiments were carried out using a 0.1 The pseudo-first order rate equation can be written in its linear form of as: The pseudo-second order model can be described in its linear form as The intraparticle diffusion model is described by the equation To determine the feasibility of AB25 dye biosorption by Δ Δ There is significant correlation between initial dye concentration and dye binding capacity of an adsorbent, which in turn depends on the available binding sites all over its surface It is well known that the solution pH is an important parameter in any biosorption process, because it influences the sorption capacity of sorbents and solubility of sorbates As shown in Biosorbent dosage is a crucial parameter in dye removal, because it determines the percentage of solution decolorization and may also be used to predict the cost of biomass per unit of dye solution to be treated  Wastewaters bearing dye contain various types of salts that lead to an increase in ionic strength, thus influencing the performance of biosorption; therefore, we also investigated in this study the effect of NaCl concentration in the range 0–40 Different effects of NaCl on the removal of reactive, acidic or alkaline dyes were previously reported. For instance, an increase in NaCl concentration led to a sharp decrease in the sorption of the alkaline, cationic dye Basic Blue 9 by modified rice straw, whereas this effect was less marked for Basic Red 5 The rate of sorption is of utmost significance when designing batch biosorption systems; therefore, it was important to establish the time dependence of our system under different conditions The influence of contact time on the biosorption process was also studied at different values of the initial pH (2, 6.5, and 11) using an AB25 dye concentration of 70 Isotherms describe how a sorbate interacts with a sorbent material and establish the most appropriate correlation with the equilibrium curve The Temkin isotherm model, which takes into account the interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate, is based on the hypothesis of uniformly distributed binding energies up to a maximum energy and states that the heat of adsorption decreases linearly with increasing the adsorbate coverage The Freundlich model is an empirical model that describes monolayer adsorption with heterogeneous surface. As shown in On the other hand, the Langmuir model is based on the assumption of monolayer sorption onto a surface with a finite number of identical and homogeneous sites. The correlation coefficient of this model was lower ( Although both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models well represented equilibrium biosorption data, prevalence of heterogeneous nature of shrimp shell is suggested by the highest Another model that is less commonly used in the isothermal analysis is the Dubinin–Radushkevich model, whose Several kinetic models were proposed to describe sorption kinetics, which give important information to design batch sorption systems as well as to select optimum operating conditions for full-scale batch process The pseudo-second order model yielded better fit (  The intraparticle diffusion model was also tested in order to verify the possible influence of mass transfer resistance on binding of AB25 dye onto the biosorbent. As shown in Temperature ( The system exhibited negative values of Δ Since in the textile industry many electrolytes are usually added to dye solutions to improve color fastness AB25 dye sorption on shrimp shell was found to be 463 Compared with the strong individual effects of nitrate and sulfate salts that were able to increase the biosorption capacity from 463 to 490–494 In order to have an idea of the potential of In this study, the equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamics of Acid Blue 25 (AB25) dye biosorption by  The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
