Physicochemical interactions between the mineral particles and liquid binder play a pivotal role in controlling the agglomeration behaviour and defining the agglomerate attributes. In this study, the effect of tap water, saline water (2M NaCl) and 30% and 44% w/w H2SO4 solutions as binders on agglomeration behaviour and product attributes (compressive strength, re-wetting stability and microstructure) of a hematite-rich mixed minerals was investigated. The results revealed that at equivalent binder mass dosage of 13wt.%, albeit different binder volume dosages, the agglomeration with tap and saline water displayed markedly faster nucleation and coalescence-controlled agglomerate growth behaviour. The acidic solutions led to slower nucleation followed by pseudo-layering agglomerate growth behaviour, the extent of which was greater at 44% than at 30% w/w H2SO4 binder addition. Generally greater compressive strength and re-wetting stability were displayed by the acid-bound agglomerates compared with tap water and saline water-bound ones. The internal microstructural analysis revealed that the pore volume fractions of the wet agglomerates were almost independent of the binder type. In the dry state, however, the pore volume fractions of the water-bound agglomerates were slightly lower than that of acid-bound ones, both were, however, markedly higher than those observed for wet agglomerates. The increase is believed to be due to particles’ shrinkage resulting from interfacial stresses and strains following moisture loss during drying. The observed outcomes highlight the importance of binder type and their impact on agglomeration behaviour and product characteristics.Heap leaching (HL) is a process used to extract value metals (e.g., gold (Au), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni)) from their low grade ores at lower capital and operating costs than the other hydrometallurgical methods ( Run-of-mine (ROM) lateritic ores are characteristically polydispersed comprising a large fraction (e.g., >30 Depending on the ore mineralogy and chemical composition and the operating HL conditions, raffinate-based lixiviant (e.g., H During acid agglomeration, the wetted mineral particles generally bind together via (i) liquid bridges, (ii) liquid films and (iii) solid bridges from re-crystallization/solidification of solubilized species ( The binder solution properties (e.g., viscosity, density, acidity, interfacial tension) and percent mass or volume dosage not only influence the particles’ wetting behaviour, saturation level, nucleation and growth processes during agglomeration but also the final product characteristics (e.g., strength, microstructure, re-wetting stability, porosity) ( Notably, whilst various facets of goethite-rich limonitic Ni laterite ores have been extensively studied including agglomeration behaviour ( Water is a critical resource for Australian mineral processing operations and its accessibility and quality can impact on the economic viability of the business. Most groundwater available for mining operations in arid and semi-arid regions are characteristically saline (including sea water) or hypersaline. To date, no study has been reported on the effect of binder salinity on agglomeration behvaiour and agglomerate properties. In this paper, the effect of water-based binder composition on agglomeration behaviour and product attributes of a hematite-rich mixed mineral feed, which mimics complex, low grade limonitic Ni laterite ore, is investigated. Specifically, the influence of binder acidity and salinity on powder wetting, agglomeration behaviour and products properties (e.g., strength, re-wetting stability and microstructure) was examined. The feed (hematite-rich mixed mineral) used in this study comprised four polydispersed (1–130 Isothermal, batch agglomeration tests were conducted at ∼24 Evolution of agglomerate size distribution with time was characterized by manual sieving of dry product and cumulative mass fractions under size against mean agglomerates’ size plots ( The micro-CT analysis was conducted on ∼10 Isothermal, batch leaching experiments were conducted in tap water, saline water, 30% and 44% w/w H  With 30% and 44% w/w H The observed differences in the agglomeration behaviour shown in Taking cognizance of the results in   The EDX analysis of randomly selected spots of the solid material obtained from tap water supernatant indicates dominance of Fe, which is from the hematite seed particles ( The reconstructed 2D and 3D micro-XCT images of the internal microstructures of wet and dry agglomerates made with tap and saline water and acidic solutions, are shown in Comparison of wet and dry agglomerate porosity values estimated from micro-CT analyses (based on the data in The compressive strengths and re-wetting stabilities of wet and air-dried agglomerates produced with different binder solutions are shown in  Taking into account the differing binder composition-based reactivities and hence, the concomitant agglomerate interfacial and structural properties, Eq. According to Eq. The data in In terms of binder solution effect on agglomerate re-wetting stability, the same factors which enhanced the strength of acid-bound agglomerates (explained in previous paragraph) also led to their superior re-wetting stability compared with tap and saline water-bound agglomerates. Also, a comparison of the strength and re-wetting stability of acid-bound agglomerates observed in this study and those of 100% model hematite ( Overall, the present findings suggest that typical potable and saline groundwater can be used for successful agglomeration of crushed ores; however, the products’ compressive strength and re-wetting stability may not be desirable for efficient heap leaching. Using acidic solution for agglomeration provides better binding-effectiveness and hence greater product strength/stability due to chemical reactions (leaching) at solid–liquid interface followed by solidification and/or recrystallization of leached species upon drying. The fact that acid solution is superior to water as a binding agent for agglomeration and heap leaching of mineral ores such as Ni laterite ( The impact of binder properties (e.g., acidity, salinity, density) on powder wetting and nucleation, agglomeration behaviour and product characteristics (compressive strength, re-wetting stability and internal microstructure) of hematite-rich mixed mineral feed was investigated. Faster nucleation and coalescence growth behaviour agglomeration was observed during tap and saline water agglomeration whilst H The financial supports of
