Summer sausage is produced from lean beef, pork, pork fat, or fatty pork trimmings. The particles of meat and fat in the finished products have a diameter of around 3–4mm, and the fat content of the product is around 30%. Additives such as salt (around 25–28g/kg), nitrite, and spices are added, and black and white pepper, mustard seed, nutmeg, garlic, coriander, and allspice are the spices most frequently used. Nitrite and fast-acting starter cultures are also introduced. Frequently, citric acid is also applied to conform with the required drop in pH value. The sausage mass is filled into fibrous casings of 70- to 80-mm diameter, and the product is fermented at high temperatures of 30–40°C. The pH drops quickly as a result, and the final pH obtained is usually around 4.5, which is low but accepted by the customer. After being smoked, the salami is heated to around 60–65°C in the core at low RH levels (around 40–50%). The product is dried further until the desired weight loss has occurred.Summer sausage is produced from lean beef, pork, pork fat, or fatty pork trimmings.

The particles of meat and fat in the finished products have a diameter of around 2–3 Within Asia poultry, salami is produced using boneless chicken or turkey meat from thighs with the skin on. The meat is processed when still semifrozen, and mincing of the meat materials to the desired particle size is most often practiced before being mixed with all spices and additives. Occasionally, the mincer-filling head system is applied and glucono-delta-lactone is generally applied to achieve acidification to a pH of around 4.7–4.9. Salt is applied at around 24–26
