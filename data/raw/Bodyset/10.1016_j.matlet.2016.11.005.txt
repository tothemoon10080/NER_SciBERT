Graphene-like MoS2 has attracted significant interest because of its unique electronic, optical and catalytic properties with two-dimensional lamellar structure. A novel intercalation-detonation method was used to prepare monolayer and multilayer graphene-like MoS2. MoS2 was first completely intercalated by abundant oxygen-containing functional groups bonded to the sulfur atom layer in basal planes of the MoS2 structure, increasing the layer spacing and decreasing the Van-der-Waals' force between the layers. Then, the intercalated MoS2 was rapid exfoliated by high energy of detonation. Characterization results indicate that the graphene-like MoS2 was successfully prepared by the explosion method. This type of processing is simple, highly efficient and generates fewer impurities.Graphene-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS Due to the adjustable band gap, graphene-like MoS Here, we report a novel intercalation-detonation method to prepare graphene-like MoS Raw materials, MoS Exfoliation was performed by placing premixed intercalation MoS As-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, Germany), Raman spectroscopy (Jobin Yvon HR-800), atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker, Germany), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Fischione M3000) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5400, USA). The samples for AFM and HR-TEM examinations were dispersed in ethanol with ultrasonic treatment for 30 XRD patterns were used to detect the phase change of MoS Raman spectra are shown in  AFM morphology in XPS measurements were carried out to characterize the chemical nature of the intercalation and intercalation-detonation MoS From Based on the above analysis, the exfoliation mechanism of bulk MoS In conclusion, crystalline graphene-like MoS This work was supported by the
