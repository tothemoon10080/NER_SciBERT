The solvent extraction and separation performances of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from hydrochloric acid solutions were investigated using dibutyl sulfoxide (DBSO) diluted in kerosene. Pd(II) was strongly extracted by a lower concentration DBSO in a lower concentration hydrochloric acid solution while the reverse was obtained for Pt(IV) extraction. Based on independent extraction and separation experiments of Pd(II) and Pt(IV), the separation parameters of Pd(II) and Pt(IV), including dibutyl sulfoxide concentration, contact time of aqueous and organic phases, organic/aqueous (O/A) phase ratio and H+ concentration of aqueous phase, were studied in detail, and the optimal separation parameters were obtained and summarized as the following: dibutyl sulfoxide concentration 0.6–1.2moldm−3, organic/aqueous (O/A) phase ratio 0.6–1.0, H+ concentration of aqueous phase 1.0–1.5moldm−3 and contact time of two phases 5min. The as-prepared separation parameters were corroborated by the extraction and separation from a synthetic stock solution containing Pd(II), Pt(IV) as well as several common impurities like Fe(II), Cu(II) and Ni(II). The results revealed that Pd(II) could be separated efficiently from Pt(IV) with a high separation coefficient of Pd(II) an Pt(IV) (2.7×104) by predominantly controlling dibutyl sulfoxide and hydrochloric acid concentrations. The extraction saturation capacity of Pd(II) was determined from 1.0moldm−3 HCl solution with 3moldm−3 dibutyl sulfoxide and its experimental value exceeded 14gdm−3 under the experimental conditions.
                  Stripping of Pd(II) from loaded organic phase was performed using a mixed aqueous solution containing NH4Cl and ammonia solutes. Pd(II) (99.2%) was stripped using the stripping solution containing 3% (m/v) NH4Cl and 5moldm−3 ammonia, respectively.Precious metals, including gold, silver and platinum group metals (PGMs), possess specific properties and have been applied extensively in many industrial spheres for decades, e.g., serving as the core materials of many significant electronic products, as the crucial compositions of fuel cells and as the key ingredients of chemical catalysts used to remove automobile pollutants automatically ( As being two important members in PGMs, palladium and platinum usually associate in the ores. Generally, Pd(II) Sulfoxide extractants are soft base ligands and are considered to have strong affinity for soft Lewis acid metals such as palladium, platinum, gold and silver ( Sulfoxide extractant (dibutyl sulfoxide molecular structure: ( Stock solution of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) (each concentration 1.000 All experiments were carried out at room temperature (303 To determine the percentage extraction of Pd(II) or Pt(IV), equal volumes (50 Percentage extraction of Pd(II) or Pt(IV) was calculated according to Eq.
