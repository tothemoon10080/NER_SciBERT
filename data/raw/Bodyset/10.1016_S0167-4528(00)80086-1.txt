Economic and ecological reasons are increasingly asking the mining industry to optimize the utilization of raw material; in close connection with this comes the growing need for smart alternatives to expensive traditional ore beneficiation processes. Maffei sarda srl operates in central Sardinia a large feldspar production unit, including two main open pit mines and a treatment plant. The total Maffei Sarda feldspar production has dramatically increased in recent years and is expected to reach half a million tonnes in year 2000. As a first step in a rationalization program for all production facilities in Sardinia, Maffei Sarda decided to install a 100 t/h optical sorting circuit in the treatment plant at Orani (NU). Optical sorting was chosen mainly because of its low operating costs and versatility, and was expected to improve both the final product overall quality and mine recovery. All bulk material that can clearly recognize by their surface optical characteristics can be classified using the MikroSort. Even insignificant optical nuances can be taken into account. After a simple preparation by size classification, the product stream is fed into the sorters; during the free fall at the end of a vibratory feeder the material fragments are scanned by high-resolution optical system and evaluated by parallel processor technology. The selection is made by accurate compressed air impulse jets that remove unwanted particles. The multicolor optical sorting technology is described with particular attention to the optical system, the image processing methods and the selection criteria. Then the industrial installation and the flow sheet are illustrated and the processing results reported.
