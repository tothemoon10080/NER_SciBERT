The distribution of framework Si and Al in the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst, for NH3 selective catalytic reduction of NOx, is manipulated via a new strategy, using SAPO-34 as a seed in hydrothermal synthesis instead of the conventional SSZ-13 micro-crystallite. The SAPO-34 seed has a strong impact on the hydrothermal stability of the catalyst, moderating the dealumination as well as the agglomeration of the active Cu2+ ions in the Cu-SSZ-13 with hydrothermal treatment at 800 °C.In the past decade, Cu-SSZ-13 has been developed as a commercial catalyst for selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH Substantial works have been done on optimizing the structural properties of SSZ-13, e.g., the compositional Si/Al ratio In this work, we demonstrate a novel and simple strategy to control the TFAl distribution in the framework of SSZ-13, by using a SAPO-34 seed in the hydrothermal synthesis. The effects of the SAPO-34 seeds on the structure, active sites and hydrothermal stability of Cu-SSZ-13 are examined. A scheme for the enhancing effect of the SAPO-34 seed on the performance of Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst is proposed. Sample notations, preparation procedures and amount of the seeds introduced during synthesis are listed in As shown in Solid-state As shown in The EPR results in The TEM images of the Cu-SSZ-13 and P H The change of cupric species can probably be explained by the change of distribution of the Al tetrahedron in the SSZ-13 framework. The content of the framework Al is very close in the Cu-SSZ-13 and PxCu samples according to As shown in The catalytic performance of the selected catalysts is shown in This work provides a new strategy to improve the hydrothermal stability of Cu-SSZ-13, viz. SAPO-34 seed is used as the seed to grow the SSZ-13 crystal. It shows the introduction of SAPO-34 enhances the distribution of the Al tetrahedron in the CHA framework, as well as influences the type and stability of the isolated Cu This work was supported in part by the Supplementary data to this article can be found online at The following are the Supplementary data to this article:
