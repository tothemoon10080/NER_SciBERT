The scope of this work consisted of producing stabilized yttrium-zirconium oxide powders from zirconium oxychloride and yttrium chloride using urea as a precipitating agent and polyacrylic acid as dispersing agent.
                  A factorial analysis was designed to study the effect of some precipitation variables (temperature, precipitation time, urea concentration, yttrium chloride concentration and polyacrylic acid concentration) on some characteristics of the aggregates (size and electrophoretic mobility) and of the zirconium oxide powders (crystalline structure).
                  It is suggested that the structure of the dispersion species strongly influenced the crystalline structure of calcined zirconium oxide powders. These species are zirconium polymers that can assume a tridimensional structure similar to fluorite favoring the retention of high temperature polymorphic phases. The decomposition of urea supplied the solution with OHâˆ’ ions at a slow rate enabling the formation of the tridimensional structured zirconium polymers. On the other hand, polyacrylic acid prevented the formation of these tridimensional structures possibly because polyacrylate ions remain in thesites of the zirconium polymeric structure previously available for polymerization reactions. For higher concentrations of urea and polyacrylic acid, an increase in precipitation time implied the predominance of the mechanism ruled by urea over that related to polyacrylic acid.
                  The role of polyacrylic acid as dispersing agent was evaluated regarding DLVO and extended DLVO theory. In a zirconium-yttrium system, electrosteric repulsion mechanisms would be responsible for a better dispersion.
