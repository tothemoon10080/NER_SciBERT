The recovery and processing of metals is one of the oldest recycling measures of mankind and the reasons for this are due to energy saving considerations and to the conservation of primary raw materials. Processes for the treatment of obsolete scrap metal have to be adapted to the most frequently used metals and metal mixtures. Size reduction as well as screen classification and separating procedures are the most common stages in scrap metal processing plants. In this chapter an overview is given showing the typical equipment for the handling of scrap metals. In this context the design and functioning principle of scrap shears as well as shredder and post-shredder plants are discussed. Finally, a new and highly sophisticated method for the segregation of waste metals - the so-called sensor based sorting - is discussed and explained.

In this chapter, the fundamentals of metal recycling are described. Only the mechanical processing of scrap is considered, because these processes are all that is required to produce metals that can be used without any difficulties and without further treatment in metallurgical plants. These metallurgical processes include the machinery that is actually a part of the downstream equipment involved in smelting and refining and thus these processes complete the recycling loop for metals. Metals for recycling include those that are recovered from large bulky equipment and often consist of both ferrous (Fe) and NF materials. The metals involved are mainly iron, steel, stainless (inox-) steel, and several NF metals. In this section, the advantages and approximate quantities of metals recovered for recycling are discussed. In 2008, the total world steel production amounted to 1.3 billion tonnes (1.3 × 10 Stainless steel is an iron alloy containing nickel, chromium and other elements that are present to protect the metal against corrosion and other unwanted chemical reactions. The market demand for this metal has doubled over the past decade, with an annual production amounting to more than 25 × 10 The most commonly used NF metals in the world today are aluminum, copper, brass, zinc, and lead. Because of their limited availability, their high value and the considerable energy saved if recycled, large quantities of these NF metals are reclaimed and recycled in smelters, refineries, foundries, and other producers of these metals and metal products in most countries of the world. This is not only ecologically sound (up to 99% reduction of CO The essential demands of modern waste management are to reduce the total amount of waste arising and to reuse and recycle as much of the waste as possible. In many fields of recycling, it is difficult to meet these requirements because the recovered products are often of reduced quality and hence value. As a result, these materials can only be used in a downgraded form. A typical example is the recycling of waste plastics. In most cases, the collected material is of mixed types of plastic that are not fit for easy recycling. The mixed plastics However, for metal recycling, the situation is very different. The most important reasons for this is that metal can be recycled indefinitely and that subsequent metallurgical treatments do not substantially change the physical and chemical properties of the metal. Furthermore, metals (including recycled metals) have a high market value, which is very rare in the recycling industry. Here, with metals, supply and demand are the determining factors that affect the market prices. Moreover, the prices can be influenced to a certain degree by operators of recycling plants as they have the chance to sell their products at convenient points of time, that is when adequate revenues can be achieved and the “price is right.” In general, the recycling industry for metals is structured in an organizational form of a pyramid: at the bottom of the pyramid are many small companies that purchase and collect scrap metal. This scrap is then sold to larger business establishments that process and separate the metals and finally it is sold to companies that have metallurgical plants for further treatment or it is sold to big multinational trading companies at the top of the pyramid. Metal scrap is made up of a mixture of metals originating from a variety of sources that include commerce and industry, municipalities, and households. This obsolete scrap is collected, stored, processed, and sold from scrap yards or other specialized facilities. In this context, “home” scrap and “in-house” industrial scrap are not discussed as these materials can be considered as “works scrap,” which never reaches the consumer. As a rule, this type of scrap does not contain foreign material, and does not need any treatment or separation process and can be reused directly. However, obsolete scrap requires target-oriented mechanical processing to meet the quality demands of the customers, which commonly are metallurgical plants. The following goals are aimed in this stage: modifications of physical properties, for example, dimensions and bulk densities, modifications of chemical properties, for example, metal content and unmixed grades of final products, modifications of safety properties, for example, removal of explosives and hollow bodies, modifications of other properties, for example, liberation and separation of unwanted adherences. The collected scrap appears in a great variety of forms and properties such as different lump sizes and shapes; materials with differing bulk densities; different kinds of metals, each with their own properties (e.g., hardness, abrasiveness, etc.); and materials made of composite substances that could include plastics and other nonmetals. Consequently, it is necessary to adapt the treatment processes to the special characteristics of the most frequently found complex-composed feed mixtures. Mechanical processing of scrap is carried out predominantly with mechanical equipment, such as shears, compaction units, shredders, and other types of machines. In the following section, typical machinery and processes used for scrap treatment are described. Moreover, the most relevant machines that are used in practice are listed in Guillotine shears are used in most industrialized countries for the cutting up of lumpy, thick-walled steel and NF metal scrap, the majority of which is reasonably ductile. In the process, the material is usually stressed by compressing and shearing forces. The desired goal of this cutting process, using the hydraulic shears, is to achieve a single-stage reduction in the scrap to dimensions with a final length of approximately 400 to 1000 mm. The process meets the demands of steel mills, foundries, and NF metal smelters in respect to the physical properties and condition of the metals. Thus, all types of scrap from the more compacted steel plates, pipes, and beams, as well as the bulky scrap in the form of tanks, casings, and structural elements, can be cut into similar-sized pieces. The functioning operation sequence of guillotine shears is characterized by spatial precompression with a side press, a press lid, and a feeding pusher forming a compact cord that is pushed underneath the cutting blade. This allows the scrap to be cut into pieces of variable length However, it is not possible to obtain liberation of complex and compounded material such as metal/metal or metal/nonmetal composites from the pieces cut with these scrap shears. Therefore, the application of guillotine shears is limited to the processing of materials containing a minor quantity of foreign substances. Such shears are predominantly operated in steady There are about 700 shredder plants installed worldwide, and these plants are used mainly for the processing of light-mixed scrap and ELVs. The first step in these plants is the shredder itself, which has the task of crushing and liberating the feed material by intensive impact and shearing stresses. As can be seen in The baffle plate edge (3) and the baffle plate (4) are structurally formed in such a way that ductile metals are further crushed and compressed until they are small enough to pass through the grid (5). The position of the grid (11) can be adjusted hydraulically; this has an important role in influencing the final grain size and the compression ratio. As a rule, the steel scrap produced in shredder plants is compressed so that a bulk density of 1 t m The material that is discharged through the shredder grid exhibits a very broad grain size distribution ranging from coarse (~150 mm) to very fine particles (<1 mm). As can be seen in the simplified flow-sheet of Within the heavy fraction of the air classifier, the metals are enriched. In most cases, magnetic drum separators are used for the selective separation of the iron and steel scrap—this accounts for approximately 60% to 70% by weight of the shredder in-feed material. After hand picking, for the removal of nonliberated copper-containing items, for example parts of electric motors, the final ferrous product fulfils the quality demands in respect of grade and bulk density so that it can be recycled in steel mills without further treatment. However, it may be expected that new developments in the field of sensor-based sorting will replace manual picking in the future. The material that is not attracted by the magnetic separator—the so-called shredder heavy fraction—is an intermediate product (5%–8% by weight of shredder input) containing NF metals. The processing of this fraction allows recovering of valuable metals such as magnesium, aluminum, copper, zinc, bronze, lead, and stainless steel. In total, approximately 50% to 60% by weight of metals are to be found in the heavy fraction. Further processing of the shredder heavy fraction with the main aim to recover NF metals mainly occurs in specialized plants, which, however, very rarely belong to the downstream equipment of shredder plants. A simplified flow sheet of such a plant illustrating the state of the art for the processing of NF–metal-rich The screen underflow fractions are then processed on three eddy current separators. These devices are very effective in segregating a good portion of the NF metals contained in the mixture The segregation efficiency of eddy current separators depends to a great extent on the physical properties of the feed material. These are mainly the grain size range, the grain shape, and the ratio of electrical conductivity to density of the metallic components. With these systems, some metals such as wires, metal/nonmetal compounds, lead, and stainless steel cannot be deflected and remain in the so-called tailings fraction for further processing. The sensor sorters 1 and 2 are used for separating the NF metal remainders. Additionally, two more sensor sorters are arranged for the removal of stainless steel items. For this purpose, sensor-based sorters with inductive metal detectors are applied (q.v. Finally, two heavy media separators are applied for the density separation of the NF metal mixture from the preceding process stages. A separation into three products (magnesium, aluminum, and a mixture of heavy metals) can be conducted based on the different densities using heavy liquids of densities of approx. 1.9 and 2.9 g cm Single grain separation using externally identifiable properties, which can be determined with suitable detectors, is defined as sensor-based sorting. This technology has revolutionized the design of dry working processes in the field of waste treatment over the past 20 years To achieve effective separation with sensor-based sorters, it is very important to condition the feed material before entering the detection zone so that the different components of the feed material can be recognized by the sensors. Thus, single particles should not touch or overlap each other. The most common method of achieving this is to use a cascade of different belt conveyors and/or inclined sliding chutes with increasing transport velocities. The application of sensor-based sorters, in recycling processes, has great advantages in comparison with conventional methods. This is becoming increasingly more beneficial as new separating criteria for separation are made accessible. In addition, the continuous development of new sensor systems continues to open up innovative fields related to separation and recycling, and remarkable progress concerning novel sensors and sensor combinations has been achieved over the past few years. A number of different types of sensor sorters have entered the market in the last decade especially designed for the separation of metals. Today, sensor-based sorters with inductive detectors are frequently used for metal separation. The assembly and functioning principle of such devices are given in A vibrating feeder (1) and a belt conveyor (2) running with a speed of 3 m s Mechanical treatment of different waste streams containing metals involves the use of well-established methods, which, as a rule, is profitable because of the high market value of the recovered metals and also because metals do not change their properties with use and hence can be recycled an unlimited number of times. The main aim of the processing methods is to achieve high recovery values as well as the best possible grades of the final metallic products. Newly developed systems such as sensor-based sorters are increasingly being implemented to improve separation efficiencies. Finally, re-smelting of the reclaimed products constitutes the closing of the complete recycling loop for metals.
