This chapter is devoted to the separation produced by particle settling due to gravitational forces. Based on the principle of Buoyancy, the gravitational systems and the deciding factor for particle settling to take place, is the difference between the density of the solids and that of the suspending liquid. The existence of the density difference is, therefore, a necessary pre-requisite in sedimentation. The object of modern methods of treatment is to convert the unstable into a stable effluent suitable for discharge to the local watercourse. Designing and operating of re-circulation systems can be complicated, but problems could be avoided by using a sludge blanket clarifier, in which the feed enters below a blanket of accumulated and heavily flocculated solids. The chapter describes how a blanket is fluidized by the up-flowing feed, and the feed solids are trapped in it. The solid content of the blanket increases continuously and a bleed stream is taken off to maintain the mass balance.
