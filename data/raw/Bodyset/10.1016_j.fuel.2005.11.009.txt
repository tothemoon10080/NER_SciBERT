Recently, I have been following articles on acidophiles in Fuel (Vol. 84, pp. 81–87; Vol. 83, pp. 181–186; Vol. 82, pp. 2065–2068). In these articles, the name of Mesophilic iron and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria are widely used in biological processes (biodesulphurisation/biooxidation/bioleaching) for the oxidation of sulphidic-ferric ores It is recommended that this terminology should be used in future articles.
