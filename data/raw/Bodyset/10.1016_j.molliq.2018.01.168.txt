This study investigated the potential ability of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to recover palladium ion from aqueous solutions. The effect of pH, initial metal ion concentration, contact time and temperature on adsorption of Pd(II) was investigated. The Pd(II) adsorption properties were analyzed through kinetic, isotherm and thermodynamic models. Furthermore, FTIR, SEM-EDS, TEM-EDS, and XPS were applied to evaluate the Pd(II) adsorption mechanisms onto S. oneidensis MR-1. The kinetic data suited pseudo-second order model, indicating the rate-controlling step was chemical adsorption. The equilibrium data were well fitted to Langmuir isotherm model with maximum Pd(II) adsorption capacity of 158.48mg/g at 50°C. The thermodynamic results suggested the Pd(II) adsorption process was exothermic and spontaneous. The results of FTIR, SEM-EDS, TEM-EDS, and XPS revealed both biosorption and bioaccumulation occurred in Pd(II) removal process from aqueous solutions.Biosorption is a promising technology for the removal and recovery of metal ions from aqueous and waste solutions due to its low-cost, high effectiveness at low concentrations and environmentally friendly nature [ Biosorption is a fast and metabolism-independent process that can rely on different physicochemical mechanisms such as ion exchange, electrostatic interaction, complexation and microprecipitation [ In case of Pd(II) biosorption, the interaction between Pd(II) ions and functional groups can facilitate Pd(II) adsorption in agreement with HSAB (Hard-Soft Acid-Base) theory [  Therefore, the present study focused on the biosorption properties and mechanisms of Pd(II) onto  The biosorption experiments were performed by adding The influence of pH on Pd(II) adsorption was investigated at different initial solution pH (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0), the initial Pd(II) concentration was 200 The effect of initial metal ion concentration was carried out at 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 Biosorption kinetic experiment: the Pd(II) initial concentration was 200 Biosorption isotherm experiment: the initial concentration of Pd(II) was varied from 50 to 400 Biosorption thermodynamic experiment: this section was carried out in a similar method as the isotherm experiment, except that the Pd(II) initial concentration was adjusted to about 200 After adsorption, the samples were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 The samples of raw and Pd(II)-loaded biomass were obtained by vacuum freeze-drying. FT-IR (Nicolet 6700, USA) was performed to identify the functional groups on the cell surface. The spectra were recorded within the range of 4000–400 The surface morphology of the samples was analyzed by SEM (Quanta-200, FEI, UK) at 10 TEM analysis was performed using a Hitachi-7650 (Japan) at 100 XPS analysis was carried out by Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 spectrometer (UK), using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer. The pH of solution has been identified as one of the most important environmental factors, which affects not only the solution chemistry of metal ions, but also site dissociation of the cell surface [ As shown in These results could be explained on the basis of the metal speciations and surface charge on the biomass [ Metal adsorption is a mass transfer action that can usually be considered as the agglomeration of metal at the interface between two phases [ The kinetic experiment was performed to investigate the rate controlling step and to identify the mechanism involving in biosorption process [ Pseudo-first-order model [ Pseudo-second-order model [ Intraparticle diffusion model [ The fitting curves for these kinetic models were shown in The intraparticle diffusion model was used to confirm the influence of mass transfer on Pd(II) biosorption [ Two common isotherm models, the Langmuir model and the Freundlich model, were used to predict the maximum adsorption capacity and identify the interaction between sorbate and biosorbent. The experimental equilibrium data for the sorption of Pd(II) were obtained at four different temperatures (20 The Langmuir model assumes the adsorption occurs as a monolayer without interactions between the adsorbed molecules and with equivalent adsorption energies [ The Freundlich model supposes the multilayer adsorption occurs at heterogeneous surfaces, accompanied by interaction between the adsorbed molecules [ The linearized Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms of Pd(II) ions were given in The essential characteristics of the Langmuir isotherm model can be expressed in term of the dimensionless equilibrium parameter Thermodynamics parameters are evaluated to investigate the nature of the adsorption. The Gibbs free energy change Δ As can be seen from The FT-IR spectroscopy technique is an important way to evaluate possible reactions between metal ions and surface functional groups of biomass. The FT-IR spectra of After the adsorption of Pd(II), the peaks at 3301 SEM-EDS technique was applied to locate potential palladium precipitates on the biomass surface [ Interestingly, TEM provided insight into the morphology change of biomass after adsorption and spatial distribution of Pd precipitates. As shown in Therefore, the Pd(II) adsorption onto XPS was performed to determine the elemental composition of row and Pd(II)-loaded biomass and identify the chemical status of recovered palladium on the cell surface. C, N, O, Cl and S can be found in the survey spectrum of row biomass ( In this study, a typical metal-reducing bacteria Through Langmuir isotherm, Kinetic studies indicated the experimental data fitted well with pseudo-second-order model and the thermodynamic parameters showed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the biosorption process. The results of FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM-EDS, and XPS confirmed that This study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of
