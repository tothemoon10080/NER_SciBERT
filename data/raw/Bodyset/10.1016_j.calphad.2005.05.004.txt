The Gibbs energy of the liquid phases in the SmCl3–MCl (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) systems is described by a modified quasi-chemical model. Based on measured phase equilibrium data and experimental thermochemical properties of these binary systems, a set of thermodynamic functions has been optimized by using the CALPHAD technique. The calculations based on the obtained descriptions show good agreement with experimental phase diagrams and thermodynamic values.Rare earth metals play an increasing important role in various fields of contemporary science and technology. As is well known, molten salt electrolysis has been widely used for the production of rare earth metals and their alloys To continue our previous work In order to optimize the phase diagram with short-range ordering a modification of the quasi-chemical theory of Guggenheim The Gibbs energy of “reaction” The mole pair Gibbs energies of A–B pairs, i.e. The molar energy of A–B pairs, The phase diagrams of the SmCl By comparing the results of the four research groups, we chose the data of the SmCl All thermodynamic data The phase diagrams data, the Gibbs energies of formation of the intermediate compounds, and the thermodynamic data According to the calculated phase diagrams, the coordination numbers In the modified quasichemical approach, the molar energy of A–B pairs, Here The expression for the Gibbs energy of formation of the intermediate compound The optimized coefficients The phase diagrams of the SmCl The enthalpies of mixing and the interaction parameters of the SmCl A thermodynamic optimization of the SmCl The project is the key program supported by Foundation of Natural Science of Anhui Education Committee numbered as 2005KJ016 ZD of key project.
