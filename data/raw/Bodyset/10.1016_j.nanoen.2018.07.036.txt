And then, based on typical solid electrolytes, several approaches for improving the contacts between electrolytes and electrodes for configurations of all-solid-state Na batteries will be discussed, which are beneficial for enhancing electrochemical performances. Finally, a perspective on the future direction for developing high-performance Na-ions solid electrolytes and making intimate interfaces between electrolytes and electrodes for all-solid-state batteries will be proposed. We hope this Review provide the guidance not only for materials design of solid electrolytes, but also for forming interfaces in all-solid-state Na batteries with favorable electrochemical performances for practical applications. The history of developing Na-ions solid electrolyte was much earlier than that of Li-ions, and the layer structured β-alumina (Na The ionic conductivities of typical Na-ion solid electrolytes, such as β-Al The electrochemical/chemical stabilities of solid electrolytes are also important factors to be considered for all-solid-state Na batteries. Comparing to stable electrolytes of β-Al β-Al For ionic conductivity of Na-β′′-Al β′′-Al The Na-β′′-Al Different from Na-ions migrations in 2D planes of layer-structured β′′-Al The ionic conductivities of NASICON are in the range from 10 The NASICON materials can be synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and spray-freeze/freeze-drying methods The sulfides electrolytes have attracted much attentions because of high ionic conductivities, excellent mechanical properties for intimate contact between electrode and electrolyte, isotropic ionic conductions without grain boundary resistances, simple manufacturing operations for processing into a film at low temperature, and variable compositions in a wide range Generally, sulfides electrolytes can be divided into glass and glass-ceramic. In detail, glassy electrolytes with equivalent phase, like Na Glass-ceramic electrolytes that prepared by crystallization of glass precursor have been extensively studied in recent years. For instance, Na The sulfides electrolytes usually exhibit higher ionic conductivity than that of oxides because the electronegativity of sulfur (with larger atomic radius) is smaller than that of oxygen, which leads to a smaller electrostatic force between Na and S in framework The typical preparation process of sulfides electrolyte is mechanical ball milling and low-temperature heating treatment of precursors Compared to inorganic solid electrolytes, the solid polymer electrolytes have several advantages, such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, low cost, convenience of fabrication process, and accommodation of volume changes of electrodes during charging/discharging, which have been extensively studied for all-solid-state Na batteries. The early Na-ions polymer electrolyte was started from dissolving Na salt in polyethylene oxide (PEO) solvent to form cations and anions, in which Na cations were solvated by polymer chains and became movable through the connected chains Besides single polymer as solvent, the composite electrolytes combining with other organic polymers have been proposed to improve ionic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities. For example, PEO electrolyte blended with succinonitrile (SN), PVP and PANI have been employed as polymer composite electrolytes The Na-ions polymer electrolytes have ionic conductivities in the range of 10 It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivities can be improved in composite electrolytes. For example, a composite polymer electrolyte comprising of 50%wt PEO-50%wt SN with sodium-triflate (NaCF Besides PEO based electrolytes, other Na-ions polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivities have also been explored. For instance, the ion conductivity of PAN-24 wt% NaCF The polymer electrolytes are usually fabricated by solution-casting method, in which polymer host and Na salt are dissolved in organic solutions and then poured in PTFE molds for film formation As illustrated above, organic polymer electrolytes with high amorphous state can offer high ionic conductivity. However, the crystalline organic solid electrolytes can also be applied as fast Na-ions conductors. For one thing, a co-crystalline NaClO Besides, other inorganic solid electrolytes, like Na-rich anti-perovskites and Na-borohydrides have also been proposed ( The Na-borohydrides composed of Na As both ionic conductor and separator, the solid electrolyte layer is sandwiched between compressed powder electrode layers (positive and negative electrode) to fabricate bulk-type all-solid-state Na batteries ( The cathode materials that used in all-solid-state Na batteries are similar to that of liquid-electrolyte based batteries, such as sodium layered metal oxides (NaCoO As most of cathodes are composed of powder materials for bulk-type solid-state Na batteries, the poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and cathode has negative effect on the performances of solid-state batteries. So far, there are many strategies for forming intimate interfaces, which can be classified into to following aspects. The common approach to fabricate the interfacial contact is preparing composite cathode that mixed by active material and electrolyte, which have been widely adopted in both inorganic and organic solid electrolytes batteries ( For the fabrication of composite electrode, the heterogeneous inorganic solid electrolyte powders and active material are firstly physically/mechanically mixed (may cause the aggregation of each component), followed by cold-pressing, which is not enough to form void-free dense composites with intimate contact, or not sufficient for improving the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state batteries. Fortunately, for organic solid electrolyte, the composite cathode can be prepared by well mixing of active materials and polymer electrolytes in the solvent. For example, by fabricating the cathode sheets with mixing of NaCu Besides solid composite electrode, the organic liquid electrolyte and ionic liquid have been applied as wetting agent to enhance the tight contact between cathode and solid electrolyte ( Another effective approach for forming intimate interface is surface coating of active material particles by thin films of solid electrolytes ( It has been demonstrated that the interfacial resistance can be reduced by making interlayer/interphase for ions transports between solid electrolytes and cathodes. For instance, a plastic-crystal electrolyte interphase consisting of SN and NaClO Taking the advantage of both inorganic ceramics and organic polymers, the composite electrolytes have been proposed to provide improved ionic conductivity with high flexibility for reducing the interfacial resistances between solid electrolytes and electrodes ( The structural design of electrode and battery are also effective approaches for making intimate interfaces of solid electrolytes and cathodes. For example, the Na For all-solid-state Na batteries, the anode/electrolyte interfaces are mainly focused on the interfacial contact between Na metal/alloy and solid electrolytes with formation of pathways for fast ions transports, and Na metal should be plated/stripped reversibly without obvious dendrites. It has been demonstrated that the interfaces are more stable and intimate between polymer electrolytes and Na anode than that of inorganic solid electrolytes, where Na dendrite formation is unavoidable and followed by penetrations of grain boundaries. Moreover, the interfacial contact will not intimate after volume changes of Na anode thin film over charge/discharge cycles, which causes the decay of cycling stability. Thus, the interfacial modifications between Na anode and inorganic solid electrolyte are essential to reduce resistance and enhance the performance of all-solid-state Na metal batteries. For the assembling of all-solid-state Na batteries with electrolyte pellet, Na metal foil was generally pressed on one side of solid electrolyte under a pressure to make interfacial contact ( Similar to cathode/electrolyte interface, the organic liquid electrolyte can be used as wetting agent to enhance interfacial contact between Na anode and solid electrolyte at room temperature ( The interlayer can be added or formed for ions transports between Na anode and solid electrolytes to reduce the interfacial resistance and enhance the contact ( The surface coating is an effective approach to make intimate contact between cathode and solid electrolyte, which can also be used for Na anode ( The rechargeable Na based batteries have been proposed as the promising alternative of Li based batteries because of low cost and high abundance of Na resources in Earth's crust. And the all-solid-state Na batteries based on solid electrolytes are more preferable for large-scale energy storage owing to high safety and stability better than the liquid electrolyte with inflammability and explosive. So far, various Na-ions solid electrolytes have been developed, including the β/β′′-Al The challenges of low ionic conductivity, weak electrochemical stability and poor mechanical property of solid electrolytes can be overcome by several methods. For one thing, the structural integration for the materials design as an effective way should be firstly taken into attention. For inorganic solid electrolytes, the ionic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities can be improved by substitution or dopants. For example, the ionic conductivities of NASICON can be increased by dual elements doping. Similarly, the ionic conductivities of sulfides can be improved by substituting different anion species and adding Na oxides/sulfur, which can increase the Na concentration and the decrease the activation energy for ions transports. However, increasing the amount of network modifiers with Na compounds may facilitate the crystallization of glass, which are not favorable for the increase of ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the instability of sulfides electrolytes in the air, that is, the H Another big challenge for developing all-solid-state Na batteries is the interfacial issue, especially the large interfacial resistance and poor compatibility between electrode and electrolyte ( Besides the electrolytes and interfacial issues that fully discussed in this review, some other aspects, like the fundamental understanding of the ions transports mechanisms in both the interfaces and the bulk batteries during the charge/discharge, and the battery constructions that consisting of composite cathodes, solid electrolytes and Na metal anode, are need to be further explored for all-solid-state Na batteries. The ions transports on the interfaces are much more critical for understanding the interfacial process and enhancing the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state Na batteries. And experimental and theoretical calculation approaches are preferred to be combined for further development. The design of battery construction is also important for optimizing the performances of all-solid-state Na batteries. Besides the conventional techniques, the integration of composite cathodes by SPS and 3D printer, are considered as the advanced fabrication methods to design optimum microstructures for all-solid-state batteries. Thus, much more research on all-solid-state batteries are still needed for the deeper understanding of fundamental mechanism and accelerating its process of the practicality.
