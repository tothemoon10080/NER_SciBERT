In order to manufacture metal-sheathed bulk superconducting discs, the explosive compaction/cladding technique, which combines explosive welding and compaction, was employed. In this paper, experimental and numerical investigations are reported on grooved metallic plates, filled with superconducting ceramic powder, subjected to explosive loading. The response of the metal and ceramic material during compaction is investigated by using finite element techniques and the dimensions of the compacts, pressure and temperature distributions are predicted. The numerical results obtained are compared with experimental observations, being in good agreement.Shock consolidation is a widely used method for producing ceramic and metallic components for advanced structural applications. It is a process by which the particle surfaces are highly deformed producing inter-particle bonding in a one-step process. The consolidation of the powders is accomplished by the passage of a strong shock wave through the powders. In the case of high- The optimization of the compaction process and the evaluation of the process parameters are of great interest for engineers and the finite element methods can help in explaining the mechanics of powder behaviour under applied stress, as well as in predicting the deformation of the compact, the pressure, density and stress distribution, during the process. Most of the finite element models are associated with the static consolidation, while the modelling of the explosive compaction, is not extensively considered, since it is difficult to provide the dynamic properties of powders and the related Hugoniot curves The experimental configuration of the superconducting disc consisted of an initial set-up angle of 0° and a stand-off distance of 4 In the case of the four superconducting discs, the configuration consists of a flyer silver/copper plate, which was impacted, using a 30 According to experimental measurements, the thickness of the flyer plate was reduced to 1.2 A thermomechanical numerical analysis of the explosive compaction/cladding process was performed, using the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA3D. The macro-mechanical approach is adopted and the modified Drucker–Prager/cap elasto-plastic constitutive model is used to describe the superconducting powder According to the simulation of the compaction/cladding of the superconducting disc, the flyer plate reaches the powder after 12 The obtained pressure, acting on the metal and the ceramic, was in the range of 7 According to the simulation the flyer plate reaches the base after 23 From the results reported above and similar conclusions made pertaining to the explosive compaction/cladding
