Purpose
                  The purpose of this preliminary retrospective study was to review the demographics and outcome of patients with a variety of facial fractures that were stabilized with PL bone plates and screws.
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  The records of 295 consecutive patients with facial fractures treated by open reduction and internal fixation, performed by the author from 2001 through 2004, were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were selected to receive biodegradable fixation on the basis of mechanism of injury, the degree of bony displacement demonstrated on clinical and radiographic examination, patient age, and fracture pattern or location. Outcome measures such as infection, non-union, and mal-union were identified and subjectively assessed. Descriptive statistics were recorded and analyzed.
               
                  Results
                  Two hundred eighty-one patients met the criteria for inclusion in the study with follow-up of 3 weeks to 3 years. Fifty-nine (21%) patients were identified as having received biodegradable plates and screws. All patients eventually went on to satisfactory healing with favorable restoration of form and function. Complications occurred in 16 patients overall (6%). Of these, 2 patients were treated with resorbable plates and screws; 1 patient with a zygomatico-maxillary complex fracture developed a sterile abscess that presented 1 year postoperatively and responded to local measures. Another patient with a Le Fort I fracture developed an anterior open bite necessitating Le Fort I osteotomy for correction.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Favorable healing can be observed through the use of biodegradable PL plates and screws to stabilize selected midface fractures in patients of all ages, as well as mandible fractures in early childhood.
