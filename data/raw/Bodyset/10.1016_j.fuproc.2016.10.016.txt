The drying of coal slime with high moisture content is indispensable for the majority of its industrial applications. In view of the low drying rate at the falling-rate drying period during the conventional drying process, hot-air drying followed by microwave drying, a featured deep drying method, can fundamentally solve this problem and achieve fast and efficient dewatering. In this study, the combination of hot-air and microwave drying to dry coal slime was presented, the general behavior of combined drying method was investigated at a combined fixed bed reactor with hot-air in the temperature range of 120–200°C and a microwave oven with a maximum power of 800W. The critical point of hot-air drying, also termed transition point at which hot air drying switched into microwave drying, were experimentally determined and the results showed that the moisture contents of the critical points were about 15% for the samples used. Furthermore, the effects of different target moisture contents and microwave powers on the drying performance and energy consumption of combined dewatering were studied. The results showed that microwave drying could significantly elevate the drying rate when the coal slime reached the critical moisture contents during the hot-air drying method, which indicated that combined drying was an effective method to achieve deep drying of coal slime with a significant reduction in total drying time.Coal slime is a by-product of coal washing, and cannot be easily utilized on a large scale due to its high levels of moisture content, high viscosity, high ash content, and low heat value properties. In recent years, the amount of coal slime has increased drastically due to the fast rise in the amount of coal washing in China, which could potentially lead to significant energy waste and environmental pollution. Currently, the preferred means of utilizing coal slime is combustion as fuel for power generation Currently, coal slime drying methods can be divided into two categories: mechanical drying and thermal drying. Mechanical drying includes the processes of sieving, centrifugation, and filter press drying, but after mechanical drying, the moisture content is still relatively high (approximately 20%) Conventional thermal drying processes can generally be divided into the growing-rate (AB), constant-rate (BC) and falling-rate (CE) drying periods Microwave heating has several unique features of selective and volumetric heating over the traditional approaches With these distinctive features, microwaves have been widely used to heat or melt various dielectric materials in applications such as food processing Based on the above characteristics of traditional drying and microwave drying, it is possible to re-enhance the drying rate if microwave assisted heating is used after the coal slime enters the falling-rate drying period in the conventional drying process. It is even possible to bring the coal slime in the falling-rate drying period back to the constant-rate drying stage, or change the falling-rate drying curve from “concave” to “convex” (microwave drying has this important characteristic The hot air/microwave combined drying method has been widely used in the food industry Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a hot air/microwave combined drying technology program. Tests were conducted to obtain the essential characteristics of the combined drying process, in order to determine the critical moisture content range of hot air drying, and the effects of different targeted moisture content ( The fine coal slime was collected from Bucun coal mine at Jinan, China, and the results of its proximate analysis are listed in The combined drying test system consists of two parts: a conventional hot air drying system and a microwave drying system. First, spherical coal slime of a certain mass is placed on a hot air drying test rig for pre-drying to achieve the target moisture content (conversion point); then the sample is quickly transferred into a microwave drying test system to continue deep drying (the sample handling process should be completed within 5 The hot air drying test system consists of a hot air generator, a precision scale (G&G500, accuracy ± The microwave drying test system for coal slime is shown in The experiment process was the same as reported in our previous publication Energy consumption is an important indicator of the drying process evaluation. The heat consumed to remove a unit mass of water 1) For the hot air drying method, the energy required for drying coal slime is 2) For the microwave drying method, the energy required for drying coal slime is 3) For the hot air/microwave combined drying method, the energy required for drying is Under hot air drying conditions, the drying rate of coal slime was high during the pre-drying period, and significantly decreased after entering the falling-rate period. According to  Similarly, changing the drying conditions (e.g., hot air temperature, wind speed, and particle size, etc.) resulted in different critical moisture content values of coal slime The TG curves of hot air and hot air/microwave combined drying samples are shown in As shown in When the conventional drying crossed point C, the drying process converted to microwave heating (for the CD During convective drying, the gradients of temperature and moisture are negatively correlated, and heat flux goes from the particle surface to the center of the particle through various transmission channels like convection and conduction, while moisture mass flux goes from inside the particle to the surface by virtue of concentration differences in moisture. In this case, water spreading toward the outside of the material entails an additional resistance to heat flow inside the material According to In summary, the hot-air drying method by itself not only is time-consuming with low efficiency, but also affects the coal slime product quality. Hot air/microwave combined drying can significantly improve the coal slime drying rate, shorten the drying time, and achieve deep drying. On the whole, the hot air/microwave combined drying process of coal slime was proven to be technically feasible Suitable target moisture content for lignite industry application is generally 10%–15%, but can be even as low as 5% According to It can also be seen that the coal slime sample with a target moisture content of 15% had similar results to those when using microwave drying It is necessary to note that, according to In addition, under different target moisture content (15%, 10%, or 5%), the drying times to complete the microwave drying method were 270 To further examine the combined drying characteristics of coal slime, a coal slime sample that had been hot air dried to a moisture content of 15% was used, for microwave deep drying tests at various microwave powers (800 As can be seen from For a given mass of coal slime sample, the level of microwave power determined the magnitude of microwave radiation intensity upon per unit mass of coal slime. With the increase of microwave power, the microwave radiation intensity per unit mass of coal slime increased. Under this effect, the maximum drying rates of the sample for all the three power levels (800  Based on these results, it can be inferred that increasing the target moisture content, the energy consumption of drying declines, which is also consistent with the experimental results ( In order to investigate the effects of different microwave power levels on the energy consumption of combined drying, hot air drying is used to pre-dry the material to a moisture content of 15%, and then combined drying test is conducted at different microwave power levels (800 Despite numerous types of available dryers, literature on the design, scale up, and techno-economic aspects of wet coal drying is still sketchy and difficult to compare on a consistent basis. Some comparison of different drying methods concerning energy consumption of lignite was performed, as shown in Nevertheless, each drying technology has its own applicable conditions and the range of applications. For example, although hot air drying has a lower total energy consumption, during the late stage the energy is significantly higher, so it is generally used for pre-drying wet materials but not for deep drying. If hot air drying is used for deep drying as well, its total energy consumption is not necessarily low. While microwave drying has higher energy consumption, it can significantly enhance the drying rate, shorten the drying time, and achieve low temperature and deep drying. In addition, the characteristics of microwave heating including drying evenly, small destructivity and high product quality provides good opportunities for development for the application of drying coal slime and other fossil fuels, which will also promote the rapid development of hot air/microwave combined drying technology. The integration of two drying methods with different heating principles is bound to play their respective advantages, reduce the overall drying time, improve product quality, and reduce the total energy consumption of drying. The combined drying of coal slime by incorporating hot-air with microwave drying process was presented in this study. There are obvious decreasing-rate drying periods during the conventional hot-air drying process and the critical moisture content at different conditions was about 15% and can be used as the indication point, at which the coal slime started to convert to microwave drying. Higher microwave power and larger target moisture contents could lead to a significantly higher drying rate, shorter drying time, and hence the less energy consumption. It was confirmed that microwave drying could significantly elevate the drying rate after the coal slime reached the critical moisture contents during the hot-air drying method, which shortened the total drying time remarkably. The combined drying process was proved to be an effective method to achieve the deep drying of coal slime in terms of saving drying time. These conclusions provided significant theoretical direction for the combined drying process design of coal slime and other similar materials. This work was supported by the
