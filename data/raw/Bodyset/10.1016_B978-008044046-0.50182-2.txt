Cracks are modelled by boundary elements with quadratic and singular variation of displacement. Interpolation of geometry is Hermitian cubic along crack roots, blending to quadratic elsewhere. Singular shape functions multiply nodal values of stress intensity factors in dominant and subdominant crack opening modes. Singular and hypersingular integral equations are collocated at nodes of elements and auxiliary collocation points. Computed stress intensity factors are compared with values obtained by other methods for a plate with planar semi-elliptical surface crack, and results obtained using coarse and fine meshes are shown for mixed mode displacement of a non-planar crack.
