Ultra-fine grinding has proved to be a major attraction for industries for use in improving the quality of products. An attritor mill has a specific advantage over other conventional milling equipment, such as a fluid energy mill, due to energy saving during the comminution process. Experiments were conducted to study the performance of grinding in a laboratory attritor mill. This consists of a mild steel vessel with an interior lining of stainless steel, 4 mm thick. A stainless steel impeller of 82 mm diameter fitted with 10 mm diameter pins in pairs, at four different axial positions, is held in the central position of the mill by a sealed bearing. The shaft is belt-driven with an AC motor of 1 horsepower using a 440 V supply. The grinding of calcite is studied under wet conditions using zirconium balls. The mill feed has a very wide size distribution, with a maximum particle size of 35 Î¼m. The balls used are of two sizes, with average diameters of 3 mm and 1 mm and are added in different proportions. The aim of this study is to reduce the time of grinding and simultaneously obtain a narrow distribution. Preliminary investigation shows that a single size of large balls increases the grinding rate but reaches a constant value within a short time. Hence, there is no further decrease in the particle size of the product. The larger grinding media is then replaced by a smaller one. This decreases the product size considerably. Alternatively, grinding media consisting of a mixture of different ball sizes results in finer product size than that from single-sized grinding media. The breakage and selection functions, which are used for prediction of product-size distribution, are estimated.
