In the published paper, a general evaluation was carried out about the performance evaluation of roadheaders in metallic ore excavation by using the specific energy (SE) obtained from small-scale rock cutting tests. For a correct evaluation, the optimum SE obtained from full-scale linear rock cutting tests should be used when calculating the performance of roadheader by using Eq. (1) given in the paper. Alternatively, the optimum SE can be predicted from the equations suggested by Although Considering the above information, the optimum SE3 values were predicted from the plot (
