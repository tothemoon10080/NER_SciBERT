The peak compressive strengths at different confining pressures of cement-mixed gravel (CMG) that are very similar to those obtained by single-step loading (SL) drained triaxial compression (TC) tests using multiple specimens can be obtained by a multiple-step loading (ML) test using a single specimen. However, only the unload/reload stress–strain relations at different confining pressures (except for the primary loading pressure at the first step) can be obtained from an ML test, and the reloading relations become softer with the increases in negative irreversible axial strain increments that have taken place during the respective immediately preceding unloading regimes. This phenomenon is formulated by a unique empirical equation for the CMG tests. Undamaged reloading stress–strain curves (URCs) were inferred by removing the damage effects from measured reloading curves (MRCs) in the ML TC test based on this correlation. A method was developed within the framework of the proportional rule to infer primary loading curves (PLCs) at different confining pressures from the URCs and the PLC at the first step obtained from a given ML TC test. A procedure was formulated to modify the PLCs obtained by this procedure based on the PLCs measured at stresses exceeding the yield stress for large-scale yielding during reloading at different confining pressures in the ML test. This method was validated by comparing the PLCs obtained from the results of a pair of ML tests, increasing and decreasing the confining pressure, with those obtained from a set of SL TC tests at different confining pressures.mean particle diameter maximum particle diameter tangent Young's modulus fines content specific gravity of solid particles uniformity coefficient cement content per gravel weight scaling factor coefficient of proportionality for hysteresis stress–strain relations deviator stress (= maximum deviator stress peak strength optimum water content water content normalization factor of axial strain increment for reloading curves normalization factor of axial strain increment for primary loading curves average axial strain axial strain increment irreversible axial strain increment maximum dry density dry density vertical (axial) effective stress horizontal (lateral) effective stress cyclic loading cement-mixed gravel local deformation transducer multiple-step loading measured reloading stress–strain curve primary loading stress–strain curve reloading single-step loading triaxial compression undamaged reloading stress–strain curve The use of cement-mixed soil, produced by mixing soil with a relatively small amount of cement powder and a proper quantity of water, is now one of the most popular ground-improvement technologies. Compacted cement-mixed soil is often used to construct critical permanent soil structures by allowing very small deformation at the working loads. A number of related researches have been performed (e.g., Various factors, including the ageing effects at a shear stress on the subsequent stress–strain behavior and peak strength and the viscous effects on the stress–strain behavior, were studied by     It is very convenient if a set of stress–strain curves during primary loading at different The test material and the test method are described only briefly below, as detailed descriptions can be found in Particles larger than 10 To minimize the effects of non-uniform deformation and the associated non-uniform stress distribution within the specimen, due to irregular contact and high friction, the top and the bottom of the specimen set in a triaxial cell were made smooth by pasting a thin layer of gypsum slurry on them and by lubricating them by the smearing of a thin layer of silicon grease. The specimen was isotropically consolidated at Series 1: Series 2: Two 2(a): An ML test with full unloading of the deviator stress, 2(b): An ML test with full unloading of In these two ML tests, drained TC loading at respective steps was stopped and reversed so that the total axial strain that would have taken place by the end of the final TC loading remained smaller than the measurable range of the axial LDTs (about 2.5%). Details of the test method and the test results are reported in Series 3: Cyclic loading to evaluate the cyclic loading effects on the stress–strain behavior during and after cyclic loading. Multiple unload/reload cycles, in which unloading was started from the same stress state followed by full reloading, were repeatedly applied increasing the deviator stress amplitude during otherwise continuous loading at a fixed     The tangent modulus at the same shear stress level during reloading decreases with an increase in the unloading increment not only by the damage effects that have taken place during the immediately preceding unloading stage, but also by the hysteresis effects (controlled by the amount of decrease in stress). To extract the damage effects, the hysteresis effects are removed from the test results based on the proportional rule, which is often employed to describe the hysteretic stress–strain ( According to this rule, when any of the cyclic strain-hardening effects, viscous effects or damage effects due to the large unloading are not included, the reloading stress–strain relation from a given stress–strain state ( If a pair of   Based on the fact that the relation presented in Parameters Function The reloading curve for the value of A is obtained by substituting When applying this method to other cases, it is recommended that the validity of Eq.

This trend was expressed by an empirical equation to infer the undamaged reloading stress–strain relations from a given reloading relation.
