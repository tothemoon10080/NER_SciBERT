A new route for the synthesis of WC–Al2O3 composite free from unwanted W2C phase through mechano-chemical treatment of WO3–xAl–y(4−1.5x)C mixture has been investigated. It has been concluded that by substitution of 10mol% of 2mol Al (x
                     =1.8) with equivalent stoichiometric amount of C together with 20mol% excess carbon addition (y
                     =1.2), i.e., using a WO3:1.8Al:1.56C initial mixture, W2C free WC–Al2O3 composite can be successfully obtained by about 6h milling. Crystallite size and lattice strain of the WC–Al2O3 composite synthesized in the present study as well as those obtained by the previous successful routes have been reported. The results revealed that a powder whose synthesis route involves lower adiabatic temperature as well as longer milling time would have a smaller crystallite size and higher lattice strain. Furthermore, TEM observations showed that all synthesized powders contain the agglomerates which consist of nano-size particles.Superior properties of tungsten carbide (WC) including high hardness and fracture toughness as well as good thermal stability, enables the engineers to use this compound and/or its composites in a wide range of applications such as cutting tools, die materials and wear resistant parts Mechano-chemical synthesis involves the milling of reactants powders by help of the high energy mills. Intensive milling of the reactants increases the internal defects of crystallites which in turn increases the rate of chemical reactions; so that the process occurs at much lower temperatures. Mechano-chemical synthesis has attracted the attention of many researchers due to its low cost and simplicity as well as its ability to produce nano-size products The process of mechano-chemical synthesis of tungsten carbide and/or its composite powders which have been reported by various researchers can be categorized in the following classes: Milling of initial mixture consisting of W and C reactants. In this route formation of WC takes place gradually Milling of tungsten ore or tungsten trioxide with carbon which results in a significant decrease of temperature of the subsequent thermal process Milling of tungsten oxide with carbon together with a reducing agent, such as Mg Reaction mechanism leading to the formation of WC–Al To prevent the formation of undesirable W Route 1: distinction between highly exothermic aluminothermic reduction reaction of WO Route 2: addition of reducing agent (Al) in some equal portions to the WO Route 3: Addition of excess carbon to the initial WO Another possible route, reported in our previous paper Our previous investigations On the basis of these findings, a new research program aimed at developing another new route for the fabrication of a W Detailed information regarding the experimental procedure of previously studied routes has been reported elsewhere In the present research work, various WO Starting materials were: WO Probable evolution of CO/CO Williamson–Hall method Size and distribution of particles were observed by means of a transmission electron microscope (TEM). For this purpose, the powder was dispersed in ethanol (Wako 050-00446) and mounted on a copper grid. A summary of some different routes which have been examined for the production of W Detailed explanation has been reported in our previous publications No additional carbon ( Evolution of CO gas during milling (see It seems that at high temperatures obtained as a result of released heat of reaction Another possible solution to the W 20% additional carbon (  Higher C amounts would decrease the system maximum temperature due to its ability of the absorption of some of the heat released by aluminothermic reduction reaction Reaction system will not be encountered with carbon insufficiency with higher carbon amounts in the initial mixture. As A comparison between excess amount of C which has been added to the initial mixtures for avoiding W 40% additional carbon ( It has been proved that the crystallite size as well as the lattice strain of any particular powder would affect its behavior during the subsequent treatment and could bring about some unexpected consequences It has been shown that in various materials synthesis methods, higher synthesis temperature results in a larger particle/crystallite size as well as lower lattice strain It has been shown that milling time is a key parameter in mechano-chemical synthesis processes and increasing the milling time would yield a smaller particle/crystallite size as well as higher lattice strain  Attempts have been made in a series of research works to determine the initial composition and conduct the milling process in such a way that the intensity of heat generation and consequently the adiabatic temperature becomes under control so that the formation of unpleasant W Various WO The type of reaction in all studied mixtures ( For the mixtures consisting of 1.3 and 1.56 A W For WO Comparison of the crystallite size and lattice strain of the WC–Al
