Gadolinium oxide, cerium oxide, and 10 mol% gadolinia doped ceria ceramic powders have been synthesized using combustion technique. Though the cubic gadolinia phase is stable at room temperature, single phase monoclinic gadolinia was obtained as a result of combustion synthesis using fuel lean and stoichiometric precursor compositions. This powder was subjected to calcination treatment and ceria doping to study the stability of phases and the rate of phase transformation from monoclinic to cubic gadolinia. It was found that monoclinic gadolinia transforms to cubic gadolinia upon calcination at temperatures less than 1200oC. It was also found that rate of phase transformation is more for powder produced using fuel lean compositions; and the rate is enhanced upon ceria doping.
