Comminution indices are used to represent the grindability of a combination of minerals treated by specific processes. If two rock samples with similar values for an index are treated in the same comminution process, they are expected to have a similar behavior during grinding. However, indices are obtained assuming the breakage of homogeneous and continuous materials without considering minor scale mineral and geological textural characteristics. Eventual differences in the process could be related to those properties and may not be explained by comminution indices by itself. In the present study, two different copper ores samples with similar Bond Work index were used to evaluate the influence of mineralogy and geological texture at meso and micro scale in a ball grinding process at laboratory scale. Samples were characterized through geological texture analysis at micro-scale using petrographic microscopy, hyperspectral characterization, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence. The effect of mineral properties on grinding was assessed through controlled grinding kinetics performed in a Magotteaux Mill®. Results show that the BWi allows to describe the transition between initial and final states at long grinding times, but it cannot reproduce the entire grinding kinetic, while textural properties, such as grain size and matrix-grain mineralogical composition, may be linked to P80 variation over time and the variation of cumulative particle size distributions at different grinding times. Results suggest that geological texture may be considered as a complement to traditional grindability indices to evaluate the grinding performance.Comminution theory has long been focused on the relationship between applied energy and the particle size obtained from a given initial feed size (Eq.        Among the BWi applications, there is the possibility to compare the industrial performance with the theoretical specific energy consumption, in order to evaluate the grinding circuit and to obtain its efficiency. If the circuit is efficient, the operational BWi (OWi) should remain relatively constant and near to the laboratory BWi. Differences between BWi and OWi could be related to the circuit efficiency and the resistance to breakage of the rock. Under this premise, different ore samples with similar grindability should have a similar behavior during the grinding process if the circuit is efficient, but differences in the product particle size or the specific energy consumption could not be explained directly from the BWi under mentioned conditions (  The differences observed during the analysis of grinding circuits using the BWi and its operational value can be related to the nature of Bond’s theory, which assumes that the material is homogenous and constant. Using this theoretical BWi, just a specific and known mineral association could be well described for a specific value of grindability and the subsequent plant design, plant operation or circuit optimization. Traditional practices in the mining industry are based in grouping certain sectors from a deposit using geological or geometallurgical parameters at meso or macro scale, defining units or domains, which usually do not consider micro-scale properties of rocks. Due to geological nature, it is possible to find these variations may trigger many structural, mineralogical or geometallurgical variations at a minor scale between samples obtained from the same unit and differences in mineral processing. In other words, a domain may not correctly reflect attributes that could drive processing performance and large deposit sectors may be classified as equals, even having minor but relevant differences ( Related to grindability parameters, it has been demonstrated that in different size ranges, variables such as particle size, particle size distribution, and rocks structures can modify the comminution processes as they may imply changes in the rock strength ( Many authors ( It is widely recognized that geological texture may be a crucial property in geometallurgy ( Traditionally, in process mineralogy, the texture is defined by particle sizes and spatial distribution of grains, and it is used as a parameter to set a certain number of textural classes. To define textural classes, different properties can be considered, such as the abundance of mineral, ore/mineral deportment, the shape of mineral, mode of occurrence of the mineral of interest or mineral associations ( The aim of the current study is verifying whether the texture at meso and micro scale has an effect in the grinding process that cannot be described by a comminution index, exploring different types of fragmentation and analyzing from the perspective of single and multi-fractal breakage. Indeed, a relationship between a power law distribution and a fractal distribution may be found. The definition of a fractal may be obtained from the relationship between number and size of objects. If the number of objects (    On the other side, for fragmentation one of the most used way to represent the size-frequency distribution of fragments is the exponential dependence (Eq.        This study hypothesizes that geological texture at different scales can affect the grinding performance of different mineral samples, in a way that is not possible to infer this effect using standard comminution indices such as the Bond Work index. For this, two different ore deposits from Chile denominated “A” and “B”, were selected and sampled for geological and geometallurgical characterization. Both ores sources were chosen considering their similar geological context and presumably similar mineralogical composition (in order to be as similar as possible in terms of theirs grindabilities expressed by the BWi) but expecting them to have different textural properties at micro-scale, as different genetic processes formed them. The deposit “A” corresponds to a copper porphyry, where the ore mineralization is given mainly by copper and molybdenum sulfide minerals. The ore mineralization occurs in “A” forming a stockwork and also disseminated in the host rock ( For each type of sample, quantitative mineralogy was determined using a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hyperspectral characterization. It has been demonstrated that the combined use of these techniques gives accurate quantitative mineralogical results ( The qualitative information obtained with the Hylogger3™ was used to perform Rietveld Refinement Method ( Since there is not a standard definition of texture for process mineralogy, an exhaustive textural analysis was performed at meso and micro scale to define textural classes for each deposit. Hand specimen samples were selected for visual description, and polished and thin sections were prepared for petrographic microscopy studies (both transmitted and reflected light analysis were performed, to describe the texture of non-sulfide and sulfide minerals). This analysis was also used to verify the mineralogy obtained by applying the Rietveld refinement to the XRD data. The properties considered to define textural classes were the following: protolith, primary texture, secondary textures, main structures, mineral associations, predominant alteration, style of alteration, mode of occurrence of sulfide minerals, grain size, and grains shapes. Finally, to evaluate the influence of geological texture in grinding processes and to compare it with the BWi, grinding kinetics were performed in the Magotteaux Mill® (    Each diffractogram was obtained analyzing the range 5°-85° at a rate of 1° per minute. Rietveld refinement was applied to obtain quantitative mineralogy using hyperspectral results (qualitative mineralogical results) as high-quality reference information for non-sulfide gangue minerals. Sulfide phases were selected using microscopic textural analysis and visual inspection of hand rock samples through the application of sulfide minerals diagnostic properties ( Many Rietveld refinement stages were applied consecutively adding a new phase in each repetition, until reaching acceptable values for the following statistical parameters: least-square residual (R The textural analysis was performed at meso and micro scale aiming to obtain as much textural information as possible, in order to clearly show the differences between both ores. Below, an exhaustive textural description is presented including the most typical used properties (e.g., grain size) and others that have not been widely used in geometallurgy (e.g., style of alteration). In this case, it must be remembered that samples were formed by different genetic processes (porphyry copper versus local hydrothermal veins), so it was expected to find differences in the textural observations.  Deposit “A” A hand specimen from deposit “A” is shown in Deposit “B”   Deposit “A”  From transparent sections, three kinds of veinlets were recognized. The first identified group were veinlets filled by quartz ( From observation of polished sections with reflected light, it was possible to recognize that opaque minerals are mainly pyrite and chalcopyrite ( As additional information, some accessory minerals were recognized. The most important were anhydrite ( Deposit “B”  Scarce veinlets were recognized in these samples, and opaque minerals filled all of them. In general, veinlets are discontinuous and with not well-defined edges ( In reference to opaque minerals occurrence, from the observed polished section through reflected light, it was possible to identify a high presence of crystals of bornite and chalcopyrite and a lower abundance of covellite and chalcocite. All these crystals are disseminated or filling veinlets, as mentioned before (  Using the grinding kinetic results, the P The passing fraction under the average feed grain size was also calculated and plotted, using the grain size obtained from the textural analysis (0.05 mm for mineral “A” and 0.25 mm for mineral “B”) ( The results presented in According to the results, for all grinding times, the coarse fraction of samples from deposit “B” grind faster than the coarse fraction of samples from deposit “A”, while the fine fraction of samples from deposit “A” grind faster than the fine fraction of samples from deposit “B” (as shown in Considering results of mineralogical quantification and textural description, samples from deposit “A” are richer in phyllosilicates and clay minerals, in comparison to samples from deposit “B”. Phyllosilicates have a smaller particle size, and they are malleable, having the capacity to absorb high quantities of energy before breaking. Some authors ( Another aspect associated with phyllosilicates is the effect on grinding indices. In this particular case, the Bond Ball test was carried out using a cutting mesh of 150 μm, which is smaller than the phyllosilicates particle size in the samples, using Regarding the presence of microstructures in samples from deposit “A”, in this case, contrary to what was expected, at micro-scale the microstructures like fine veins filled by quartz, gypsum, and phyllosilicates, do not contribute to obtaining a high quantity of fine particle sizes. Indeed, for all grinding times, the P Results in Considering the results presented in Grinding kinetic for deposit “A” is related to the fragmentation of homogeneous and fine grains. On the other hand, grinding kinetic for deposit “B” is firstly related to the liberation and fragmentation of large size rock fragments (at micro-scale), generating cracks and fissures and reducing the P According to the results, it is possible to observe that grinding kinetics are not well described by the BWi, at least for short grinding times. However, the high similitude in the grindability of samples from both deposits may be observed in the P It is observed that by applying some calculation procedures, the BWi can be linked to a specific point of the entire kinetic curve, but it is not possible to use the grindability to describe the whole grinding kinetic in these cases. In this sense, geological texture at micro-scale may give additional information that could help to explain some of the observed differences, as the P The results shown in    Some authors ( The current results suggest that geological texture at micro-scale may be an appropriate characteristic to be considered. This to explain changes during intermediate stages of grinding processes and that textural properties may be linked to different behaviors shown by samples that, a priori, could not have been expected to show such a difference. The effect of the geological texture on the grinding performance of two minerals with similar grindability (Bond work index) was evaluated through experimental and well-controlled laboratory grinding tests. According to the results, both the P The results showed that two samples with similar BWi reach similar grinding products after long grinding times, so the Bond Work index would be able to explain the change between an initial and a final state of the process, giving account of the total energy involved in such change, in a thermodynamic-like approach. However, it is not possible to reproduce the entire grinding kinetic (stage by stage) from a grindability index value by itself. Using the geological texture as a complementary parameter to be evaluated when describing mineral grindability, may be useful to explain behaviors at short and medium grinding times. The results obtained in this work suggest that the geological texture may give relevant information about the grinding behavior of a sample, which may be used as a complement of the grindability index to help to describe the whole grinding kinetic curve.
