Across the world, a course on state-space methods in control relies heavily on linear algebra, and teaches how to apply the idea of change of basis, but looking at the Indian context we believe that the treatment itself needs a change of basis and hence a fresher approach has been developed and successfully tested over the past five years at the National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli in the department of Instrumentation & Control Engineering for the undergraduate students in their sixth semester. This paper presents certain key ideas of the on-going practice.
