Chalcopyrite, conditioned with sodium dicresyl dithiophosphate (DTP), was floated under standard and well-defined hydrodynamic conditions. The advancing contact angle values of the flotation feed and products were measured and the flotation response benchmarked against a calibration previously established for the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate (KAX) system. Furthermore, the flotation response of pyrite, separately conditioned with KAX and DTP, was also evaluated under the same hydrodynamic conditions. When the advancing contact angle of chalcopyrite conditioned with DTP was the same (within 5°) as that of chalcopyrite conditioned with KAX, the flotation response was, within experimental error, the same. For both chalcopyrite and pyrite, heterogeneity of the advancing contact angle within the feed size fractions was demonstrated by significant differences in contact angle values measured on the flotation concentrate and tailings size fractions. The mean contact angle of the chalcopyrite and pyrite particles remained constant, within experimental error, through both flotation and sample preparation under the test conditions. The flotation response of chalcopyrite at 2% solids (w/w) was the same, within experimental error, as that at 30% solids (w/w) in the presence of silicate gangue, suggesting non-interaction of this gangue mineral with chalcopyrite under the test conditions. The operational advancing contact angles inferred for pyrite using the calibration established for the chalcopyrite-KAX system were, however, lower than the measured feed advancing contact angles, while the maximum recovery of pyrite was also lower than for chalcopyrite for the same feed advancing contact angle values, in the contact angle range less than 80°. The difference in flotation response between these two minerals for the same feed contact angle values was interpreted in terms of a difference in critical contact angle value for stable bubble–particle attachment. The critical advancing contact angle values for the pyrite size fractions were higher than values for chalcopyrite for size fractions above 20μm. This difference in critical advancing contact angle was attributed to the difference in mineral specific gravity between chalcopyrite and pyrite.The key steps in the collection of particles by bubbles in the pulp involve bubble–particle collision, attachment, and detachment ( Hydrodynamic interactions are dominant in the collision efficiency while interfacial forces (e.g., particle hydrophobicity) play a major role in the attachment efficiency. The stability of the bubble–particle aggregate, a function of both hydrodynamics and interfacial forces against disruptive forces in the pulp, determines the stability efficiency ( Mineral surfaces are chemically heterogeneous so that the overall hydrophobicity and flotation response is controlled by the abundance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface patches ( The mean advancing contact angle of a chemically heterogeneous, but smooth, surface may be approximated by the Cassie equation ( When a particle collides with a bubble in the pulp zone, the liquid separating the two must be displaced if attachment is to occur. The induction time is the minimum time necessary for the attachment of an air bubble to the mineral surface ( In a previous paper ( In this paper, the validity of the calibration curves is evaluated using chalcopyrite conditioned with a different collector (i.e., potassium amyl xanthate, KAX) at 2% and 30% solids (w/w), and also pyrite conditioned separately with KAX and DTP. The evaluation is carried out by benchmarking the flotation responses of chalcopyrite-DTP, pyrite-KAX, and pyrite-DTP systems against the chalcopyrite-KAX calibration. The 30% solids pulp density is a typical plant pulp content and was used as a first step to establishing whether the calibration curves may be used to benchmark the flotation response of particles in a natural ore. The specific task of benchmarking a natural ore against the calibration is tackled in a separate paper ( Two sulphide minerals were used in this work, chalcopyrite and pyrite, which have densities of 4.2 and 5.0 The maximum size of the ground product targeted was 420 In the case of pyrite, no cleaning pre-flotation stage was required, so the ground sample was wet sieved to separate the −20, 20–38, and 38–53 The first stage in the preparation of a flotation feed sample was the manipulation of the feed advancing contact angle and its measurement on each size fraction independently. Freshly prepared size fractions of chalcopyrite were hydrophobic and needed to be oxidised to decrease the advancing contact angle to lower values that could eventually be increased to desired values by collector addition. Selected size fractions were thermally oxidised at 150 In the case of pyrite, each size fraction was activated separately in the presence of 500 The method chosen for the measurement of advancing contact angle on the powdered sample was the Washburn technique ( In this current paper, the advancing contact angles of both the flotation feed and product size fractions were separately measured. Chalcopyrite and pyrite size fractions were conditioned with collector as explained previously to different advancing contact angles and floated at 2% solids (w/w), according to the procedure described further below. Flotation products were collected separately into three samples to measure the advancing contact angle: the first concentrate (collected in the first minute), the second concentrate (combined concentrates from 1–8 The Washburn technique was the principal method used in the measurement of advancing contact angles in this work. However, there was a need to compare the advancing and receding contact angles of chalcopyrite and pyrite at high and low advancing contact angle regimes. This determination provides information on the contact angle hysteresis for the two minerals. Both advancing and receding contact angle measurements were carried out using the Equilibrium Capillary Pressure (ECP) technique. Details of the method are given elsewhere ( In the case of pyrite, the 75–105 After the measurement of advancing contact angles on all feed size fractions, a flotation feed sample (100 Each test condition was repeated at least twice, and the corresponding concentrates at each time interval were combined for particle sizing. The conditioning time at pH 10 was 1 Chalcopyrite size fractions were conditioned individually with DTP at pH10 (Tests 3 and 4 in The frother used was MIBC (Methyl Iso-Butyl Carbinol) at 38 The bubble size in flotation was measured using the photographic method ( Particles are recovered via two primary mechanisms (1) by true flotation in which hydrophobic particles are recovered by attachment to air bubbles and (2) by entrainment, which involves the non-selective recovery of particles in water recovered to the concentrate irrespective of whether they are hydrophobic or hydrophilic ( Recovery by entrainment in a single batch flotation test was estimated using the method by For each particle size fraction, the rate of particle recovery, after subtraction of entrainment, was calculated assuming a single floatable component and a non-floating component. The size-by-size recovery data, after subtraction of entrainment, was fitted to the first-order rate equation: The collection efficiency, The bubble surface area flux is a measure of the bubble surface area rising up through the cell per unit cross-sectional area and is given by ( In previous work, flotation characterisation of the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system resulted in the development of calibration curves of the undistributed rate constant and collection efficiency versus particle size fraction for different advancing contact angle ranges ( In this section, the flotation response of the chalcopyrite-DTP system is compared with the calibration curves developed previously ( The approach adopted in this study is to assume two floatability components in the feed for each size fraction, a floating, and a non-floating component. The advancing contact angles of flotation products were measured to ascertain the basis of the separation and establish if there was conservation of advancing contact angle values. Results of the advancing contact angle measurements carried out on the original feed and the flotation products demonstrate that the advancing contact angle of particles in the feed remains largely unchanged during both flotation and sample preparation under the experimental conditions ( Furthermore, the concentrates collected in the first minute (first concentrate) have consistently higher advancing contact angle values than the second concentrate. The tailing, which is solely the non-floating component ( Differences in contact angle of particles separated by flotation have been demonstrated for the first time in this study, and it is anticipated that future studies relating particle size, flotation rate constants, and contact angle may lead to the determination of contact angle distribution within a given size fraction depending on flotation behaviour. This may represent a leap forward in the development of diagnostic tools for process control in mineral processing. The undistributed rate constant for each size fraction in Tests 1 and 2 ( The measured feed and inferred operational advancing contact angles, based on the undistributed rate constant, are in good agreement for both the low and high advancing contact angle regimes, with The critical advancing contact angle values by size fraction determined for the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system ( For the high advancing contact angle regime (20 It appears that the critical advancing contact angles calculated using the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system ( Flotation of ores is normally carried out at higher pulp density than that used in the study of the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate ( Changes in pulp density may affect bubble size ( The Sauter mean bubble diameter was determined to be 0.57 An inferred operational advancing contact angle was then calculated for each size fraction in Tests 3 and 4. The results show that, within the experimental error of flotation, there is very good agreement between the measured feed and inferred operational advancing contact angles ( The calibration curves developed previously on the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system ( Apparently, only low advancing contact angle values could be obtained with the pyrite-DTP system, which would be a result of differences in the adsorption mechanism between copper sulphide and pyrite when conditioned with DTP ( The advancing contact angle values of the flotation products were measured, and, as observed in the case of the chalcopyrite-DTP system, the first concentrate was more hydrophobic than the second concentrate. The tailing, which is dominated by the non-floatable component, had lower advancing contact angles than either concentrates. Differences in advancing contact angles of the flotation products demonstrate conclusively that there is distribution of advancing contact angles within each size fraction of the feed, as observed in the case of the chalcopyrite-DTP system. Advancing contact angle heterogeneity may therefore be a characteristic of all mineral ensembles such that when an advancing contact angle is measured on a bed of particles, it is actually the surface area weighted mean of a statistical distribution. There appears to be a difference in the recovery–time profile for pyrite as compared to chalcopyrite. The recovery–time curve plateaus at shorter flotation times for chalcopyrite ( Comparison was also made between the maximum recovery of chalcopyrite and pyrite for each size fraction exhibiting the same contact angle. The maximum recovery of chalcopyrite for each size fraction and feed contact angle measured on pyrite ( The inference of an operational advancing contact angle based on the undistributed rate constant may provide further insight into the flotation behaviour of pyrite compared to chalcopyrite. Empirical equations (Eq. Lower inferred operational advancing contact angle implies that the calibration curves generated with the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system ( It was decided to compare the wetting and dewetting behaviour of chalcopyrite and pyrite size fractions exhibiting the same advancing contact angle, within experimental error, of the Washburn technique (± Copper activated pyrite conditioned with DTP did not achieve high advancing contact angles. The maximum advancing contact angles achieved were in the low to medium range (50–60°). The measured feed and inferred operational advancing contact angles show scatter, especially in the intermediate size range ( From the literature ( Pyrite flotation behaviour was compared to that of chalcopyrite assuming a gamma statistical distribution of contact angle within a size fraction and fitting the pyrite flotation data using the same parameters determined previously (i.e., assumption 1). For the feed mean advancing contact angles shown in When assumption 1 was applied, the model fit to the pyrite flotation data overestimated the maximum recovery for the mean contact angles measured using the Washburn method ( The possibility of similar advancing contact angle distributions in the feed for chalcopyrite and pyrite size fractions was evaluated by comparing the cumulative masses of tail, second and first concentrates ( Fitting to the pyrite flotation data under assumption 2 was attempted by allowing the critical contact angle to vary to obtain the best fit. A least squares method that minimised the difference between the model and experimental These results appear to support the assumption that the advancing contact angles are statistically distributed around the measured mean contact angle in the feed in the same way for both pyrite and chalcopyrite and that the pyrite size fractions generally have a higher critical advancing contact angles than chalcopyrite. Thus, the lower recovery of pyrite compared with chalcopyrite, for the same feed advancing contact angle ( A higher advancing contact angle is required to recover pyrite particles in flotation at the same rate as chalcopyrite particles within the same size fraction. The critical advancing contact angles for pyrite and chalcopyrite particles have been de For the −20 Changes in the hydrodynamic conditions may give different critical contact angle values. If these results reflect the general behaviour of mineral particles, then it should be possible to determine the maximum recovery of any fully liberated mineral in a specific size fraction when the feed mean contact angle and critical advancing contact angle values are known and assuming the same statistical distribution of contact angle values as for the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system. The methodology needs to be tested against a natural ore, a difficult task tackled in another publication ( Chalcopyrite particles exhibiting the same mean advancing contact angle in the feed (within experimental error of the Washburn technique), but with different functional groups on their surfaces (i.e., amyl xanthate and dicresyl dithiophosphate) are recovered with a similar undistributed rate constant (within experimental error). This finding further validates the calibration developed using the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system and extends its application to a different collector on chalcopyrite. The conservation of the advancing contact angle through flotation and sample preparation for a given size fraction, for both chalcopyrite and pyrite, was demonstrated by the very close agreement between the measured and recalculated feed contact angle values under the conditions of this study. The heterogeneity of contact angles in each feed size fraction, for both chalcopyrite and pyrite, was confirmed by measurements of contact angle on the flotation products. The concentrate contact angles values were always higher than the tailings contact angle values, which, in turn, were always at, or lower, than the critical contact angle that is specific for each mineral. Under the conditions of the present study, the flotation response of chalcopyrite particles at pulp densities of 2% and 30% solids, with quartz as non-interacting gangue, was the same within experimental error. This finding may allow benchmarking of chalcopyrite flotation behaviour from an ore against the calibration developed for the chalcopyrite-amyl xanthate system. The undistributed rate constants of pyrite were lower than for chalcopyrite exhibiting the same feed advancing contact angle, within experimental error, while the maximum recovery of pyrite was also lower for the same feed advancing contact angle, in the range less than 80°. This difference was attributed to differences in the critical advancing contact angle for pyrite and chalcopyrite due to differences in mineral specific gravity. The same statistical function may be applied to both pyrite and chalcopyrite flotation data to determine the distribution of contact angle values given a mean contact angle measured in the feed. It may be possible to predict the maximum recovery of a liberated mineral as a function of size fraction when the feed contact angle is known or, conversely, to infer an operational contact angle based on particle size, flotation rate constant, and critical contact angle of a mineral under the specific test conditions used in this study.
