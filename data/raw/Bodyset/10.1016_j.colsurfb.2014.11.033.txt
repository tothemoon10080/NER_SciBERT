Herein, poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) surfaces were treated to form various roughness values (R

                     =290–445nm) and polar functional groups on the surfaces using a plasma-etching process, followed by immersion into simulated body fluid (SBF) for apatite formation. The surface morphology, chemical composition, and mean roughness of the plasma-etched PCL surfaces were measured, and various physical and morphological properties (water contact angles, protein absorption ability, and crystallite size of the apatite layer) of the in vitro mineralized PCL surfaces were evaluated. The roughened PCL surface P-3, which was treated with a sufficient plasma exposure time (4h), achieved homogeneously distributed apatite formation after soaking in SBF for 7 days, as compared with other surfaces that were untreated or plasma-treated for 30min or 2h. Furthermore, to demonstrate their feasibility as a biomimetic surface, pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) were cultured on the mineralized PCL surfaces, and cell viability, DAPI-phalloidin fluorescence assay, and alizarin red-staining of the P-3 surface were highly improved compared to the P-1 surface treated with a 30-min plasma exposure time; compared to untreated mineralized PCL surface (N-P), P-3 showed even greater improvements in cell viability and DAPI-phalloidin fluorescence assay. Based on these results, we found that the mineralized PCL surface supplemented with the appropriate plasma treatment can be implicitly helpful to achieve rapid hard tissue regeneration.In general, characteristics of biomedical scaffolds have been controlled with various surface treatments An aliphatic biodegradable polymer, poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL), has been used widely as a synthetic tissue regenerative material because of its minimal toxicity, low immune reactivity, good mechanical and physical properties, and ability to form desirable 3D shapes An Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified 3D PCL scaffold has been suggested to show bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC In this report, we suggest another surface modification of PCL, which can be applied in hard tissue regeneration. A plasma-etching process is used to obtain submicron-scale roughness, followed by immersion in SBF, which has a composition similar to that of human blood plasma and is a biomimetic process that generates an apatite layer on a substrate Recently, we proposed electrospun PCL micro/nanofibers and rapid-prototyped PCL scaffolds, which were treated with oxygen plasma, for the effective control of surface roughness In the current study, we designed a new bioactive surface with which to assess various highly roughened PCL surfaces. We used a plasma-etching process to obtain submicron-sized roughness ranging from 293 to 445 PCL film (density: 1.135 To obtain various roughened surfaces, PCL film was subjected to oxygen-plasma treatment using LF (low frequency) plasma (CUTE-MP/R; Femto-Science, Inc., Korea). A low frequency of 50 The plasma-etched and non-etched PCL surfaces were immersed in 1× SBF composed of NaCl (7.995 The morphology of the plasma-treated and mineralized surfaces was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (SNE-3000M; SEC Inc., Suwon, South Korea). To assess calcium and phosphorus on the mineralized PCL surface, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carried out. A surface roughness tester using phase-shifting interferometry (Nanoview-m4151p, South Korea) was used to measure the average surface roughness value ( A 10-μl water droplet was placed on the surface, and the water contact angles (WCAs) were measured by the sessile drop method at room temperature and 32% relative humidity. The mean value of at least five individual measurements was calculated. To measure the crystallite size of the The chemical bonding states and atomic concentrations on the surfaces were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCA2000; VG Microtech, Uckfield, UK) using a hemispherical electrostatic energy analyzer and Al K Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry (model 6700; Nicolet, West Point, PA, USA) was used to analyze the apatite layer on the mineralized surfaces. IR spectra represent the mean of 30 scans at 600–4000 Mineralized PCL surfaces for cell culture measuring 5 After 7 days of cell culture, the surfaces were subjected to DAPI fluorescent staining to characterize cell nuclei, and phalloidin was used to visualize the actin cytoskeletons. The cell nuclei density and area fraction were calculated from the fluorescence images of the surfaces using ImageJ software. The proliferation of viable cells was determined by MTT assay (Cell Proliferation Kit I; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). This assay is based on cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt, MTT, to produce purple formazan crystals by mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. Cells on the surface were incubated with 0.5 Calcium mineralization was determined by Alizarin red-S staining in 24-well plates. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-MEM (Life Sciences, USA) containing 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA, USA), 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (Cellgro, Herndon, VA, USA), 50 Total protein content was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce kit; Thermo Scientific). The cell/surface was washed with PBS and lysed with 1 All data are presented as means We applied two processes to generate mineralized PCL surfaces: plasma treatment and To quantitatively evaluate the size of the roughened surfaces, surface roughness ( According to Yang and Wolke, the level of calcium (Ca To generate an apatite layer on the plasma-etched PCL surfaces, EDS analysis of the mineralized surfaces in SBF after 7 days demonstrated the presence of Ca, P, and O, which is consistent with the growth of a calcium phosphate layer on the surfaces, as shown in The mineralized surfaces were evaluated by FT-IR analysis. The IR spectra of the surfaces before and after mineralization are presented in To assess the size of the crystallites on the apatite layer, XRD analyses of the mineralized surfaces before and after The water contact angle is a good indicator of the hydrophilic property of a biomaterial, which can affect initial cell adhesion and growth. The measured contact angles of mN-P, mP-1, mP-2, and mP-3 were 73 Fluorescence images of pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) after 7 days of culture on the mN-P, mP-1, mP-2, and mP-3 surfaces are presented in To assess cell proliferation quantitatively, the numbers of nuclei in the same area, which were shown in the fluorescence images, were evaluated ( The proliferation of cells cultured on the Generally, calcium deposition is analyzed qualitatively using the alizarin red staining method. The optical density (OD) of calcium deposition on the surfaces (mN-P, mP-1, mP-2, and mP-3) after 7 and 14 days, as determined by alizarin red staining, are shown in In this study, a new mineralized PCL/apatite surface was fabricated using a combination of plasma etching and This research was financially supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the
