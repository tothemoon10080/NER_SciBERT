The wear and friction properties of aluminum matrix alloy and silicon carbide based aluminum metal matrix composites under dry condition at different sliding distance (i.e. 1979.20 m and 2262 m) with loads varies between 10 N- 30 N have been studied by using pin on disc wear measuring machine (Make: DUCOM, Bangalore). All experiments were performed at room temperature and results revealed that silicon carbide based aluminum metal matrix composites and aluminum matrix alloys possesses better properties at low sliding distance and at lower load also. Although silicon carbide based aluminum metal matrix composites shows better properties compared with aluminum matrix alloy at lower as well as at increased sliding distance under dry condition. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) of worn surfaces for both silicon carbide aluminum metal matrix composites and aluminum matrix alloys have also been done.
