Forearm instability results from trauma, which disrupts the radial head, the interosseous membrane, and the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Inadequate treatment of injuries to these forearm stabilizers may result in the complex problem of chronic longitudinal forearm instability. Delayed recognition and/or treatment of injuries producing forearm dissociation has led to poor patient outcomes, which makes timely recognition of the injury pattern imperative. This article discusses relevant aspects of forearm anatomy and current concepts in the diagnosis and treatment options for this complex injury pattern.
