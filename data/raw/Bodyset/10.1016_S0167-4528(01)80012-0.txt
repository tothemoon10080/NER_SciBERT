The value of coal for utilization is determined by coal rank, impurities (moisture, ash, sulfur, and some trace elements), and particle size. Coals fall into three groups: thermal (steam), metallurgical (coking), and conversion coals. The thermal coals are used as fuel either for direct heating or for the production of hot water and steam for power generation. The metallurgical coals are utilized as a raw material to make coke needed in blast-furnace operations and foundries. The term “coking” refers to a carbonization process where a bituminous coal is heated to drive off the volatile matter and leave a porous solid residue with significantly higher carbon content. Conversion coals are used as feedstock in the production of gaseous and/or liquid fuels derived from coal. Presently, this form of utilization represents jointly a small proportion of total coal utilization. Spontaneous combustion results from self-heating of coal, the surface phenomenon that depends on coal surface properties and coal particle size.
