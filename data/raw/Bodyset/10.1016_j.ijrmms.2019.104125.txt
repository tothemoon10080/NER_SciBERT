Beishan area is now considered as a potential site of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository. In order to understand the mechanical behavior of Beishan granite, conventional triaxial compression (CTC) and hydro-mechanical (HM) coupling tests are conducted on Beishan granite. An acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system is employed to estimate the rock damage evolution during the tests. The testing results show that the compressibility of the rock specimens increases and expansibility decreases with increasing confining pressure under CTC tests, resulting in failure pattern transforms from splitting failure to shearing failure. Under HM coupling, the compressibility decreases and expansibility increases with increasing pore pressure, and the micro cracks can keep relatively equilibrium state due to the existence of fluid. Based on AE hit counts, the crack closure stress

                      is reached. The fluctuation intensities of AE amplitude and frequency centroid (FC) increase during the loading process. The amplitude fluctuation range increases and FC decreases after peak during CTC tests. However, the amplitude fluctuation range reaches its maximum at peak stress under HM coupling tests, and FC decreases. Moreover, simplified models of failure process for crystalline rocks under compression and HM coupling are proposed.Disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) is one of the most challenging subjects across the world. The most important task is to isolate the HLW from the biosphere. At present, deep underground geological disposal is regarded as a feasible way. Granite, a potential host rock for HLW, is basically characterized by high strength and low permeability. It is reported that China plans to build a HLW repository in granite strata in Beishan, Gansu Province. It is well recognized that growth of micro cracks associated with crack coalescence, and propagation can eventually lead to failure of crystalline rock. On the other hand, development of micro cracks will also cause the change in rock volume, Fluid flow through rock is of fundamental importance in HLW isolation. In crystalline rocks, fluid flows through a network of cracks under the flow pressure. For this, fluid in cracks could have a major influence on the propagation of crack networks, resulting in permeability change. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) is widely used to observe propagation and coalescence of micro cracks in rocks. In the present study, CTC tests and HM coupling tests are conducted under different confining pressures and pore pressures, respectively. An AE monitoring system is employed to reveal the fracturing process of Beishan granite during the tests. Based on testing results, development of micro crack in the process of failure is studied in order to characterize the overall mechanical behaviors of granite. The granite samples were taken from the Beishan area, Gansu Province, China. The specimens, with diameter of 50 mm and length of 100 mm, were prepared according to ISRM recommendations. The tests were carried out with a MTS815 Flex Test GT rock mechanics machine. The MTS815 tester has a maximum load capacity of 4,700 kN and can supply a maximum confining pressure of 140 MPa. The axial and lateral strains were measured by a pair of extensometers. The measurement ranges for the axial and lateral extensometers (LVDT) are 5 mm and 8 mm, respectively. A 12-channel portable AE system, which could work simultaneously with the loading system, was utilized to monitor AE events during the CTC and HM coupling tests. The triggering threshold of AE system was set to 28 dB. The sensor frequency was 200 kHz. As shown in For CTC tests, the confining pressures were set to 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 MPa, respectively. In the first step, a vertical load of about 2 kN was applied in order to fix the position of the specimen. Then, the desired confining pressure was reached with a constant loading rate of 0.05 MPa/s to ensure that the specimen was under uniform hydrostatic stresses. For the HM coupling tests, the specimens were immersed in water for 72 h in the vacuum suction device to reach the saturated state. The testing results of CTC tests are tabulated in At the confining pressure of 5 MPa, axial splitting failure is observed. With increasing confining pressure, shear failure is dominant. A macro shear crack runs diagonally through the specimen when the confining pressure reaches 30 MPa. It can be obtained from The stress-strain curves of Beishan granite under different pore pressures are shown in The characteristics of AE hit counts observed during the CTC tests are shown in In order to better understand the failure process, AE events at different stress levels are shown in The accumulated numbers of AE events at different stress points (marked in The frequency centroid (FC) and amplitude of AE were analyzed by choosing one AE channel, as shown in FC is a calculated frequency feature reported in kilohertz, which results from a sum of magnitude time frequency divided by a sum of magnitude time, as equivalent to the first moment of inertia. In the pre-failure stage, fluctuation of FC is basically the same as the trend of amplitude. However, FC reaches lower values in the post-failure stage. AE hits counts characteristics during HM coupling tests are shown in  The fluctuations of amplitude and FC under different pore pressures are basically the same, as shown in Based on the testing results, simplified failure processes for crystalline rocks under compression and HM coupling are illustrated in As shown in It also shows that lower confining pressure causes smaller compressibility of the specimen, and vice versa. Moreover, stress concentration is not uniform in the specimen due to the interaction between low peak stress and low confining pressure. As a result, the post-peak expansion is marked, which can be easily to observed in a form of splitting failure. On the other hand, interaction between high peak stress and high confining pressure makes the stress concentrated in the specimen uniformly, therefore the post-peak expansion is relatively small, and shearing failure dominates. An illustration of the overall specimen failure process under different pore pressures with respect to HM coupling tests is shown in The strength, deformation and AE characteristics of Beishan granite are obtained by CTC and HM coupling tests. Under different stress levels, the development of AE is in good agreement with the propagation of micro cracks. The failure pattern of crystalline rocks is well calibrated by AE activities. Based on the testing results, the following conclusions can be drawn. For the CTC tests, the compressibility of Beishan granite increases linearly with increasing confining pressure. The specimen begins to expand when the axial stress reaches 81.1% of the peak stress. Splitting failure is dominant under low confining pressure. The higher the confining pressure, the more pronounced the shear failure. For HM coupling tests, the compressibility decreases with increasing pore pressure, as well as peak stress. The dilitancy point appears at 82.4% of the peak stress. AE activity shows different phenomenon under different stress levels, which can be used to determine the damage stresses. For CTC tests, AE activity shows that the induced damage before AE amplitude and FC have same fluctuation trend in the CTC tests. The fluctuation intensity increases with the increasing axial stress. In the residual stage, the amplitude fluctuation increases, and FC decreases. For HM coupling tests, amplitude fluctuation range increases during the loading stage and reaches its maximum at the peak stress, the same as fluctuation intensity. However, the FC decreases after the peak stress. It should be noted that pore pressure affecting the rock strength is not thoroughly investigated in this research. In the future, more tests are needed to be conducted for further investigating the AE and fracturing characteristics of the rock subjected to different confining stresses and pore pressures. In addition, the permeability of Beishan granite also needs to be studied thoroughly. This work was supported by the
