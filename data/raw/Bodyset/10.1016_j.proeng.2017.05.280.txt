A new analytical approach able to predict the mechanical behavior of rock bolts subjected to pull-out tests was proposed in this paper. Input parameters of such approach are: rib profile shape, height, width, angle of wrap and spacing, axial bolt pull-out force, and material properties. As for the analytical part, the basis of the new analytical solution for the prediction of the load displacement curve was developed. Derived mathematical equations enable calculations of grout displacement in elastic and elasto-plastic behaviour. In the experimental part, four examined bolts in situ pull-out tests were compared with the predictions of the new analytical approach, and this comparison led to the validation of this approach.
