                     MnO3-yttria stabilized zirconia (LSM-YSZ) were deposited onto dense YSZ electrolytes by colloidal deposition technique. The cathode characteristics were then examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and studied by ac impedance spectroscopy (IS). Conditioning effects of the LSM-YSZ cathodes were seen, and remedies for these effects were proposed for improving the performance of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). LSM surface contamination and modification, cathode bonding to the YSZ electrolyte, changing Pt electrode and bonding paste, and curvature of sintered YSZ electrolytes led to some changes in microstructure and variability in cell performances. Much of the variability could be eliminated by using only one batch of Pt paste, using flat and sanded YSZ plates as well as consistent processing procedures. Reproducible impedance spectra were obtained by using the improved cell configurations. Typical IS spectra measured for an (air) LSM-YSZ/YSZ/LSM-YSZ (air) cell at 900°C showed two depressed arcs. The impedance characteristics of the LSM-YSZ cathodes were also affected by experimental conditions such as surface modification of the LSM by Ni or Sr, cathode compositions and applied current.In recent years, several groups worldwide have been involved in the development of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) capable of delivering high power at reduced temperatures, and remarkable progress has been made in developing reduced temperature SOFCs. The approaches generally fall into two categories: the use of materials with substantially higher conductivity and/or fabrication of SOFCs using thin-film electrolyte membranes. Several methods for depositing thin-films onto porous SOFC electrodes/substrates have attracted widespread attention because the electrolyte ohmic loss became negligibly small as electrolyte thickness was reduced La In this study, the electrochemical evaluation of a series of perovskite electrodes is presented.
