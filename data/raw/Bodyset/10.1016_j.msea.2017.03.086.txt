In current study, AZ80-0.5wt%Ca-1.5vol%Al2O3 magnesium matrix nanocomposite was fabricated by rheo-casting method. After T4 heat treatment, the nanocomposite was exposed to extrusion at 450°C with extrusion ratio of 12:1. Microstructure and mechanical results showed fragmentation of eutectic phase to fine particles, dynamic precipitations and recrystallization (DRX), strong basal plane texture and the increase of yield strength, yield anisotropy and hardness of nanocomposite after extrusion process. Yield and ultimate tensile strengths of the extruded nanocomposite were increased by 87.8% and 126.4%, where in compression test, strengths of the nanocomposite were developed by 61.9% and 35.6%, respectively. Moreover, tensile elongation of the extruded nanocomposite was improved by 530%, while its compressive elongation was decreased by 31.5%. After compressive test, reorientation of lattice structure was occurred by twin formation and higher density of twins was observed in extruded nanocomposite than as-cast one.Magnesium matrix composites (MgMCs) are an emerging type of materials with high specific properties, superior creep resistance and high damping capacity, which are excellent candidates for lightweight structural materials In recent years, many research attempts have been devoted to the evolution of MgMCs with AZ series alloys as a matrix, which their properties can be further enhanced by alloying Among different manufacturing methods for fabrication of MgMCs such as powder metallurgy and casting process, rheo-casting (stirring practice in semi-solid zone) has privilege because of its simplicity and economic advantages and relatively uniform distribution via proper wettability between reinforcement and matrix during process. Besides, lower processing temperature is another advantage of the rheo-casting process which facilitates the practice and increases stirrer and metal mold life Deformation of Mg with HCP structure (c/a~1.624) is rather difficult as they have not enough independent deformation systems So, the aim of present study is to investigate the effect of hot-extrusion on the microstructure and mechanical properties of rheo-cast AZ80-Ca-Al AZ80 Mg alloy (Al: 8.2, Zn: 0.48, Mn: 0.026 AZ80 alloy ingot pieces, 0.5 As-cast AZ80-0.5Ca-1.5Al Phase, microstructure and texture characterizations of nanocomposite were performed on central part of as-cast sample as well as on the extruded sample, parallel to the extrusion axis, using Optical Microscopy (Olympus-GX51), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) equipped by EDX, image analyzer software and X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8-advanced). The etchant solution for microstructure analysis was acetic picral. Room temperature tensile properties of as-cast and extruded nanocomposites were measured according to the ASTM E8M-05 standard using a Zwick 250/Roell universal testing machine, with crosshead speed of 0.5 XRD patterns of rheo-cast and extruded AZ80-0.5Ca-1.5Al The main difference between XRD patterns of as-cast and extruded nanocomposites is relatively higher intensity of (0002) peak of the matrix in the extruded one. In extruded nanocomposite, reorientation of (0002) basal plane in α-Mg matrix along extrusion direction is mainly attributed to basal slip of {0001}< OM microstructure and FESEM micrograph results of AZ80-0.5Ca-1.5Al EDS analysis indicates presence of three main phases, α-Mg, β-Mg Due to special solidification manner of rheo-casting technique, the microstructure of rheo-cast nanocomposite is comprised of some large primary α-Mg grains solidified inside crucible (initial grains) and mostly fine α-Mg grains with semi-globule morphology enclosed by initial grains in secondary solidification stage inside the die cavity ( So as to evaluate the distribution of solute elements and reinforcement particles in nanocomposite matrix, FESEM-EDS analysis was done on tensile fracture surface of extruded nanocomposite as shown in The microstructure of the hot-extruded AZ80-Ca-Al Breaking off the β-eutectic plates to smaller particles is happened by the occurrence of necking phenomenon, since plastic formability of β eutectic phase increases at high temperature In the extruded nanocomposite, two kinds of zones are observed that consist of presence of high volume fraction of ultrafine new recrystallized grains in vicinity of eutectic phase ( In particle poor areas, it is suggested that bulging initial grain boundaries during hot-extrusion process introduces rotational dynamic recrystallization (RDR) whereas the recrystallized grains find enough opportunity to grow because of less pinning effect ( The morphology of most dynamic precipitates is nearly spheroid shape and they predominantly locate around the DRXed grains while drop-like continuous precipitations are observed within α-Mg grains ( According to To evaluate the issue in compressed as-cast and extruded composites, XRD patterns of both as-cast and extruded nanocomposites after compression test are obtained as shown in Also, microstructural observations of the composites in as-cast and extruded conditions after compression test reveal formation of twinning in some grains, especially in coarser and free precipitation ones ( Tensile stress-strain curves of as-cast and extruded nanocomposites at ambient temperature are shown in Compression testing results of AZ80-0.5Ca-1.5Al Wang et al. Finally, the significant increase in elongation in compression test than that in tension test ( The yield strength anisotropy, defined as compressive to tensile yield strengths ratio (CYS/TYS), for the as-cast and the extruded nanocomposites were shown in In this work, AZ80-0.5Ca-Al The matrix grains were significantly refined after hot-extrusion due to DRX mechanism introduced by PSN, rotational dynamic recrystallization mechanism and pinning of the grain boundaries by particles. Remarkable improvement in yield and ultimate strengths in tensile and compression tests were achieved after hot extrusion process. Tensile elongation of nanocomposite was improved by 530% after extrusion process. Higher value of I(0001)/I The main deformation mechanism during compressive deformation in hot-extruded nanocomposite was extension twinning, where the concave shape was observed in compression curve.
