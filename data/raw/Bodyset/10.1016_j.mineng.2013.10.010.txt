                      results in a remarkable decrease in calcite surface hydrophobicity with sodium oleate and depressants, while it has little influence on calcite surface hydrophobicity without sodium oleate. Adsorption data indicates calcium carbonate coating on calcite surfaces may change the adsorption mechanism of depressants. The study presented that added lattice ions change reactivity of the calcite surface and improve depressants actions on calcite flotation.Calcite is a common and important component of sediments and sedimentary rocks ( Calcite is one of the most extensive carbonate gangue minerals in flotation of smithsonite, fluorite, scheelite, apatite and celestite ( More recently, it has been found that both lattice ions (Ca High purity minerals of calcite were collected from Hunan province, China. The sample was gently ground manually in an agate mortar and then screened to obtain the âˆ’104 All of the flotation tests were carried out in a mechanically agitated flotation machine at a constant rate. The calcite suspension was prepared by adding 2.0 In this study the contact angle of calcite was tested by the MiniLab ILMS (GBX, France). Before every single test, the calcite block had been grounded by metallographic sandpaper and then washed by deionized water. The prepared calcite block was conditioned with the same conditioning regime as the flotation tests. Then let it air dried and tested in the machine. The sample was prepared with the same conditions as the flotation tests. The suspensions were separated at 9000  In the presence of excess lattice ions, the recovery of calcite decrease from 50.4% to 5.9% at 2 Contact angle of calcite was tested to further confirm the influence of lattice ions on calcite flotation. The test results are shown in  According to Both theoretical and experimental studies provide evidence for distinct properties of the calcite with freshly adsorbed or precipitated CaCO Adsorption tests of depressants were performed in order to further explore the role of lattice ion additions to calcite surfaces. The adsorption of depressants on the calcite mineral surface as a function of depressant concentration is shown in The results from these experiments indicate that calcium carbonate precipitated or adsorbed on the surface of calcite when lattice ions were added into the system. This conclusion is consistent with the calculated saturation index for calcite at the experimental conditions. The data indicates that a calcium carbonate coating on calcite surfaces has little influence on intrinsic hydrophobicity of calcite, but alters the calcite surface hydrophobicity in response to the addition of sodium oleate and depressants. The changes of calcium solubility and depressants adsorption capacity indicate that the reactivity of calcite surface is changed by the addition of Ca Lattice ions have been shown to exhibit a significant impact on calcite recovery. With the addition of depressants, calcite flotation recovery decreases with the pre-addition of calcium and carbonate ions. The contact angle measurement verifies that calcite surface wettability converts to hydrophilic with the addition of lattice ions in the presence of collectors and depressants. The results of adsorption measurements indicate that the reactivity of calcite surface with the addition of Ca The authors acknowledge the
