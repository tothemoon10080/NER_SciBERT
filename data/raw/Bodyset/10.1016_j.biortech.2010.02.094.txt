A bioelectrical reactor without cation-specific membrane was designed to test effects of direct electrical current on growth of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacterium. The results indicated that the cell significantly enhanced the growth of T. ferrooxidans. At a current of 30mA, the maximum cells density reached 1.39×109
                     cells/mL within 84h, which was 10 times faster than under a conventional cultivation method, in which electrical current is not used. A lag phase during the growth of T. ferrooxidans was observed when direct electrical current was applied, and the lag phase became longer under higher current intensity.Electrokinetic remediation has been proved to be an effective way to remove heavy metals from fine porous solids such as soil, clay, fly ash and sludge ( Since the first report of using anodic oxygen generated from electrolysis for media oxygenation in 1956 ( The purpose of this study was to investigate the growth characteristics of iron oxidizing bacterium, The iron oxidizing bacteria The experiments were carried out in an opened PVC cell with a rectangular base of 250 Two experiments were presented. The experiment A was to test and verify the feasibility The main objective of the experiment B was to explore the best current intensity for cultivation of the During the process of experiment, pH, Fe The max The concentrations of Fe(II) in EA2 and EA4 were relatively stable compares to that in EA1 and EA3 ( Culturing of According to the contrast experiments’ results of EA2 and EA4 ( The bacterial cells concentration reached up to 10 There was an obvious lag phase of This study demonstrates that the direct electrical current is able to enhance the growth of The study was funded by
