The pretreatment of an antimonial refractory gold and silver ore was investigated using alkaline sulphide leaching. The ore assayed 20g/t Au and 220g/t Ag and contained predominantly quartz/clay and barite, and to a lesser extent, sulphides such as pyrite, stibnite, sphalerite, zinkenite (Pb9Sb22S42) and andorite (Sb3PbAgS6). The latter mineral was identified to be the most important sulphide phase for the occurrence of gold and silver. Cyanide leaching of the ore consistently resulted in low extraction of gold (49%) and silver (18%) confirming the refractory nature of the ore. Alkaline sulphide treatment of the ore under suitable conditions was shown to leach out up to 85% Sb, which remarkably improved the extraction of silver from <18% up to 90% Ag in the subsequent cyanidation step. Gold extraction was also enhanced by 20–30%. These findings suggest that alkaline Na2S leaching can be suitably used as a pretreatment method prior to the conventional cyanidation for the refractory Sb-bearing ores.Gold-bearing ores can be classified as either free milling or refractory based on their metallurgical response to cyanide leaching ( Silver-bearing sulfides including proustite, pyrargyrite, tennantite and tetrahedrite ( The decomposition of some arsenical and antimonial sulphides in alkaline sulphide leaching systems can be given by the following reactions ( Previous studies on an antimonial gold/silver ore from Akoluk, Turkey have indicated that the ore is refractory in character, presumably linked with the occurrence of the sulphides including zinkenite (Pb Despite the extensive alkaline sulphide leaching studies on many gold- and silver-bearing sulphides ( An antimonial refractory gold/silver ore sample obtained from Akoluk (Ordu-Turkey) was used in this work. The ore sample was crushed down to −4 The chemical composition of the ore sample ( Earlier studies ( The occurrence and association of gold and silver are illustrated in The majority of the gold particles were observed to be smaller than 3 In these tests, the effects of concentrations of sodium sulfide (0.5–4.1 All cyanide leaching tests (24 Cyanidation tests revealed that the extraction of gold and silver from the ore was low (49% Au and 18% Ag) even at a fineness of grind of d The leaching behavior of antimony from the ore was evaluated during the alkaline sulphide leach tests performed under different conditions ( The maintenance of alkaline conditions is required to minimise the hydrolysis of S The influence of the temperature of Na The effect of the particle size of the ore (d During these alkaline sulphide leaching tests, the dissolution of gold, in particular, and other metals from the ore was also monitored. The extent of gold extraction was determined to be 3–9% which tended to increase with increasing temperature and concentrations of Na  In a similar manner, the extraction of silver in the cyanide leaching was enhanced from 66% to 87% with the increase in the temperature of the alkaline sulphide pretreatment using 4.1 Detailed mineralogical analysis of the ore revealed that gold occurs as alloyed with silver (~ Sincere thanks and appreciation go to the
