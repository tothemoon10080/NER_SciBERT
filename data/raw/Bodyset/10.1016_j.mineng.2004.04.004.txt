Studies on solvent extraction of Hf(IV) from acidic chloride solutions have been carried out using Cyanex 302 as the extractant diluted in kerosene. Variations of acid and extractant concentrations on the extraction of metal indicated decrease and increase in percentage extraction, respectively. Further, the plots of logD vs. log [HCl]/log [HA] gave negative and positive slopes of 2, indicating that the extraction follows ion exchange mechanism: MO2+

                     +2HA(org)

                     (aq), where, M=Hf(IV); HA=Cyanex 302. Stripping of metal from the loaded organic (LO) with different acids indicated sulfuric acid as the best stripping agent. Increase of temperature during extraction stage increases the metal transfer showing exothermic nature of the extraction process. Regeneration and recycling capacity of Cyanex 302, extraction behavior of associated elements such as Zr(IV), Ti(IV), Al (III), Fe(III) and IR spectra of the extracted Hf–Cyanex 302 has been studied.Hafnium is used for alloying with iron, titanium, aluminium and other metals. The metal is used for nuclear control rods and is an efficient “getter” for scavenging oxygen and nitrogen. Pearson proposed that the substitution of sulfur in organophosphorus acids render the extractant molecules with increasing electro negativities in the order: S The concentration of Hf(IV) and Zr(IV) in the aqueous phase was determined by the xylenol orange (XO) method ( Equal volumes (10 ml) of the aqueous phase containing desired concentrations of Hf(IV)/or other metals and organic phase containing the extractant, Cyanex 302 were equilibrated for 30 min in glass stopped bottles using a mechanical shaker. Preliminary experiments on the kinetics of metal extraction showed that equilibrium was achieved with in 20 min contact. After phase disengagement, the aqueous phase was separated and metal concentrations were estimated by XO method. The concentration of the metal in the organic phase was calculated from the mass balance. All the experiments were conducted at room temperature (30 Hf–Cyanex 302 solid complex was prepared by solvent extraction method. Loading of 0.002 M Cyanex 302 in chloroform with metal was carried out by repeated contact of fresh portions of metal solutions (0.001 M) for 30 min. Finally, LO phase was separated and filtered through Whatman phase separator (1PS). Diluent from the LO was removed by rotavac pump, which results in the formation of a semi-solid metal complex. A drop of the Hf(IV) complex was kept on a KBr pellet and placed under IR lamp to evaporate chloroform completely. IR spectrum of the extracted metal complex and pure Cyanex 302 was recorded for comparison. The extraction equilibrium of tetravalent hafnium from hydrochloric acid solutions with Cyanex 302 extractant may be represented as The effect of salts such as NaCl, Na The extraction of 0.001 M Hf(IV) from 0.1 M HCl solutions using 0.002 M Cyanex 302 in various diluents has been investigated. The results indicate that the extraction of Hf(IV) varies with the nature of diluents and follows the order (%E): Toluene (41.2) The effect of temperature in the range of 303–333 K (±1°) on the extraction of metal from an aqueous solution containing 0.001 M Hf(IV) and 0.1 M HCl with 0.002 M Cyanex 302 showed increase of percentage extraction of metal from 32% to 88.4%. The calculated value of Δ° An aliquot of 10 ml of 0.002 M Cyanex 302 was repeatedly contacted for 30 min with the same volume of aqueous solutions containing 0.00014 M of hafnium and 0.1 M HCl. After equilibration, the phases were analysed for hafnium content. The amount of metal transferred into the organic phase after each contact was calculated by difference and the cumulative concentration of hafnium in the organic phase after each stage of contact was determined. It is clear that most of the hafnium existing in the aqueous phase was extracted into the organic phase up to 7th stage of Cyanex 302. Analysis of LO contains 60 mg Hafnium stripping from 0.002 M Cyanex 302 containing 60 mg The recycling capacity of 0.002 M Cyanex 302 for the extraction of Hf(IV) (using 0.001 M metal and 0.1 M HCl) were carried out by first loading with Hf(IV) and then stripping with 8 M H The extraction behavior of Zr(IV), Ti(IV), Al(III) and Fe(III) (0.001 M each) has been investigated as a function of HCl concentration (0.005–1 M) using 0.002 M Cyanex 302 in kerosene ( The IR spectra of hafnium complex with Cyanex 302 and pure extractant for comparison were recorded. Cyanex 302 spectrum shows only two absorption bands at about 2950 and 2280 cm Survey of literature revealed that Cyanex 302 has not been exploited for the extraction of hafnium. Solvent extraction of Hf(IV) from acidic chloride solutions using Cyanex 302 indicated the transfer of metal follows cation exchange mechanism. Regeneration and recycling of extractant indicated greater stability of Cyanex 302. The present study indicates that the possibility of separation of Hf(IV) from Ti(IV), Al(III) and Fe(III).
