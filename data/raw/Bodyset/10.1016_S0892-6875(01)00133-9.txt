LOESCHE vertical roller mills are widely used for the comminution of raw materials in the cement industry, for the comminution of clinker and blast furnace slag and for the production of pulverized coal for cement kilns, blast furnaces and power plants. Recent research has shown, that the application of these vertical roller mills in dry grinding of ores and minerals can lead to significantly better recovery rates and higher grades when compared to conventional grinding. Since mid 2000 a LM 50.4 has been in operation for the comminution of a phosphate carrying pyroxenite ore with a capacity of 825 t/h at a D80 of 480 Î¼m.
