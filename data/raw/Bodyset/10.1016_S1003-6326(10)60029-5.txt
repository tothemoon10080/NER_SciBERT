Indium was recovered from zinc oxide flue dust (ZOFD) with sulfuric acid by oxidative pressure leaching in an autoclave, and the effects of different technological conditions on indium leaching were studied. Potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide were used as oxidants. The atmospheric pressure leaching experiments were also carried out. The experimental results show that the leaching rate of indium can be effectively improved by oxidative pressure leaching. The optimum conditions of pressure leaching are determined as sulfuric 5.10 mol/L acid, leaching time 150 min, temperature 90 Â°C, and the H2O2 dosage of 0.5 mL/g or 2.5% KMnO4. The leaching rate of indium is more than 90%, which is increased by 13% compared with that of atmospheric pressure leaching process without oxidant under the optimum conditions.
