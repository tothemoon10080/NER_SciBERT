These are the answers to the questions asked by Dr J.C. Jones for the paper “Statistical Modelling of Stockpile Behaviour under Different Atmospheric Conditions—Wetern Lignite Corporation Case” First of all, the resistance temperature detector we used in this work is three-wire configuration and the technical characteristics of the RTS are given in The reason why the moving average filter was used is to remove the pick-up effects with high frequency concealing the signals with very low frequencies supposed to be coming from the measurement stations. Moreover, in order to obtain reliable measurements, the Wheatstone arrangement with constant current source was used.
