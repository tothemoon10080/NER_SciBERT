The basis for effective control of flotation process is operative and reliable measuring composition and physic-chemical parameters of pulp. The used analyzer for measuring parameters of liquid and solid phases of flotation pulp (RA-931) includes X-ray-fluorescence sensor of metals content and potentiometric block of measuring ionic composition. The analyzer is placed directly into technological flows and allows obtaining information at given moment. Block-scheme of the main operation for controlling and regulating selective flotation includes: collection, storing and processing data on parameters of liquid and solid phases of flotation pulp; estimation of grade of being processed ore and determination of optimum parameters of the process; correction of reagent dosing and parameters of flotation equipment operation. Special studies and tests at pilot automated flotation facility allowed to demonstrate effectiveness and to determine conditions of applicability of the proposed method, system and analyzer in the process of bulk and selective flotation of polymetallic ores.
