The initial stages of oxidation of aqueous solutions of p-chlorophenol (pcp) and p-nitrophenol (pnp) on Bi-doped PbO2 electrodes have been studied. From deconvolution and analysis of UV–Vis spectra of the solutions obtained during electrochemical oxidation, benzoquinone and aliphatic acids were identified as the primary oxidation intermediates; oxidation of benzoquinone was found to be the slow step during the early stages of the electrochemical combustion process. The effect of competing adsorption of pcp and pnp on Bi–PbO2 was also examined, and the presence of pnp in solution was found to inhibit the rate of oxidation of pcp during concurrent oxidation of both phenols.Recent work has shown that electrochemistry offers valid alternatives to traditional methods for the treatment of organic compounds present in residual waters The extent of the reaction is chiefly governed by the catalyst species facilitating oxygen transfer to the organic compound. The prevailing model proposed for this kind of reactions involves adsorption of the organic compound on the catalyst surface, followed by electron transfer and reaction on the electrode with OH radicals present on the surface, produced from discharge of water In this work, the oxidation of A three-compartment glass cell, with glass-frit separators, was used throughout. This allowed maintaining the solution in the working compartment separated from that contacting the 2.2 cm Large platinum gauze surface area electrodes (ca. 85 cm Long-time electrolysis was carried out at 1.65 V (SCE) using an EG&G PAR model 273 potentiostat, using another platinum gauze with larger geometrical surface area as counterelectrode. In these experiments, the working electrode compartment was filled with 60 ml of phenol-containing solution. Spectra of the solutions were acquired with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode-array spectrometer under HP 89531 MS-DOS UV/Vis Operating software. Using an Eppendorf micropipette, 100 μl of solution was extracted from the electrolysis cell at different times during electrolysis or adsorption at open circuit, and these aliquots were diluted in 10 ml of water before obtaining the spectrum in a quartz cell with 1 cm optical path. Spectra of the solutions at short times during adsorption were obtained The concentration of chloride in solution, produced from oxidation of pcp, was determined potentiometrically using a silver electrode Adsorption of pcp and pnp on Bi–PbO From the number of moles in surface excess, the real area of the lead oxide electrode was estimated from the following equation: As shown in As with adsorption, the kinetics of oxidation was followed with UV–Vis spectra. The increasing signal due to the presence of pbq, as well as the negligible variation of the electric current with the applied potential, indicates that under the present conditions formation of a polymeric film on the electrode surface does not occur. Additional evidence for this was obtained from FTIR spectra of the electrode surfaces after completing electrolysis in pcp solutions, which did not show absorption bands due to phenolic compounds The dependence of the concentration of each species with the electrolysis charge is shown in The reaction mechanism may be represented as: Considering further that the surface concentration of the species involved controls their oxidation rate, then in the presence of several phenolic compounds in solution, the respective oxidation yields depend on the relative strengths of their interactions with the surface. Thus, we electrolyzed a solution containing equal initial concentrations (10 Measuring with UV–Vis spectroscopy, the concentrations of reactants and some of the intermediates generated during electrochemical oxidation of pcp on bismuth-doped PbO
