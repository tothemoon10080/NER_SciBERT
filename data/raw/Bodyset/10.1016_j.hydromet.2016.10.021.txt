Red mud cannot be directly employed as the raw material of iron-making and construction materials for the existence of sodium element. The effects of cooling methods of furnace, air, water and liquid nitrogen on roasted red mud for recovering Na+ with water leaching were investigated through the analyses of TG-DTA, QXRD, FTIR, SEM, etc. The faster cooling methods we used, the better leaching performance would be obtained. Liquid nitrogen cooling sample therefore displayed the best leaching result with concentration of 1202mg·L−1 Na+ at the first leaching stage (~25wt.% total sodium recovery). Part of cancrinite known as desilication products transformed into NaCaHSiO4 and nepheline after the roasting process. In the fast cooling red muds, the new generation of Na2Ca(CO3)2 could dissolve directly into water; the increase of Ca(OH)2 concentration to ~4.8wt.% was beneficial for the dissolution of cancrinite and NaCaHSiO4 during the leaching process; amorphous phase increasing from ~4.1 to ~13.5wt.% made sodium be more easily leached out from sodium-containing amorphous phase than the same crystalline phase; fluey flakes or plate-shape particles weakened the aggregation behaviour; the increase of specific surface area from 1.898 to 2.177m2·cm−3 leaded to the contact area increasing between particles and leachant, implying that sodium could be more easily leached out from the fast cooling samples.Red mud is generally a rusty solid waste generated from the aluminium industry via the Bayer process, employing this technology in alumina production currently accounts for > The sodium removal or recovery methods typically consisting of water/seawater leaching, acid leaching/neutralization, bacteria leaching, CO The hydrothermal process demonstrates an excellent performance to recover sodium from red mud and other valuable elements simultaneously. In the early 1990s, Creswell ( So far these parameters―roasting condition of lime & soda concentration, roasting atmosphere, temperature, time and leaching condition of temperature, pressure, duration time, pH for recovering sodium and other valuable elements from red mud―have been widely researched, whereas there was little attention that is paid to the influence of cooling methods on the dealkalization of roasted red mud with water leaching method. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to monitor effects of the various cooling methods, namely furnace cooling, air cooling, water cooling and liquid nitrogen cooling, on the leaching of sodium from the roasted red mud with five water leaching stage at a specific temperature and residence time. Bayer red mud used in the present study was sampled from a subsidiary company of Chalco in Guizhou province of China. The chemical composition of sample was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF-1800, RIGAKU Co., Japan) analysis, as listed in Thermal behaviour was conducted by Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, HCT-4, Henven, China) with powder red mud (< Wherein, In order to reduce the errors and quantify the amorphous phase, ~ The amorphous phase Wherein, The red mud samples were heated to 850 The leaching results of sodium from roasted red mud cooled by various methods are illustrated in The chemical composition of red mud listed in To ascertain the reason for changes in sodium recovery among the samples cooled by various cooling methods, the phase transitions during the active roasting process need to be analysed first. The phase identification and quantitative analyses of red mud samples cooled by various methods are showed in 102–600 600–765 765–938 Cooling process: In the case of air cooling red mud sample, the specific phase composition is given in  In order to obtain more information concerning the phase transformation during the roasting process, the room temperature Fourier transform infrared spectra of all the samples including the untreated red mud were carried out with transmittance bands of 400–4000 Besides the effect of cooling methods on mineral phases, the morphology of samples could be more or less affected simultaneously and that would lead to the change of sodium recovery. The microstructures of red mud cooled by various methods are presented in The mass particle-size distributions of red mud samples treated by various cooling methods are shown in The results suggest that various cooling methods have a significant effect on recovering sodium from the pretreated red mud. The faster cooling method, such as liquid nitrogen cooling method and water cooling method, is helpful for the leaching of sodium from pretreated red mud. Prior to leaching process, red mud material needs to be roasted at 850 The authors are grateful for financial support from
