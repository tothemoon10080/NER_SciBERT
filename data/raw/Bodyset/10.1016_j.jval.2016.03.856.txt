All over the media and from the Analysis of Experts in Nigeria. There is a clarion call to diversify the mono product (oil-dependent) Economy of Nigeria: the most populous black nation in the world and the Giant of Africa. The diversification is to move away from the oil dependent economy of Nigeria to an economy driven by the presence of Industries carrying out solid minerals extraction, exploration as well as processing agricultural products and doing manufacturing. In the face of these, very less has been said about the health hazard potential of this proposed diversification as well as its potential to further proliferate the effects of Climate Change that is currently ravaging our planet. In view of these, I sought to gather information on the various disease conditions that could spring up due to industrial presence in an area and the approaches to eliminating their effects. Considering that Nigeria is a developing country without the adequate resources, infrastructure and institutions to contain this diseases and health conditions in the event of a fall out. There was a huge need to do a thorough environmental and health impact assessment in Nigeria before kick starting the proposed diversification. In designing the Nigeria Diversification Policy. Federal Government of Nigeria should adopt the most environmentally safe measure to reduce the incidences of cancer and other diseases that often result from industrial activity. The Government of Nigeria should also adopt protocols that will ensure the continual survival of our planet.
