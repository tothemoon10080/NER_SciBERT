One of the most important reasons for the serious damage of embankment dams is their impermissible settlement. Therefore, it can be stated that the prediction of settlement of a dam is of paramount importance. This study aims to apply intelligent methods to predict settlement after constructing central core rockfill dams. Attempts were made in this research to prepare models for predicting settlement of these dams using the information of 35 different central core rockfill dams all over the world and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) methods. Parameters such as height of dam (H) and compressibility index (Ci
                     ) were considered as the input parameters. Finally, a form was designed using visual basic software for predicting dam settlement. With respect to the accuracy of the results obtained from the intelligent methods, they can be recommended for predicting settlement after constructing central core rockfill dams for the future plans.
