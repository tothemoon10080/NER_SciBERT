The development of new technologies is one of the most effective ways to solve environmental problems related to ore-dressing. Complex mineralogical investigations are able to help in improving this process. In collaboration with researchers from the IPKON institute, we have developed an electrochemical method to improve the properties of crushed ores prepared for the wet magnetic separation. This article studies the samples before and after application of the electrochemical method. Surfaces of mineral grains investigated by the scanning electron microscopy show differences in flocculation. Measured polarization curves showed unequal electrochemical processes on surfaces of magnetite, hematite, and martite particles. X-ray analysis and Mössbauer data also confirmed the changes in compositions of the ores before and after using the electrochemical method. Magnetic properties of the studied species to be compared before and after the application of method showed relevant increase in parameters such as magnetic viscosity (Svo), breaking saturation field (Hcr), magnetic susceptibility (χ), and specific magnetization (Is).
