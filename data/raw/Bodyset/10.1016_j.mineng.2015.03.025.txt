Crushed sand fines have a pronounced effect on fresh concrete rheological properties, which can be controlled through a concrete micro-proportioning approach, i.e. optimisation of the particle size distribution (PSD) in the very fine range of the grading (⩽250μm). The paper describes a study where possibilities of producing crushed sand by combining high-speed (70m/s) vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushing and static air classification are explored to enable the micro-proportioning approach in full-scale aggregate and concrete production. In addition, the effect of rock resistance to fragmentation (crushability) on the shape improvement and fines generation during high-speed VSI crushing is experimentally studied.
                  The VSI crushing experiment results show that an acceptable level of crushed sand particle (1.25–8mm) equi-dimensionality (flakiness index lower than 5–8%) can be achieved for all processed feeds, regardless of the parent rock crushability or initial particle shape. The amount of fines smaller than 63μm and 125μm generated during high-speed VSI crushing is very strongly governed by the resistance to fragmentation of the processed rock materials. Analysis of the air classification results show possibilities of modelling a variety of different crushed sand fine particle (⩽250μm) grading curves independently of the rock type, amount of fines or grading of the crushed sand product after the VSI crushing.There are two ways to produce fine aggregate (sand Production of crushed sand is usually a considerably more complex process than simple extraction of natural sand. In contrast to the natural sand production, stand-alone crushed sand plants are quite rare. The production is usually integrated with the coarse crushed aggregate production. The exact layout of a crushing plant can be quite variable, however, the production process usually involves several (usually four) size reduction stages, which include crushing, transport (mainly conveyor belts), size control (mainly screens) and classification equipment. The four stages can also be denoted as: The main components of the In Historically the too high fines content from VSI crushing has been solved by the means of wet classification (washing). However, this approach is not always feasible due to problems like lack of space, availability of the water resources, environmental issues from de-watering ponds and operational problems in places where negative temperatures are reached in the winter time, There are several types of static air classifiers available, namely Gravitational (G), Gravitational-Inertial (GI) and Centrifugal (C), and the type used will depend on the desired cut-size ( The other two types of static air classifiers, To produce high quality manufactured sand a VSI crusher is normally run at a high speed in order to maximise the obtainable particle equi-dimensionality, which is known to allow for better particle packing and improved fresh concrete rheology ( The influence of the crushed sand fines in fresh concrete can be explained through the Particle–Matrix concrete workability model ( For example, a lean pumpable concrete mix would need more of fines to achieve the minimum paste volume (in order to saturate the voids of the particles phase ( Different narrow size ranges of crushed sand fines grading can also be enriched with certain mineral types, There are also indications that mineralogy of the fines can lead to different performance in fresh concrete due to the interaction of the colloidal size crushed filler particles and superplasticisers ( Control of the fines composition very accurately for a wide variety of bedrock would then enable to control the rheological properties of the matrix, and thus concrete mix through an approach that is introduced here as concrete micro-proportioning. The micro-proportioning approach means that the total interaction and grading curve of the aggregate fines, other mineral additives, cement and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) are considered and proportioned for optimised performance. The concrete micro-proportioning approach described above can be made possible, if the fine part of the crushed sand (⩽250 The approach of producing crushed sand aggregates in a way that allows for utilising the mix micro-proportioning approach would allow for optimised, environmentally friendly and quality and economy driven aggregate and concrete production. It would mean that VSI’s at crushed sand production plants could be run at the highest speed to achieve improved particle shape even at cost of increased fines content. The described approach would allow for best possible utilisation of crushed sand properties and facilitate switching to producing concrete with 100% crushed aggregates thus preserving the depleting natural sand resources. The proposed concrete micro-proportioning approach could potentially also be beneficial for crushed aggregate producers. They could benefit from the ability to supply crushed dry filler products that comply with tight specifications for industries other than concrete production, which is an important factor from a mass balance point of view. The first objective of this study is to contribute to understanding the effect of various Norwegian rock types on fines generation potential and possibilities of shape improvement during high-speed VSI crushing. The second objective is to investigate the possibilities of using multiple-stage air classification approach to classify crushed sand, particularly fines ⩽250   PSD of the crushed aggregate powder fractions obtained from the air classification experiments was determined by a Micromeritics SediGraph 5100, which is a PSD analysis device based on particle sedimentation speed and equivalent Stokesian diameter. All the vendor recommended procedures were followed and vendor-supplied particle dispersion liquid SediSperse A-11 (specific gravity 0.76 The SediGraph equipment is designed to be able to measure particles in the range of about 0.1–300 Flakiness index (FI) measurements were performed according to EN 933-3 ( For concrete aggregates, mechanical properties are usually expressed by their resistance to fragmentation (Los Angeles value) according to EN 1097-2 ( The test machine (  CR    ABR    The crushability (CR) value has a good exponential correlation to the Los Angeles value according to EN 1097-2 ( The experiments were performed under well-controlled conditions (rotor speed, feed rate and power draw of the crusher’s motor) in a full-scale crushing and screening test plant ( The crushing experiments were performed in open circuit with rock-box and no cascade flow. First the crushing plant was cleaned from the previous materials. Next rock-on-rock crushing chamber was configured: a small amount of the feed material was initially run through the VSI at 70 The experiments were performed under well-controlled conditions (feed rate, air-flow of the fan and primary and secondary air ratio) in a full-scale air classification test plant equipped with static air classifiers, feeding equipment, an air flow generating fan and a bag-house ( The data in Results from analysing PSDs of the material from the VSI crushing experiments are presented in Amount of fines generated during the impact crushing is an important parameter of the VSI-crushed sand product. The amount and grading of the fines would suggest the best final classification means and equipment, based on the desired application of the crushed sand. It is known that the energy required to crush rock material is proportional to the amount of new surfaces (amount of fines) generated (  By comparison of The observed correlation ( FI is predicted for the product size range of 1.25–25 Similar size feed is used (about 4–25 Rock materials with CR value in the range of about 35–55% (LA values of approx. 18–30%) are processed; High VSI rotor speed (70 While simple empiric models like the one in Eq. A typical result, in terms of PSDs of aggregate fractions obtained during the air classification experiments done with the equipment shown in The grading of the GI fines intermediate product represents the natural grading of the 0/250 In practical concrete and aggregate production terms, the micro-proportioning approach would involve blending back together different fractions of the classified fines from the same rock type, to obtain the desired grading. To investigate the actual possibilities of this approach, it was attempted to model blending together the three different crushed fine fractions (4 The curve modelling (control of PSD for particles ⩽250     Other reference curves were also obtained by combining the fractions of T4 and T5 rock types. For this purpose the T3 GI fines reference curve was made into considerably finer and coarser PSDs by “shifting” it upwards and downwards by the same percentage (8.4%) at the 20 QuHigh-speed (70 An acceptable level of crushed sand particle (1.25–8 The amount of fines smaller than 63 Analysis of the air classification results show possibilities of modelling a variety of different crushed sand fine particle (⩽250 Future studies should include developing an improved understanding of the effect of crushed fine aggregate particle properties on the rheological properties of fresh concrete.
