The development of sound constitutive descriptions able to predict accurately the changes in flow stress during plastic deformation, under changing temperature and strain rate conditions is of utmost importance for the correct prediction of the mechanical response of metals and alloys, which undergo deformation under hot-working conditions. Therefore, the present work has been conducted with the aim of developing a constitutive model of such characteristics, able to describe as accurate as possible the changes in flow stress of a commercial 20MnCr5 steel, when this material is deformed at elevated temperatures and different strain rates. Particular attention has been paid to the analysis of the flow stress, work-hardening and work-softening behavior when this material is subjected to transient testing conditions, that is to say, changes in strain rate and deformation temperature in the course of plastic deformation. The constitutive description is initially developed from the analysis of the stress–strain curves obtained from axisymmetric compression tests conducted under nominal constant testing conditions, which involved the deformation of the material at temperatures in the range of 1123–1473K and strain rates of 0.01–10s−1, up to effective strains spanning from approximately 0.6 to 1. The initial work-hardening and the subsequent work-softening behavior exhibited by the material during plastic deformation have been thoroughly characterized on a rational basis. The temperature and strain rate dependence of the yield stress, critical stress for the initiation of dynamic recrystallization, apparent saturation stress and actual steady-state flow stress have been described by means of the Sellars–Tegart–Garofalo model. The time to 50% dynamic recrystallization has also been described as a function of deformation temperature and strain rate, by means of a simple parametric relationship commonly employed for this purpose. The proposed constitutive description employs a single activation energy, whose value is close to that required for the self-diffusion of Fe in austenite, of approximately 284kJmol−1. Further experiments involving changes in deformation temperature and strain rate have been carried out in order to validate the constitutive model. The results indicate that the proposed approach is able to describe satisfactorily the changes in flow stress, work-hardening and work-softening of the investigated material during transient testing conditions.material constant material parameter (s material constant initial austenitic grain size (μm) dynamically recrystallized grain size (μm) material constant Avrami exponent universal gas constant (J material constant experimental activation energy (J activation energy for DRX, (J time for 50% recrystallization (s) absolute temperature (K) material constant volume fraction recrystallized Zener–Hollomon parameter (s material parameter (MPa effective strain effective strain rate (s temperature-dependent shear modulus (MPa) shear modulus at 0 flow softening due to DRX (MPa) effective stress (MPa) flow stress corresponding to the work-hardening and DRV curve (MPa) athermal stress (MPa) critical stress for the onset of DRX (MPa) yield stress (MPa) hypothetical saturation stress (MPa) steady-state flow stress (MPa) work-hardening rate (MPa) athermal work-hardening rate (MPa) Industrial hot-working processes are mainly characterized by the fact that, during manufacturing, the material is deformed plastically under transient testing conditions, that is to say, a situation in which the stock experiences significant changes both in deformation temperature and strain rate in the course of plastic deformation. As a consequence of this fact, the formulation of a rational constitutive description of the material able to predict as accurate as possible the changes in flow stress, as well as the work-hardening and work-softening processes associated with such changes, requires the fulfillment of a number of conditions. In particular, the constitutive description should be formulated in differential form, in order to be able to update the changes in deformation temperature and strain rate before each iteration step during the integration scheme employed for the computation of the flow stress. Thus, explicit integrated expressions, which allow the computation of the flow stress as a function of the total strain imposed to the material, commonly employed for the description of the changes in flow stress during plastic deformation under constant testing conditions, would not be appropriate for describing such changes under transient testing conditions. When structural steels are deformed under constant hot-working conditions, the flow stress curve exhibits a typical behavior as a consequence of the different microstructural processes that occur during plastic deformation, as shown in After reaching a critical stress, dynamic recrystallization (DRX) becomes operative as the main concurrent restoration mechanism, leading to the presence of a peak stress on the stress–strain curve and to a work-softening transient, followed by the attainment of a steady-state flow stress value. Therefore, the appropriate formulation of the constitutive description of the material would require a set of expressions in differential form able to predict the evolution of the different microstructural processes involved, in order that such a constitutive law could be employed for the analysis of deformation processes under transient testing conditions. The constitutive description and hot workability of steels, when these materials are deformed in a wide range of temperatures and strain rates, in order to analyze their behavior either during thermomechanical treatments or performance in applications as structural materials, has been extensively investigated in the past few years In order to accomplish this objective, different approaches for the temperature and strain rate description of the flow stress have been employed, which have included the models earlier advanced by Sellars and Tegart However, it is important to point out that the vast majority of the constitutive descriptions developed for different steel grades have involved the analysis of the flow stress changes during extensive plastic deformation essentially under constant testing conditions, whereas only few works have examined the behavior of these materials when changes in deformation temperature and strain rate occur concurrently during the deformation process, as observed in actual hot-working operations Thus, the present investigation has been conducted in order to analyze in a rational manner the constitutive behavior of a 20MnCr5 steel grade deformed both under constant and transient hot-working conditions. Firstly, the constitutive description is derived from the results of tests carried out under constant testing conditions, which follows an improved methodology to that employed in a previous study conducted on a C–Mn steel Secondly, an analysis of the deformation of the material under varying conditions of deformation temperature and strain rate is conducted, as well as the quantitative validation of the constitutive model for describing the changes in flow stress under such deformation conditions. This aspect represents an important contribution of the present work, which could not be accomplished in our previous investigation on C–Mn steel The approach advanced employs a single activation energy whose value is close to that of the self-diffusion of Fe in austenite, of approximately 284 The present investigation has been conducted by employing a number of effective stress-effective strain curves obtained from samples of a 20MnCr5 (SAE 5120) steel of the following composition (wt.%): 0.19 C, 1.25 Mn, 1.2 Cr, 0.4 Si, 0.035 S, 0.035 P and Fe bal, tested under axisymmetric compression conditions. This material is widely employed in the manufacture of a number of mechanical parts and components, which include piston bolts, spindles, camshafts, gears and shafts, among others. For the present study, the material was provided in form of bars from which compression cylindrical specimens of 10 Prior to testing all the samples were austenitized at 1173 A welded thermocouple (type K or S, depending on the testing temperature) was employed to closely monitor and control the temperature of the specimens during testing. The samples were heated from room temperature to the testing temperature at a mean constant heating rate of 3  The stress–strain data corresponding to the work-hardening and dynamic recovery (DRV), transient can be employed for determining the values of the critical stress for the onset of dynamic recyrstallization, Thus, once the value of In the present study, following our previous developments The determination of the yield stress values, by fitting the experimental flow stress data to the above equation, allows an estimation of the athermal stress, According to the model earlier advanced by Sellars and Tegart The STG model can also be applied for the temperature and strain rate description of the critical stress for the initiation of dynamic recrystallization, Thus, it could be concluded that the use of a single activation energy, with a value close to that corresponding to the self-diffusion of Fe in austenite, into the STG model, would provide quite satisfactory results regarding the temperature and strain rate description of these stress parameters. On the other hand, when the flow stress of the material determined on curve (a) of Thus, as the volume fraction recrystallized increases with the course of plastic deformation, the actual flow stress (curve (b) on Thus, once DRX becomes operative ( Once the temperature and strain rate dependence of  In the latter figure, it can be observed that the constitutive model proposed is able to reproduce the vast majority of the experimental flow stress values with an accuracy of ±20 In order to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed constitutive model for predicting the changes in the flow stress of the material in the course of plastic deformation under variable testing deformation conditions, a number of tests were carried out, which involved changes in strain rate at constant temperature or changes in deformation temperature at constant strain rate. The results of some of these tests are presented in  On the other hand, All the above figures include not only the actual experimental stress–strain data, but also the predictions provided by the constitutive model, as well as the actual stress–strain curves determined under constant testing conditions (dotted lines), which represent the lower and upper bounds of the flow stress for the corresponding testing deformation conditions. In general, it can be stated that the constitutive model is able to provide a satisfactory prediction of the changes in flow stress that occur as a consequence of the changes in deformation temperature or strain rate. As can be observed in The constitutive model developed in the present work for the investigated 20MnCr5 steel represents a rational approach for the description of the flow stress of the material during deformation at elevated temperatures and strain rates, which fulfills the required conditions for its use in the design and simulation of industrial hot-working operations. The four stress parameters involved in the model are determined on the foundation of a physically-based model, which assumes the interaction of dislocations with barriers and the surmounting of the thermal barriers (solute and interstitial atoms, as well as forest dislocations) by means of thermally activated processes. The analysis of the yield stress of the material clearly indicates that solute atoms have a significant effect on the initiation of plastic flow, as determined from the slope of the linear relationship shown in However, as plastic deformation proceeds, work-hardening and dynamic recovery come into operation, with a clear predominance of dislocation multiplication over dislocation annihilation, which leads to a well marked initial work-hardening transient on the stress–strain curves. The fact that an activation energy close to that of the self-diffusion of Fe in austenite can be satisfactorily employed for the temperature and strain rate description of both the yield and saturation stresses, points out the similitude of the activation volumes of the thermal barriers that oppose dislocation motion from the initiation of plastic flow up to the critical stress for the onset of DRX. Also, it indicates that during the operation of dynamic recovery, motion of jogged screw dislocations and climb of edge dislocations segments would play a significant role in the annihilation and re-organization of the dislocation structure prior to the initiation of DRX. As indicated in the previous section, the critical stress for the onset of DRX was determined by means of the criterion advanced by Poliak and Jonas In the present work, the critical values for the onset of DRX, for the different conditions of deformation temperature and strain rate, could be derived without any ambiguity from the distinct minimum shown on each Comparison of As shown in An important limitation of computing the volume fraction recrystallized by means of an Avrami equation, as it is conducted in the present work, has already been indicated by Brown and Bammann Thus, the experimental scatter intrinsic to the determination of the different stress parameters, as well as the time to 50% recrystallization and their correlation with deformation temperature and strain rate, explains the scatter observed in the computed values of the flow stress for all deformation conditions. Furthermore, given its formulation in differential form, it is possible to update the changes in deformation temperature and strain rate that occur in actual industrial hot-working operations, which allows the prediction of the changes in flow stress when the material is deformed under transient loading conditions, as shown in  On the contrary, in For the tests conducted under constant strain rate conditions, in which the deformation temperature was either increased or decreased, the advanced constitutive model is also able predict correctly the trend in the changes of the flow stress in the course of plastic deformation. On the contrary, when deformation temperature is decreased from 1373 Thus, for all the tests conducted under transient testing conditions, the proposed constitutive formulation is able predict correctly the trend observed in the changes of the flow stress with applied strain. Also, for most of these tests, the model is able predict the magnitude of the flow stress, at least within the accuracy of ±20 Finally, although instantaneous changes in deformation conditions were not conducted in the present work, hypothetical instantaneous increments in strain rate at constant temperature or hypothetical instantaneous decrements in deformation temperature at constant strain rate indicate that the model is able to reproduced the over-shooting in the flow stress commonly observed in the type of test, as reported by several authors In this sense, it is important to point out that in the present work, the steady-state flow stress ( At present, further experiments under transient loading conditions are being carried out in order to improve the predictive capabilities of the model, as well as to extend it to the analysis of other ferrous alloys. A rational constitutive model in differential form, able to describe the changes in flow stress of a commercial 20MnCr5 steel grade when this material is deformed under hot-working conditions, has been developed. The basic equations of this constitutive description have been derived from stress–strain curves determined under constant hot-working conditions and the model has been validated by means of different tests conducted under transient testing conditions. The model employs a single activation energy value, whose magnitude is close to that of the activation energy for self-diffusion of Fe in austenite. In this way, it has been determined that dynamic recrystallization will occur in this material whenever the magnitude of the Zener–Hollomon parameter is less than approximately 1.26 Professor E.S.
