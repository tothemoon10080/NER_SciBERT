A novel micromechanical magnetometer has been designed, fabricated, and tested that consists of low-stress electrodeposited magnetic alloys and surface-micromachined polysilicon structures. The sensor responds to applied magnetic fields without consuming any power and the magnitude of the angular response is scale independent. Theoretical models are developed and their predictions agree well with experimental results. Mechanical responses to fields as small as 200nT have been optically detected for a micromechanical magnetometer with a 1000

In these applications smaller, lower power, and cheaper magnetometers would be advantageous. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology can be used to reduce the size of many types of sensors as well as increase their ability to be mass produced (e.g. pressure sensors and accelerometers). A small magnetometer with low power consumption would also be useful for wireless microsensor networks, which have commercial and military applications, such as perimeter security, shoreline reconnaissance, and personnel or asset monitoring Miniaturization of magnetometers using MEMS technology has been reported in several studies We propose a novel method of fabricating micromechanical magnetometers using polysilicon mechanical flexures and electrodeposited ferromagnetic alloys as the sensing element. In these prototype devices the mechanical response is measured optically and a sensitivity of 200 The compass is the earliest known magnetometer, placed by historians in China between 2637 BC and 1100 AD When the magnet is placed in a field, the equilibrium established between the magnetic and the mechanical torque (i.e. The magnetization of ferromagnetic material has a hysteretic dependence on magnetic field. When the field is increased and then brought back to zero, the material has a non-zero remanent magnetization A simple bar magnet containing two poles will create the well-known field outside of the magnet as well as a lesser-known field inside the magnet. The magnetization of the ferromagnetic element is written as a vector When magnetizing a magnet, the applied field The fabrication of the device is divided into four parts: structure fabrication, seed layer patterning, electrodeposition, and release. The MUMPs In our previous report Unfortunately, the removal of the seed layer using wet chemical etchants (i.e. step 6 as described above) became a significant challenge. When removing the nickel seed layer with a commercial nickel etchant (Transene Nickel Etchant TFB) galvanic coupling effect between the seed layer (Cr/Ni) and the electrodeposited layer (85Co15Ni) made it energetically favorable to etch the electrodeposited layer. In fact, the much thicker electrodeposited magnet (10 Sputter etching (CVC sputtering system) was used to work around the problem, since it is a purely physical etch (i.e. there is no galvanic reaction). In addition, both chromium and nickel can be removed in the same step. Although the sputter etch was effective in removing the seed layer, the temperature of the chip during the etch was relatively high (>260 The solution used in this work is to pattern two types of seed layer. One seed layer has good adhesion, high release etch resistance, and is patterned to form islands used as the electrodeposition base for the electrodeposited magnet. The second seed layer, named the conduction layer, is deposited over the entire chip and is used to electrically connect the islands of the first seed layer. The primary characteristic of the second layer is that it is conductive and can be selectively etched without attacking the electrodeposited magnet. A three-mask post-foundry process was developed. The first mask uses lift-off to define the regions where 10 Although titanium has a resistivity 25 times higher than copper Electrodeposition has many advantages over other deposition techniques for the microfabrication of IC-compatible hard magnetic materials. The magnetic properties of the films can be tailored for specific applications, since they are strongly influenced by electrodeposition parameters (e.g. solution composition, pH, current density, temperature, agitation, and current waveform). Various hard magnetic materials have been electrodeposited to evaluate the relationships between electrodeposition parameters, microstructure, and magnetic properties ( To integrate electrodeposited magnetic materials with ICs and MEMS, the electrodeposited materials must have: (1) low deposit stress to prevent film cracking and structure deformation, (2) good adhesion between the seed layer and the electrodeposited films, and (3) corrosion resistance to HF and other acids that are frequently employed in MEMS fabrication. In order to reduce the stress of electrodeposits, various electrodeposition parameters, including solution composition (e.g. additives and anions) and deposition temperature, must be investigated. The most effective factor to control the stress of electrodeposited thin films is additives (e.g. saccharin). Adhesion between electrodeposited hard magnetic materials and the nickel seed layer has been improved by activating the nickel surface with 20% HCl for 1 Presently, 40Co60Ni is deposited for its low-stress and high corrosion resistance. Although the device performs well using this alloy, its properties are inferior to other hard magnetic materials we have developed ( Once the chip is electrodeposited, the resist is stripped at 80 The fabrication yield with the improved process is extremely high (i.e. 250 out of 251 devices survived fabrication). Magnetic material is deposited into electrodeposition molds that have a smooth and vertical sidewall profile and a 2:1 height-to-width aspect ratio. Pillars of photoresist are positioned on the etch holes to prevent the electrodeposited material from blocking the etch holes. During release etch in 49% HF, no failure due to chemical etching was observed. In addition, stiction was not an issue even for After release, the devices are tested in an ac magnetic field (0.5–1000 To verify that devices are rotating about the torsional axis, the deflection of a device is measured along the entire length of the magnet. If the device is working properly, the deflection should be a maximum at the ends of the magnet and decreases linearly as the measurement approaches the torsional axis. As previously mentioned, the magnetization is a function of shape. Given that we know the geometry, magnetic field direction, field magnitude, and angular deflection, the magnetization of the devices can be determined by equating  For magnetometers with the same magnetic plate dimensions, altering the torsion beam stiffness can also impact performance as shown in We have also designed devices with and without etch holes to investigate their effect on magnetometer performance. The frequency response of the device slightly peaks at 8 Although devices constructed with 40Co60Ni performed well, better materials should be implemented to achieve a higher remanent magnetization and performance. Since some better magnetic alloys may be attacked by HF, methods to improve their corrosion resistance are needed. One possible approach is to coat the magnetic material with a corrosion resistant layer. The squeeze-film damping phenomenon encountered is being correlated with existing models. Testing at different pressures would give us better understanding of this behavior. Magnetometers with integrated capacitive position sensing and piezoresistive strain measurement are also being developed. A ferromagnetic micromechanical magnetometer based on the simple compass is predicted by theory to be scale independent. Sub-mm devices are predicted to be capable of detecting fields significantly smaller than 1 This work is supported by the Darpa MEMS Program DABT63-99-1-0020 and an NSF Career Award ECS 9876285.
