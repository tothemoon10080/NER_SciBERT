Even though more than six decades have passed since the first theory on heterogeneous nucleation at grain boundaries (GBs) was established in the 1950s, the concurrent shape variation (co-deformation) of both the nucleus and the GB was still not captured by existing models. By using a fully variational approach, we demonstrate for the first time that a nucleus with low-energy facet(s) is highly deformable in response to its interaction with the GB along the triple junction line and, consequently, its energy of formation can be reduced by orders of magnitude relative to predictions by previous methods.Since nucleation is the first step in all first-order phase transformations that are ubiquitous in nature (such as formation of dew drops on a spider's web) and widely utilized in many technologies (such as environmental science and technology, chemical and metallurgical engineering, materials design and synthesis, food science and processing, etc.) However, nucleation is still one of the toughest nuts to crack, in particular for solid state processes, and heterogeneous nucleation (HN), even though much more common, appears to be even more difficult to deal with as compared to homogeneous nucleation. Consider, for example, the most classical problem of HN of a new phase at a pre-existing homo-phase interface such as grain boundaries (GBs). Existing studies Because of these challenges, the existing models for HN at GBs, both classical Recent molecular dynamics studies of HN at GBs Since a critical nucleus is defined by the saddle point along the minimum energy path (MEP) on the total free energy surface in a high-dimensional phase space (including all degrees of freedom, structural, compositional and geometrical), interface forces and torques must be balanced at junctions and everywhere else. Thus both the nucleus and GB plane involved have to be able to relax their shapes simultaneously and freely (i.e. For a system with According to the gradient thermodynamics A necessary condition for a saddle point is given by a vanishing functional variation of the grand potential Ω, i.e., δΩ As has been proven theoretically that at equilibrium (either stable or unstable) the Young's law of force balance at triple phase junctions is satisfied in the MPFM framework Validation of the model is made first by studying the simplest case where an The current approach is then applied to find the critical nucleus configuration at a GB in the presence of low-energy facet(s) in one of the adjoining grains (e.g., the  In the case of Shape changes of faceted nucleus at different Co-deformation between a faceted nucleus and its hosting GB is required to reach true equilibrium with all forces (including torques if any) balanced at TJs. Such force balance is guaranteed in the MPFM Such co-deformations required by the force-balance at junctions are found to have a profound impact on the activation energy barrier for nucleation as well. In Moreover, the manner and degree of co-deformation and, thus, the deviation from its counterpart derived by the geometrical methods vary dramatically with facet inclination and anisotropy (see above discussions) and so does the activation energy barrier for nucleation. It is found that the interplay among the GB area eliminated and hetero-phase interfaces created associated with the nucleation determines the shape and relative area of each portion and thus differences in the manner and degree of co-deformation. In particular, when GB area elimination plays the dominant role, the facet may deviate from it cusp orientation ( In summary, by formulating a fully This work is support by the  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
