Spinel LiCo0.09Mn1.91O3.92F0.08 as cathode material was modified with LiCoO2 by the sol-gel method, and the crystal structure, morphology and electrochemical performance were characterized with XRD, SEM, EDS, AAS and charge-discharge test in this paper. The results show that a good clad coated on parent material can be synthesized by the sol-gel method, and the materials with modification have perfect spinel structure. LiCo0.09Min0.09O3.92F0.08 materials coated by LiCoO2 improve the stability of crystal structure and decrease the dissolution of Mn into electrolyte. With the LiCoO2 content increasing, the specific capacity and cycle performance of samples are improved. The capacity loss is also suppressed distinctly even at 55 Â°C.
