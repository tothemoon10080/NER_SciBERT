The influence of gravity on the reaction engineering of tubular reactor is studied by analyzing the residence time distribution curves. The results show that upflow-feeding mode is more beneficial compared with downflow-feeding mode, since the flow pattern of the fluid in the reactor is closer to plug flow. The result of dynamic experiment conducted in ion-exchange of tungsten metallurgy is as good as that in reaction engineering of ion-exchange column. Whether downflow-feeding or upflow-feeding mode is adopted, breakthrough time decreases when solution concentration increases. Upflow-feeding mode has longer breakthrough time and greater improvement in adsorption capacity especially with high WO3 concentration in ion-exchange.
