Isolated coronal fractures of femoral condyle are rare in adults and nonunion of Hoffa fracture is reported only a few times in the literature. We analyzed six cases of nonunion of Hoffa fractures over a period of three years. Three patients were treated conservatively and three patients had fixation failures. Delay of presentation was 2 months to one year. Treatment protocol consisted of open reduction, excision of pseudoarthrosis, bone grafting and internal fixation along with knee arthrolysis. Union was achieved in all patients at mean 16 weeks. The treatment of nonunion of Hoffa fractures requires careful preoperative planning and meticulous surgical technique. The literature regarding the controversies in fracture management and surgical technique are reviewed.
