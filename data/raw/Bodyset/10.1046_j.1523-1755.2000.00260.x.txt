Chronic metabolic acidosis in azotemic rats on a high-phosphate diet halts the progression of renal disease.
               
                  Background
                  Hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis are general features of advanced chronic renal failure (RF), and each may affect mineral metabolism. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of chronic metabolic acidosis on the development of hyperparathyroidism and bone disease in normal and azotemic rats on a high-phosphate diet. Our assumption that the two groups of azotemic rats (acid-loaded vs. nonÂ–acid-loaded) would have the same degree of renal failure at the end of the study proved to be incorrect.
               
                  Methods
                  Four groups of rats receiving a high-phosphate (1.2%), normal-calcium (0.6%) diet for 30 days were studied: (1) normal (N); (2) normal + acid (N + Ac) in which 1.5% ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was added to the drinking water to induce acidosis; (3) RF, 5/6 nephrectomized rats; and (4) RF + acid (RF + Ac) in which 0.75% NH4Cl was added to the drinking water of 5/6 nephrectomized rats to induce acidosis.
               
                  Results
                  At sacrifice, the arterial pH and serum bicarbonate were lowest in the RF + Ac group and were intermediate in the N + Ac group. Serum creatinine (0.76 Â± 0.08 vs. 1.15 Â± 0.08 mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (52 Â± 8 vs. 86 Â± 13 mg/dL), parathyroid hormone (PTH; 180 Â± 50 vs. 484 Â± 51 pg/mL), and serum phosphate (7.46 Â± 0.60 vs. 12.87 Â± 1.4 mg/dL) values were less (P < 0.05), and serum calcium (9.00 Â± 0.28 vs. 7.75 Â± 0.28 mg/dL) values were greater (P < 0.05) in the RF + Ac group than in the RF group. The fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP) was greater (P < 0.05) in the two azotemic groups than in the two nonazotemic groups. In the azotemic groups, the FEP was similar even though PTH and serum phosphate values were less in the RF + Ac than in the RF group. NH4Cl-induced acidosis produced hypercalciuria in the N + Ac and RF + Ac groups. When acid-loaded (N + Ac and RF + Ac) and nonÂ–acid-loaded (N and RF) rats were combined as separate groups, serum phosphate and PTH values were less for a similarly elevated serum creatinine value in acid-loaded than in nonÂ–acid-loaded rats. Finally, the osteoblast surface was less in the N + Ac group than in the other groups. However, in the acid-loaded azotemic group (RF + Ac), the osteoblast surface was not reduced.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The presence of chronic metabolic acidosis in 5/6 nephrectomized rats on a high-phosphate diet (1) protected against the progression of RF, (2) enhanced the renal clearance of phosphate, (3) resulted in a lesser degree of hyperparathyroidism, and (4) did not reduce the osteoblast surface. The combination of metabolic acidosis and phosphate loading may protect against the progression of RF and possibly bone disease because the harmful effects of acidosis and phosphate loading may be counterbalanced.Hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis are general features of advanced chronic renal failure Acid loading in normal animals and humans increases urinary calcium excretion Another critical issue is whether metabolic acidosis directly affects the development of renal osteodystrophy While it might seem that the effects of phosphate retention and acidosis are not interrelated, such a conclusion may not be correct. As shown in Our goal was to evaluate the effect of chronic metabolic acidosis on the development of hyperparathyroidism and bone disease in normal and azotemic rats receiving a high-phosphate diet. Our initial assumption was that the magnitude of renal failure and hyperparathyroidism would be similar in the two groups of azotemic rats, thus allowing a comparison of the effect of metabolic acidosis on the bone disease. However, our assumption proved to be incorrect. Male Wistar rats weighing 180 to 200 g were used for the study. In two of the four study groups, renal failure was surgically induced by arterial ligation of two of the three hilar branches of the left main renal artery. This was followed one week later by a right nephrectomy. In the two nonazotemic groups, sham operations were performed at the same time intervals. During surgical procedures, rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneally administered ketamine 7.5 mg/100 g (Ketaset; Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and xylazine 0.5 mg/100 g (AnaSed; Lloyd Laboratories, Shenandoah, IA, USA). Rats were housed in individual cages, given 14 g of food daily, and allowed free access to water. The amount of food eaten did not differ among the groups because rats were removed from the study if they did not consistently consume greater than 90% of their diet. After the right nephrectomy or sham operation, the four groups of rats were placed on a high phosphate diet (1.2%) for 30 days. The diet also contained 0.6% calcium and 100 IU of vitamin D per 100 g of diet (ICN, Cleveland, OH, USA). The four groups were ( After sacrifice the ilium was detached from the skeleton and processed undecalcified as previously described Serum calcium and phosphate and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured with specific kits (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Serum creatinine was measured with a creatinine analyzer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA). Measurements performed on the 24-hour urine collection were calcium and phosphate (Sigma) and creatinine (Beckman). Intact PTH was measured with an immunoradiometric assay specific for the rat (Nichols, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA). Serum calcitriol was measured with a radioreceptor assay by Nichols Institute; because of the large aliquot of serum needed for measurement, serum calcitriol could not be measured in all rats. Arterial pH, pO Comparisons of the serum and urinary data among the four groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Duncan test for multiple comparisons. The association between two variables was assessed by Pearson's linear correlation. A comparison of the slopes of two regression lines was based on the formula t = (b The weight at sacrifice was not different among the four groups The most remarkable biochemical finding was that renal function, as determined by the serum creatinine, BUN, and creatinine clearance, was better in the acid-loaded, RF group (RF + Ac) than in the nonacid-loaded, RF group (RF; A direct correlation was present between serum creatinine and BUN ( Shown in As shown in An inverse correlation was present between serum calcitriol and serum creatinine As shown in As shown in Shown in Our expectation was that a similar degree of RF would be present in the two azotemic groups, and as a result, it would be possible in these phosphate-loaded rats to compare directly the effect of chronic metabolic acidosis on the bone disease as well as biochemical changes. However, the acid-loaded, azotemic rats did not develop the same degree of RF as the nonÂ–acid-loaded azotemic rats. In addition to suggesting that metabolic acidosis has a renoprotective effect in phosphate-loaded 5/6 nephrectomized rats, our study results also suggest that acidosis independently enhanced the renal clearance of phosphate. The increased renal phosphate clearance resulted in a lower serum phosphate value, which likely contributed to the higher serum calcium level. Both the lower serum phosphate and the higher serum calcium would function to moderate the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Perhaps the most surprising feature of the study was that NH Our results seem to contradict those of other studies in which it has been suggested that metabolic acidosis contributes to the progression of renal failure in azotemic rats Many years ago, Holliday In the two azotemic groups (RF and RF + Ac), distinct differences in serum creatinine, BUN, calcium, phosphate, PTH, and creatinine clearance were present. Because renal function was different in the two 5/6 nephrectomized groups, it is difficult to know whether the respective differences in serum chemistries were due to acidosis or differences in renal function. When correlations were performed between serum creatinine and both serum phosphate and PTH, it became possible to consider certain conclusions in the two azotemic groups. When serum creatinine and serum phosphate were compared, the correlations were significant in both the renal failure and the RF + Ac groups, but the slopes of the regression lines were different. Thus, for similarly increased serum creatinine values, serum phosphate was less in the RF + Ac group, suggesting an enhanced renal clearance of phosphate for a similar degree of renal failure. Thus, our data suggest that for retarding the progression of renal failure, lowering the serum phosphate concentration by means of decreasing the renal set point for phosphate reabsorption may be as effective as reducing the serum phosphate by dietary intake. While the interaction between chronic metabolic acidosis and phosphate has been the primary focus of this study, chronic metabolic acidosis may have other effects that could affect renal function. These include: ( As has been shown in previous studies of NH The FE In in vitro studies in bone, metabolic acidosis has been shown to stimulate osteoclastic resorption and inhibit osteoblast function In the only previous study of acid loading in 5/6 nephrectomized rats, the magnitude of renal failure and hyperparathyroidism was similar between the acid-loaded and nonÂ–acid-loaded azotemic rats There have been several small studies The study by LeFebvre In summary, chronic metabolic acidosis in phosphate-loaded, azotemic rats (
