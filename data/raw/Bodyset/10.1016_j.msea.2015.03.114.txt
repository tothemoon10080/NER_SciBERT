Titanium, zirconium and molybdenum (TZM) alloy with different amounts of rare earth lanthanum oxide was prepared by powder metallurgy into 0.5mm thick sheets. The effects of the La2O3 content on recrystallization temperature and mechanical properties of the TZM alloy were studied. La2O3 increased the recrystallization and recovery temperature of the TZM alloy and increased its tensile strength and elongation.Molybdenum is a typical refractory metal, and has excellent high temperature strength, thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. However, it is brittle at room temperature, has low recrystallization temperature, high plastic to brittle transition temperature and is easily oxidized in air According to the study, the strengthening mechanism To further improve the TZM alloy performance, drawing lessons from molybdenum lanthanum rare earth elements alloy reinforcement, the paper studied the effects of La The main experimental design was as shown in Lanthanum-doped TZM alloys were prepared from the following main raw materials: pure Mo powder (Jinduicheng Molybdenum Co., Ltd.), TiH Mixing powder and ball milling Pure molybdenum powder was mixed with TiH Compacting Mould pressing forming technology includes die forming, weighing, pressing, drying, modification and compacting processes. The doped powder was pressed into blanks, pressing, and demoulding after pressure relief got the required shape and size of the products. Steel pressure was 21 Sintering Pressed blanks were pre-sintered in the muffle furnace at 1200 Obtained lanthanum-doped TZM plate was 0.5 The samples were cut out of the rolled plate along the rolling direction using the XQ-2B metallographic specimen mounting press. After polishing and corrosion testing, the samples׳ microstructure was observed using Nikon SMZ1000 optical microscope. Tensile testing was performed using the WDW-100 10 Microstructure of the Sample 1, without La after annealing at different temperatures is seen in During the TZM alloy cold rolling, grain slip occurs accompanied by dislocations intertwining, stretching the grain and crushing the fibers, resulting in the TZM alloy work hardening. Adding La  Fibrous texture after 1200 Molybdenum is a metal with high stacking fault energy, thus recrystallization core will be generated by the sub-grains merging La Samples 1, 2 and 3, annealed at 1000–1600 Tensile fracture surfaces in  Although a small amount of La  Adding La La They increase the tensile strength and elongation of the TZM alloy plate. For the same conditions, along with the increase of the La The authors acknowledge support from the
