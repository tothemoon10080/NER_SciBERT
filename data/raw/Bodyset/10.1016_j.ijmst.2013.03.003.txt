The interrelationship between preload forces and natural frequencies of anchors was obtained from the structure of an anchor and its mechanical characteristics. We established a numerical model for the dynamic analysis of a bolt support system taking into consideration the working surroundings of the anchor. The natural frequency distribution of the system under various preload forces of the anchor was analyzed with ANSYS. Our results show that each order of the system frequency varied with an increase in preload forces. A single order frequency decreased with an increase in the preload force. A preload force affected low-order frequencies more than high-order frequencies. We obtained a functional relationship by fitting preload forces and fundamental frequencies, which was in agreement with our theoretical considerations. This study provides theoretical support for the detection of preload forces.
