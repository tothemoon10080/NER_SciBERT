The influence of ceria and nickel addition to alumina-supported Rh catalyst for steam reforming of propane at low temperatures has been studied by preparing and examining 2wt%Rh/Al2O3, 2wt%Rh/20wt%CeO2–Al2O3, and 2wt%Rh–5wt%Ni/20wt%CeO2–Al2O3. TPR characterization showed that adding ceria makes rhodium oxide easier to reduce and the presence of rhodium also makes ceria easier to reduce through Rh–Ce interaction, whereas the addition of Ni makes Rh2O3 and ceria more difficult to reduce, likely due to Rh–Ni and Ce–Ni interactions. Adding ceria and nickel significantly improved the catalytic activity of Rh catalyst for propane conversion at 475°C. Kinetic study at different temperatures (450–650°C) indicated that the addition of ceria and Ni can greatly increase the propane reforming rates by lowering the activation energies from 67.6–68.8kJ/mol for 2Rh/Al to 50.1–50.4kJ/mol for 2Rh/20CeAl and to 42.1–42.5kJ/mol for 2Rh5Ni/20CeAl. The feed steam/carbon molar ratios corresponding to maximum reaction rates at 475°C increased from 2.0 for 2Rh/Al to 3.0 for 2Rh/20CeAl and 4.5 for 2Rh5Ni/20CeAl catalyst. A kinetic equation based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood model best fitting the experimental data was applied for the propane steam reforming over the Rh-based catalysts. Kinetic results at different partial pressures of propane and steam revealed that the addition of ceria could enhance the steam and propane adsorption, while the addition of Ni could significantly promote the propane adsorption, probably through working with Rh as propane adsorption sites.Due to the high intrinsic energy efficiency of fuel cells, hydrogen production via fuel processing for on-board and on-site fuel cell applications has become an important area of catalysis research Currently, supported Ni catalysts are widely used for steam reforming of natural gas in industry owing to their high activity and low cost Consequently, the present work aims at developing a fundamental understanding on the effects of ceria and Ni addition to alumina-supported Rh catalysts for low-temperature steam reforming of propane. Propane is chosen as the probe molecule here because it is a simple one for mimicking liquid hydrocarbons, and also the dominant component in the commercially available liquefied propane gas (LPG), a widely used residential fuel. This work is a systematic study concerning the effects of ceria and Ni addition on the physico-chemical property and catalytic activity of the alumina-supported Rh catalysts for steam reforming at low temperatures under different partial pressures of propane and steam. Analytical characterization was conducted to evaluate the metal–support and metal–metal interactions. Reforming tests were carried out under various conditions to clarify the activity and kinetic behavior as well as the turnover frequency of the supported monometallic and bimetallic Rh-based catalysts. High-purity reagent-grade Ni(NO Propane steam reforming was carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor system, as shown in The catalyst was reduced in situ at 535 Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the calcined catalysts were obtained on a Scintag (Thermo Scientific) PAD V Powder Diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation ( N Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was conducted using freshly calcined catalyst samples on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 TPR/TPD analyzer with 5% hydrogen in argon and a temperature ramp of 10 Propane conversion and selectivity to H The turnover frequency (TOF) of a catalyst is defined as the number of reactant molecules converted to products over one active site per second, which truly reflects the activity level of available catalytically active sites on surface. In the present work, each exposed Rh metal atom on the surface is considered as an active site for propane conversion. For each monometallic Rh catalyst, after a given time on steam (i.e., upon reaching steady propane conversion), the TOF was calculated using the following formula: The physical properties of the Rh-based catalysts are given in As shown in The XRD patterns of 2Rh5Ni/20CeAl, 2Rh/20CeAl and 2Rh/Al catalysts are shown in The crystallite sizes of CeO  When Ni was further added (2Rh5Ni/20CeAl), the first TPR peak, which was assigned to Rh associated with ceria (Rh–Ce), shifted back to a higher temperature (132 Results from the activity tests of 2Rh/Al, 2Rh/20CeAl and 2Rh5Ni/20CeAl catalysts for propane steam reforming at 475  Turnover frequency (TOF), which embodies the intrinsic activity of the active sites, was calculated based on the number of exposed Rh sites and the data is listed in Before the kinetic data can be obtained, two major factors should be considered: (1) the stability of the catalysts and (2) the external and internal mass transfer limitations. Experiments were conducted under appropriate conditions to make sure that those factors were of insignificance. As shown in To check the possibility of external and internal mass transfer limitations, the reforming was conducted under two different conditions: (1) reducing the catalyst amount with the same particle size (45–63 Kinetic data were obtained by changing the partial pressure of the reactants at a constant total pressure of 1.0    The kinetic results show that the rate of propane steam reforming strongly depends on the partial pressures of both propane and steam. According to these kinetic features, a Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) model can be applied and the rate of propane reforming can be deduced as: The kinetic equation The pre-exponential factor The propane steam reforming was also conducted at different temperatures (450, 500, 550, 600, and 650 In this study, we found that by adding 20 The present results on the partial pressure effects reflect on how the catalyst composition could affect the balances of rates of adsorption and reaction of steam and propane. The conversion rate depends on the relative rates of reactants adsorption and activation. The higher conversion rates at higher steam partial pressure indicate a higher activity for propane activation which needs to be matched by higher steam adsorption and activation rates. Consequently, higher partial pressure of propane at a given steam partial pressure may push the reaction in a steam-starving regime, as can be seen from The new kinetic result that 2Rh/20CeAl catalyst exhibited higher steam adsorption constant What is also interesting is the new result on the partial pressure effects that adding CeO It is now clear that loading CeO The H The decrease of ceria reducibility can result in the decrease of steam adsorption constant ( From the present work, it has become very clear that upon Ni addition, there exists close interaction between Rh and Ni and they act in concert to promote propane adsorption and reaction. It is also clear that both Rh and Ni interact with CeO It has been hypothesized that the support is the principal site for water activation and the metal sites are responsible for the activation of hydrocarbons in steam reforming reactions For the 2Rh/Al catalyst, surface Rh metal works as sites for propane adsorption and activation, and alumina support provides sites for steam adsorption and activation. For 2Rh/20CeAl catalyst, CeO The present results have provided new insight into, and fundamental understanding of the effects of adding CeO The influence of ceria and nickel addition to alumina-supported Rh catalysts for low-temperature steam reforming of propane has been systematically studied. The characterizations showed that loading 20 Kinetic studies on steam reforming at different temperatures (450–650 The active site-based turnover frequency of the catalysts increased in the order of 2Rh/Al (1.27 A rate equation based on Langmuir–Hinshelwood (L–H) model best fitting the experimental data was developed and applied to the propane steam reforming over the Rh-based catalysts. The kinetic results derived at different partial pressures of propane and steam based on L–H model revealed that the ceria addition could enhance the steam and propane adsorption, while the Ni addition could significantly promote the propane adsorption, probably through working with Rh as propane adsorption sites. These results provide new fundamental insight into the synergetic effects between Rh and Ni and between Rh–Ni and CeO This work was supported by US Office of Naval Research through an ONR NAVSEA Grant N00014-06-1-0320.
