The effect of clinker grinding aids (GAs) on mill performance and cement properties is currently quantified in real-scale grinding plants. In fact, laboratory-grinding mills operated for given time interval do not consider the effect of circulating load, thereby leading to increased specific energy consumption (Ec) with excessively wide cement particle size distribution (PSD) curves. The main objective of this paper is to develop and validate a laboratory locked-cycle approach that mimics the industrial grinding operations occurring in closed-circuit tube mills. Test results have shown that Ec and its rate of decrease due to GA additions can be adequately predicted using this approach, when compared to those resulting from a real mill operating at 90ton/h. The addition of GA led to narrower PSD curves and shifting towards smaller diameters, just like what happens in industrial grinding. Also, the cement properties including water demand, setting time, and compressive strength matched to a large extent within each other.Laboratory-grinding mills are widely used by cement researchers and companies to assess the effect of grinding aids (GAs) on processing of clinker and energy savings. The grinding is realized either for fixed specific energy consumption (Ec) or Blaine fineness, and results compared to those of a control mix ground without GA. In case the grinding is performed for fixed Ec (i.e., mill rotating for given time interval), the incorporation of GA is typically associated with an increase in cement Blaine fineness and compressive strength at various ages ( Because of different operational modes, data obtained from laboratory-grinding mills operated for fixed Ec or Blaine values cannot be directly transposed to industrial mills. In fact, the clinker processing in real-scale mills is a continuing process, whereby the grinding forces are applied to the coarse particles while the fine ones are discharged as soon as they have been reduced to the required cut size ( Unlike industrial mills, laboratory-grinding mills operated for fixed Ec or Blaine values do not account for CL, therefore leading to significantly different cement particle size distribution (PSD) curves. The PSD is often approximated using the Rosin–Rammler–Sperling–Bennett (RRSB) function where the particle size ( The cement PSD is vital for water demand, rheology, and hydration processes such as heat release, setting time, volume change, and strength development ( Currently, the quantification of GA effects on mill performance and cement properties is realized in industrial grinding mills. Yet, this task is quite cumbersome for both GA suppliers and cement companies, as it extends over several days and requires thorough planning ahead of time. For instance, the addition of GA especially at high rates should not abuse the grinding system, and requires close monitoring of grinding parameters such as the fresh feed rate and CL, mill and elevator motors power, mill sound and temperature, and separator rotor speed and air flow ( The industrial testing becomes particularly complicated if a GA is already being used in the plant, as this necessitates stopping of GA dispensing to “clean” the mill from residual polymers and obtain the control cement mix. This stage extends over several hours, throughout which the grinding parameters should be continuously adjusted over time. For mills operating at several dozens of tons of cement per hour, this induces considerable drops in mill productivity and large amounts of finished products with highly fluctuated quality ( This research study was initiated following an industrial grinding test undertaken to quantify the effect of a glycol-based GA on mill performance and cement properties. The first phase presents the data collected over 2 consecutive days of clinker grinding in a real-scale closed-circuit tube mill operating at around 90 Industrial clinker used for the production of ASTM C150 Type I cement ( Commercially available glycol-based GA was used; it is referred to as clinker grinding improver and pack-set reducer in the cement industry. Its active chemicals determined by the Karl Fisher method, specific gravity, and pH were 64%, 1.08, and 7.8, respectively. The main components of this additive included diethylene glycol and propylene glycol. The fineness of cement was evaluated using the Blaine measurement, sieve residue, and PSD curve. The Blaine was determined using the air-permeability apparatus as per ASTM C204 Test Method ( A laser particle-size diffraction analyzer (Fritsch, Analysette 22 NanoTec Plus) capable of measuring particle sizes varying from 0.01 to 2000 The water demand required to achieve normal consistency was determined by mixing 650 Industrial closed-circuit tube (or ball) mill schematically presented in The industrial mill was operating without any GA. The first stage of testing consisted on ensuring uniformity of grinding parameters and sampling cement at regular time intervals for use as control mixtures. This stage was pursued over 3 Then, sprinkling of GA over the fresh feed introduced in the mill started at a rate of 280 The separator’s rotor speed (or, motor power) and air flow rate are crucial parameters for controlling cement fineness and residue ( The dispensing of GA was stopped over-night, and industrial testing resumed the second day. The stability of mill conditions was first assured, then GA dispensing started at a rate of 530  As can be seen in The CL increased from 1.43 when grinding was realized without GA to 1.71 and 1.81 when such additives were incorporated at 280 and 530 Typical PSD curves of cement sampled after reaching stable mill conditions are plotted in The water demand necessary to achieve normal consistency of various sampled cement mixtures remained almost invariable at 28.6% The 28-days compressive strength increased from 52.13 A 50-l laboratory-grinding mill having a drum diameter, length, and rotational speed of 400 Initially, a control mix was prepared by grinding 6 Two other grinding tests were then realized by sprinkling the pre-selected GA concentration of 280 or 530 As expected, the addition of GA led to reduced Ec, given the decrease in cement agglomeration ( The GA addition was associated with an increase in R-45 and R-90 values ( Compared to the control mix, the incorporation of GA did not remarkably alter water demand and setting time of tested mixtures. Those measurements remained within narrow ranges that varied within 27.75% The second grinding method adopted in this testing program is inspired from the standard Bond test that is frequently used in the mineral industry to express the ore’s resistance to crushing ( In this experimental program, the locked-cycle grinding tests performed to obtain the control cement made without GA were realized at pre-determined time interval of 17 The sieving procedure on the 100-μm limiting screen was realized using an ordinary mechanical vibrating shaker. The mill was replenished after each run with a mass of new feed equal to the undersize in order to re-adjust the material to 6 After the control mix that necessitated an Ec of 24.93 Typical variations in feed (B0), rejects (B2), and CL determined following consecutive grinding cycles for control cement and that containing GA at 530 Concurrently with CL, the cement Blaine fineness, sieve residues, and PSD curves varied remarkably during the first two grinding cycles, and stabilized thereafter. For example, the R-45 of the control mix decreased from 19.7% to 17% during the first two grinding runs, then stabilized at around 15.2% after the third cycle ( In accordance with industrial testing, the locked-cycle method determined after reaching stable mill conditions resulted in narrower PSD curves and shifting towards smaller diameters with GA additions (i.e., Compared to the control mix, the addition of GA did not result in remarkable effect on water demand, as these remained within 29% The 28-days compressive strength slightly increased from 49.8 Throughout discussion, the data measurements collected from industrial or laboratory tests were normalized with respect to corresponding control conditions, as follows: The variations in B0, B2, and (B0 The magnitude of CL and its variations due to GA additions are remarkably altered when grinding was realized in the 50-l laboratory mill following the locked-cycle method. Hence, the 1.43 CL of the control mix encountered during industrial grinding increased to 2.605 in laboratory testing, while the addition of GA at 280 and 530 Compared to industrial tests, excessively high Ec was required to secure a cement Blaine of 3850 The variations in B0 and Ec due to GA additions when tests are performed in real-scale or laboratory mill following the locked-cycle method are plotted in Regardless of GA additions, it is interesting to note that the variations in Ec determined using the locked-cycle and industrial mills were pretty close to each other, as these varied within −10% The variations in R-45, Unlike traditional grinding, the locked-cycle method generated relatively steeper PSD curves (i.e., higher As earlier mentioned in Phases I and II, the water demand of tested cements did not remarkably vary with the grinding method or GA additions; the values remained within 28.5% The The variations in setting and compressive strengths were remarkably altered when cement was obtained using the traditional laboratory grinding method. For example, This research project was initiated following an industrial grinding test realized to quantify the effect of GA on mill performance and cement properties. Its main objective is to develop a laboratory “locked-cycle” method that simplifies testing and mimics the grinding operations occurring in closed-circuit tube mills. The method consists on screening the laboratory mill content after each grind run to remove undersize, which is then replenished with an equal mass of new clinker. The procedure is repeated until CL becomes constant, thereby reflecting stable mill conditions delivering cement possessing invariable Blaine fineness, sieve residues, and PSD curves. Due to a scale effect, industrial testing resulted in lower CL magnitudes when compared to those obtained from the locked-cycle laboratory method. However, the Ec and its rate of decrease due to GA additions were remarkably close to each other, reflecting the adequacy of the proposed method. It is to be noted that excessively high Ec values were noted when the traditional grinding method was used (i.e., grinding for enough time until reaching the targeted Blaine of the whole cement mixture). The locked-cycle method generated cement mixtures possessing PSD curves fundamentally similar to those obtained from industrial testing. Hence, the addition of GA led to narrower PSD curves and shifting towards smaller diameters, given the reduced percentage of particles finer than around 5 The author wishes to acknowledge the support provided by Holderchem Building Chemicals, Amchit, Lebanon.
