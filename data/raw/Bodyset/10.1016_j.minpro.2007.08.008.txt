The work presents a theoretical and experimental assessment of the mechanical power absorption by a prototype horizontal ring mill, during the continuous comminution of olivine with feed rates for a wide range of operating conditions. The forces acting on a ring element of a prototype ring mill under continuous operating conditions have been theoretically calculated and it has been experimentally confirmed that they are proportional to the square of the rotational speed. A linear variation of power with feed rate has been established and a functional relationship between consumed power and rotational speed is also proposed. Results demonstrate that there exists a feed rate for which the value of the friction coefficient between the rings and the powdered material is minimized, independently of the rotational speed. It was further found that the product size depends on the absorbed mechanical power and it decreases with increasing power values.Power consumption is an important parameter in every industrial machine since it affects its design as well as the price of the product. Comminution is among the most demanding processes, consuming large amounts of electric energy ( The present work examines the mechanical power absorption by a prototype horizontal ring-mill developed at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), for milling of olivine ores. The development of a low cost ring-mill capable of pulverizing materials with a broad spectrum of mechanical and physical properties started at NTUA in 1996 ( Free choice of the ratio of normal to shear forces and better adaptability of the machine to the fracture criterion of the material with significant energy savings. The grinding media (rings), as they freely rotate, can partially slide in the interior of the cylindrical drum and can trap and fracture particles with very small dimensions. Machine elements subject to wear can be chosen out of cheap materials (readily available commercial tubes that need only low cost cutting to be adapted as replacement parts). The active surface to volume ratio of the system is sufficiently small to result in a high productivity. In the past ( Olivine is an industrial mineral compound of silicon with Fe and Mg with the “general” chemical formula (Mg,Fe)2SiO4. Geologically, it is formed during the outflow of magma and the subsequent rapid cooling of the latter. It is a super-alkaline (pH Olivine is generally used as a refractory material in applications requiring temperatures up to 1600 °C, in casting foundries as olivinic sand for the construction of moulds, as slag conditioner in blast furnaces, in the sand-blasting of metals, as a soil improver of acid soils (due to its highly alkaline character), in metallurgy, where through the sublimation of MgO from olivine is obtained the precious lightweight metallic Mg for the automotive and aerospace industries, in the chemical industry for the production of sulphuric magnesium – used in agricultural fertilizers and in the neutralization of acid waste – and as a filler of thermal insulation in underwater cables ( The olivine used in the current work is mined from the deposits of Macedonian Olivine Ltd, Kozani, Greece. The current commercial exploitation requires grain sizes in the range of 0.74–4 mm, while there is interest for grain-size fractions in the range of 200–500 μm for use as a substitute of fine-grain refractory material (water glass, sodium silicate, chromium anhydrite etc.). After the crushing process, 5–7% of the total production in the size range of less than 2 mm, corresponding to 300–500 tons annually, remains unexploitable. The current work examines comminution parameters affecting the production of a high added value material after grinding the wastes to the − The components of the ring mill are shown in A force analysis has already been presented by The rotational speed of the ring around its axis is very low and corresponds only to 5% of the theoretical value of a ring rolling without losses on the material surface. ( During operation, the ring exerts a centrifugal force  Forces The design angle Eq. If The centrifugal force exerted on the rings is given by Eq. density of the ring material (kg/m distance between the centers of the mill and the ring, OO rotational speed (RPM) The distributed centrifugal force is given by: The calculated values of the distributed centrifugal force, During mill operation, each ring – towed by the rod – is pressed against the material due to the centrifugal force The value of Assuming that eccentricity The power absorbed by the mill is given by: Substituting force The above theoretical analysis indicates that power is expected to vary proportionally to the 3rd power of the rotational speed. However, as shown from the experimental results of the next paragraph, this is not totally valid because the friction coefficient,  The ground material is olivine in granular form with initial size The measured variation of power for various throughput values and rotational speeds are presented in A linear increase in power consumption is measured with increasing feed rate (    It can easily be noticed from If it is assumed that the coefficient of friction is a function of the rotational speed, it is necessary to perform a series of new experiments with different mill and feed materials in order to be able to prove it, which is beyond the scope of the present work. Such experiments would permit the derivation of a new theoretical model to highlight the sensitivity of the variation of the coefficient of friction on the rotational speed, the assumed value of eccentricity ( In The variation of specific energy consumption in kWh/t as a function of throughput value is shown in  The forces acting on a ring element of a prototype ring mill under continuous operating conditions as well as the absorbed mechanical power have been theoretically calculated. It has been experimentally confirmed that the consumed mechanical power is not proportional to  distance between the centers of the mill and the ring OO rod diameter (mm) ring internal diameter (mm) ring outer diameter (mm) eccentricity of material force force between rod and ring (N) component of material force (N) component of rod-mill center distance (mm) length of the rings (m) mechanical torque (Nm) ring mass (kg) mechanical power (W) rotational speed (RPM) center of the mill center of the rod center of the ring force normal to the ring (N) distributed centrifugal force on the rings (N/m) centrifugal force (N) rod radius (mm) force tangential to the ring (N) total friction coefficient design angle (°) angular velocity (r/s) arc of rotation (°) density of steel (7165 kg/m
