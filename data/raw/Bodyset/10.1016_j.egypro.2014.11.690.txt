A basic evaluation of the entire NH4-salts pH swing mineral carbonation process steel slag based system including CO2 capture, ammonia absorption and regeneration of additives, has been investigated to evaluate its feasibility at industrial scale.
                  Heat released from mineral dissolution, pH adjustment and precipitation of impurities, carbonation reaction and CO2 capture was
                  2.3 MWh/tCO2 and could be recovered using heat exchangers and reused within the mineralization process to heat-up the incoming streams of steel slag, ammonium sulphate and water. Heat required, mainly from water evaporation and regeneration of additives, is reported to be 20 MWh/tCO2.
