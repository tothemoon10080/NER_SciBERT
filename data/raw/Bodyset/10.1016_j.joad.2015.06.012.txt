Objective
                  To investigate that if the hybrid external fixation is the definitive treatment and management of tibial extra articular and intra-articular pilon fractures of the adult in emergency.
               
                  Methods
                  We treated 237 cases of pilon fractures using hybrid external fixation with or without minimal osteosynthesis from February 1999 to December 2014. All fractures were classified according to the Association for the Study of Internal Fixation. The three groups were represented by 108 patients (45.5%) for the Type A; 75 patients (31.8%) for Type B and 54 patients (22.7%) for Type C. Road accidents [118 patients (50.0%)] were the most common cause of tibial pilon fractures.
               
                  Results
                  According to a mean follow-up of 7.3 years we had bone healing after 4.8 months from surgery in the 61.18% of the patients. The results were subjectively excellent, while the 54.00% were objectively excellent according to Ovadia and Beals score, and the results showed 29 complications.

                  From our data hybrid external fixation with or without minimal fixation is a good surgical method to treat pilon fractures.Tibial pilon fractures are complex and difficult to treat. They represent about 1% of all fractures of the lower extremities, and up to 10% of the tibial fractures Pilon fractures are more common in men than in women The tibial pilon, taken as an anatomical unit, shows a thin skin, a precarious vascularization and no muscle insertions; these factors concur to make the healing phenomena of the soft tissue more complex, and favor the exposure of fractures due to high-energy trauma on this segment (20%–25% of these fractures are exposed) From February 1999 to December 2014, at the UOC Orthopedics and Traumatology of AORNG Rummo of Benevento, we treated 237 tibial pilon fractures using hybrid external fixation with or without a percutaneous synthesis with cannulated wires or Kirschner's wires. The average age of the study population was 43.6 years (range 16–65 years), the sex ratio was 3.65 to 1; males were 186 and women 51 ( The evaluation criteria of the two groups were: the visual analog pain scale (VAS) of the traumatized ankle; the subjective/objective Ovadia and Beals score; the time, the average derigidification time of the system; the average time of return to walk freely; the average healing time of the fracture, and complications. The endpoint assessment was set at 12 months for both groups. All patients had soon moved the ankle passively and actively. Derigification was performed by removing all those components of the external fixator which reduced the lever arm, making the implant dynamic. The degree of pain measured with VAS decreased on average within 12 months from the trauma: 0 points VAS before trauma, 9.8 (range 8–10) points VAS at moment of the trauma, 4.2 (range 3–6) points VAS 1 month after the trauma, 3.8 (range 2–5) points VAS 3 months after the trauma; 2.2 (range 0–4) points VAS 6 months after the trauma; 1.6 (range 0–4) point VAS 12 months after the trauma. The radiographic bone healing occurred in about 4.8 months (range 4–7.5 months) while derigidification of the external fixator was performed on average at 2.1 months (range 2–6 months) after surgery. The total weight-bearing on the lower limb was granted to approximately at 2.4 months from the trauma (range 2.0–3.2 months) after surgery. A total of 145 out of 237 patients (61.18%) had excellent subjective results, while 54.00% (128 out of 237) had excellent results from the objective point of view; good results with 68 (28.69%) patients in subjective view and 82 (34.60%) in objective view; discrete results with 17 (7.17%) patients in subjective view and 22 (9.28%) in objective view; insufficient results with 7 (2.95%) patients in subjective view and 5 (2.12%) in objective view. During the follow-up period of about 7.3 years (range 6 months–15 years), we had 29 complications: 21 Ankle's osteoarthritis; 2 skin infection; 1 malunion; 1 nonunion; 2 delayed bone healing; 1 bad alignment pro curved/retro curved < 10; 1 bad alignment in varus/valgus > 5. However, the complications of mobilization of proximal fiches, breaking distal K-wires, breaking implant and deep infections were not observed. The main objectives of the treatment of tibial pilon fractures are the maintenance of length, recreation of the joint surfaces and restoration of limb alignment. Open reduction provides the safest way of achieving fracture reduction and restoring joint congruity, considering also the possibility of external fixation to restore severe articular comminution in Type C fractures (AO/OTA) The rate of amputation, arthritis, chronic osteomyelitis and dehiscence of the surgical wound stood at approximately 2% with the use of open reduction and internal fixation with a rate of skin necrosis of 13% On the basis of these results and of what we found in the literature, we understand that the use of a technique limits the minimum surgical trauma of soft tissues and bone component, while ensuring a good primary stability, an early joint mobilization is undoubtedly to be preferred for the treatment of this type of injury. The complexity of the treatment of tibial pilon fractures and the importance of further studies (including randomized controlled trials) directed at the formulation of evidence-based recommendations for treatment.
