Azolethione derivatives have attracted much attention in coordination chemistry, but their engineering applications as metal corrosion inhibitors or flotation collectors remain underexplored. In this work, the chemical reactivity of azolethione surfactants was investigated using density functional theory (DFT) method. The results indicate that the S and N atoms in the conjugated azolethione group of 5-heptyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione (HpOT), 5-heptyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thione (HpST), 5-heptyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (HpNT), 4-amino-5-heptyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (HpATT) and 6-heptyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3-thione (HpNNT) are the chemical reaction center. Based on the electron-donating ability, the reactivity of azolethione derivatives is forecasted to be HpNNT > HpNT > HpATT > HpST > HpOT. The computed binding energies of heptyl-substituted azolethione ions with Cu2+ and Cu+ are less than −150 kJ/mol, implying the potential chemisorption of azolethione compounds on the surfaces of copper minerals/metal/alloys. The micro-flotation results indicate that the heptyl azolethione surfactants are excellent collectors for the flotation of chalcopyrite and malachite. The collecting ability to malachite is in the sequence of HpOT > HpNT > HpATT > HpST > HpNNT, matching precisely with the results of contact angle measurements. This study provides an atomic scale understanding of the structure-property relationship of azolethione derivatives as chelating agents for copper minerals flotation and copper corrosion inhibition.Froth flotation is a physicochemical process widely used in the mining industry to recover the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals. Based on the relative surface hydrophobicity of the mineral particles, the flotation occurs in tanks or columns equipped with an agitator and air inlet. This process involves adding flotation collectors which selectively impart sufficient surface hydrophobicity to the targeted mineral, boosting the attachment of the desired mineral to air bubbles. Therefore, flotation collectors play a vital role in the successful recovery of valuable minerals The structure of flotation collector consists of a polar group ( With the ever-increasing depletion of high-grade ores, efficiently processing the complex ores has become one of the most difficult challenges facing the mining industry. It is widely recognized that rational design/selection of tailored flotation collectors to the specific ore would give rise to a considerable increase in flotation recovery and a notable decrease in the reagent cost Owing to the remarkable progress in the computer power, new mathematics, and robust computer programs during the recent decades, computational chemistry has developed to the extent that its importance has been recognized to be on a par with experimental chemistry in investigating the physiochemical properties of chemical system and reactions. Among plenty of useful computational chemistry methods, density functional theory (DFT), with excellent computational accuracy and efficiency, has been widely used to study the electronic properties and atomic structure of various chemical systems Azolethione derivatives, a unique family of compounds incorporating N- and S-donor atoms such as 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-thione, 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thione, 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione, 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-thione, have received fairly extensive attention in the field of coordination chemistry and surface engineering owing to their exceptional chelating ability toward transition metal ions and excellent corrosion inhibition performance Considering that azolethione derivatives possess particular binding affinity toward Cu It is a general scientific consensus that more powerful mineral/metal-selective reagents need to be designed to meet the requirements of separating valuable minerals from refractory ores or inhibiting metal corrosion. Such reagents can only be designed through identifying the structural criteria for a compound to be highly selective towards a given mineral/metal. Although there are already some reports concerning the flotation studies of each kind of azolethione compounds mentioned above, the comparative study of the structure-property relationship of azolethione derivatives, to the best of our knowledge, has never before been explored. It is well established that the structure-reactivity relationship study is of utmost importance to develop a theoretical framework to guide the design of novel high-performance flotation collectors All calculations in this work were performed via Gaussian 09 software package The binding energy (Δ Where Δ To illustrate the effect of polar group on the chemical reactivity of azolethione derivatives, electronic structure parameters, including electronic chemical potential (µ) The dipole moment is a useful descriptor for the van der Waals interaction between two chemical species Where The global electrophilicity index (ω) allows for the quantitative description of the electrophilic or nucleophilic nature of chemical species, physically denoting the tendency to accept electrons, which can be defined as Micro-flotation experiments were performed in a 220 mL modified Hallimond tube. The malachite or chalcopyrite samples (purity > 95%) with the particle size ranging from 38 to 76 µm The detailed flotation procedures have been reported in the published literature Where ε is the flotation recovery of a single mineral, The contact angle of malachite was measured on a JC2000C contact angle analyzer (Shanghai Zhongchen, China) in terms of the reported method For all the azolethione compounds examined, as shown in The optimized structures for all chemical species of azolethione derivatives were displayed in  As seen from the The calculated values of dipole moment, chemical reactivity indexes (µ, ŋ and ω), frontier orbital energies and total energy for HpOT, HpST, HpNT, HpATT and HpNNT were given in Dipole moment, as a measure of molecular polarity, is closely correlated with the van der Waals interactions The HOMO energies of the ion species of azolethione derivatives increase in the following order: HpOT < HpST < HpATT < HpNT < HpNNT. In terms of their ability to donate valence electrons (to form the normal covalent bond with metal species on mineral or metal surfaces) The LUMO energies of the ion species of azolethione derivatives follow the pattern: HpST For the ion species of azolethione derivatives, the computed ŋ values of HpOT > HpNT > HpST indicate that the absolute chemical hardness decreases with the replacement of oxygen atom by a nitrogen atom and a sulfur atom. The order of calculated ω values is HpNNT < HpNT < HpATT < HpOT  < < HpST, which implies that the HpST ion is the strongest electrophile, as also evidenced by the decreasing µ values (HpNNT > HpNT > HpATT > HpOT > HpST). For the azolethione-copper system, it has been reported that the azolethione-Cu(I) complexes are the chemical species responsible for imparting hydrophobicity to the mineral (or metal) surface and triggering subsequent flotation response (or corrosion inhibition). The Cu(I) ion, being the closed-shell d In order to understand the contribution of atomic orbitals to the frontier molecular orbitals both qualitatively and quantitatively, the compositions of frontier molecular orbitals of azolethione derivatives were graphically presented in  Based on the significant contribution of S and N2 or N3 atoms to the HOMO of azolethione anions, they may play a major role in the azolethione-mineral/metal interaction. The preliminary analysis is well corroborated by the previously published literature As evident in The calculated values of Mulliken and natural atomic charges were listed in Among the HpOT, HpST and HpNT anions, the natural charges of S6 and N3 or N2 atoms are more negative than other atoms in the functional group, which is in line with their extensive involvement in bond formation with metal atoms Based on the results and analyses above, it can be safely concluded that the exocyclic S atom and endocyclic N3 or N2 atom in the azolethione group are of the chemical reaction center for azolethione derivatives. The sulfur and nitrogen atoms usually show strong electron-donating ability and weak electron-accepting ability. Given that azolethione derivatives are chelating-type flotation collectors or corrosion inhibitors, the azolethione-mineral/metal interaction may be potentially dictated by the electron donor properties of S and N3 or N2 atoms. Thus, the HOMO energy and composition of azolethione derivatives would be of paramount importance in determining their flotation or corrosion inhibition performance, while their LUMO energy and composition play a secondary role. For the ionized species of azolethione derivatives, the key parameters related to their chemical reactivity in aqueous solution were summarized in In order to further explore the potential engineering application of azolethione derivatives as flotation collectors for copper minerals or corrosion inhibitor for copper metal/alloy, their interactions with cupric and cuprous ions in aqueous solutions were studied theoretically by using the computation method described in As shown in One of the major goals of structure-activity relationship study is to develop a scientifically robust framework to achieve a priori theoretical prediction of flotation performance or corrosion inhibition ability for the untested compounds. In order to verify the validity of the aforementioned theoretical analysis, micro-flotation experiments regarding the recovery of malachite and chalcopyrite have been carried out. Heptyl-substituted azolethione derivatives have been synthesized in our lab according to the reported approaches It is well documented that there are two schemes for flotation recovery of oxide copper minerals: (i) prior sulfidization followed by flotation, and (ii) direct flotation. For the latter option, the stability of surface complexes plays an important role in the direct flotation of oxide copper minerals Using heptyl-substituted azolethione derivatives as flotation collectors, the effect of pH value or collector dose on the flotation recovery of malachite was displayed in The contact angle of malachite surfaces without or with adsorption of azolethione derivatives was measured, and its average value and standard deviation were shown in Employing heptyl-substituted azolethione derivatives as flotation collectors, the influence of pH value or collector dosage on the flotation recovery of chalcopyrite was shown in The sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen atoms in the azolethione group exert a major influence on the chemical reactivity of heptyl-substituted azolethione derivatives. In the case of HpOT, HpST and HpNT, the frontier orbital energies, atomic charges and the interaction energies with Cu The adsorption of azolethione derivatives on to mineral surfaces through chelation is an essential precondition for the selective flotation enrichment of valuable minerals. This process is closely related to the affinity of minerophilic group toward mineral surfaces. Additionally, other physicochemical properties such as hydrophile-lipophile balance, adsorption kinetics, foaming power, distribution species in solutions and etc., are important factors affecting the flotation performance of flotation collectors. After the adsorption of azolethione collectors on to the malachite surface, the contact angles followed the pattern: HpOT > HpNT > HpATT > HpST > HpNNT, which matched well with the results of malachite flotation. Thus, given that the chemisorption of azolethione compounds on malachite is strong enough, their hydrophobization ability and adsorption rate to malachite surfaces might play an important role in distinguishing their flotation performances. By increasing the collector dose, the difference in the flotation recovery of malachite could be nearly eliminated (see The micro-flotation results as listed in In addition, the discrepancy between theoretical prediction and experimental observation may arise from the fact that flotation system is inherently a multiscale, multiphase and dynamic process. The electronic properties of flotation collectors as well as the simplified modeling of collector-metal interaction are only the essential factors for evaluating the flotation performances of azolethione surfactants. Apart from these bonding factors, other physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity, adsorption kinetics, foam property, distribution species in solutions, etc., may be also significant factors affecting the flotation performance of collectors. Nevertheless, the chemical reactivity of chelators plays an indispensable and essential role in rational design and development of flotation collectors or corrosion inhibitors. In this work, the molecular structures of azolethione derivatives were modeled using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-311 + G (d, p) level in both vacuum and aqueous phases. The binding energies of azolethione anions with Cu The exocyclic S atom is the chemical reaction center of the investigated azolethione anions, and the endocyclic heteroatoms (or the exocyclic N atom for HpATT) in the azole ring might also attend the bonding interaction with metal atoms. In terms of the theoretical study of azolethione-Cu In terms of the chemical reactivity descriptors and electronic structure analyses, the theoretically predicted electron-donating ability via normal covalent bond and electrostatic interaction is in the order of HpNNT > HpNT > HpATT > HpST > HpOT, while the electron-accepting ability to form back-donating covalent bond follows the trend of HpST > HpOT > HpATT ≥ HpNT > HpNNT. The designed heptyl azolethione compounds exhibited outstanding collecting performance for the flotation of chalcopyrite and malachite. Given that the chemisorption of azolethione derivatives on to copper minerals is adequately strong, their hydrophobization ability or adsorption rate to malachite and chalcopyrite surfaces might play a key role in distinguishing their flotation performances. With a small increase in the collector dose, the difference in the flotation recovery of malachite and chalcopyrite could be almost negligible. Based on the chemical reactivity, the heptyl-substituted azolethione compounds hold great promise for practical engineering application in corrosion inhibition of copper metal/alloy as well as flotation separation and recovery of Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Pt and Pd minerals.
