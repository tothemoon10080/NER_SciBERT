Elimination/mineralization of paracetamol (PCT) was investigated by catalytic oxidation under ultrasound, UV and both. The catalyst was synthesized by immobilization of nPt on TiO2 to benefit from the ability of Pt to facilitate charge transfer processes and to separate e−/h+ pairs. It was found that increasing the Pt-loading enhanced the rate of sonochemical reactions, but retarded that of photolytic reactions, due to reduced UV absorption on the surface. Simultaneous application of sonolysis and photolysis was synergistic due to disaggregation of the particles and homogenization of the active species over the catalyst surface. The decay of PCT was highly dependent on the availability of OH, as the reactions were nearly terminated in the presence of a strong OH scavenger-2-propanol. However, a remarkable rate enhancement was observed in the presence of a suitable dose of I−, which scavenges both OH and

                     . The result was explained by the production of excess radicals upon sonolysis of iodide solutions, and the reactivity of PCT with them. Finally, carbon mineralization was significantly hindered in the presence of both scavengers due to increased competition for OH and inefficient formation of hydroquinone arising from reduced availability of

                     .The presence of pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater is an emerging issue because of their uncontrolled release and complex molecular structure, which makes it difficult to remove by conventional biological processes. Hence, residues of pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater effluent are transmitted to surface water, groundwater and even drinking water to impose a variety of health risks ( Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as effective means of eliminating pharmaceuticals in water, either as alternatives or complementary tools to conventional water treatment options. Studies on the degradation of PCT by AOPs have focused on ozonation ( Advances in nanoscience during the last decade have shown that fabrication, characterization, and manipulation of novel materials leads to nano-structured composites that can effectively be used in heterogeneous catalysis ( The use of noble metals (Pt, Pd, Ag, Au) as support materials on TiO Platinum is one of the most effective noble metals for making TiO Oxidation of organic compounds in photocatalytic processes is initiated by reactions with aqueous phase A very common scavenger of The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of decorating the surface of commercial TiO Paracetamol sulfate potassium was purchased from Sigma (>97% purity) to make a standard solution. Test samples were prepared using commercially available pills (500 mg), as described in our previous work ( HPLC-grade methanol, reagent grade NaOH, H Pt-TiO Samples were collected at short intervals during 1-h reaction time to analyze the concentration of PCT, TOC, H       The structure, morphology and size of the modified TiO Control Experiments (with 40 μM PCT and no catalysts).    Catalytic Experiments (with 40 μM PCT + 5 mg L    All experiments were run with three replicates to assess data reliability (0.05 < VAR < 5, error margin ≤ ±0.015) and the solution pH was monitored throughout the reaction time to depict the progress of the oxidation process. SEM analysis of catalyst surfaces showed that different loadings of Pt did not alter the shape, morphology or size of TiO Batch adsorption tests with PCT and the nanocomposites with varying Pt-loadings showed that the time to reach equilibrium changed with the quantity of platinum, as it was 60-min with P2 and P4, and 120-min with P1. The data as presented in PCT was sonicated at three different frequencies to select the most effective one. The power deposited in the reactor in each run was estimated by calorimetric analysis as 0.184 W L An additional tool for selecting the best frequency was monitoring of the H The rate of peroxide formation during 15-min sonication of pure water is presented in Sonication of PCT for 1-h at the selected optimum frequency showed that 90% of the compound decomposed via a pseudo-first order rate (k′ = 2.34 s In our previous work reporting the elimination of PCT with Pd- and Au-supported TiO During the last decade a number of researchers have shown that the sonoluminescence produced during cavitation collapse is capable of exciting surfaces of metallic semiconductors through their band gap energies, leading to the generation of e Photocatalytic decomposition of PCT with P2 and P4 was found to proceed faster than that with P1 and TiO Nevertheless, the nanocomposites were slightly better than TiO As discussed in the previous sections, the presence of platinum nanoparticles on TiO Application of photolysis together with acoustic cavitation was expected to provide a synergy via the unique properties of ultrasound for cleaning and polishing of solid surfaces, for separating agglomerated particles, for accelerating the diffusion and mass transfer of solutes (to solid surfaces and their interfaces), and for generating excess reactive species that enhance the rate of redox reactions over the catalyst surface ( We found that PCT decay without catalysts was slower (k = 0.063 min We concluded that the high efficiency of sono-photocatalysis was not only due to the synergy of ultrasound, but also to the roles of Pt and O The experiments were repeated in the presence of 2-propanol (PR) and potassium iodide (KI) to shed light on the reaction sites and the reactive species. It was found that the presence of PR led to a significant inhibition in the rate of decomposition and mineralization of PCT due to the competition for A severe rate inhibition in the presence of 2-propanol indicates that the decay reactions of PCT were highly The hypothesis of alternative reactive species is confirmed in the literature reporting the production of From the above discussion, it is obvious that the enhancement in the rate of PCT decay at low-to-medium doses of KI is due to reparation of the On the other hand, we found that the mineralization process was significantly hindered in the presence of both scavengers, as the percentage of TOC decay in the presence of PR and KI at a scavenger: PCT molar ratio of 218 was 0% and 1.26%, respectively; and that at the low dose of KI (KI: PCT = 35) was 36%, as opposed to 48% mineralization in the absence of the scavengers. The data are presented in It has been reported that byproducts of photocatalytic oxidation of PCT on TiO We further analyzed the concentration of nitrate in the samples to assess the degree of nitrogen mineralization, and found that despite the poor efficiency of C-mineralization in the presence of KI, 19% of organic N-was converted to Sonolytic immobilization of n-platinum on pristine TiO It was found that increasing the Pt-loading enhanced the activity of the catalyst under ultrasonic irradiation (via production of excessive bubbles and The study has also highlighted the role of The research was funded by The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
