Experience curve approach has been used before to predict cost reductions in renewable power technologies. For wind and PV, this prediction came true but not for Concentrating Solar Thermal (CST). The CST has not been able to enjoy sufficiently high deployment rates and therefore has not been able to achieve significant cost reductions. This paper examines the technical reasons for the relatively slow CST uptake over the last two decades and how this can be remedied in the future using different technology.
