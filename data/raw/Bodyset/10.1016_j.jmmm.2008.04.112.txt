Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films were deposited on fused quartz substrate at different substrate temperatures (T
                     s) varying from room temperature (RT) to 850°C using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. All the films in the as-deposited state were X-ray amorphous and non-magnetic at RT. The film deposited at RT after annealing at temperatures T

The PLD has been employed to deposit polycrystalline YIG thin films on fused quartz substrates using a stoichiometric YIG target. The third harmonic (355 The XRD of YIG thin films deposited at different In order to see if post-deposition annealing will help in the observation of XRD peaks, we annealed the RT-deposited film at temperatures ( The above results indicate that post-deposition annealing of PLD YIG thin films deposited on fused quartz substrates even at a lower temperature is more beneficial in the grain growth than the substrate heating. However, we do not observe such a post-deposited annealing effect on PLD YIG thin films when deposited on Si and GGG substrate. We carried out a second experiment in which the films deposited at higher  We measured the magnetization of all the films. No  It is also to be remarked that magnetization values in our PLD YIG thin films on quartz substrates are always lower than the bulk value (1750 Another interesting result from this study is that two different methods of thermal treatment In this paper, we present the study of the PLD YIG thin films deposited at various substrate temperatures up to 850
