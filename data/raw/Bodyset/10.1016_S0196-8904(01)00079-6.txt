When the demand of fresh water does not exceed a few cubic meters, the solar still is a viable option. Productivity enhancement for this process was one of the main goals of the researchers. In this work, the effect of using the floating perforated black plate on the productivity process is investigated theoretically and experimentally at different brine depths under the same operating conditions. A mathematical model is developed to calculate the theoretical productivity of the solar still with the floating perforated black plate. Two experimental still units of 0.25 m2 each are constructed. Comparison between the theoretical and experimental results is considered. In this work, it is found that the results of the developed mathematical model are in good agreement with the experimental results. Also, it is found that using the floating perforated black aluminum plate in the solar still increases solar still productivity by 15% (at brine depth of 3 cm) and 40% (at brine depth of 6 cm.).solar radiation intensity (W/m daily productivity of solar still of plain water (liter/m daily productivity of solar still of floating perforated black plate (liter/m wind speed velocity (m/s) condensation heat transfer coefficient (W/m evaporation heat transfer coefficient (W/m convective heat transfer between glass and ambient (W/m radiative heat transfer coefficient between glass and ambient (W/m convective heat transfer between water and glass cover (W/m radiative heat transfer coefficient between water and glass cover (W/m heat transfer coefficient between floating plate and upper water liner (W/m heat transfer coefficient between floating plate and lower water liner (W/m convection heat transfer coefficient between basin liner and water (W/m overall heat transfer coefficient between side wall and surrounding (W/m overall heat transfer coefficient between bottom wall and surrounding (W/m sky temperature (°C) ambient temperature (°C) inside temperature of glass (°C) outside temperature of glass (°C) vapor temperature (°C) temperature of upper water (°C) temperature of upper plate surface (°C) temperature of lower plate surface (°C) temperature of lower water (°C) water temperature at layer liner temperature (°C) glass absorptivity (dimensionless) fraction of energy absorbed by water (dimensionless) fraction of energy absorbed by black plate (dimensionless) latent heat (J/kg) dynamic viscosity of moist air (kg/m  A solar still, with its lower productivity, does not compete with other desalination techniques. However, when the demand of fresh water does not exceed a few cubic meters, the solar still is a viable option. Productivity enhancement of this process was one of the main goals of researchers In this work, a floating perforated black aluminum plate is employed to maintain film evaporation in the solar still. The effect of using the floating perforated black plate is investigated theoretically and experimentally at different brine depths under the same operating conditions of Suez City. Using the measured values of solar intensity, wind velocity and ambient temperature at the Suez area as input data, the daily productivity of the solar still is calculated. The mathematical model is developed according to the relations of heat transfer coefficients, which were obtained by Ghoraba Temperature gradient across the thickness of the glass cover is insignificant. Heat transfer coefficient is considered to be constant at the selected time interval. Heat capacity of the basin liner and the insulation are neglected. The saline water in the basin is treated as fresh water. The floating perforated black plate is opaque with constant absorptivity of 0.8. The variations in the absorptivity and transmissivity of the glass and water surfaces with the variation in angle of the incoming radiation are neglected.         For the first time interval, with the initialization of the unknown temperatures, the computations of individual heat transfer coefficients are performed at a given climatic conditions. The individual heat transfer coefficients are evaluated at the end of the previous time interval and considered as a constant value in the current time interval. With a reasonable specified tolerance, the solution technique of the considered equations is performed by the Gauss–Seidel iteration method. The updated temperatures will be used in the next time interval as initial values and so on. The rate of condensation for each time interval is calculated at the mean value of the meteorological data of solar intensity, wind speed and ambient temperature as follows: Two units of a single sloped solar still are designed and constructed to maintain the comparison under the same weather conditions. Each unit consists of a metallic box having four sides. These sides are made of steel sheet 2.5 mm thick. Two of these sides are of rectangular shape, while the other sides are trapezoidal. Three holes in each unit are made, two of which are in the base for drainage and distilled water output, and the third hole is in the backside for feeding. The sides of each box are painted white from the inside in order to reflect the solar radiation to the water surface. The base of each unit is painted black to increase the solar absorptivity. Only the base of each unit is insulated with foam (thermal Two mathematical models are coded, the first one for the still of plain water and the second for a solar still with floating plate. The solar still productivity for the two cases were calculated at the same operating conditions. The theoretical results of the two cases for different brine depths, are presented in A comparison between experimental and theoretical results of the productivity of the solar still at different brine depths is presented in To show experimentally and theoretically how much the use of the floating perforated black plate affected the daily productivity, two units are considered at the same brine depth, the first unit with the black perforated plate and the second with a plain water surface. The percentage increase in productivity is calculated based on the following relation,  The following two points may be concluded: (1) The results of the proposed mathematical model are in good agreement with those of the experimental model of the solar still with floating aluminum perforated black plate. (2) Using the floating aluminum perforated black plate in the solar still increases the solar still productivity by 15% for a water depth of 3 cm and 40% for a water depth of 6 cm.
