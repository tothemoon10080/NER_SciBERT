The contribution of this paper on the relationship of energy–particle size in the comminution of brittle particulate materials is based on two concepts: (a) the potential energy of a single particle and (b) the size distribution of particles in a particulate material. The potential energy Q
                     
                        x
                      of a single particle of size x is defined as the energy required to create this particle. By definition Q

                     =q

                        x
                      is the specific energy per unit mass and M
                     
                        x

                        m
                     ), where C and m are constants. For particulate materials, the particle distribution is assumed to be the Gates, Gaudin, Schuhmann: P
                     
                        x
                     =W

                     , where P
                     
                        x
                      is the cumulative particle mass finer than x, W
                     0 is the total mass of the assembly, y is the maximum particle size (size modulus) and α is a constant (distribution modulus). The potential energy E
                     
                        y
                      of a particle assembly is defined as the total energy of its particles. It is shown that for m>1 and α−m≠−1 then E

                      and for α−m=−1 then E
                     
                        y
                     =(CW

The conditions for the application of the formulae above are presented in the text.particle size surface of a particle surface coefficient volume of a particle volume coefficient mass of a particle of size particle density mass of a particulate material finer than size size modulus of a particulate material (max. size for GGS distribution) distribution modulus of a particulate material total mass of a particulate material energy of a single particle specific energy of a single particle energy of a particulate material of size modulus specific energy of a particulate material of size modulus energy to go from a particulate material of size exponent exponent constants according to index constants defined in the text Comminution is a fundamental operation of mineral processing and size reduction circuits expend significant amounts of energy. It is also generally recognised that the actual energy required to reduce the particle size of a brittle material is a small percentage [about 4% ( Recently the author ( 1. The type of size distribution of the particles produced during grinding is kept constant for all crushing events. In the present work it is assumed to be the GGS described by Eq. 2.

The relationship energy–particle size for a single particle is assumed to be given by the empirical formula ( 5. By definition the energy 6. The mass of a particle of size 7.

In accordance with the above the energy difference that one has to expend in order to go from the assembly of size As mentioned above the integration of  The derivative of  The specific energy     The case for Values of Frictionless crusher ( Rod-mill/ball mill tests assume the energy used for breaking the particles is a constant proportion of that expended by the mill. In these tests one can either relate the size modulus to the energy used ( Experimental data adopted from the literature are presented in From these data, one can see that for most minerals the quantity ( The values of ( From the same data, it is also obvious that for the materials used and the size range of the particles tested, the value of Using Eqs. For particulate materials which have a GGS distribution, the specific energy is plotted in For comparison, According to the model presented above, the energy required for comminution depends on the size of the material and its distribution. The energy demand increases as size decreases and the increased rate depends on the exponent (1− The model presented is a general one and includes those of As an example of the above mechanism, Some of the conclusions above are well known and are mentioned only for the completeness of the presentation. Another interesting observation is the fact that the size distribution of a particulate material after breaking is not arbitrary. Not only does the size modulus depend on energy but the distribution modulus is also a function of the breaking mechanism. As mentioned above according to the experimental data, the value of the quantity ( As mentioned above, the equation suggested by Bond did not include the size distribution of the material and, in order to overcome this difficulty, he defined the size of a particulate material as the 80% passing size (P80). Mathematically an infinite number of distributions can have the same P80 and for this reason, some negative criticism was addressed to Bond ( . As is well known the basic theories that describe the relationship of energy and particle size in comminution are those of In an effort to describe the comminution process by a general theory that will include those above as partial cases, Eq. For values of Starting from Eq. Assuming that the energy of the initial material of size Regardless of this treatment the contribution made by Charles is considerable since he is the first to take into account the size distribution and collect experimental data that show the close relation between In a previous attempt to describe the relationship between energy and particle size in comminution, An analysis of the mathematical form of
