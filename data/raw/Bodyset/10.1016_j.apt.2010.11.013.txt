In this study, the influence of the fluidized bed height on the float–sink of different sized spheres in a gas–solid fluidized bed was investigated. Fluidized beds with heights h
                     =200, 150, 100 and 50mm were prepared using a cylindrical column of inner diameter=290mm and a mixture of zircon sand and iron powder as the fluidized medium. Float–sink experiments were carried out using density adjusted spheres of diameter D
                     sp
                     =40, 30, 20 and 10mm. It was found that the float–sink performance at D
                     sp
                     ⩾20mm is not affected by the height of the bed, and the sharpness of separation (the density range where spheres neither float nor sink completely) is less than or equal to 200kg/m3. In the case of D
                     sp
                     =10mm, the sharpness of separation is a larger value (1100kg/m3 at h
                     =200mm), whereas it decreases with decreasing h and is 400kg/m3 at h
                     =50mm. The fluctuation of the surface height of the fluidized bed was visually recorded. The fluctuation is reduced by reducing h. The fluctuation vs. h correlates with the sharpness of separation at D
                     sp
                     =10mm vs. h. These results indicate that the dry float–sink separation of smaller sized spheres is improved as the fluctuation of fluidized bed surface is decreased by reducing the fluidized bed height.Separation by density of an object is an indispensable unit operation for industry, in particular, for mineral processing. Generally, wet float–sink separation in a dense suspension of fine particles in a liquid is utilized The gas–solid fluidized bed has the potential to replace the wet separation. The fluidized bed has liquid-like properties such as density and viscosity Zircon sand with bulk density equal to 2900 Density adjusted spheres of diameter  In order to investigate why floating of the spheres of In summary, spheres of diameter This study was supported by Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
