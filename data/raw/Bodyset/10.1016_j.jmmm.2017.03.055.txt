This happens despite of their high saturation magnetization (MS) and Curie temperature (TC) values. It was observed that by selecting an appropriate magnetic field the temperature can be rose exactly near the therapeutic temperature and thus it will help to selectively kill the cancerous cells leaving normal cells unaffected. These nanoparticles (size around 8–15nm) were produced by single step microwave refluxing technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrates that samples were essentially single phase except for x
                     =0.5 sample. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study for the samples demonstrated that Ce was present in both Ce3+ and Ce4+ states. The saturation magnetization value of the samples decreased sharply from 62Am2/kg for x
                     =0.01 to 19Am2/kg for x
                     =0.1. This value further decreased with increased Ce doping.Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) belonging to the family of iron oxides are extensively used in the field of biomedicine due its excellent biocompatibility and chemical stability Preferential heating of the cancerous cell beyond physiological temperature (∼37 Although, several magnetic materials with Curie temperature ∼50 Researchers have extensively focussed on the synthesis of undoped as well as doped Fe For the synthesis of Ce doped magnetite nanoparticles, (NH The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the samples were obtained using a Phillips X'pert Pro Advanced powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ  In the spinel structure of Fe TEM bright field micrographs of Ce In order to identify the chemical oxidation states of the elements present on the surface of Ce substituted Fe One Fe Room temperature magnetisation vs. field curves for Ce All the samples except x In order to carry out magnetic hyperthermia experiment, ferrofluids of Ce  Even Zr- and Hf-substituted magnetites exhibited T  The average size below 15
