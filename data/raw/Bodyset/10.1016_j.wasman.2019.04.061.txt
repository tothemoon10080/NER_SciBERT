Printed circuit boards (PCB) are an essential component of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and account for roughly 5% of the mass of EEE. Knowledge about the chemical composition of PCB is crucial to enable an enhanced recycling, especially for elements considered critical regarding their economic importance and supply risk (e.g. precious metals or specialty metals such as tantalum, germanium, gallium). No standard reference methods exist for determining the chemical composition of PCB. Previously published element mass fractions cover a wide range and were produced with numerous methods for sample preparation, digestion, and measurement. This impedes comparability of PCB composition from different studies. To investigate sample- and element-specific effects of applied methods a PCB sample from desktop PC was analysed in two separate labs. One lab applied sample- and element-specific validated methods (aqua regia, HF, H2SO4 blend; ICP-OES, QQQ-ICP-MS), providing reference values, the other applied routine in-house methods (aqua regia; ICP-OES, ICP-MS) to assess the validity of in-house methods for chemical analysis of PCB. A t-test was used to identify elements depicting significant differences between validated and in-house methods. For base metals, in-house methods led to comparable results. For precious, specialty, and hazardous metals as well as REE investigated in this study, significant differences were detected. With respect to all results for in-house methods in this study, the combination of aqua regia and ICP-OES led to less significant differences than aqua regia and ICP-MS. The results show that sample- and element-specific quality assurance is crucial to prevent analytical bias.7 ml aqua regia 10 ml aqua regia 8.5 ml HF-special-blend: 5 ml H2SO4 48 % + 1 ml HNO3 65 % Printed circuit boards (PCB) are an essential component of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Conductive lines are printed on an insulated, inflexible or flexible board made of glass fiber reinforced polymers, such as epoxy resin, and electrically connect electronic components mounted on the board to form a working circuit. Electronic components are e.g. transistors, capacitors, integrated circuits (IC), central processing units (CPU), and other functional units. ( From 2000 to 2015 the total mass of PCB in EEE placed on market (POM) in the EU decreased from 0.3·10 Recently, PCB have become of special interest since its components contain valuable and rare elements, many of which are considered critical for the EU ( Many studies report data on PCB composition applying a multitude of methods for sampling, sample preparation, and chemical analysis, which results in an extensive but diverse data basis. The aim of this study is to investigate sample- and element-specific effects of chemical analysis methods on the resulting compositional data. These effects and their influence affect the construction of a knowledge base of the urban mine. To achieve this, a PCB sample from desktop PC was analysed by two separate labs with two different objectives. Lab 1 aimed at determining the elemental composition of the sample as accurately as possible by applying extensive quality assurance measures and developing sample- and element-specific wet-chemical analysis methods. The analysis results serve as reference values in this study. Lab 2 represents the standard procedure for chemical analysis and aimed at determining the elemental composition of the sample by applying analytical in-house methods and good analytical practice. This approach compares to the studies cited above, where commercial or research labs conducted the chemical analysis. A detailed comparison of the results, including a The PCB sample was analyzed by two labs: lab 1 is Empa Materials Science and Technology, Advanced Analytical Technologies (L1), and lab 2 is Technische Universität Berlin, Chair of Circular Economy and Recycling Technology (L2). L1 applied extensive quality assurance measures to develop sample- and element-specific wet-chemical analysis methods validated according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories ( To represent the standard procedure for chemical analysis, L2 applied analytical in-house methods, also based on DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025, with in some cases less elaborate methods. In this study, the term in-house method stands for single-laboratory methods for digestion and measurement based on existing guidelines, but not fully validated via collaborative trials ( A necessary prerequisite for comparable results of chemical analysis is a homogeneous sample to reduce variability from subsampling. Hence, the objective of sampling and sample preparation in this study was to obtain a PCB sample as homogeneous as possible, not to produce a sample representative for a certain type of PCB and (W)EEE. To achieve this, 15 desktop PC were sampled in September 2009 from a WEEECycle collection point in Delft, the Netherlands. After separating the PCB, components which are difficult to comminute were removed (CPU, fan, graphic card). The resulting PCB sample with a total mass of 11.3 kg was shredded in a two-step approach: (1) coarse comminution with a shredder (MEWA UNICUT) and subsequent sieving and (2) fine comminution with a cutting mill (Retsch ZM 100). The cutting mill in the second shredding step is equipped with an integrated sieve with a mesh size of 0.2 mm and resulted in two fractions. The oversized particles with a grain size  > 0.2 mm, which were not further grindable due to physical-mechanical properties of the material and the technical capability of the cutting mill, were discarded. The material with a grain size < 0.2 mm and a total mass of 960 g represents the PCB sample in this study, constituting 8.5% of the total mass of separated PCB. This means 91.5% of the total mass of separated PCB are lost during the shredding and sieving steps due to oversized particles and are discarded in this study. The sample was further split with a rotary divider (Retsch PTZ) into 8x8 subsamples (1-I, 1-II, 1-III, … , 8-VI, 8-VII, 8-VIII) and then stored in LDPE sample bags at room temperature in dry conditions until analysis. No thermal sample preparation methods were used to maintain the typical sample matrix of PCB, consisting of an organic polymer and metals in different materials and alloys. The obtained sample material is dark grey in color and has a powdery texture. The elements of interest were selected with regard to relevance in mass fraction (base metals), criticality (specialty metals and rare earth elements (REE)), value assessment (precious and specialty metals, REE), and hazardousness (hazardous metals) ( To test the subsamples for homogeneity, seven subsamples (1-II – 1-VIII) were selected, transferred to sample cups (FluXana, SC-4331) including a PP foil seal (FluXana X-Ray Film Circles, 4 µm). Measurements were taken through this seal foil. Each cup was measured three times with ED-XRF. For the homogeneity assessment target elements with a high mass fraction were selected (Cu, Fe, Pb, Sb, Sn, Zn). Al was excluded due to its low atomic mass. An ANOVA Chemical analysis was conducted both non-destructive with energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (ED-XRF) as well as wet-chemically. Measurements with ED-XRF were conducted by both labs, L1 and L2, with the objective to investigate the homogeneity of all subsamples analyzed and pre-scan the sample regarding its composition. L1 used a NITON XL3t (Niton Corporation, Billerica, MA) (denoted as L1-ED-XRF), employing two measurement modes (PLASTIC and MINING) with a measurement duration of 90 s (30 s per filter) and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01%. The samples were filled into sample cups (double open ended, ø 30.9 mm; Chemplex Cat. No. 1530; sealed with Mylar polyester foil, Chemplex Cat. No. 256) for measurement. L2 used a NITON XL3t-Air (Analyticon) (denoted as L2-ED-XRF), employing one measurement mode (MINING) with a measurement duration of 120 s (30 s per filter) and a LOQ of 0.05%. The samples were filled into sample cups (SC-4331 by FluXana and sealed with a PP foil, FluXana X-Ray Film Circles, 4 µm). Elements with an atomic number  < 12 cannot be detected with ED-XRF. Certified reference material was analyzed to assure a correct and consistent measurement of the ED-XRF devices. The content of organic material was determined by gravimetric loss on ignition (LOI) at 550 °C in a muffle furnace (Nabertherm N60H) (in accordance with DIN EN 15935 Sludge, treated biowaste, soil and waste – Determination of loss on ignition ( L1 and L2 analyzed the PCB sample applying a set of wet-chemical analysis methods. L1 used three subsamples (5-I, 5-IV, and 5-VII) and digested for every subsample three portions of the material, resulting in nine single values, each representing one measurement of one digestion. L2 used two subsamples (7-I and 7-III) and digested for every subsample three portions of the material, resulting in six single values, each representing one measurement of one digestion. L1 developed validated methods, in conformity with DIN EN ISO/IEC 17025 ( Element spiking technique by standard addition is applied in both L1 and L2 and serves as an internal quality assurance step. Element spikes are added to the sample before digestion in the form of element standard solutions to test the whole analysis system, from digestion to measurement, using the same digestion acids as for the sample. The added concentrations for all elements under investigation lie within the concentration ranges which were measured in preliminary ED-XRF measurements. As described above, L1 provided nine single values for each element and L2 provided six single values for every element and applied method. To summarize and analyze the data three statistical parameters were calculated: The arithmetic mean Eq.    its related standard deviation Eq. and relative standard deviation Eq. The calculation of the recovery rates (RR) for standard addition and for liquid standard samples are given in Eqs. Eq.

Recovery rate, without matrix: Standard addition is used to check if either the digestion or the measurement has an influence on the analysis result. Spikes are added to blind samples and submitted to the microwave-assisted digestion in the same manner as the samples and are subsequently measured. The RR of the individual elements is calculated as in Eq. Recovery rate, with matrix influence: To examine the effect of the digestion on the analysis result including matrix influence, the samples were spiked as described in Microwave, acid, and measurement device: The influence of microwave settings, acids, and measurement device was investigated with Welch’s This chapter depicts the results of the chemical analysis of the PCB sample and discusses occurring effects. As described above, L1 provided nine single values from nine digestions for each element (n Firstly, the results of the homogeneity assessment are addressed, followed by a description of the composition regarding the elements analyzed. Because of the sample preparation, this PCB sample cannot be regarded as representative for PCB from desktop PC and hence the compositional data cannot be compared with literature data. Subsequently, Welch’s Seven subsamples (1-II – 1-VIII) were analyzed with ED-XRF. An ANOVA This result indicates that the PCB sample with a particle size < 0.2 mm is sufficiently homogeneous for some elements, but not all. In addition, only elements with a sufficiently large mass fraction were tested, hence no assessment about the homogeneity regarding e.g. precious metals can be drawn. PCB are a very complex and heterogeneous sample matrix; hence, this degree of mechanical sample preparation can be assumed acceptable for a comparative study of different wet-chemical analysis methods.  The mass fraction of organic substances, determined as LOI, is 29.2%, i.e. roughly 30% of the PCB sample is composed of the plastic board and other plastic components. Of the elements under investigation, Cu has the largest mass fraction (7.57%), followed by Al (4.81%), Sn (3.87%), Fe (2.51%), and Zn (0.618%), i.e. base metals add up to close to 20% of the PCB. Cu is used in conducts, the copper foil and in some solder alloys, Al is used as sheets on the copper foils to increase heat conductivity ( Precious metals account for only a small mass fraction of the PCB sample (Au 388 ppm, Pd 32.9 ppm, Pt virtually not present in the sample with 0.12 ppm). Ag was not analyzed with wet-chemical methods by L1 due to Cl in the sample material. Ag bonds with Cl and precipitates as AgCl, decreasing the measureable Ag in the digested solution which leads to an underdetermination of Ag. This effect is intensified by HCl containing digestion acids, such as AR. This means that the determination of the Ag mass fraction cannot sufficiently be done using wet chemical analysis (see The total content of all REE analyzed constitute only 174 ppm, with Nd having the largest share (104 ppm); Ce, La, and Pr show mass fractions between 10 and 20 ppm, whereas Gd and Sm lie between 1 and 10 ppm. Regarding specialty metals, Ta has the highest mass fraction (1,710 ppm), followed by Co (643 ppm), Ga (6.16 ppm), and Ge (0.464 ppm). The comparatively high content of Ta can be attributed to tantalum capacitors on PCB ( Within the group of hazardous metals, Pb has the highest mass fraction of 23,400 ppm, Sb is present with 3,510 ppm, Cd with 30.7 ppm, and As with 17.4 ppm. Pb was used in leaded solders before the implementation of the RoHS Directive (European Commission, 2003) in 2002 and is used in some exceptions to this day (European Commission, 2011; As described in For L1-ED-XRF only mean values were available, hence it was not feasible to detect significant differences with a The following paragraphs are organized by the measurement device used in L2. For instance, chapter ICP-OES discusses the results of Welch’s The null hypothesis H In general, ED-XRF (energy-dispersive) is less accurate than WD-XRF (wave-dispersive), due to, inter alia, a higher selectivity ( Welch’s For Sn, Nd, Sm, Cd, and Pb significant differences of L2 from L1 were detected. Cd was analyzed with an equivalent acid (AR) and measurement device (ICP-OES). Sn and Pb were determined with an equivalent device (ICP-OES), but different digestion acids (L1: HCl-HNO The results of Welch’s Precious metals (Au, Pd, Pt) and REE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy) were determined with an equivalent digestion acid (AR) and an equivalent measurement device (ICP-MS). For the analysis of Cd an equivalent acid was used (AR), but a different device (L1: ICP-OES; L2: ICP-MS). For As different acids were used (L1: HNO Of the 15 elements analyzed by L2 with AR and ICP-OES, ten provide acceptable results. For AR and ICP-MS the ratio is disproportionately worse with one out of 16 measurements. Hence, the combination of AR and ICP-OES as in-house method performs sufficiently accurate for a majority of the elements investigated in this study. In the following chapter the different effects influencing the chemical analysis are discussed in more detail, based on the parameters described in Repeatability: After proving that the PCB sample is homogeneous, SD and RSD are sufficient indicators for the repeatability of the sample digestion, due to the fact that the relating single values represent independent digestions. Smaller SD indicates better repeatability of the digestion. The RSD enables a comparison of the deviations between elements with mass fractions in different orders of magnitude. For the base metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Sn, Zn) all RSD for L1 and L2 are < 10% for all methods (ED-XRF and wet-chemical). Hence, we can assume that the digestion of these base metals is robustly repeatable with the digestion methods applied. The precious metals Ag and Au show high RSD for L2-ICP-OES and L2-ICP-MS, which can be due to sample heterogeneity with respect to Ag and Au or it can mean the digestion of these elements is not repeatable in L2. In contrast, Pd displays a small RSD. For REE RSD shows a wide range. Values produced with L2-ICP-MS for Ce, La, and Sm exhibit RSD  < 10%, albeit RSD produced with L2-ICP-OES for Ce and La are higher (18 and 21%). Nd shows comparable RSD for L2-ICP-OES and L2-ICP-MS (11% and 15% resp.). RSD for Gd is 29%. However, for REE with a very small mass fraction, i.e. Pr and Eu with Hence, digestion of this sample matrix is adequately repeatable for base metals. For most of the other elements (elements with a mass fraction < 5,000 ppm) it is possible that the digestion is not sufficiently repeatable, but no definitive conclusion can be drawn due to unknown sample heterogeneity for these elements. Recovery rate, standard addition before digestion: Element-specific, without matrix: All RR for the base metals range between 89% (Cu) and 106% (Zn). Hence, the digestion and measurement of unspiked and spiked blind samples in L2 can be assumed unaffected regarding analysis of base metals. RR for precious metals show sufficient results for Ag and Au (94% and 92%) and a minor underdetermination for Pd (79%). REE depict acceptable RR for Ce (88%), Gd (107%), La (99%), Nd (86%), and Pr (102%). Sm exhibits a larger underdetermination (72%), Eu shows a very large overdetermination (179%). Co provides a sufficient RR rate in the blind sample (92%). This also applies for most hazardous metals. Cd (87%), As (97%), and Pb (93%) exhibit adequate RR. However, this is not true for Sb, which has a very small RR (14%), due to the fact that Sb precipitates as insoluble Sb oxide. In summary, RR including digestion without matrix influence is adequate for all elements, except Sb and Eu. Matrix influence: L1 did not provide wet-chemical analysis results for Ag due to a high Cl concentration in the sample leading to precipitation of Ag as AgCl and consequently an underdetermination of Ag. Although there is no reference value from L1, the comparison with L1-ED-XRF and L2-ED-XRF shows that ED-XRF indeed results in higher measurement values than wet-chemical analysis with L2-AR. Ag results of wet-chemical analysis of L2 exhibit a large SD and hence a large RSD ( RR including digestion with matrix influence are adequate for most elements, but not sufficient for Ag, some REE, and Sb, where effects were already identified. For a sufficient wet-chemical analysis of Ag it is crucial to first analyze for Cl. Regarding REE, the small mass fractions in combination with high mass fractions of base metals are an analytical challenge and easily lead to not robust results. For Sb a sufficient concentration of Cl in the digestion acid is necessary, otherwise Sb precipitates as antimony oxide. Microwave: Acid: The composition and concentration of the digestion acid has a direct influence on the quality of the digestion. E.g. for the digestion of Ta it is necessary to use an HF acid blend, whereas for precious metals and REE AR is the suitable digestion acid ( During digestion, volatile AsH is formed, which may be lost after digestion when the digestion vessels are opened, leading to an RR of 0% in L1 for As in AR. To prevent this As loss, H A variation of the concentration of the applied digestion acids was not investigated in this study. Repeatability: The results provided by L2-ICP-OES and L2-ICP-MS (i.e. the values given by the measurement devices) both represent mean values of two and three single measurements, respectively. This means the ICP-MS used by L2 measures the digested sample three times and displays mean and RSD of these three measurements as analysis result. Examination of the variation of the data shows that RSD was < 2% for all results, i.e. the digested samples were in themselves homogeneous, hence no concentration gradients were detected and the measurements are repeatable. Recovery rate, standard addition without digestion: Element-specific, without matrix: To test the accuracy of the measurement device liquid standard samples in four dilutions with selected elements in varying concentrations were measured with ICP-OES ( Matrix influence, interferences: Regarding Au, L2-ICP-MS shows a high underdetermination (see Measurement device: Where possible, L2 measured elements with both devices, ICP-OES and ICP-MS (Ag, As, Cd, Sb, Zn with ICP-MS in addition to ICP-OES; Au, Ce, La, Nd, Sm with ICP-OES in addition to ICP-MS) ( Due to the limited number of elements for which both ICP-OES and ICP-MS results exist, only a limited informative value can be drawn. In general, ICP-OES analysis is prone to spectral interferences, due to spectral overlaps of emitted radiation. This is not the case for ICP-MS, where the detection criterion is the atomic mass. For REE L2 shows that ICP-MS tends to underdetermine the mass fraction, potentially due to the higher accuracy of the QQQ-ICP-MS in L1. For ICP-OES this is not as clear ( PCB present an exceedingly complex sample matrix with a high mass fraction of base metals and a variety of critical metals in low mass fractions. It is possible to prepare a sufficiently homogeneous sample, yet there are still element-specific challenges for chemical analysis of PCB potentially leading to significant differences from the true element mass fraction. It is not always possible to detect these differences with quality assurance measures, as these measures can also be affected. This was shown using element recovery in blind and sample. These influencing effects impede an accurate characterization of PCB for a harmonized knowledge base for anthropogenic ores. One approach to reduce these effects is the application of representative certified reference materials to test the analysis system. Where no representative certified reference materials exist, interlaboratory tests give information about the sample- and element-specific validity of analytical methods. This study shows that routine in-house methods using AR digestion and ICP-OES are sufficiently accurate for the majority of elements investigated (10 of 15 elements display no significant difference), whereas AR and ICP-MS results in significantly less accurate mass fractions, with the exception of Zn. There is no detectable dependency between mass fraction and accuracy for in-house methods. This means there are elements with high mass fractions which show comparable results for in-house methods and those which display significant differences. The same is valid for elements with low mass fractions. ED-XRF analysis exhibits significant differences for all elements. However, XRF measurements are non-destructive as well as quick and produce a good estimation for elements with a high atomic mass and a high mass fraction.
