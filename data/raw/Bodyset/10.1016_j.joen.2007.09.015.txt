The aim of this study was to evaluate the reaction of the pulp tissue against mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) with or without 10% calcium chloride (CaCl2). Pulpotomies were performed in 4 canines and 8 premolars of two 8-month-old dogs. MTA with or without CaCl2 was applied on the pulp tissue. The animals were killed after 90 days, and the specimens were processed for the microscopic analysis. Pulp tissue response was similar for MTA with and without CaCl2. Pulp vitality was present in all specimens, along with pulp repair with formation of mineralized tissue bridging. The addition of CaCl2 to MTA did not change its biologic properties in formation of mineralized barrier after pulpotomy.
