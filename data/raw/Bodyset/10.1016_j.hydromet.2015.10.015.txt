This study investigated the performance of Amberlite IRC 748 resin in removing calcium ions from highly concentrated potassium chromate solution in a fixed bed column. The exchange capacity increased with initial calcium ion concentration and bed height but decreased as flow rate increased. Four different kinetic models, specifically the bed depth service time (BDST), mass transfer, Thomas, and Yoon–Nelson models, were applied to the experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves and determine the column parameters. The BDST model was extended to the prediction of service times of columns operated at different flow rates and influent concentrations; while the experimental and theoretical data points followed a similar trend, they deviated slightly from each other. The Thomas and Yoon–Nelson model predictions were in very good agreement with the experimental results for all the process parameters studied, indicating that they are suitable for use with these kinds of columns.Chromium trioxide is an important chemical essential to many industries, such as wood preserving, electroplating, leather tanning, metal finishing, and chromic oxide production. However, the typical industrial method for synthesizing it, by decomposing sodium chromate with sulfuric acid, discharges large amounts of waste with high chromium(VI) content, causing serious environmental problems ( Source reduction, or the initial prevention of waste, is the best method for preventing pollution. Chromium trioxide production by ion membrane electrolysis of chromate salts is widely studied in this respect, as it results in near-zero emissions ( We previously used Amberlite IRC 748, a weakly acidic ion exchanger containing an iminodiacetate group, for the effective removal of calcium ions from potassium chromate solution in batch experiments ( For industrial water treatment, ion exchange in a fixed-bed column is preferable, as it is simple to operate and efficiently utilizes the exchanger capacity, resulting in improved effluent quality. The performance of such a system is described by the breakthrough curve, the time and shape of which determine the operation and dynamic response of the column process ( Because mathematical models facilitate the design and assessment of full-scale systems by reducing the number of pilot-scale tests required to optimize operating conditions and design parameters, several have been developed to predict dynamic column behavior ( As a continuation of our previous work, this study evaluated the performance of the Amberlite IRC 748 resin for the removal of calcium ions from potassium chromate solution in a fixed bed column. The effects of design parameters on the shape of the breakthrough curve were investigated, including bed height, influent concentration, and flow rate. The dynamics of the exchange process were modeled by various kinetic models, specifically by the bed depth service time (BDST) model, mass transfer model, Thomas model, and Yoon–Nelson model. Successful design of a column sorption process requires the accurate prediction of the concentration–time profile or breakthrough curve of the effluent (  where The Thomas model ( where The Yoon–Nelson model ( where The data obtained from the batch isotherm studies can be used for the prediction of the theoretical breakthrough curve, which can then be compared with the experimental curve. This was accomplished through detailed calculations for an initial metal ion concentration of 20.1 The isotherm study found that the removal of calcium ions by Amberlite IRC 748 followed the Langmuir isotherm; the equation of the equilibrium line ( where An operating line was drawn to pass though the origin and the point given by According to where The term where The plot of ( Dividing Eq. where ( Amberlite IRC 748 was purchased from Rohm Haas. Its physical and chemical properties are shown in Continuous fixed bed exchange studies were performed in a glass column (internal diameter: 9.50 Breakthrough curves are shown in The effect of flow rate on breakthrough performance is shown in The effects of changing initial calcium ion concentration are illustrated in Applying Eq. The critical bed depth,   For 95% saturation: For 2% saturation: The resulting lines were nearly parallel, with a horizontal distance between the lines of 12.7 According to the BDST model, if In addition, data collected for one influent solute concentration can be adjusted by the BDST technique and used to design systems for treating other influent solute concentrations. If the initial metal ion concentration and the new intercept can be written as: The predicted slopes and intercepts from the BDST equations are shown in The experimental and predicted breakthrough curves according to the Thomas model with respect to bed height, initial metal ion concentration, and flow rate are shown in The values of The experimental and theoretical breakthrough curve based on the mass transfer model is shown in All models were suitable for describing all or a definite part of the dynamic behavior of the column except for the mass transfer model. This is not entirely surprising given that the other three models are mathematically equivalent ( The above equations demonstrate that all three models would give the same A fixed bed column study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of Amberlite IRC 748 in the removal of calcium ions from potassium chromate solution, with results indicating the process to be effective overall. The effects of different exchange parameters on calcium ions removal were studied, specifically flow rate, initial calcium ion concentration, and bed height. Overall percent removal of calcium ions increased with bed height but decreased with increases in both initial calcium ion concentration and flow rate. The BDST, mass transfer, Thomas, and Yoon–Nelson models were applied to the experimental data obtained from dynamic studies performed on the fixed bed in order to construct the breakthrough curves and determine the kinetic parameters of the column. Overall, the BDST model correlated well with experimental results. The experimental breakthrough profile was compared to the mass transfer model profile, obtained from the CMBR data incorporated into the Langmuir isotherm model, which showed that the latter could not correlate batch and column experiments. Finally, the Thomas and Yoon–Nelson models provided very good descriptions of the breakthrough curves for all the process parameters studied, and were ultimately proposed for use in column design.  slope (min intercept (min) bed depth service time inlet or initial calcium ion concentration at time t (mg effluent calcium ion concentration at time t (mg equilibrium concentration of metal ions in the aqueous phase (mg the concentrations of metal ions in effluent at breakthrough (mg the concentrations of metal ions in effluent at exhaustion (mg equilibrium concentration of solute in solution corresponding to an exchanged concentration, continuously mixed batch reactor wastewater flow rate (L rate constant in the Yoon–Nelson model (min total bed depth (cm) height of exchange zone (cm) rate constant in the bed depth service time model (L rate constant in the Thomas model (L overall mass transfer coefficient (cm weight of exchanger (g) maximum exchange capacity (mg equilibrium exchange of calcium ions per gram of the exchanger in the Thomas model (mg equilibrium exchange of calcium ions per gram of the exchanger in the Langmuir model (mg volumetric flow rate (L coefficient of correlation time (min) time at breakthrough (min) time at exhaustion (min) linear flow velocity of feed to bed (cm total volume of solution treated to the point of breakthrough (L) total volume of solution treated to the point of exhaustion (L) total volume of solution treated at time t (L) effluent volume (L) bed depth of column (cm) the theoretical depth of the exchanger (cm) intercept slope (min time required for 50% exchange breakthrough (min) This work was financially supported by the
