In this work, the synthesis of Mg87Ni10Al3 hydride by reactive ball milling under H2 atmosphere is presented. Reactive milling under hydrogen induces the conversion of Mg into nanocrystalline MgH2 (final crystallite sizes

                      8 nm). The percentage of the hydride increases with the milling time and after 20 h of mechanical treatment the reaction is complete. Only at longer milling time, when a high conversion degree of Mg into the hydride is reached, the reaction with Ni to form Mg2NiH4 is observed. Thermal analysis shows that, for the shorter milling time, the decomposition of the hydride starts at

Modified stainless steel vials, to allow milling under different atmosphere, were used together with 11 stainless steel balls (12 mm diameter) with a ball to powder mass ratio (BPR) 15:1. In order to study the evolution of the reaction during milling, samplings at regular intervals of time (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 h) were performed. The microstructural evolution upon milling was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis by using a Philips 3050 diffractometer with Cu K  The thermal stability of the hydride formed by milling for different times was studied by DSC and TG measurements. The amount of hydrogen in the alloy was also determined. In From the results and taking in account that the formation of Mg The hydrogen content in the alloy was determined by TG analyses showed in Reactive milling of an elemental Mg The work has been supported by the EU Project HPRN-CT-2002-00208, CeRMAE, MAT2003-00780.
