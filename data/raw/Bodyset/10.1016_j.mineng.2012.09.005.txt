The concentrations of the rare earth elements (particularly Y, Yb, Er and Sc) in the zinc-stripped organic phase streams in the solvent extraction process at Skorpion Zinc mine have increased gradually over the past four years. Iron is the only other impurity present in notable quantities in the organic phase after washing and scrubbing prior to zinc stripping. This project aimed to evaluate the effects that rare earth elements and iron in the organic phase have on the zinc solvent extraction process and to subsequently find appropriate stripping conditions for the removal of these elements from the zinc-stripped organic phase.
                  Results obtained by performing laboratory scale batch tests indicated that the viscosity of the organic phase doubled and the phase disengagement time increased from 100 s to 700 s when the total rare earth elements and iron concentration in the organic phase was increased from 3100mg/L to 6350mg/L. The zinc loading capacity of the organic phase after two extractions furthermore decreased by a value between 1g/L and 3g/L, depending on the composition of the pregnant leach solution. The stripping of low concentrations of rare earth elements and iron from 40% di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) diluted in kerosene was evaluated using two different stripping agents (H2SO4 and HCl) with concentrations between 1M and 7M, organic-to-aqueous ratios between 0.5 and 4, and temperatures between 30°C and 50°C. The highest stripping percentages were achieved at acid concentrations greater than 5M, organic-to-aqueous ratios of less than 0.5 and high temperatures.At Skorpion Zinc mine in south-west Namibia, zinc silicate oxide ore is refined through sulfuric acid leaching, neutralisation, clarification, solvent extraction, electrowinning and finally casting of 99.995% Zn metal. More detailed overviews of the process have been presented by The concentration of rare earth elements (REE) (particularly scandium, yttrium, ytterbium, and erbium) in the zinc-stripped organic phase in the solvent extraction circuit has gradually increased over the past four years; this indicates that the rare earth elements are not sufficiently removed from the organic phase during the current washing, scrubbing, zinc stripping, and iron stripping stages. The objectives of this study were threefold: firstly, to determine the effects that rare earth elements and iron have on the organic phase viscosity, the zinc loading capacity of the organic phase, and the phase disengagement time; secondly, to find suitable operating conditions for the stripping of accumulated rare earth elements and iron from the zinc-stripped organic phase stream; and thirdly, to evaluate different viable plant solutions to implement the conclusions drawn from the experimental work to strip the rare earth elements and iron from the recycled organic phase. This study expands the work presented by In the context of this study, “organic health” refers to the viscosity, zinc loading capacity, and phase disengagement characteristics of the organic phase. Skorpion Zinc regularly performs standardised validation tests, similar to the tests described in Section The phase disengagement time is dependent on the density difference between the liquids in the emulsion, the rate of coalescence, and the rate of diffusion, which, in turn, is affected by the temperature and organic phase viscosity.  During zinc solvent extraction, zinc is extracted according to reaction Reaction However, during the solvent extraction process of zinc, the organic phase is poisoned by other elements, specifically iron, rare earth elements and scandium, which are co-extracted with the zinc. Iron is co-extracted with zinc according to the following reaction: Once the zinc has been stripped from the organic, the organic phase is regenerated by removing the iron with HCl according to the following reaction: The co-extraction reaction of rare earth elements (represented by the symbol for yttrium, Y) is given by the following reaction ( Stripping of rare earth elements from the organic phase can be achieved by means of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or nitric acid in a manner similar to that used for zinc and iron stripping, yielding reaction The variables that were identified to have a potentially significant effect on the percentage stripping achieved include the type and concentration of stripping agent, the stripping temperature, and the O:A ratio. Various stripping agents, including H   Similar to extraction, stripping involves a change in entropy and enthalpy ( The experimental setup was the same as that described by Laboratory scale extractions were performed to produce different synthetic organic phases that were representative of the zinc-stripped organic phase stream on site. A synthetic aqueous phase with a composition of 1200 To determine the effect of the rare earth element concentration in the organic phase on the organic health, extraction tests were performed during which 200 The test procedure described above was performed for three different organic phases, each with a different rare earth element and iron concentration, and two different aqueous solutions, namely a sample of pregnant leach solution (PLS) obtained from site and a synthetically prepared pregnant leach solution. The synthetic leach solution was a sulphate solution with a pH of four, containing 31 The experimental procedure for the stripping tests was similar to that used for the organic health tests. The mixing time required to reach equilibrium was measured, and it was found that the percentage stripping of none of the metals increased by more than one percentage point after 12 Appropriate amounts of the organic phase and the stripping agent were added to the jacketed glass mixing cylinder and agitated for 12 The repeatability of the results was validated by repeating the tests performed with 5 Zinc was extracted from plant pregnant leach solution (PLS) containing 32 For extraction from the synthetic pregnant leach solution, the zinc loading on the organic phase decreased with an increase in rare earth concentration. As the rare earth concentration on the organic phase increases it starts to compete with Zn for D2EHPA, effectively reducing the zinc loading capacity of the organic phase. Although the zinc loading on the organic phase after extraction from plant pregnant leach solution decreased from 21.4 The viscosity of the organic phase was measured after the second extraction stage when the organic phase had been loaded with zinc from synthetic pregnant leach solution or plant pregnant leach solution. The viscosity increased with an increase in the rare earth and iron concentration ( The effect of the organic phase rare earth and iron concentration on the phase disengagement time was determined as discussed in Section  Lower percentages rare earth element stripping were achieved with HCl compared to H In all instances, the acid concentration was sufficient for the acid not to be the limiting reactant. Considering the discussion of the stripping chemistry and equilibrium constants in Section  In general, the percentage stripping for the respective rare earth elements increased as the temperature was increased. This effect was more profound for acid concentrations where relatively low percentage stripping was achieved, and appeared to be more significant when using sulfuric acid as stripping agent compared to hydrochloric acid. Referring to Given the fact that an increase in mixing time did not affect the extent of stripping significantly, it was valid to assume that the stripping reactions had reached equilibrium; an increase in stripping efficiency with an increase in temperature hence indicated that the stripping reactions are endothermic. From the results presented in Section Based on the results obtained from the batch tests, the implementation of a sulfuric acid stripping section, employing either a conventional mixer-settler circuit or a stripping column, would be the technically most feasible solution. A portion of the sulfuric acid aqueous phase leaving the stripping section can either be recycled to the upstream leaching process or be treated with oxalic acid to remove the rare earths as a solid oxalate product prior to returning it to the stripping section or leaching process. If the solution is recycled to the leaching process directly from the stripping stage, the rare earth elements will be recovered in the solid precipitate produced in the neutralisation step following leaching, as it has been reported that a noticeable amount of rare earth elements precipitate out during this stage ( The existing HCl stripping process used for the removal of iron from the zinc-stripped organic phase has a design capacity of 960 Although the replacement of the organic inventory will not require any additional test work or equipment, it only offers a short-term solution that will not prevent the accumulation of the rare earth elements on the organic phase. The high expenditure associated with this option can hence not be justified. Based on the results discussed above for the organic health test work, it can be concluded that the rare earth element and iron loading reduces the zinc loading capacity of the organic phase. High loading occurs easier and result in aggregation of complexes, which in turn results in increased organic phase viscosity and increased phase disengagement time. As the total rare earth element and iron concentration in the organic phase increased from 3100 The experimental results achieved with the zinc-stripped organic phase collected from the Skorpion Zinc solvent extraction circuit confirmed that sulfuric acid achieves better stripping of Y, Er, and Yb from the organic phase than HCl. When using sulfuric acid with a concentration of 5 The two technically feasible long-term solutions for the problem of rare earth element accumulation on the organic phase in the Skorpion Zinc solvent extraction circuit include the implementation of a new sulfuric acid stripping section or the improvement and expansion of the existing HCl stripping section used for iron removal.
