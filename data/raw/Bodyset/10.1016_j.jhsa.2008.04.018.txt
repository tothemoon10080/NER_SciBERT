The volar approach to the distal radius fracture is an important exposure in the treatment of these fractures, particularly with the growing enthusiasm for fixed-angle volar plating. With reports in the literature documenting complications associated with external fixation and dorsal plating, the volar approach has become ever more popular. Moreover, advancements in locking plate technology have expanded the indications for palmar plating beyond volar shear and volarly displaced fractures to include unstable intra-articular distal radius fractures. The surgical approach remains the same as when Henry recommended the interval between the flexor carpi radialis and the radial artery. Critical elements of the surgical technique include releasing the brachioradialis, gaining exposure all the way to the sigmoid notch, and building the intra-articular reduction, beginning with the intermediate column and moving radially. The relevant anatomy, indications and contraindications, postoperative care, and a pertinent case presentation are discussed.
