An effective method was studied for the separation of high-purity individual rare earths from middle rare earth concentrate. The method combines photochemical reduction and extraction chromatography and consists of two steps: first, injecting a middle rare earth feed solution to a column packed with extraction resin while photochemically reducing Eu3+ to Eu2+ in the feed solution, followed by separating the reduced Eu2+ which has not been adsorbed on the extraction resin by washing; and, second, separating Sm3+ and Gd3+ adsorbed on the extraction resin by elution. This study was carried out with a 193nm ArF excimer laser source, a column packed with HEH[EHP] resin, isopropanol as scavenger of hydroxyl radical formed in the photolysis of water, deionized water as washing solution and HCl solution as eluent. With the aim of obtaining high yields of high-purity products, parameters such as concentrations of isopropanol and Eu2O3 in the feed solution, acidity and flow rate of the feed solution and acidity and flow rate of the eluent were evaluated with synthetic solutions. Based on the obtained results, the method was applied to separate individual rare earths from a commercial solution. Finally, the yields of Sm2O3, Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 products were 82.5%, 93.7% and 78.1% respectively, with purities of 99.99%.Now, high-purity rare earths are widely used in the development and production of many advanced technical products. In general, high-purity rare earths are produced in the separation processes ( Separation of samarium, europium and gadolinium from middle rare earth concentrate is particularly difficult due to the similarity of extraction coefficients of Sm  Recently, In the extraction chromatography ( Separation of individual rare earths by the extraction chromatography depends on parameters of stationary phase such as type and content of extractant impregnated in extraction resin, those of mobile phase such as type, acidity and flow rate of eluent and column parameters such as size, porosity and temperature. The separation of individual rare earths requires often to use HEH[ From the advantage of photochemical reduction of Eu In general, the primary radicals formed in the photolysis of water are hydrated electrons e Isopropanol is less harmful and toxic than formic acid. Moreover, in contrast to using the very acidic formic acid, higher pH values can be reached with isopropanol, which is advantageous for the formation and stabilization of the reduced Eu Synthetic solutions were prepared by, according to the experimental conditions, mixing samarium oxide (99.99% Sm All the aqueous solutions were prepared with analytical grade reagents and deionized water. HEH[ The set-up of the combined photochemical reduction and extraction chromatography is illustrated in The energy of the photons that trigger the photochemical reaction is determined by the solution, i.e. the solvent and additives. In aqueous solution of EuCl The experiment involved two steps: in the first step, a middle rare earth feed solution was injected to the extraction resin column while reducing Eu In general, washing solution should have no effect on the retention of elements adsorbed on the extraction resin. In the separation of rare earths using columns packed with HEH[ In the second step, Sm After the separation, the extraction resin was regenerated by passing HCl solutions of 2 The purity and yield of europium were evaluated by analysis of washing solution and those of samarium and gadolinium by analysis of eluate. The washing solution fractions and eluate fractions from the column outlet were collected at regular intervals, and then, concentrations of individual rare earths in the fractions were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry ( In the present method, yields of high-purity individual rare earths depend on the photochemical reduction of Eu In the aqueous solution of EuCl As described in This organic radical The quantum yields (μmol·J The compositions of rare earths in the synthetic solutions were (in g·L In the first step of the present method, it was shown that not only Eu When washed using the deionized water after the injection of the feed solution into the column while reducing Eu The irradiation dose of excimer laser was 14 The acidity of synthetic feed solution was 0.0001  Usually, reduction of metal ions in an aqueous solution is carried out when the isopropanol concentration is high ( The Eu As shown in   In this study, when the Eu When an acidity of aqueous solution is higher than 0.01 As shown in As shown in Eqs. Usually, both the photochemical reduction of metal ions in an aqueous solution and the adsorption of metal ions on the extraction resin in chromatography are diffusion-controlled processes ( The flow rates of synthetic feed solutions were varied from 0.3 In Usually, the parameters such as type, acidity and flow rate of mobile phase are the key factors in the separation of elements adsorbed on the extraction resin ( The compositions of rare earths in the synthetic feed solutions were (in g·L The effect of acidity of the eluent on the separation of Sm The effect of flow rate of the eluent on the separation of Sm Based on the results obtained with the synthetic feed solutions, the separation of individual rare earths from the commercial feed solution was carried out under the following conditions: the isopropanol concentration, 0.047 The elution curve is shown in In this paper, we proposed an effective method which combines photochemical reduction and extraction chromatography for the separation of high-purity individual rare earths from middle rare earth concentrate, and studied the effects of various parameters on the photochemical reduction and separation of europium and the chromatographic separation of samarium and gadolinium with synthetic feed solutions. When washed the extraction resin column using the deionized water after the injection of feed solution, the purity of europium product was over 99.9% in the washing solution from the column outlet. Especially the purity of europium product was 99.99%, when the flow rate of feed solution was lower than 0.5 The isopropanol concentration had a significant effect on the yield of europium product. When the Eu A distinctive feature in the photochemical reduction of europium is that the irradiation dose of excimer laser is limited to the dose needed for generating the hydrated electrons to reduce 44% of Eu In the separation of samarium and gadolinium, the flow rate of eluent had more significant effect than the acidity of eluent. When the acidity and flow rate of eluent were 0.8 Based on the obtained results, the method was applied to separate individual rare earths from a commercial solution. Finally, the yields of Sm The significant advantage of the present method is that it combines reduction and separation without precipitation of Eu In the present method, separation of every individual rare earth was carried out with the column packed with HEH[ In this study, no leakage of the extractant from the extraction resin was observed. However, it is one of the issues to be more studied in future how many times the column can be used without leakage of the extractant and change in separation characteristics of rare earths. In its industrial application, it is difficult to combine separation process and analysis. This problem arises in the chromatography in general and no data concerning it exist yet.
