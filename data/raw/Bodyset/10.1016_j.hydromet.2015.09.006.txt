Recovery of base metals such as Cu, Ni and Co from low grade ores ( A survey of literature indicated that number of methods are being practiced for production of such metal powders, which include ionic precipitations ( For efficient treatment of sea nodules, nodules are initially smelted to produce alloys rich in Cu, Ni, Fe and Co while rejecting most of the gangue minerals in the slag. These alloys are then sulfidized to make friable mattes, which are leached in sulphuric acid under high temperature–pressure condition ( Initial copper reduction studies were carried with synthetic solutions having similar compositions as that of leach solutions i.e.: 25 Reduction kinetics of Cu The effect of hydrothermal reduction temperature, time and H The effect of reaction time on percentage reduction of Cu was studied in the range 15–150 The effect of reaction temperature on percentage reduction of Cu was studied in the range 150–200 In actual practice the solutions generated from treatment of sea nodules could contain ~ In the previous section, copper powders were precipitated from a mixed Cu-Ni solution in presence of trace amount of Fe Precipitation experiments were carried out at 180 The copper powders precipitated in the present study were chemically analyzed after their digestion to determine their purity. In all the cases, the Cu content was found to be above 99.9%. The major impurities in these powders are Na and K, which are probably incorporated during the pre-treatment of powders prior to their analyses. Typical XRD spectrum of a Cu powder matches well with the standard JCPDS file. The SEM photographs of Cu powders obtained at different precipitation temperatures are shown in Copper powders precipitated under optimum condition (temperature 180 Aqueous reduction of Cu Reaction ( In the present study we observe that, percentage of Cu It is anticipated that Fe Production of copper powder from sulfate solutions containing nickel and iron (25 The authors are thankful to the
