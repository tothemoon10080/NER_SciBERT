The layered perovskite type oxide K2La2Ti3O10 powders were prepared under air, Ar and H2 calcination atmospheres by sol-gel method and characterized by X-ray diffractometry, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The influence of the calcination atmosphere on the photocatalytic reactivity of K2La2Ti3O10 for hydrogen production was investigated. The photocatalytic reactivity of K2La2Ti3O10 prepared under air, Ar and H2 atmospheres was compared with that prepared under ultraviolet and visible light radiation using I- as electronic donor. The results show that K2La2Ti3O10 prepared under Ar and H2 atmospheres has higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production than that prepared under air atmosphere. The hydrogen production rates under ultraviolet irradiation are 127.5, 81.3 and 57.0 μmol/(L·h) and those under visible light irradiation are 40.2, 30.2 and 16.5 μmol/(L·h) respectively when K2La2Ti3O10 is prepared under Ar, H2 and air atmospheres.
