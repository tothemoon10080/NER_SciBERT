The Independent Principle (IP), which states that the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient are independent of α if the normal velocity component is used, was examined in oscillatory flows. Hydrodynamic forces were measured over a Keulegan-Carpenter number (KC) range of 3–30 and a Stokes parameter (

In addition, the lift coefficient increases with the increase of cylinder yaw angle. The results of the lift force spectra and the lift coefficients imply that the existence of the cylinder yaw angle has an intensified effect on the vortex shedding process around a square cylinder in oscillatory flows.Oscillatory flow around a cylindrical structure is of importance due to its intrinsic interest in theoretical hydrodynamic research and its relevance to practical engineering applications. Knowledge of the hydrodynamics is essential for both the design and operation of offshore structures, such as semisubmersibles and tension leg platforms. For some cylindrical structures, owning to their directionality, the sea waves and/or currents can approach the structures obliquely. In these cases, the fluid velocity in the axial direction of the structure is not negligible, which may have profound effect on the vortex instability, vortex regime classifications and force characteristics of the structure. For a yawed circular cylinder in steady current, it has been found that over a certain range of yaw angle, the normalized vortex shedding frequency, i.e. Strouhal number According to the results of a yawed circular cylinder in the harmonically oscillatory flow by In offshore engineering, the slender structures may have either square or rectangular cross-sections. The generation and shedding of the vortices from these structures in currents, waves or a combination of them, which determine the fluid loading on bluff bodies, normally reveal a high dependence on the geometry of the cross-sections ( While the flow and hydrodynamic features of a yawed circular cylinder in oscillatory flow have been reported extensively, our knowledge about the wake characteristics of a yawed square cylinder in oscillatory flow is limited. It has been showed previously that the yaw angle of a square cylinder plays significant roles in the evolution of flow instabilities and force characteristics in steady flow ( The schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in The blockage is about 1/10 in the present study, of which the effect is neglected. The free surface effect is evaluated by the Froude number, which is defined as In waves and oscillating flows, the total in-line force  The subscript The time series of the total in-line force recorded in the The transverse force, or lift force, undergoes a periodic change as the vortex shedding progresses when a cylinder oscillates in water. The measurement of lift force was conducted simultaneously with the in-line force. The FFT filter technique with a cutoff frequency of 6 times of the oscillating frequency is applied to the lift force signals. This cutoff frequency was chosen based on the highest dominant frequency, which is closely related to KC. For example, the highest KC covered in the present study is 31, corresponding to three pairs of vortex shedding regime which means that the highest fundamental shedding frequency is 4 times of the oscillatory frequency. Therefore, a cutoff frequency with 6 times of the oscillatory frequency was chosen to remove the noises but keep the interested information of the lift force. A better comprehension of the hydrodynamics around a sinusoidal oscillating cylinder can be gained by examining the spectrum and the root-mean-square (RMS) coefficient of the lift force. The power spectrum of the lift force is obtained from FFT analysis. The dominant frequency can be identified as the fundamental lift frequency normalized by the oscillatory flow frequency which is defined as Another way to check the multi-frequency feature of the lift force is the harmonic lift coefficients ( In oscillatory flow, the hydrodynamic forces depend on KC as well as The drag ( When the cylinder is yawed to the flow, a significant difference can be observed in the drag coefficients for different yaw angles. For KC in the range of about 8–20, there is a dramatic deviation of For a circular cylinder, a negative value of Before examining the yaw angle effect on the lift force for a square cylinder, the vortex shedding regime classification was conducted by examining the time series of the lift force as well as the fundamental lift frequency at different KC, which has been performed for a circular cylinder in oscillatory flows in previous studies ( To examine the yaw angle effect on flow regime classification, the time series of the lift force and the corresponding spectra at Prior to the investigation on the fundamental frequency of the lift force, the time series from two sets of measured lift force at KC As the lift force is induced by the asymmetrical pressure distribution due to the periodic vortex shedding, it may have the multiple-frequency feature. The spectra of the lift force are demonstrated in Apart from the fundamental lift frequency, the harmonic lift coefficient, calculated from Fourier analysis, can also be used to investigate the multiple-frequency feature of the lift force. The first 4 harmonic components of the lift coefficient, corresponding to the vortex shedding regimes of no vortex shedding, single pair, double pairs and triple pairs, respectively, are calculated and shown in The RMS value of the lift force A well-controlled experimental investigation has been conducted for a yawed square cylinder oscillated in quiescent water to examine the effect of the cylinder yaw angle on the hydrodynamics. Quantitative comparisons were made between the square cylinder and the circular cylinder to demonstrate the similarities and differences between the two types of cylinders in oscillatory flows. The main conclusions are summarized below: The most significant differences in Based on the time series and the spectra of the measured lift force, the vortex shedding regime for a square cylinder can be classified as: KC The increase of The authors sincerely acknowledge the financial supports from
