In the present study, we have attempted to demonstrate functional expression by the rodent cartilage of particular isoforms of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) essentially required for central glutamatergic signal termination. Constitutive expression of mRNA was shown for the first time with the neuronal EAAT subtype excitatory amino acid carrier-1 (EAAC1), in addition to glial subtypes such as glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), in rat costal chondrocytes cultured for 7–21 days on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Western blotting analysis confirmed the expression of corresponding proteins for both GLAST and GLT-1 in cultured chondrocytes. The accumulation of [3H]glutamate (Glu) occurred in a temperature- and sodium-dependent manner with biochemical and pharmacological profiles similar to those seen for brain EAATs in chondrocytes cultured for 7 days, while [3H]Glu accumulation consisted of a single component with a K

                     max of 1320±120pmol/mg protein/min, respectively. In organotypic cultured metatarsals isolated before vascularization from embryonic mice, where cells underwent maturational development from resting to proliferating, prehypertrophic, hypertrophic and calcified chondrocytes in a progressive order of cellular differentiation, moreover, mRNA expression was seen for GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAT4 but not for EAAC1 subtypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed distribution profiles different from each other with GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAT4 isoforms in sections of cultured metatarsals and isolated tibiae. These results suggest that extracellular Glu could be cleared up into intracellular locations through particular glial and/or neuronal EAAT isoforms functionally expressed by the rodent cartilage.In line with our previous findings in rat adrenal In central glutamatergic synapses, moreover, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) need to be constitutively and functionally expressed for the termination of signaling mediated by this neuroactive amino acid, in addition to Glu receptors for the transformation of extracellular signals. EAATs are classified into five different subtypes including glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST; EAAT1), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1; EAAT2), excitatory amino acid carrier-1 (EAAC1) (EAAT3), EAAT4 and EAAT5 so far In the present article, therefore, we have focused on the evaluation of possible functional expression of particular isoforms of EAATs by cultured chondrocytes prepared from adult rat costicartilage, in addition to metatarsals isolated before vascularization from embryonic mice, where cells undergo maturational development from resting to proliferating, prehypertrophic, hypertrophic and calcified chondrocytes in an order of progressing differentiation without invasion by osteoblasts, osteoclasts and capillaries [3,4- Cartilage was isolated from adult female Wistar rat ribs, followed by incubation at 37 Mouse chondral progenitor cell line ATDC5 cells were purchased from the RIKEN cell bank (Ibaraki, Japan) and maintained as described previously Chondrocytes were plated at a density of 4 Chondrocytes were placed in 24-well plates and cultured for different periods of time up to 21 days. Cells were rinsed with PBS twice and then stained for 30 Purification of collagen was performed from chondrocytes cultured for different periods of time up to 28 days. After being washed with PBS, cell layers were scraped and homogenized in 0.5 Cell homogenates prepared as described above were dissolved in 10 Cultured chondrocytes were washed with PBS twice, followed by extraction of mRNA using mRNA purification kit and subsequent synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) with 12.5 Chondrocytes were cultured for 7 days, followed by washing with HEPES Krebs-Ringer (HKR) (125 The three central metatarsal rudiments were isolated from ddY mouse embryos at 15.5 days post-gestation. Each of middle three metatarsals was placed in a well of a 24-well plate containing 1 Metatarsals cultured for 5 days and tibiae isolated from embryonic mice at 15.5 days after gestation were individually fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, followed by decalcification with 20% EDTA and subsequent immersion in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 Immunohistochemical detection of each EAAT isoform was done as described previously Results are all expressed as the mean Costicartilage was isolated from adult female Wistar rat ribs, followed by digestion with collagenase and collection of cells toward subsequent plating for culture. Cultured cells underwent proliferation toward a confluent state for a period up to 14 days, followed by differentiation to form nodules on 14 days and subsequent calcification on 28 days ( In order to analyze expression of mRNA for EAATs, mRNA was extracted from samples for subsequent RT-PCR using specific primers for each EAAT. Rat whole brain exhibited marked expression of mRNA for GLT-1 and EAAC1, with expression of both GLAST and EAAT4 in rat cerebellum and EAAT5 mRNA in rat retina, respectively ( In order to evaluate the functionality of EAAT isoforms expressed by chondrocytes, an attempt was made to determine whether the substrate Glu is indeed incorporated through particular EAAT subtypes in these cultured cells. Chondrocytes cultured for 7–21 days were incubated with 1 In order to confirm the net incorporation of [ [ Chondrocytes cultured for 7 days were incubated with different concentrations of [ Chondrocytes cultured for 7 days were incubated with 1 Metatarsals before vascularization were isolated from embryonic mice at 15.5 days after gestation, followed by organotypic culture for different periods up to 5 days. In proportion to increasing culture days, marked increases were seen in both the total length of the cartilage rudiment and the length of the middle mineralized part in cultured metatarsals ( Metatarsals cultured for 5 days were dissected for frozen sections to evaluate distribution profiles of each EAAT in particular chondral cell types. In these sections, expression of mRNA for PPR was highly restricted to prehypertrophic chondrocytes, but not in other chondral cells at particular differentiation stages, on in situ hybridization analysis ( In order to confirm the expression of particular isoforms of EAATs in chondrocytes, tibiae were isolated from embryonic mice at 15.5 days after gestation, followed by immediate dissection of frozen sections for subsequent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses as done with metatarsals cultured for 5 days. Similarly high localization was seen with expression of mRNA for PTH1R to prehypertrophic chondrocytes in tibiae on in situ hybridization evaluation ( The essential importance of the present findings is that radiolabeled Glu was indeed accumulated in a temperature- and sodium-dependent manner in primary cultured rat costal chondrocytes that expressed mRNA and corresponding proteins for particular isoforms of EAATs. The accumulation of [ By contrast, one possible discouraging speculation is that the chondral functional expression may be derived from osteoblastic cells contaminated in cultured chondrocytes isolated from rat costicartilage. In the present study, however, immunohistochemical analysis clearly revealed the localized expression of immunoreactive EAAT isoforms in particular chondrocytes resided in tibiae and metatarsals, where we have confirmed the absence of the osteoblastic marker protein type-1 collagen on in situ hybridization (unpublished data). Moreover, metatarsals isolated on E15.5 from embryonic mice have been considered as pure cartilage rods devoid of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and capillaries even when cultured for 5 days after the isolation The more potent inhibition by the GLT-1 selective inhibitors T3MG and DHK than the non-selective EAAT inhibitors CCG-III and THA argues in favor of the view that the glial EAAT isoform GLT-1 would play a role more crucial for mediating the temperature- and sodium-dependent accumulation of [ A splice variant of GLAST lacking exon 3 is expressed in both bone and brain Glutamatergic innervations would be distributed not only in the CNS, but also in peripheral non-neuronal tissues including bone and cartilage. Glu could be classified into autacoids as done with histamine and serotonin, whereas a concept for the paracrine and/or autocrine signal mediator should be re-considered for establishment of the autocrine hypothesis for Glu. The lack of phenotypic alterations of the bone growth in mice knocked out of GLAST It thus appears that extracellular Glu may be incorporated into intracellular locations through particular isoforms of EAATs for possible subsequent events such as signal termination and/or glutathione synthesis in cartilage as well as in bone. Evaluation of chondral EAATs could be of a great benefit for the future elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying the crisis of a variety of chondral diseases associated with the degenerative malfunction of chondrocytes including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
