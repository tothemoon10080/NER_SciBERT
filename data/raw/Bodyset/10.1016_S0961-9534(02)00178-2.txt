Different systems for harvesting and storage of wood fuel from willow shoots give fuels with different particle size distribution, particle shape and moisture content. These factors influence the tendency for wood fuel particles to form a stable bridge over openings, which prevents the feeding of the fuel. The influence of cutting and storage method on the tendency to bridge was studied for chips and chunks made from 3 to 5 year old willow shoots harvested in January and December. Shoots were cut with four different machines to produce five fuel assortments with nominal particle length from 28 to 200

                      loose volume piles. Some piles were uncovered, some covered with plastic and two were sealed in an airtight silage plastic film enclosure. The bridging tendency was measured at the end of May and September by determination of how wide a “bridge” of fuel over a slot opening could be before it collapsed. With a 500

                      thick layer of fuel above the slot opening, the bridge width varied between 58

                      for the large chunks. Most of the variation was due to two fuel properties, the proportion of particles longer than 100

                      and the moisture content of the fuel.Cut willow shoots ( In this study willow shoots from SRF were cut with different machines producing particle sizes and shapes in different proportions over the period December 1996 to January 1997, and stored in piles outdoors uncovered or covered by plastic until the end of May or September 1997. The different storage methods and storage times resulted in different moisture contents, between and within piles It is known that the particle shape of wood fuel influences its tendency to bridge over openings The aim was to study the tendency to bridge over openings for fuels from cut willow shoots with varying fuel variables as a result of cutting equipment, storage method and storage time. The variables analysed were nominal particle size, proportion of long particles and moisture content. The method and equipment used to study the tendency for fuels to bridge over openings has been used since the mid 1980s for around one hundred different solid biofuels, mainly wood fuels Bridging is measured with different amounts of fuel in the box; 250, 500, and Measurements on the material from each fuel type and bed depth are repeated 10 times. After each measurement the bridging tester is emptied and filled again allowing the particles to orient randomly. The slot opening needed for the bridge to collapse will vary depending on which particles are in or close to the bridge and how they are oriented. The more heterogeneous material, the greater is the variation between the ten measurements. Each measurement is seen as a replication. ANOVA is used to study the difference between tested fuels. Linear regression is used to study the influence of nominal particle size, proportion of particles longer than The tested wood fuels came from a storage study (7). Three to five year old short rotation willow stands with an average height of 3– Cutting method/machine (three willow shoot harvesters and one chunker) Austoft harvester, adjusted to Austoft harvester, adjusted to Bender harvester, with Claas harvester, with Silvatec chunker, adjusted to Storage method outdoor in a pile, open (without any cover); outdoor in a pile, completely covered; outdoor in a pile, covered on the top only; outdoor in a pile, airtight wrapped with plastic film. Storage time from December/January until the end of May; from December/January until the end of September. The fuels were stored outdoors in piles 5– The The main variables studied for explaining a fuel's tendency to bridge were nominal particle size, proportion of particles longer than During bridging measurement three samples of 2– The tested fuels differed considerably in particle size, particle size distribution and particle shape depending on the machine used for comminution. The Silvatec chunks had a reasonably even particle length; around Mean values and ANOVA of bridging tendencies for combinations of cutting equipment, nominal length, storage method and storage period are presented in The different storage times, from December/January until May or September, resulted in different moisture contents which influenced the bridging tendency for all fuels, but for most of them this influence was small ( The nominal particle length had some influence, showing a higher bridging tendency for fuels with a higher nominal particle length. However, Bender chips, with the lowest nominal particle length Bridging tendency was measured at two or three different bed depths, 250, 500 and The most important variable for explaining the differences in the tendency to bridge in this study was the proportion of long particles. This is in line with results from studies of other solid biofuels All fuels that were measured at two moisture contents, i.e. both in May and September, needed a smaller slot opening when the moisture content was lower ( The combined variable (proportion of particles longer than The two variables do not explain the difference in slot opening required between two of the fuels studied, the Bender and the Austoft 100, which have similar proportions of particles longer than It is interesting to note that fuel produced from willow shoots by both the Austoft and the Claas SRF harvesters had significantly lower tendency to bridge than the commercial fuel chips made from logging residues. Earlier (unpublished) studies showed a higher tendency to bridge for willow shoots cut by an earlier version of the Austoft SRF harvester, which produced a fuel with a higher proportion of long top-ends of the shoots, “rat tails”. Obviously the cutting equipment has been improved to produce a fuel with a better flowability. The Danish Ministry of Energy and EU supported the study.
