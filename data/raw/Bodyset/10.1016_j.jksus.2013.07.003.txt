Physico-chemical conditions for the optimal separation of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from a galena ore leachate using a combination of tributylphosphate (TBP) and bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid (Cyanex®272) have been investigated. The results of fundamental studies using synthetic solution of Pb(II) showed that the extraction efficiency increased with increasing pH, extractant concentration and temperature. An extraction yield of 92.1±0.2% for Pb(II) at pH 5.0 by 1mol/L TBP in 100% MIBK and 94.6±0.2% for Zn(II) at pH 3.0 by 0.032mol/L Cyanex®272 in kerosene was obtained from an initial galena leach liquor containing 1705.1mg/L Pb, 98.7mg/L Zn and 130.2mg/L total iron as major constituents at 25±2°C at a stirring time of 30 and 25min, respectively. Iron was also effectively removed by precipitation using 1mol/L ammoniacal solution at pH 3.5. The stoichiometry of the lead-extractable species was found to be HPbCl3·TBP. Values of 52.7±0.01 kJmol−1, −5.05 kJmol−1, 159.6±0.01JK−1
                     mol−1 and 0.127±0.003M−2 were calculated for the apparent standard molar enthalpy (ΔH°), Gibb’s free energy (ΔG°), molar entropy (ΔS°) and extraction constant, respectively. About 94.5±0.2% Pb(II) and 94.6±0.2% Zn(II) were stripped from the TBP and Cyanex®272, respectively using 0.1mol/L HCl solution. Finally, a compact extraction scheme has been provided.The galena ore (PbS) is the most important sulfide mineral and is generally treated pyrometallurgically. However, lead smelting faces difficulties with respect to environmental regulations. Therefore, the hydrometallurgical recovery of lead from galena may be a promising process with environmentally inert elemental sulfur being formed instead of sulfur dioxide ( The intrinsic nature of chloride leach liquors resulting from the hydrometallurgical treatments of sulfide ores is rather complex; these solutions usually contain relatively high concentrations of basic metals, as well as small contents of other rare metals or frequently precious metals ( Consequently, solvent extraction is one of the efficient hydrometallurgical techniques used for purification, separation or concentration of metals from aqueous media. It has found extensive application in mineral processing ( In general, several studies have been carried out on Zn(II) by solvent extraction ( There is practically no reported work on the hydrometallurgical recovery of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from the galena ore of Nigerian origin. In recent years, the recovery of these metals from aqueous chloride solutions has attracted much attention. This is due to the high efficiency of the chloride leaching process which is now recognized as a logical choice for treating complex sulfide ore concentrates ( For this study, three phosphorus based extractants were employed. These are: Tributylphosphate TBP (Merck, purity 99%) Triphenylphosphite, TPP (BDH Chemicals, Poole England, purity 97%); and Bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphoric acid: Cyanex®272, (Cytec Industries, Rungis Cedex, France, purity 85–90%. Distilled kerosene and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) were used as organic diluents throughout this work. In the absence of TBP, the metal ion extraction such as lead by MIBK in aqueous chloride media is not quantitative ( The experimental procedure adopted comprised of a preliminary study aimed at establishing optimal conditions for the extraction of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from synthetic lead and zinc solutions by TBP and Cyanex®272, respectively and with subsequent applications to the recovery of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from the galena leachate ( The aqueous solutions of Zn(II) and Pb(II) with metal concentration of 1 Equal volumes of aqueous and organic phases were shaken at room temperature (25 The concentration of the metal ion in the organic phase was calculated from the difference between its concentration in the aqueous phase before and after extraction. Concentration of iron content in the mixture was also determined spectrophotometrically at The composition of the galena leach liquor used for this study at pH 1.0 was Pb: 1705.1 Recently, our findings on the extraction of Zn(II) from aqueous chloride sphalerite leach liquor by Cyanex®272 in kerosene showed that the stoichiometry of the metal species with extractant was 1:1 by ratio. The extraction equilibrium has been evaluated and consistent with the following relation: The result of the preliminary studies in search of selective extractant for Pb(II) is summarized in From The effect of concentration of TBP in 100% MIBK on the extraction of Pb(II) was studied using aqueous leach liquor containing 100 From The composition of the extractable species was analyzed by plotting log The slope from The pH of the aqueous solution containing 100 From Therefore, pH 5.0 was noted as the optimum pH for the Pb(II) extraction where about 95.7 The plot of log  Therefore, the extraction of Pb(II) by 1 A study on the successive extraction of lead(II) by 1 From From The influence of temperature on the Pb(II) extraction by TBP was investigated at different temperatures from 27 to 50 The enthalpy change of the reaction, Δ As the starting galena leach liquor contained mainly iron, lead and zinc, the leachate (from Section The result from The resulting solution from Section The results from The result of total lead stripping from the TBP loaded organic phase by 0.1 The result from The resulting aqueous solution following the Pb(II) extraction by 1 The result obtained from the stripping of Zn(II) from Cyanex®272 organic phase by 0.1 From On the basis of the experimental results discussed so far, a hydrometallurgical scheme summarizing details of all analytical procedures required for the recovery of Pb(II) and Zn(II) from a Nigerian galena ore is shown in The results of fundamental studies on the solvent extraction of Pb(II) from chloride solution by TBP in 100% MIBK showed that the extraction of metal ions increased with increasing pH, extractant concentration and temperature. The probable composition of the extractable species may be HPbCl Furthermore, the separation of Zn(II), total iron and other metals constituting impurities to Pb(II) was carried out from an initial galena leach liquor containing 1705.1 Total iron was initially precipitated from the leachate by 1 The authors are grateful to
