We describe a novel approach to process bioceramic microparticles and poly(diol citrates) into bioceramic–elastomer composites for potential use in orthopedic surgery. The composite consists of the biodegradable elastomer poly(1,8-octanediol-citrate) (POC) and the bioceramic hydroxyapatite (HA). The objective of this work was to characterize POC–HA composites and assess the feasibility of fabricating tissue fixation devices using machining and molding techniques. The mechanical properties of POC–HA composites with HA (40, 50, 60, 65wt.%) were within the range of values reported for tissue fixation devices (for POC–HA 65wt.%, S

                     s=27.3±4.9, all values in MPa). At 20 weeks, the weight loss of POC–HA composites ranged between 8 and 12wt.%, with 65wt.% HA composites degrading the slowest. Exposure of POC–HA to simulated body fluid resulted in extensive mineralization in the form of calcium phosphate with Ca/P of 1.5–1.7 similar to bone. POC–HA supported osteoblast adhesion in vitro and histology results from POC–HA samples that were implanted in rabbit knees for 6 weeks suggest that the composite is biocompatible. Synthesis of POC–HA is easy and inexpensive, does not involve harsh solvents or initiators, and the mechanical properties of POC–HA with 65wt.% HA are suitable for the fabrication of potentially osteoconductive bone screws.Orthopedic, cranio-facial, and oral-maxillofacial surgeons often use tissue fixation devices such as pins, plates, and screws that are made from poly( We have recently described the synthesis and characterization of elastomeric and biodegradable polyesters, referred to as poly(diol citrates), for soft tissue engineering HA [ POC pre-polymer was synthesized according to published methods The following mechanical properties were measured using a Sintech mechanical tester model 20/G (Triangle Park, NC): (1) bending strength ( The degradation of POC–HA composite samples (10 Surface mineralization of POC–HA composites was assessed in vitro using modified simulated body fluid (SBF) POC and POC–HA discs (7.0 Six New Zealand white rabbits (Covance, Kalamazoo) weighing between 2.3 and 2.7 One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on three or more means with a Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test applied within groups. A The fabrication process revealed that below 40 The weight loss over time profiles for POC–HA composites incubated in PBS at 37 Mineralization was not observed on the surface of POC incubated in SBF ( On gross examination, the implant seemed well integrated with surrounding cartilage with the implants having a similar color and consistency ( The vast majority of orthopedic implants are made from metals, which can cause unwanted tissue reactions, and lead to significant bone removal if a secondary intervention is required Herein we describe for the first time a process that produces a bioceramic–elastomer composite with a wide range of mechanical properties and a HA content that is similar to that of bone. Novel bioceramic composites, based on the biodegradable elastomer poly(diol citrate), were engineered with the expectation that they would have enhanced osteointegration potential relative to current biodegradable fixation implants. The rationale was to design a fixation implant that would consist mostly of the bioceramic component to maximize osteointegration while employing a degradable and relatively inexpensive elastomer as the macrophase binder. We hypothesized that POC would be a good candidate to improve the processability and mechanical properties of bioceramic implants due to its biocompatibility, adjustable mechanical properties, controllable degradation rates (a few months to 1 year), and mild synthesis conditions The mechanical property measurements of the POC–HA composites evaluated in this study were within the range of values reported for biodegradable polymers and composites used or proposed for bone fixation devices Although polymer–HA composites are expected to integrate with bone, the weight percent and rate of degradation of the polymer component are parameters that may influence the function and in vivo integration of the composite. We have previously reported the complete degradation of POC within 6 months when incubated in PBS at 37 Regarding the potential bioactivity of POC–HA in vivo, HA has been shown to induce the deposition of calcium phosphate mineral on the surface of ceramic implants and bond to bone POC has been shown to be compatible (i.e., as per cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation assays) with several cell types including human and pig endothelial cells, human and pig smooth muscle cells, bovine chondrocytes, and bovine fibroblasts Herein we describe the development of biodegradable composites based on an elastomeric biodegradable polyester. The feasibility of processing POC–HA composites into useful forms was confirmed as interference screws (bone screws) were successfully engineered using both, molding and machining methods. Advantages of POC–HA or POC–bioceramic composites include: (1) simple synthesis and in-situ cross-linking polymerization at relatively mild temperatures while avoiding the use of exogenous catalysts and toxic solvents, (2) incorporation of a high percentage of the bioceramic component, (3) increased osteoblast adhesion and mineralization, potentially enhancing osteointegration, (4) use of a polymer component that should degrade completely within 2 years rather than 3–5 years as in the case with PLLA, and (5) decreased cost relative to the use of poly(  Bending strength ( Compression strength ( Shear strength ( Tensile strength ( Torsional strength (
