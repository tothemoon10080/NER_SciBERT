As observed from the current literature, the vast majority of the constitutive models that have been proposed for the description of the changes in the high-temperature flow stress of high-Mn austenitic steels, in the course of plastic deformation as a function of deformation conditions, have been expressed in terms of the total applied strain to the material (ε), which, as indicated by Follansbee and Kocks, is not a valid state parameter. In order to overcome this disadvantage, which hinders the prediction of the changes in flow stress under transient deformation conditions, commonly found during industrial hot-working processes, a different constitutive description is proposed. The advanced approach is based on the temperature and strain rate description of three important parameters: yield stress, hypothetical saturation stress and actual steady-state stress, which is considered equal to the critical stress for the onset of dynamic recrystallization, as proposed by Jonas et al. This description is accomplished by means of the well established Sellars–Tegart–Garofalo model, employing a unique value of the apparent activation energy for hot-working determined from the analysis of the peak stress values, as proposed earlier by Glover and Sellars. The model also requires a description of the time for achieving 50% dynamic recrystallization, which is expressed as a function of deformation conditions by means of the simple parametric relationship also proposed by Jonas et al. This information is subsequently input into two evolution equations, which describe the change in the work-hardening and work-softening rates of the material, as a function of deformation conditions, either when the work-hardening is counterbalanced only by dynamic recovery or when it is counterbalanced by both dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization. The results reported in the present communication indicate that the proposed constitutive description is able to provide an accurate reproduction of the experimental flow stress values determined under constant deformation conditions, obtained by Wietbrock et al. However, the analysis of a hypothetical deformation schedule conducted under transient deformation conditions suggests that a second internal state variable, other than dislocation density, might be required for the improvement in the prediction of the corresponding stress–strain curves.material constant  material parameter, s stress exponent in the power law  Avrami exponent time for 50% recrystallization, s material parameter apparent activation energy for hot-working, kJ apparent activation energy for dynamic recrystallization, kJ absolute temperature, K volume fraction recrystallized Zener–Hollomon parameter, s material parameter in the STG model, MPa material parameter in the exponential law, MPa  parameter in the exponential law work-hardening or work-softening rate of the material, MPa total effective strain effective strain rate, s temperature-dependent shear modulus, MPa flow stress after the onset of DRX flow stress corresponding to the work-hardening and DRV curve, MPa Athermal stress, MPa critical stress for the onset of DRX, MPa yield stress, MPa hypothetical saturation stress, MPa steady-state flow stress, MPa Worldwide, the automotive industry accounts for more than 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by transportation. Therefore, in order to meet the new demands regarding harmful exhaust gas emissions regulations, as well as improving fuel consumption efficiency and reducing vehicles mass without compromising passengers׳ safety, a new generation of high strength steels, including the high-manganese (15–30 HMnAS can exhibit different deformation modes, depending on the stacking fault energy (SFE), which in turn is determined by the alloying content. Thus, previous investigations conducted on this subject indicate that these materials can display both Mechanical Twinning and Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP), when the SFE is the range of 20–60 Due to their outstanding mechanical properties and potential applications in the land transportation industry, HMnAS have attracted much interest and therefore, in the past few years many research works have been devoted to the study of the interrelationships that exists among processing parameters, microstructure and final mechanical properties. Such investigations have dealt with many different aspects of this complex subject and have encompassed the analysis of the plastic deformation of these materials both at low, medium and elevated temperatures. At low and medium temperatures these investigations include a variety of issues, such as the development of physically-based phenomenological models to predict the overall deformation behavior of these materials The study of the hot deformation behavior of HMnAS also encompasses a wide range of research topics, which include the simulation of the final passes in the thermo-mechanical rolling by multi-stage compression tests and constitutive analysis In general, the different constitutive models that have been proposed for the description of the high-temperature flow stress of different steels, including HMnAS, as a function of deformation conditions have in common the fact that the flow stress ( Also, in the model advanced by Imandoust et al. In the above Table, the parameter Clearly, the different constitutive models indicated above have significant drawbacks for two reasons: Firstly, as indicated by Follansbee and Kocks Given the above account, it is apparent that the development of a consistent constitutive model, which can be employed for the description of the flow stress of HMnAS in terms of deformation conditions and valid state parameters able to represent the microstructure of the material, is of utmost importance. Moreover, in order to be able to assist in the modeling of actual industrial hot-working operations and update changes in deformation conditions throughout the processing schedule, the model should be presented in differential form. Thus, the main objective of the present work is the development of a constitutive equation of these characteristics for an HMnAS of the type Fe–Mn23–C0.6, during deformation under hot-working conditions. In the advanced model, both the work-hardening and work-softening rates are expressed in terms of dislocation density through the flow stress of the material, as well as in terms of deformation conditions. The work-softening transient is also described in terms of the DRX kinetics of the material, expressed in differential form. The suggested approach could also be extended and employed for the description of the flow stress, as well as the work-hardening and work-softening rates of other different materials, which exhibit DRX during hot deformation. The present work has been carried out employing the stress–strain curves reported by Wietbrock et al. The available flow stress data allows the determination of the main stress parameters characteristic of the deformation of the material under these conditions, namely: yield stress, critical stress for the onset of DRX, peak stress, actual or hypothetical saturation stress (depending on deformation conditions) and actual steady-state stress. Also, the work-softening transients present in some of the curves, particularly at strain rates of 0.1 and 1 The strategy followed to determine the constitutive equation of this material has essentially been explained in detail in two previous communications The above evolution equation depends on the current flow stress, Both Whereas, for In the above equations, Both the critical stress for the onset of DRX ( Thus, if The above equation is observed to depend on In the above equation, The first aspect concerning the development of the constitutive equation of the material is the computation of the apparent activation energy for hot-working, Thus, In this way, it is possible to compute A further simplification that can be implemented in the present constitutive model is based on the experimental results reported by Jonas et al. Thus, once the corresponding expressions for  Such dependence allows an explanation of the much less pronounced effect of deformation temperature on Thus, the description of the change in These features are more clearly observed in  The potentialities of the proposed constitutive formulation for the description of the changes in flow stress during transient deformation conditions will be examined in the next section, within the context of predicting the stress–strain curves corresponding to some hypothetical transient deformation conditions, which involve arbitrary changes either in strain rate at constant temperature or changes in deformation temperature at constant strain rate. The proposed constitutive description for the Fe–Mn23–C0.6 steel examined in the present work (which can also be applied to C–Mn and other different steels, that display DRX) exhibits a number of advantages in comparison with the formulations previously developed for this material and other TWIP steels, as indicated in the introductory section of the present communication. Essentially, it only requires the description of the temperature and strain rate dependence of three stress parameters: yield, hypothetical saturation and steady-state, as well as the description of the temperature and strain rate dependence of the time required for the achievement of 50% dynamic recrystallization. This information is subsequently employed for the numerical integration of two evolution laws by means of which, the changes in flow stress with the applied strain is described. The first law (Eq. Although the present work involved the analysis of the peak stress values as a function of deformation conditions, the constitutive description is independent of the peak parameters. The purpose of the analysis that was conducted with the peak stress values was merely the determination of a unique magnitude of the apparent activation energy for hot-working. This analysis showed that the Q≈443 As shown in Another interesting comparison of the results obtained in the present study with those reported in the literature entails the parameters Also, it can be observed that the proposed constitutive description is absolutely independent of the total strain ( Even more, since in the present approach the flow stress is determined from the numerical integration of one of the corresponding evolution laws, it is possible to accomplish the description of the flow stress of the material during transient deformation conditions, a feature that is not possible when an integrated expression of the flow stress as a function of the total strain, of the form In order to illustrate these aspects, let us analyze different hypothetical deformation schedules with distinct characteristics, as illustrated in Thus, In the case of In the case of An interesting aspect shown in Finally, regarding the limitations of the proposed constitutive equation for the Fe–Mn23–C0.6 steel deformed under hot-working conditions, it must be emphasize the such a description has been developed from the experimental stress–strain curves reported by Wietbrock et al. Therefore, more research is clearly needed in order to determine more precisely the conditions under which DRX effects would start to be observed, since this information would have a significant influence on the prediction results corresponding to loading transient conditions involving higher The analysis of a number of stress–strain curves reported by Wietbrock et al.
