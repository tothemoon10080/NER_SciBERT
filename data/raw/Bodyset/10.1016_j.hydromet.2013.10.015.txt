The acid resistance of some West Australian laterite ores has been reported to be associated with its cementation structure at submicron level. Although closely related, iron and silicon are found not to be intimately mixed in the goethite-silica/silicate cementations from the current Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy examination. The round or diamond tips of the liberated goethite crystals suggest slow crystal growth in high silicate conditions. The effect of pre-treating the cementation structure by potassium hydroxide liquor digestion upon the atmospheric pressure acid leaching performance is also studied in this paper. Both particle size analysis using laser diffraction and direct imaging using Transmission Electron Microscopy confirm the effective disintegration of the cementations and the liberation of goethite crystals. As a result, the leaching rates of these nickel laterite ores increase by more than 6 times; nickel recoveries of these laterite ores are also increased from under 50% to near 90% after 16h acid leaching. The accelerating effect of the potassium hydroxide pre-treatment upon acid leaching rates verified that an envelope of silica and/or silicates hindered the contact between acid and goethite crystals during atmospheric leaching of these nickel laterite ores.Some limonitic nickel laterite ores from Western Australia demonstrate radically different atmospheric pressure acid leaching (AL) performance even though these have similar mineralogical compositions ( The previous study (Part I) ( In order to better understand the mechanism of cementation breakage, the cementation structure before and after caustic digestion was further studied using Energy Filtered Transmission Electron Microscope (EFTEM). The EFTEM technique, which collects specified elemental information to form each image frame using a CCD camera, has a higher spatial resolution and faster response than STEM/EDS mapping. The latter collects the whole EDS spot by spot and the spatial resolution is usually restricted by the spot size of the electron beam ( Based on the atmospheric pressure leaching data reported in Part I ( In order to compare the leaching performance of the laterite ores A15 and B11 before and after KOH treatment, the two selected powder samples A15 and B11 were first digested using KOH liquor in an autoclave and then leached by sulphuric acid using the same AL conditions used in Part I ( In order to deliberately break up the goethite-silica/silicate cementations, the slow leaching laterite ore powder samples A15 (89.3 The KOH-treated residues of samples B11 (62.3 The particles sizes of sample A15 and B11 were measured using a Malvern速 laser diffraction particle size analyser (Mastersizer 2000) after dispersing the powders in deionised water in an ultrasonic bath for 5 The metal concentrations and chemical compositions of all samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The solid samples were analyzed after fusion with Sigma Chemicals 12:22 lithium borate flux and subsequent dissolution in water. The particle size of the solid samples was further reduced using a McCrone速 micronising mill for 5 The XRD patterns of the samples were obtained using a Bruker速 D8 Discover diffractometer using Bragg-Brentano geometry on a 217.5-mm goniometer with CoK Powder samples were dispersed in deionised water and agitated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 A JEOL速 3000 EFTEM mapping of Si in Fe rich sample is difficult because the Si L The mineralogical compositions of both laterite ore samples before and after KOH treatment are given in The ICP analyses for the KOH digestion liquors from samples A15 and B11 are shown in The ICP analyses for the ore samples before and after KOH treatment are given in The average particle size of the nickel laterite ore samples before and after KOH treatment are compared in The phase composition changes during AL of the KOH-treated A15 and B11 samples based on QPA results are shown in The phase change curves for goethite in samples A15 and B11 with and without KOH treatment are compared in The iron and nickel extraction curves for both samples with and without KOH treatment are shown in Higher iron and nickel leaching rates were also obtained for the KOH-treated ore samples. The acid leaching rate constants A strong correlation between iron and nickel extractions during AL is well known for goethitic laterite ores ( The same shift toward the 1:1 Ni/Fe leaching line after KOH treatment is also observed for sample B11. The early significant preferential nickel leaching over iron for sample B11 with KOH pre-treatment might be due to the behaviour of nickel in nontronite during the KOH digestion ( In order to better understand the mechanism of goethite-silica/silicate cementation breakage, the cementation structures after caustic digestion were further investigated. The TEM images of KOH-treated sample A15 are shown in The TEM images of KOH-treated B11 shown in The accelerated acid leaching rates of these laterite ore samples after KOH digestion can be attributed to the liberation of goethite crystals from the goethite-silica/silicate cementations, which have been observed by TEM imaging. It is clear from the morphologies of the KOH-treated particles that the cementations previously holding goethite crystallites together had collapsed. However, certain levels of silicon and aluminium were still preserved in the KOH-treated goethite samples according to their EDS data in The EFTEM element maps of a cementation sitting on the edge of carbon film in sample A15 are shown in The EFTEM element maps of the liberated acicular goethite crystals in KOH-treated sample A15 are shown in According to the above analysis, silicon is spread across goethite-silica cementations but not substituted in the goethite structure. It is highly probable that the cementations in sample A15 are silica cementing goethite. The EFTEM element maps of KOH-treated sample B11 are shown in  Recent progress in processing these acid resistant nickel laterite ores has identified acid leaching in the presence of reductive sulphur dioxide ( Although the process of potassium hydroxide treatment followed by acid leaching is not expected to be cost-efficient in heap leaching operations, it verifies the acid resistance mechanism proposed for Western Australian nickel laterite ores in Part I ( The PhD scholarship of Xiaodong Wang is funded by an Endeavour Postgraduate Award from the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education, Australian Government.
