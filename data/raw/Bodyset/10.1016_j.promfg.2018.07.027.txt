Cemented carbide is difficult to machine using traditional chip-removal methods due to its hardness. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is the common method applied to shape cemented carbides because high geometric precision can be achieved. However, some important defects (pores, residual stresses or oxidation products) can be induced due to thermal reactions. Ultra-short pulse laser processing can also provide high precision and meanwhile effectively avoid these defects due to its short laser-matter reaction time. In this paper, three different patterns on WC-CoNi cemented carbides for tribological purposes, namely line-like patterns, dimples and grooves, have been created using different laser set-ups with pulse duration in the range of nanoseconds (10-9s), picoseconds (10-12s) and femtoseconds (10-15s). Microstructural and metallurgical changes of modified surfaces have been studied. Laser scanning microscopy (LSM) is conducted to measure the pattern dimensions. Focused ion beam (FIB) in combination with scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to investigate the microstructural changes of the patterned materials.
