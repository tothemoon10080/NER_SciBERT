The Ti-15Mo alloys have been studied by using electrochemical measurements. The electrochemical test was made to analyze their resistance and predictability to corrosion from green dust samples, SPS samples and arc-melt alloying. The corrosion behavior in Ringerâ€™s solution was evaluated by Potentiodynamic polarization curves, electrochemical noise and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). Images were used to study corrosion behavior and corrosion predictability.
