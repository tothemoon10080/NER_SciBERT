The study on the solvent extraction for quantitative and selective separation of total rare earth metals from the polymetallic nodule leach liquor was investigated. The typical leach liquor bearing 0. 094 g/L total rare earth, 0. 23 g/L Mn, 0.697 g/L Cu, 0.2 g/L Fe, 0.01 g/L Co and 0.735 g/L Ni was subjected to the removal iron content by precipitation method using Ca(OH)2 at pH 3.95, prior to solvent extraction of rare earth metals. Three different organo-phosphoric acid reagents (D2EHPA, PC88A, Cyanex 272) were used to ascertain their performances and selectivity towards the loading of rare earth metals in presence of other base metals. Based on the results of eq. pH effect, the performances of above three extractants followed the order as: D2EHPA>PC88A>Cyanex 272. To ensure the absence of extraction of base metals (Cu, Co, Ni), the eq. pH of the solution was optimized at the level of 2.21, though higher rare earth metal extraction efficiency was observed at higher eq. pH with either of the extractants. The complete process flow diagram for substantial recovery of total rare earth was developed using D2EHPA. Extraction isotherm plot was constructed at A:O=12:1, 3-stages and pHe=2.21, using 0.8 mol/L D2EHPA and the predicted condition of this study was further confirmed by 6-Cycles Counter Current Simulation (CCS) study. The stripping of total rare earth from loaded organic phase (LO) was conducted using HCl solution. Mc-Cabe Thiele diagram study carried out at A:O=1:5 using 4 mol/L HCl showed that three theoretical stages were needed for quantitative stripping of total rare earth. The subsequent stripped solution resulted thus led to contain total rare earth of 5.6 g/L indicating a very high enrichment of total metals by solvent extraction (SX) process.
