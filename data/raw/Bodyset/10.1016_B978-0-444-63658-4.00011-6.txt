This chapter describes the processes that comprise commissioning of gold project and the preparation and planning required for successful completion of each stage of of the commissioning process.
               The detail of the commissioning process is a function of the project size, complexity of the project and the contracting strategy. Commissioning is focussed on the safety of people and equipment during the highest risk phase of project development and operation. Effective strategies and good planning are the key requirements for success. This needs to result in clearly defined processes and alignment across many parties in order to achieve the objectives of safe and uneventful commissioning and ramp up to production targets and project completion. This chapter describes the planning, processes, people and actions required to achieve these goals.The authors would like to acknowledge the following: The permission of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy to use excerts from the paper by Newcrest Mining Limited for permission to use data from the Cadia Project Commissioning in 1998.

This chapter addresses the commissioning activities that bring a gold plant from the construction phase to routine plant operation. These activities should be initiated early in the engineering and design phase to ensure that construction is scheduled such that commissioning occurs in a safe, timely, and cost-effective manner. Commissioning includes all activities relating to factory acceptance testing (FAT), installation testing, no-load testing, systems checks, water commissioning, ore commissioning, performance testing, and early gold plant operation. This process may be facilitated in numerous ways dependent on the nature of the project, the nature of the contractual arrangements between the owner, managing contractor, and construction contractors and the size of the project. For example, the managing contractor for a lump sum turn key (LSTK) project may be responsible for all phases of commissioning to final completion, whereas the managing contractor of a complex multicontract project may only be required to bring the project to mechanical completion and then hand over to the owner for ore commissioning. Irrespective of the responsibilities, commissioning programs require careful planning, effective communication, and detailed reporting. Managing the expectations of all parties, particularly when cost or schedule pressures exist on the project, is one of the first activities during the lead up to ore commissioning. Effective communication throughout the project with engineering, construction management, contractors, vendors, and owner's representatives is paramount. Failure to recognize a common goal retards progress to completion. Unsuccessful commissioning can significantly impact project cash flow and early profitability. The commissioning program should be planned to ensure that safety hazards are identified and controlled, deadlines are achievable, manning is available, costs are contained, and plant and equipment are protected. Detailed reporting of commissioning activities is essential for communicating progress. Reporting is also critical in providing a reference document for the possible later resolution of conflict regarding contractor's, manager's, vendor's, or owner's interpretation of achievements. The commissioning process should be initiated during the engineering phase of a gold project. For large, complex projects, commissioning planning may commence during project feasibility study assessment with dedicated personnel, while for smaller projects, commissioning may be considered in parallel with detailed engineering design by the design team. Key factors that may affect the commissioning process are: Size of project Project complexity, for example, nature and number of unit processes Implementation strategy and contracting structure Owner's project and commissioning experience The commissioning strategy and plan must be reflected in all contracts for equipment and supply of services. This requires the preparation of a commissioning plan and a technical specification that are referenced in all contracts. This avoids the potential for later conflict regarding allocation of responsibilities and assists in cost control. The commissioning phase can significantly affect early project cash flow. Poor commissioning planning can lead to ongoing project difficulties, while a rapid commissioning allows operational personnel to focus on project optimization and long-term planning. Understanding the design contingencies and associated risk profile flowing from the design criteria and project expectations arising from contractual agreements is critical. A short, smooth commissioning and start-up can dramatically enhance project economics. Commissioning planning may be combined with consideration of process operability and equipment maintenance issues. This continues through the procurement and construction phases with planning and scheduling of FAT and installation testing, assisting with detailing contractor tasking and determination of vendor start-up support requirements. Ongoing interaction with procurement and construction management ensures that critical services and plant ancillaries, required for preoperational testing, are complete prior to the main plant. Commissioning usually becomes an intense process with tight deadlines as the plant construction nears completion. Delays in commissioning generally have a direct effect on the owner's cash flow. Effective communication with all the project participants, including owner's representatives, vendors, contractors and the construction team, requires extensive planning and clear definition of procedures, cost control, and reporting requirements. Commissioning can be divided into a number of phases: The definition and planning phase, coincident with engineering, procurement, and construction Interfacing with operational readiness planning for operations, maintenance, reliability, and sustainability assessments and preparation Key vendor, fabrication, and supply inspection testing Factory acceptance testing, particularly for electrical and control systems Installation testing phase, including witnessing of critical installation tests and undertaking of mechanical and electrical functional checks Systems checks and no-load operation of equipment Water testing of systems, and preliminary tuning of control systems Preliminary operation of the plant with ore and process fluids Any necessary modification of the plant to achieve design objectives Completion of process tests, if required, to demonstrate any warranted operating conditions Handover to the owner and early plant operation The effectiveness of each of the above phases is cumulative, with the successful outcome of each phase reliant on the success of preceding phases. Selected definitions of the various terms used in this chapter are given in Project size, contracting strategy, and process complexity are the principal determinants of the most appropriate commissioning strategy. Gold plants can vary from small (150 Three examples of prime contract type, and their impacts on commissioning activities are discussed next. LSTK contracts are often used for smaller projects or by junior resource companies with limited operating or financial backing. LSTK contracts require that a contractor supplies an operating plant to the owner. Such contracts are often promoted to reduce the risk to the financier by transferring risk to the experienced contractor. The competitive nature of these contracts can lead to cost minimization measures that can influence plant design, the commissioning methodology, and commissioning outcomes. The contractor is obligated to provide a plant that meets predetermined performance criteria as specified in a performance warranty. The contractor designs, engineers, and procures equipment, constructs, and commissions the plant in the most cost-effective manner, nominally with minimal owner input, within the provisions of the In Australia, LSTK contracts have typically been used for lower cost, modest capacity gold plants. The design and project costs are based on the contractor's experience with similar projects, and in some cases “off-the-shelf” process plant packages may be available. The level of documentation of installation testing and other precommissioning testing activities is often not driven by the owner, as the degree of commissioning detail in the prime contract is often minimal. This leads to a minimalist approach to the documentation of testing, resulting in reduced cost to the project and a faster precommissioning period, particularly with technically simple plants (the technical simplicity may come through experience). Installation testing may be undertaken by the design and construction team with minimal additional resources due to the modest size of the typical Australian LSTK job and the modest resources available to the project. LSTK projects are nearly always accompanied by process warranty provisions where the contractor is required to demonstrate that the plant is “fit for purpose.” Performance warranties are discussed in Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts typically occur with identifiable unit operations capable of operating as separate entities. EPC contracts may be minor, as in a water-storage system, or a part of the process plant, such as a primary crushing plant. All installation and precommissioning activities, up to and including systems checks and no-load commissioning are completed by the EPC contractor. In most cases, the contract will have performance warranty provisions to ensure the facility is “fit for purpose.” The managing contractor or owner usually manages water and ore commissioning and closely supervises critical precommissioning activities, including the witnessing of selected installation tests, all system checks, and no-load testing. The performance of and documentation for precommissioning and commissioning activities required of the EPC contractor are prescribed by the owner's or managing contractor's technical specification referenced in the contract. It is critical that the managing contractor ensures that the EPC contractor is aware of the obligations associated with precommissioning and commissioning at the time of contract award. This includes definition of tasks to be completed under any lump sum component and activities to be conducted on a reimbursable basis. Engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) contracts take a number of forms with varying contents of direct hire and contract management. The EPCM contract may include either or both of the above contract types as subcontracts to the prime contract. The EPCM contractor (managing contractor) is responsible for all activities on the site. As such, responsibilities include ensuring that the various subcontractors abide by the standards and specifications set out for the project and that the owner's requirements are met in all aspects of commissioning. Technically complex projects, particularly brownfields projects, not only need the commissioning team to have the right technical skills but also the ability to communicate knowledge to the larger construction, testing, and operations teams. Greater process complexity may increase the resources and time required to commission the plant. Each unit process should be commissioned in a logical manner as construction is completed and feed materials become available. The complexity of commissioning increases with the number of parties involved with the project and, therefore, increases with contractual complexity from LSTK to EPC to EPCM. If the project involves expansion of an operating plant, or brownfields project, an added order of complexity and level of project planning is required, due to the requirement to schedule cut-ins to an operating plant and commissioning of new equipment alongside operating plant. The commissioning of new technology in a brownfields site is perhaps the most challenging commissioning activity. Large projects are typically associated with more complex contracting strategies but not necessarily greater flow sheet complexity. The complexity of the contracting strategy and the increased focus on key items of equipment, such as large grinding mills, elevate the manning requirements. Higher throughput, and associated larger equipment, does lead to increased complexity in service equipment such as lubrication, cooling, and control systems. Gearless motor drives on large semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) and ball mills require significant installation testing and commissioning effort. The 20 MW drive for a large Australian gold/copper project with a capital cost of approximately A$295M in 1998, took three technicians over 6 Commissioning is a demanding period during which pressures can be brought to bear by the owner on contractors to maximize cash flow and profit. Commissioning can be characterized by a succession of crises if preparation and communication of the commissioning plan are not effectively completed during the engineering and construction phase of the project. Planning must commence in parallel with detailed design and be integrated with the technical, maintenance, and operating review process. Planning and scheduling aim at ensuring a common goal and focus on a logical and sequential approach to the plant commissioning phase. The planning process includes the early identification of key personnel who will ensure the operability of the plant and the sequential construction of services as required prior to the main plant precommissioning activities.  A detailed discussion of the planning process, roles and responsibilities, scheduling and turnover package preparation was presented by Sequence scheduling is typically conducted on three levels: Project commissioning schedule by facility, system, sub-system, and unit process Three-week rolling schedules as sub-sets of the project schedule detailing the precommissioning activities to an equipment level, or detailing specific commissioning milestones, task durations, allocated resources and progress to date Daily commissioning schedules as sub-sets of the three weekly schedule detailing tasks to be conducted over the next 24 Preliminary commissioning schedules are developed and continually reassessed during construction. The level of detail is dependent on the project and may vary from a bar chart of general process areas to a detailed schedule based on engineering equipment lists. The Ok Tedi Gold Project Preoperational Test Program involved the scheduling and completion of approximately 3000 individual tests ( As software packages have improved, the tendency toward more detailed sequencing of tasks has increased. In 2003, the commissioning plan for the Telfer Project was based entirely on an electronic database that was fully integrated with the engineering databases and reports on all activities ( Commissioning responsibilities for a typical gold plant are summarized in The commissioning team is responsible for the following tasks: Preparation and updating the commissioning schedule, procedures, and budgets Administration of safety clearances and tagging procedures for control purposes, for safety of commissioning personnel and for protection of plant equipment during commissioning Coordination of vendor representatives for commissioning Notification to the owner and site contractors in writing of all intentions to test, often referred to as notices of energization and/or pressurization Coordinating handover of commissioned plant areas in satisfactory condition to the owner, along with appropriate documentation. Records of precommissioning testing are forwarded to the owner as part of the handover package Coordinating with the construction manager on the finalization of punchlist tasks  Handover packages are compiled on completion of construction for turnover to the commissioning manager and on achieving mechanical completion or on achieving final completion, depending on the contract, for handover to the owner. The handover package includes all testing documentation, equipment manuals, contract status statements, punch lists, as-built drawings, and all other documentation pertinent to the facility, area, or unit operation completed. The packages detail the tests completed, the contractual status, as-built drawings, punch lists, and all other information pertaining to the facility. Details of typical package content are provided by The entire plant is typically split into unit process based packages composed of data for facilities, systems, and sub-systems. These packages are defined to enable the progressive turnover of equipment from contractors to the commissioning team, water commissioning, and turnover of plant areas from the commissioning team to the owner. Logical sequencing of these unit processes and systems for testing and commissioning also form the basis of the commissioning schedule. An example of a typical breakdown is provided in Vendor representatives may have input and site representation during installation, installation testing, water commissioning, ore commissioning, and performance testing. An important contractual role is confirmation that the installation is in accordance with requirements and that vendor warranties are in place. The budgeting and control of vendor representatives are jointly managed by the construction and commissioning team. The total budget for vendor representatives on large projects can amount to millions of dollars. Participation on small projects may be restricted to final sign-off of installation or specialist setup. When several days of travel are required to and from a remote or overseas site, the costs for each vendor representative attending site increases significantly. A decision may be taken to have vendor representatives attend site for only key items of equipment. If this is the case, commissioning team manning levels need to account for the work otherwise conducted by vendor representatives. The managing contractor's commissioning team should have sufficient experience to determine the requirement for vendor representation, and sufficient expertise to determine when vendor warranties should be exercised. The principal aim in all construction and commissioning is to ensure the safety of all participants while completing the necessary work. This is facilitated through the planning process and the rigorous application of an isolation and tag-out procedure for testing of all energized systems. The isolation and tag-out procedure is more rigorous in commissioning than later plant operation due to the concurrent construction, testing and operation of plant facilities and the lack of familiarity of construction workers with plant operation requirements, as well as plant operators with construction requirements. The procedure needs to clearly define the isolation of equipment for maintenance or modification and the associated tagging process. Particular care is needed on brownfields sites, where commissioning of new equipment occurs alongside an operating plant. Cleanliness inspections are an important part of the precommissioning process and should be completed for all facilities prior to each of the various stages of testing. The definition of precommissioning may vary from project to project but typically includes installation testing, no-load testing, and system checks. For the purpose of this discussion, precommissioning includes verification of plant and equipment (C0) and dry commissioning (C1) as defined in Sufficient resources must be in place to do a thorough job of testing. Incomplete testing leaves doubts as to functionality, creates extreme credibility problems, and must therefore be avoided. The number of personnel involved in commissioning is a function of the size and complexity of the project. For a typical large gold project, with the responsibilities shown in Owner's representative(s), for witnessing tests Managing contractor's team Construction manager Commissioning manager (if required to assist with quality control) Commissioning administrator (recommended to handle the piles of paperwork on all except smaller and less complex projects) Commissioning team Process engineers Mechanical/piping engineers Electrical/instrument engineers and technicians Process control engineers and technicians Construction superintendents Mechanical/piping Electrical/instrumentation Vendor engineers and technicians Sub-contractor's commissioning team Supervisor Tradesmen/commissioning technicians (to do the work). The owner's operating and maintenance personnel can contribute to pre-commissioning. This can assist with seamless transfer of a facility from the contractor to the owner, as these personnel gain early experience of the plant. The effective use of the owner's team is dependent on the owner's ability to bring on personnel early and ensure that sufficient time is available for training and preparation. Project commissioning is ideally conducted in the following sequence: Infrastructure used during construction, including warehouses, offices and laydown areas, and temporary services (sewerage, power, and water) High voltage (HV) switchyard Sub-stations and motor control centers (MCCs) (particularly those supplying water and air services) Water supply, storage, and distribution systems Water and air distribution services necessary to conduct preoperational testing in the main plant External facilities required for plant operation, such as crushing plants and tailings dams Reagent and similar services in the main plant Main operating plant The aim of the above sequence is to ensure that all services are operable prior to completion of the main plant, allowing focus on the main plant in the period immediately prior to process commissioning. Verification of plant and equipment is the verification that the plant or equipment has been constructed in accordance with the relevant design documents and vendor requirements. Typically, it will include hydrostatic and pneumatic pressure tests, flushing of lines, lubrication, alignment checks, electrical point-to-point checks, megger tests, and component identification checks. All equipment and systems are cleaned out prior to completion of C0 testing and handover to the commissioning team. Construction personnel are generally responsible for C0 testing. Handover from construction to commissioning is accompanied by a package indicating the general status of the works and associated contracts, as described previously. Dry commissioning and the operation of energized systems typically come under the management of the Commissioning Manager's team. This includes the inspection, testing and no-load energisation of plant and equipment to verify conformance with design. Typically this will include initial motor energization, direction of rotation (DOR) checks and no-load motor operation for bearing temperature, and vibration checks. Initial motor energization and testing will often require motors to be uncoupled (for example centrifugal pumps) and drive alignments to be re-checked. Extended operation of some equipment (no-load testing) without ore or water may also be undertaken to confirm readiness for process commissioning. This typically includes feeders and conveyors where clearances and initial belt tracking can be checked. Dry commissioning also includes initial control system checks as the objective is to verify that the installation is in accordance with the plant design ahead of process commissioning. This typically includes field and remote start/stop commands, interlock checks, and initial calibration of field instruments (for example, belt weightometers). Process commissioning is defined as those activities and tests where plant and equipment are initially exposed to benign loads (for example, air and water) and then exposed to normal operating loads and process fluids such as ore, carbon, and reagents. Process commissioning comprises the discreet sequential stages of wet commissioning (C2) and ore commissioning (C3) as defined in The organizational structure for the management and control of the commissioning phase is dependent on the contract structure. For LSTK projects, the managing contractor controls all aspects of plant commissioning through to final completion, although the owner exerts ultimate control, as the managing contractor aims to hand over the plant in the shortest time frame. Owner's personnel commonly operate and maintain the plant under the direction of the managing contractor's commissioning manager. For EPC and EPCM contracts, the management and control of C3, ore commissioning, may fall to either the owner or the managing contractor. The owner may wish to control commissioning where the owner's team has extensive commissioning or operating experience with similar processing plants. The number of personnel involved in process commissioning is a function of the size and complexity of the project. For a moderately large EPCM project, the people required to complete process commissioning include: Owner's representative(s), for witnessing tests Managing contractors team Commissioning manager Commissioning administrator (if required) Commissioning engineers Process/metallurgical Electrical/instrumentation Mechanical/piping PCS/control “Mod squad” Supervisors Tradesmen Vendor engineers and technicians The task of leading a commissioning team requires that the commissioning manager has sufficient experience to command the respect of the construction, commissioning, and owner's teams and has the flexibility to adjust the approach to maximize outcomes at minimum cost outlay. The ability to manage the handover process and work with both the construction manager and owner's team is important. The commissioning process commonly results in a requirement for modifications to piping, platework, instrumentation, and electrical systems, as well as adjustments to mechanical equipment. Such work is preferably undertaken by a dedicated team, the “mod squad” in order to divorce it from contract work and agreed variations. The “mod squad” is commonly formed from members of the construction and installation contractors, as their contract work winds down, and reports to the commissioning manager. While the responsibility for commissioning varies with the nature of the contract, the owner's operators and tradesmen usually operate and maintain the facility, following the introduction of ore, under the direction of the responsible party. In all cases, the operation of the plant should be conducted through the owner's management structure. A balance between training and achievement is required to arrive at a successful commissioning outcome. Failure to communicate and train owner's staff will result in alienation and friction between commissioning personnel and operators. If the owner's personnel are unready when the plant is handed over, plant performance is likely to drop for a period following departure of the commissioning team. This will result in a greater loss to the project than the loss resulting from the extra time taken to effectively implement actions on a team basis. There have been mixed experiences where owner's operational personnel have been co-opted into systems checks and water commissioning. Ill-prepared owner's operators can interpret a high frequency of installation “faults” as poor-quality engineering and construction. This can lead to a loss of confidence in the plant on the part of the operators, which is detrimental to a successful handover. On completion of C1, dry commissioning, plant, and equipment in the respective system or facility are ready for wet commissioning. Wet commissioning involves the testing of an individual or group of integrated items of plant and equipment under benign load (air or water) to demonstrate stable operation of a commissioning system under this load. The systems will be operated as close as practically possible to normal plant operating conditions and upset conditions will be simulated where practical. Wet commissioning activities typically include: Filling tanks and vessels with water Pumping water along liquid and slurry lines Simulation of operating conditions, using water and air, where practical Testing of systems with operating equipment Operation in accordance with the control philosophy, including PCS sequence testing and automated control where practical Surveillance for abnormal conditions (for example, excessive vibration or bearing temperature) The use of system demonstrations at the conclusion of wet commissioning is a positive approach. Operations personnel should be invited to test any and all process control interlocks and sequences with the support and advice of the commissioning team to assist them in understanding the total system. The objective of the effort put into precommissioning and wet commissioning is to provide a plant that is ready to operate. If this is the case, ore commissioning should not be a prolonged problem-solving session. Shutdown of the plant should be on a planned basis, and solely to check, adjust or modify equipment during the run-in phase and to conduct planned maintenance. The commencement of ore commissioning exposes the project to increased risk. The potential for equipment to be maltreated or damaged is high and resultant delays will impact on project economics. The planning and scheduling of ore commissioning target minimization of risk. The detailed planning and scheduling conducted for plant precommissioning should be carried through to plant ore commissioning and operational readiness. An effective planning process for ore commissioning includes the owner ensuring the supply of sufficient and suitable ore, consumables and maintenance spares, together with adequately trained personnel. The managing contractor should ensure that the owner is fully aware of the detailed requirements to avoid possible conflict and loss of production. Plant operators should understand the basic conceptual process and its method of application, including the interactions between various plant modules (e.g., grinding and CIL or water balance/storage impacts on plant operation). Plant operators also require some exposure to the duties and practices required to operate the plant. Tradesmen should ideally become acquainted with the plant by becoming involved in precommissioning activities as previously discussed. This also ensures that any deficiencies in skills are identified prior to plant start-up, allowing for the implementation of appropriate training without impacting on plant operation. Training packages may be prepared for operating and maintenance positions. These can include simulation packages so that personnel experience typical operating problems prior to plant operation. Maintenance personnel should be fully acquainted with the maintenance requirements of any novel equipment, including selected visits to vendor shops for specialist training. Informal training sessions, as part of visits by vendor representatives, can introduce personnel to unfamiliar equipment. For larger projects, a full operational readiness program is recommended that focuses on preparation of the project for operation, including operator training, preventative maintenance planning, management systems preparation, process simulation, criticality analysis, and document management. At times, things go wrong during commissioning. Although it is often necessary to attack symptoms in the short term, it is important to analyze the problem and identify the root cause before attempting to prepare a plan to rectify the problem. The plan must be communicated to all stakeholders; otherwise, confidence in the commissioning process may be lost. The principal causes of poor ore commissioning outcomes are: Poor process definition resulting from lack of test work, inadequate design data, or poor process design Incorrect equipment specification, selection, or vendor advice in design Lack of experience and expertise in design, construction or commissioning Lack of planning and scheduling of activities during construction and commissioning Inadequate consumables and spares supply resulting from lack of planning Gaps in process control logic due to inadequate FAT testing or testing across scopes of work Unsatisfactory refurbishment of second-hand equipment Design, construction, or installation errors in pipework, wiring, and control logic Inappropriate commissioning management (too many chiefs and lack of communication) Errors in testing, operating, and maintenance All issues should be discussed openly. Poor communication between parties can lead to poor contractual relations and will result in less than optimum commissioning outcomes. Even the most catastrophic design error is best identified prior to ore commissioning, thus allowing for the development of contingency plans to minimize the impact. Depending on contractual arrangements, a managing contractor may sometimes be required to undertake performance tests to demonstrate that a plant is fit for purpose ( Typically, the contractor warrants that the plant will achieve each of the following throughput tests: Maximum primary crusher throughput over a 1-h period Average primary crusher throughput over a 7-day period with an 80% passing size of the crushed-ore product of the crushing circuit no larger than, for example, 150 Grinding circuit throughput over a 7-day period with an 80% passing size of the grinding circuit product (cyclone overflow) no larger than, for example, 106 Typical process tests include the following: Flotation recovery comparable to that obtained in laboratory locked cycle tests Soluble gold values in the CIL circuit tailings solution of, for example, less than 0.02 Required advancement of carbon batches through the adsorption tanks, acid wash, elution, and return to the adsorption tanks via the reactivation kiln Gold concentration remaining on the stripped carbon, for example, 100 Gold concentration remaining in the barren eluate shall be, for example, 10 Other contractor warranties that may be required by the owner include: The crushing and other plant shall achieve the above requirements with minimal spillage, without the use of standby pumps and other equipment and without undue vibrations Specific tests required by the owner or financier The owner is typically required to warrant ore supply and the characteristics of the ore, such as ore hardness, gold grade and other relevant factors that may impact on the contractor's ability to achieve their warranties in the performance tests. The aim of both the owner and the contractor should be that plant performance during commissioning and early operation negates the requirement to formally undertake the performance tests, in part or full. The owner must pass control of the Optimization of the plant by the project owner continues after plant commissioning with the aim of maximizing plant throughput within the limitations of ore supply and the maximum capacity of the high capital cost unit processes. This is typically the comminution circuit or downstream concentrate treatment process (e.g., POX or bio-oxidation plant) for refractory gold ores. Recovery and operating costs are other targets for optimization. The Macraes Gold Project has treated sulfide ore, oxide ore (in campaigns) and retreated some tailings. The expansion in the throughput of the Macraes Gold Project since plant commissioning in 1990 is illustrated in The following step changes occurred in plant throughput as a result of plant de-bottlenecking and mine expansion: In late 1994, the plant was expanded by the addition of flotation and fine grinding capacity. The primary grind size was increased and ultra-fine grinding of flotation concentrate installed to improve gold recovery from flotation concentrate in the subsequent CIL circuit. In late 1999, a further expansion of the plant was undertaken with the addition of a ball mill (ML350) to reduce the primary grind size and allow a further increase in throughput. In addition, a POX plant was installed to improve refractory gold recovery through oxidation of the flotation concentrate. In late 2001, a retreatment flotation circuit was installed to recover gold from old sulfide tailings and in mid-2003, a further single-stage SAG mill was installed to allow for the parallel treatment of oxide ore or additional sulfide ore. Feed rate remained relatively constant between 2004 and 2013 at between 5 and 6 Each plant expansion was followed by a steady increase in plant throughput. The only element of the plant that became redundant over this period was the ultra-fine regrind facility that was shut down in 1995 due to higher-than-expected operating costs. Terms and their definitions vary from project to project. The following definitions apply to the terms used in much of this section.             The term practical completion is commonly used for this stage of commissioning, but has been avoided in this section owing to the many different definitions of this term.
