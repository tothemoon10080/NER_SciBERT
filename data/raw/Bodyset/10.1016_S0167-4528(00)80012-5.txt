Flotation columns are common devices in cleaning circuits in the mineral processing industry. The operation and control of these columns often have the final responsibility for the quality of the concentrate grade and, to a less extent, for the recovery of the cleaning circuit. The use of basic distributed control has frequently lead to a large variability in concentrate grade and recovery, as can be observed in many concentrators world-wide. The contribution to this variability usually comes from different sources, severely constraining the performance of conventional control systems. In this paper, the industrial experience in developing supervisory control systems is discussed in order to provide procedures for the diagnosis of instrumentation, calibration and maintenance, prior to the implementation of control schemes on top of the distributed control system. Examples based on control systems developed for E1 Teniente and Salvador Concentrators, from Codelco-Chile, are used to illustrate how some of the constraints on the controllability of the process can be relaxed.
