Young’s modulus (E) is one of the basic geomechanical parameters used in rock engineering in practice. It is determined based on uniaxial compressive test (UCS). However, according to International Society of Rock Mechanics it can be calculated by three different ways: as the tangent, secant and average modulus. The results from each method are significantly different. The UCS tests was carried out on 237 rock specimens with the slenderness ratio 2 of Carboniferous claystones, mudstones and sandstones. The axial deformation was always measured automatically by the displacement measurement device (LVDT) built into the testing machine and connected to the hydraulic piston. Then the Young’s modulus was calculated for each test by all three methods. The analysis of the results is presented in this paper to show the difference between all the three moduli calculated for each specimen, and to recommend the best method of Young’s modulus determination. First, the typical range of the elastic linear deformability for the chosen rock types was determined as 25–75% of the peak strength at confidence interval 95% for these sedimentary rocks. The modulus value distributions obtained from each calculation method were compared using statistical parameters: mean value, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, mean difference at confidence interval 95%, and non-uniformity coefficient.

These values show low coherence between secant and average modulus (ca. 23% difference) and good consistency of average and tangent modulus. Based on the analysis, tangent Young’s modulus is recommended as the guiding one at the constant range of 30–70% of the ultimate stress. Secant Young’s modulus, as it comprises not only elastic strain but the pore compaction as well, should be named as modulus of deformability. This conclusion was further confirmed by the regression analysis between UCS and E. The highest regression coefficients and the lowest standard error of the regression was obtained for tangent Young’s modulus determination method. In addition, modulus ratio MR for claystones, mudstones and sandstones was studied and determined as 274, 232 and 223 respectively.Engineering rock mechanics is applied in mining engineering practice to describe rock mass behaviour due to mining activity. The response of rocks and rock masses to changes in the stress fields affected by mining is a key issue for the evaluation of roadway stability and support design. The stress and strain distribution around a tunnel or mining openings strictly depends on the rock mass properties. The parameters that describe the elastic properties prior to rock failure are: Young’s modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio. Since the shear modulus and bulk modulus are functions of Young’s modulus and Poisson's ratio the last two parameters play the most important role in solving geomechanical problems. As rock is elastic-brittle material, some authors stress that the elastic modulus has become a critical parameter for describing rocks behaviour under loading ( The International Society of Rock Mechanics suggests three methods for determining deformation rock properties in uniaxial compression ( It is worth noting that In this research, 237 uniaxial compression tests were carried out to examine the methods of Young’s modulus determination and to analyse the values obtained. The tests were carried out on Carboniferous claystones, mudstones and sandstones. The range of elasticity and modulus ratio ( When dealing with the mechanical behaviour of solids the assumption is that they are homogeneous, continuous and isotropic, but rocks are much more complex and their mechanical properties vary according to scale, mineral composition or matrix type ( The laboratory uniaxial compression test, triaxial compression test as well as ultrasonic or acoustic emission investigations can be used to evaluate the strength parameters of rocks (      The range and the extent of all the above phases depend on the type of rock. Rock type is determined by mineral composition and rock structure and texture ( The stress-strain curve for axial deformations is the best way to test rock elasticity and to determine the elastic modulus (Young’s modulus). The International Society of Rock Mechanics suggests three standard methods for its determination. They are as follows ( Tangent Young’s modulus Average Young’s modulus Secant Young’s modulus There are other methods which can be used for Young’s modulus determination, but they are not widely applied ( The range of investigation for tangent and secant modulus is chosen by a researcher. The first limit is the end of phase (I) – pores compressibility. Micro- and macro-dilatancy limits can be used for deciding on the second limit. They correspond to the limits of the elastic state of the rock ( Young’s modulus of selected sedimentary rock types was tested in this study. From the perspective of mechanical properties, they are the most unpredictable rocks in rock engineering practice. Three modulus determination methods were used on three rock types to evaluate the coherence of the results. All together 237 compression tests were run: 86 on sandstones, 70 on mudstones and 81 on claystones. All three types of rock were Carboniferous from the Upper Silesia Basin in Poland, lying next to the hard coal beds of the 400, 500 and 600 group, at a depth of 700–1000 m. These rocks are typical geological formations extending from Ukraine, Poland, Czechia to Germany. The sandstone studied had a fine-grained structure, occasionally medium-grained, sometimes with silt or coal lamina ( The tests were carried out on a servo-operated press made by Walter Since the method of displacement measurement influences the results ( The samples were cylindrical or cubical (cuboid) with the height to diameter (width) ratio of H/D = 2.0, which is slightly below the ratio range 2.5–3.0 recommended by ISRM ( Many pieces of research show that rock type ( The samples were 35–65 mm in diameter. Their diameter depended on the core diameter – the size of the borehole drilled on site. Cube side length (specimens cut from the rock blocks) was always 50 mm. The change in specimen diameter is reported as the key factor affecting laboratory strength-strain test results ( The   The range of testing rock elasticity is not set by standards and should be adjusted for common rock. The limits for this range are individual for each rock sample. Although the micro-dilatancy limit is the first threshold for a rock of losing its elasticity, it is not until the macro-dilatancy limit is reached a non-linear deformation is shown, if one considers the longitudinal deformation – the easiest and the most common way of rock sample deformation measurement. Hence, the elastic range for this investigation was established between the stress at the end of phase (I) – the end of pore compaction – and the stress at the end of phase (III) – macro-dilatancy limit ( The results of lower elastic limit investigation for the selected rock types are shown in The average limit values, mean and median, are closest to each other for mudstone and amount to 24.4% and 24.0% of It is important that the standard deviation of limits of elasticity for all tested sedimentary rocks is equal to ca. 7–8% of The ranges of lower and upper elastic limit for the investigated rock types are shown in Three moduli were determined for rocks based on ISRM standards and under the assumption that the fixed percentage values of ultimate stress for tangent Young's modulus calculation were 20% and 80% of Additionally, only a few papers present recommendations regarding the investigation. From studying secant modulus determined from 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum stress based on the standards of the American Institute For Standards ( There is an interesting study by These examples confirm that the manner of calculation of Young’s modulus is entirely arbitrary. There are numerous studies concerning the influence of fissures or voids ( The results of the studies carried out by the authors are presented in As the average Young’s modulus is based on the full linear part of the stress-strain curve to describe the rock elasticity, the analysis of the difference between the modulus for consecutive samples was carried out by comparing the average modulus with the tangent and secant modulus. It is worth noting that the spread in calculated modulus for individual samples can be high. The highest difference between average and secant modulus appears for claystone and mudstone – up to 2.56 and 2.28 respectively ( Modulus ratio Analysis of uniaxial compressive strength The regression analysis was performed for all three rock types for three variants of relationships between The most common parameter used in engineering practice for the fast and easy evaluation of Young’s modulus is the modulus ratio The values of Young’s modulus for claystone, mudstone and sandstone determined on the basis of three different calculations were juxtaposed with the results of other investigations on the same rock types ( The review of modulus ratio values given in the papers shows that they vary a great deal and beyond the recommended range suggested by Carboniferous claystone – Carboniferous mudstone – Carboniferous sandstone – Attention should also be paid to the fact that there are not so many tests results on the The IRSM recommends three methods of determination of Young’s modulus from the The regression analysis shows that by applying a linear equation for the It is important that the axial deformation was always measured automatically by the displacement measurement device (LVDT) built into the testing machine and connected to the hydraulic piston. By definition, Young’s modulus describes the elastic properties of rock, therefore it should be inferred from the straight-line part of the stress-strain curve of the Secant Young’s modulus, as it comprises not only elastic but also the first phase of rock deformation i.e. pore compaction, should rather be named a modulus of deformability instead of Young’s modulus. The risk analysis of the engineering case, which takes into consideration the variability of rock types as well as, for example, the availability of samples and tests, may suggest the more conservative use of secant Young’s modulus. However, the Young’s modulus defined to describe the elastic properties of materials needs to be determined on the elastic part of the rock characteristic. None declared.
