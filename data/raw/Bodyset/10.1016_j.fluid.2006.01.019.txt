The stepwise solvation-equilibrium model of Stokes and Robinson is used for a description of departures from ideality in ionic solutions. It is shown how to construct a thermodynamically consistent model including solvation effects. Simple expressions are derived for the mean ion solvation number. The model is applied to strong electrolyte solutions (pure

                     ) by taking the mean spherical approximation (MSA) for the long-range contribution to the Gibbs energy and a local composition model, the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) model, for the short-range contribution.The modelling of the thermodynamic properties of ionic solutions can have various applications in solution chemistry, in geochemistry and for the design and control of industrial processes. In the latter domain, it may be useful for liquid–liquid extraction, distillation, hydrometallurgy, seawater desalination, absorption refrigeration, crystallisation and synthesis of drugs and chemicals, with not only water as the solvent but also organic solvents and aqueous solvent mixtures. Various models have been proposed in the literature, among which one may distinguish two types: (i) models based on a statistical mechanical treatment of the system, pictured as a collection of objects of definite shape and size, interacting through elementary known pair potentials, and (ii) semi-empirical or phenomenological models, comprising a contribution from electrostatic interactions (generally a Debye–Hückel term) that is generally decoupled from other interactions. Models of type (i) are constructed at the McMillan–Mayer (MM) level of solutions For a strong electrolyte in water, ion–ion electrostatic interactions are one such major effect. Their influence on departures from ideality can be expressed using a suitable model such as the MSA. This effect is dominant at low salt concentration. As salt concentration becomes higher, ion–ion interactions become progressively screened while the contribution of other forces becomes relatively increasingly important. These other forces are short-ranged (SR) as opposed to long-ranged ion–ion electrostatic forces. SR forces between particles have various origins and their effect is much more difficult to estimate than that of electrostatic forces. This difficulty can be circumvented at the MM level where only the solvent-averaged potentials between ions need be considered At this stage, it is necessary to distinguish between strong and weak attractive SR forces. Strong SR attractions lead to association in solution, namely solvation, chemical association and ion-pairing. Weak SR attractions may alternatively be termed van der Waals forces. The importance of association has long been recognised Although hydration is known to be a crucial process in aqueous ionic solutions, the thermodynamic models taking it explicitly into account are rather scarce. The simplest way of accounting for this effect is to suppose a In the present paper, hydration effects are introduced by utilising the basic assumptions of the latter model We make here the approximation that simple anions are not solvated, meaning that no solvent molecules are firmly attached to this type of anion on a sufficiently long time scale (this notion is distinguished from the notion of coordination, the former having a more dynamical meaning than the latter This simplification is besides very common. It was used in the original work of Stokes and Robinson In contrast, some water molecules are tightly bound to small and/or plurivalent cations. This view is confirmed by recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, for Li In the present work, it is shown how the various hydration equilibria can be handled in a thermodynamically consistent way, for a given Gibbs energy that is assumed to be split into short- and long-range (electrostatic) contributions. The further assumption of independent hydration sites on cation allows one to account for all stepwise hydration equilibria in a compact way. Finally, the method is applied by taking particular forms for the electrostatic and SR contributions to the Gibbs energy of solution, namely the MSA and NRTL expressions, respectively. The theoretical aspects of this work are developed in the next section of this paper. Section Most of the calculations of this work were done using the symbolic calculation device Maple We first consider an aqueous solution containing one strong electrolyte, Hereafter we use the subscripts 1 and W to distinguish the total water and the We adopt the basic view of Stokes and Robinson These equilibria imply the following relation between the chemical potentials of the species: Then, considering the various hydrates C( Relations similar to Eqs. We now present a new method to treat hydration equilibria and departures from ideality in closed form as follows. For each hydrated cation C( We now turn to the calculation of the electrostatic and SR activity coefficients appearing in Eq. In this paper, we make the simplification that the different forms of the hydrated cation, the C( The electrostatic contribution to the Gibbs energy of solution, Therefore, if we assume that all cation hydrates are energetically equivalent, one obtains from Eq. The form of By applying Eq. We assume that the cation possesses It can be shown using statistical considerations at infinite dilution that the equilibrium constants In particular, for Thus, it stems from Eqs. At infinite dilution of salt ( The amount of free water is determined by calculating the mole fraction The mean activity coefficient of salt in the LR system is This conversion from the set of variables In Eq. In Eq. In the present model, all solvation equilibria are accounted for consistently, with all intermediate activity coefficients calculated from the Gibbs energy of the system. This guarantees that the mean salt activity coefficient In the case of strong acids (such as HCl) in water, it may be preferable to consider that the state of minimum hydration for the proton is the hydronium ion, H In that case, one may utilise Eq. For the practical calculation of activity coefficients used in the Results section, the particular forms taken for the contributions to the Gibbs energy of solution were as follows. For the electrostatic contribution, we adopted the restricted primitive MSA expression In Eq. Using Eq. For the SR contribution, we took the NRTL expression for the system composed of the species: the free water W, the “dressed” cations C( The NRTL model, proposed by Renon and Prausnitz In this framework and assuming that all cations are characterised by the same NRTL parameters, the Gibbs energies per particle for one salt in water are respectively given by In the above formulae, the Moreover, one has in Eqs. This model can be applied to the case of salts in solvent mixtures Because It may be shown that the expression for the mean activity coefficient of salt (Eq. In Eqs. First, it was verified numerically that, as stated above at the end of Section In this work, parameter values were adjusted by simultaneously fitting the experimental osmotic and activity coefficients for strong electrolytes In the calculation of the osmotic and activity coefficients, it was noted that the terms containing derivatives of volume The values for the number of sites on a given cation, Next, an ‘optimum’ value for The procedure of determining common parameter values for the alkali halides decreases the effective number of adjusted parameters to a mean value of 3 per salt. The results for the parameters are presented in The results of Other comments about the Typical plots of the osmotic coefficient are shown in Lastly, the contributions to the osmotic coefficient, defined by Eq. Thus, an important conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that the influence of hydration on the osmotic coefficient is important at moderate and high concentration, even though the variation of Mean activity coefficients of salts in binary water–organic solvent mixtures at 25 In all cases, the present description (for strong electrolytes) could not be applied to the case of high proportions of organic solvent because of important ion pairing in such media. Therefore, in practice, the proportion of organic solvent in the mixed aqueous solvent solutions was limited to values allowing a satisfactory fit of the data or to values known to ensure complete dissociation of salt, as in the case of NaCl in water–ethanol mixtures containing less than 70 wt.% of ethanol Values for the parameters For computing the electrostatic contributions to the activity coefficients, it was assumed that the mean ionic diameter is given by the following relation: The number of additional unknown parameters is of five, namely With these assumptions about the values of As shown by the AARD’s of fits in The formalism developed in this work provides a compact and thermodynamically consistent framework to account for stepwise hydration effects on the departures from ideality in ionic solutions. It may be used with other expressions for the contributions to the Gibbs energy, In future work, the present model will be extended to the case of highly concentrated ionic solutions and associating electrolytes.  activity of species anion Helmholtz energy per volume unit cation cation hydrated with cation solvated with density of solvent charge of proton activity coefficient of activity coefficient of Gibbs energy of solution Gibbs energy per particle of hydration number of cation by solvent Boltzmann constant equilibrium constant for attachment of a molecule of equilibrium constant molality molar mass of solvent number of sites on cation Avogadro number number of particles of defined by Eqs. set of particle numbers at LR level (Eq. set of particle numbers within the model (Eq. temperature volume of solution  water stoichiometric mole fraction “true” mole fraction scale valence of ion coordination number NRTL random parameter  mean salt activity coefficient on molal scale MSA screening parameter relative permittivity of solvent permittivity of a vacuum Debye screening parameter Bjerrum length chemical potential of species  stoichiometric number of species number density of species diameter of species osmotic coefficient free water free solvent total water total solvent electrostatic contribution contribution from hydration ideal contribution contribution within mean spherical approximation contribution of short range forces reference state Stéphane Krebs acknowledges financial support from the German Arbeitsgemeinschaft industrieller Forschungvereiningungen “Otto von Guericke” e.V.
