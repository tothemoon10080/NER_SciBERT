The motivation of this work was driven to improve the thermal stability in systems where polymorphic transformations can result in an additional driving force, upsetting the expected thermodynamic stability. In this study, Fe92Ni8 alloys with Zr and nano-Y2O3 additions were produced by ball milling and then annealed at high temperatures. Emphasis was placed on understanding the effects of dispersed nano-Y2O3 particle additions and their effect on microstructural stability at and above the bcc-to-fcc transformation occurring at 700°C in Fe–Ni systems. Results reveal that microstructural stability and hardness can be promoted by a combination of Zr and Y2O3 additions, that being mostly effective for stability before and after phase transition, respectively. The mechanical strength of these alloys is achieved by a unique microstructure comprised a ultra-fine grain Fe base matrix, which contains dispersions of both nano-scale in-situ formed Zr base intermetallics and ex-situ added Y2O3 secondary oxide phases. Both of these were found to be essential for a combination of high thermal stability and high mechanical strength properties.Our previous research on mechanically alloyed Fe–Ni–Zr alloys Our hypothesis is, that by striking a balance between the benefits of adding Zr, while enhancing the stability by artificially inducing a dispersion of stable nano-oxide particles (through mechanical milling), rather than depending on elevated Zr contents and the in-situ formation of secondary phases to pin the microstructure, it will be possible to exceed this 900 Ball milling, known for producing extremely high strength powders containing grain sizes reaching the limits of nanocrystallinity has also been found equally efficient at finely and uniformly dispersing nano-scale oxide particles in a matrix It is well known that oxide dispersion strengthened steels have a unique set of high strength thermal resistant properties for high temperature applications Details of the experimental setups for mechanical alloying of Fe–Ni–Zr alloys were described elsewhere  These intermetallics containing Zr can be extremely hard (∼10  The hypothesis of this study is that 1    The observed stability at low temperatures can be attributed to Zr solutes. As we have discussed previously The effect of 1 A similar result is observed with the addition of just Y As mentioned earlier, since Y The novelty of these alloys can be attributed to a unique microstructure comprised a ultra-fine grain Fe base matrix, which contains dispersions of both nano-scale in-situ formed Zr base intermetallics and ex-situ added Y The research reported in this paper was supported by
