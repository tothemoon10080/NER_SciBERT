Re-concentrate is a complex multi-components Re-system consisting of Ce, La, Pr and Nd, which brings great difficulties for investigating the transformation and separation behaviors of REEs. The effect of super-gravity field on the mass transfer and phase separation behaviors of REEs was investigated in this paper, and the phenomenon of successive precipitation and separation of REEs was discovered. The Re3+ was firstly precipitated into Re-oxyfluoride phase with OF3-, which overcame the interface tension to be evidently separated into the bottom layer under the action of super gravity. Subsequently, the Re3+ were successively precipitated with FeO3

                     3- into Re-ferrate phase and britholite phase, which were separated further into the middle and top layers along the super gravity direction. Moreover, various REEs were efficiently recovered into the different Re-phases, respectively. The theoretical and experimental results verified the significant enhancement of super gravity on the mass transfer and phase separation of REEs, and its efficient application in REEs recovery from multi-component Re-system.Mass transfer and phase separation are usually proven to be the main restrictive links in the physical chemical processes, especially in the case of high-temperature Compared to above strengthening methods, super gravity method is a more effective intensification technology, which has the characteristics of greatly enhancing the relative motion between various phases with different density Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical materials for wide-ranging applications in space and green technologies This paper introduces the super-gravity field into the Re-concentrate, to investigate the effect of super gravity on the precipitation and separation behaviors of REEs in this complex multi-component Re-system. Moreover, the enhancement of super gravity on mass transfer and phase separation of REEs, and its efficient application in REEs recovery from the multi-component Re-system was verified through theoretical and experimental results of XRD, SEM-EDS, XRF, EPMA, and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The experiments were carried out in a centrifugal device incorporating a heating function, that is illustrated in The Re-concentrate employed in this research was obtained through multi-stage beneficiation of the Bayan Obo ore in Inner Mongolia, China The experiments were carried out in the centrifugal device shown in All of the samples with various cooling rates were divided into two halves on average along the longitudinal center line and observed using a Leica optical microscope (DM4M) to characterize the multilayer structure in the entire sample. Subsequently, the multilayer samples were crossly divided into three parts along the two interfaces and analyzed further by SEM-EDS, XRD and Raman spectrometer, to investigate the micro structures, mineral structures and mineral compositions of the various layers, respectively. Furthermore, the distribution of REEs in different layers was characterized by the electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The mass fractions of Ce The Leica optical microscope was used to characterize accurately the multilayer structure in the samples attained under super gravity and that of the parallel sample. The overall optical micrographs montaged by over 20 images (magnification 5 × 10) of the samples attained at the various cooling rates of 10, 5 and 2 K/min are shown in The mineral structures in different layers attained under super gravity and that of the parallel sample were characterized by XRD. As the XRD pattern of the sample with The microstructures and element composition of Re-phases in different layers attained under super gravity and that of normal gravity were determined further by SEM-EDS. From the SEM-EDS images of the sample with By contrast, the Re-phases were successively precipitated and separated into different layers under super gravity, as presented in Comparing the sizes of Re-phases attained under super gravity and normal gravity, it was evident that the Re-phases were significantly grown into the larger crystals under the action of super gravity, as shown in The mineral compositions in the different layers obtained under super gravity were collected further using Raman spectrometer. Through comparing the exhibit several vibrational features in the different layers of the sample as shown in The separation behavior of the Re-phases that precipitated from Re-concentrate melt under super gravity was theoretically verified further. Considering that the precipitated Re-particles in the melt are generally subjected to three lateral forces in the condition of super-gravity, including the centrifugal force far away from the centrifugal axis When According to the Stokes formula The theoretical sedimentation time Accordingly, the successive precipitation and separation behaviors of various REEs in the condition of super gravity were described as The EPMA results (Ce, La, Pr and Nd) of the different Re-phases in the multilayer sample attained under super gravity are shown in In the present work, the effect of super gravity on the precipitation and separation behaviors of various REEs in the Re-concentrate was investigated.
