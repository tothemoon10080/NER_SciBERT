Microwear patterns and formation processes are examined in modern browsing and grazing Gotland sheep from Denmark. Clear differences in microwear patterning are identified between Gotland sheep, which included a high proportion of leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees and shrubs in their diet, and those which primarily had access to graze species, with the browsing group exhibiting enamel surfaces dominated by pitted microwear features, the grazers a predominance of striations. Analysis of abrasives in dung suggests that these trends can be attributed to higher levels of soil ingestion in the grazing population and are a consequence both of grassland management practices and height of feeding within the vegetation canopy. These findings question previous interpretations of microwear patterning in browsing and grazing ungulates, which have equated striated enamel features with the ingestion of high levels of opal phytoliths, and thus have significant implications for palaeodietary reconstruction in such species, both within archaeological and palaeontological contexts. To address further the implications of these results, comparison is made between the Gotland sheep and modern grazing and fodder-fed sheep and goats from elsewhere in Europe. It is concluded that dental microwear analysis has the potential to address questions relating to grassland management practices and the use of certain fodders, such as leafy-hay, but that it may ultimately prove more difficult to distinguish ‘fresh’ browsing sheep from some grazing populations, specifically those in which levels of soil ingestion are reduced.Dental microwear analysis is now widely used in palaeodietary reconstruction Browsing and grazing were amongst the first dietary adaptations to be explored using dental microwear analysis. In the 1970s, Walker et al. The possibility that microwear could be used to distinguish animals, which had been browsing and grazing, is of considerable interest for archaeology; utilisation of woodland pasture and the collection of browse vegetation as fodder for domestic stock are widely assumed to have been critical resources for early agricultural communities within Europe Ruminant species can be classified into three broad categories on the basis of their digestive system and dietary adaptation Gotland sheep, also called the Goth sheep, are a small, primitive breed classed within the northern short-tailed group and derive originally from the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea Twenty-two mandibles from the Lejre flock were available for study. These were derived from male and female lambs, which had been born in March/April 1996 ( Microwear in the Lejre sheep was compared with an existing data base of microwear statistics for grazing and fodder-fed sheep/goats from Europe and the North Atlantic islands, specifically sheep grazing indigenous, upland habitats in Greenland ( Araldite replicas (mould=Coltene President's Jet, Regular Body; cast=Araldite MY753, hardener HY956) were made of the right lower deciduous fourth premolar (dP4) and were examined for microwear at a magnification of 500×, using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Philips XL30). For each individual, an image was captured from a specific area of enamel, approximately halfway along the anterior-facing enamel band of the bucco-posterior cusp, following procedure outlined in detail elsewhere The microwear defects visible within each image were counted and measured for defect orientation (as indicated by the angle between the long axis of a feature and a line parallel to the base of the image), maximum length and breadth using Microwear 2.2 The relationship between diet and dental microwear was investigated statistically using the Student's In November 1996, 30 samples of sheep dung containing approximately 10–20 individual dung pellets were collected from each group at Lejre during the week preceding slaughter, and a record was maintained of the lambs from which the dung was derived. In all cases, the dung was fresh and did not appear to be contaminated by wind blown soil or dust. Analysis of the dung samples aimed firstly to assess whether variation in the overall level of abrasives in the diet of the Lejre sheep could explain any microwear trends identified. This was achieved by calculating the inorganic content of dung samples, a technique used for assessing dietary abrasiveness and levels of soil ingestion in agricultural science and wildlife biology The dung samples were then prepared for analysis of grit and phytolith content using a simplified version of the dry ashing method described by Piperno The >180 Simple descriptive statistics were used to identify any variation between the grazing and browsing groups in terms of overall inorganic content, absolute concentration of phytolith and grit particles, ratio of phytolith to grit particles (expressed as a percentage) and weight of the >180 A clear difference is evident in microwear patterning between the two groups of sheep at Lejre, with those pastured on the common characterised by a striated enamel surface and those in the woodland pasture by an enamel surface comprised largely of pitted features with the occasional striations ( Stepwise DA selected 12 variables to discriminate between the ‘browsing’ and ‘grazing’ groups (analysis 1, To assess how the microwear patterning in the Lejre sheep compared with that evident in other grazing and fodder-fed sheep/goat populations, two further stepwise discriminant analyses were undertaken. In the first of these, where the aim was to assess variation within and between different grazing populations, analysis focused on five groups: the Lejre browsers ( The second stepwise DA aimed to assess whether differences could be identified between grazing, fresh browsing and animals fed leafy-hay and was based on three groups; all grazers combined ( The dung of the ‘common’ grazing sheep differs from that of the woodland pasture sheep in having a higher inorganic content, a greater concentrations of gritparticles in the <180 Microwear patterning in the Goth sheep from Lejre varies with diet/habitat. Sheep pastured on the woodland area, in which deciduous browse species are estimated to have comprised at least 40% of vegetation consumed in the weeks preceding slaughter, exhibit enamel surfaces dominated by pitted microwear features, while sheep consuming exclusively graze species on the common exhibit microwear characterised by striations ( Analyses of dung from the Lejre sheep suggest that the striated enamel surfaces evident in the sheep pastured on the common are associated with the ingestion of higher levels of abrasives and, in particular, soil/grit particles ( The ingestion of soil particles has been equated with large pits in some grazing ungulate species, including Ground-feeding animals such as grazing sheep are known to ingest significant quantities of soil along with vegetation during feeding Analyses of microwear pattering and dung samples in grazing, browsing and fodder-fed sheep from a wide range of different habitats in Europe have thus demonstrated an association between high levels of soilingestion and striated enamel surfaces and low levels of soil ingestion and pitted enamel surfaces. The presence of striations under conditions of high soil ingestion can be explained by the predominately transverse jaw movement exhibited by grazing sheep; variation in level of soil ingestion is attributed to both grassland management practices (e.g. stocking levels, season of grazing) and to feeding behaviour, specifically browsing/grazing height within the vegetation canopy. The apparent association between pitting and a diet low in abrasives is more difficult to interpret. Teaford and Oyen The associations evident in the Goth sheep, between a diet of predominately graze species and striated enamel surfaces and between browse species and pitted enamel surfaces parallels trends identified in various browsing and grazing ungulate species Research on microwear patterning in the Goth sheep at Lejre and on the wide range of grazing and fodder-fed sheep and goats described elsewhere This research was made possible through collaboration with the Historical Archaeological Research Centre at Lejre in Denmark. I would like to thank the staff at Lejre for their help and advice throughout, and, in particular, Marianne Rasmussen for organising the project, and Niels Jacobsen and Christian Kjargaard for supplying information on the feeding behaviour of the sheep and collecting dung samples. I would also like to thank Nils Andreasen for helping me in collecting the mandibles from Lejre, Dr Charles Frederick and Robert Craigie of the Department of Archaeology and Prehistory, University of Sheffield, for advice regarding the analysis of the dung samples and the staff of the Multi-Imaging Centre in Cambridge, where the SEM work was undertaken. I am also grateful to Dr Paul Halstead and Dr Keith Dobney for invaluable critical comment on an earlier version of this article. The collection of the modern mandibles from Lejre and the analysis of the dung samples were undertaken during a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Archaeology and Prehistory, Sheffield University.
