Stone dusting is typically performed using a high-powered laser at low energy and high frequency. Adjusting the pulse width of low-powered lasers may also produce a stone dusting effect. We determined fragmentation efficiency of long pulse versus short pulse duration in a low-powered laser using a dusting model. We also compared fiber-tip degradation and retropulsion at different pulse lengths. Experiments were conducted using a new variable pulse laser (Swiss Laserclast Ho:YAG-EMS) with adjustable pulse duration (300-1500Âµs). To assess comminution and fiber-tip degradation, a dusting model was employed by delivering 4kJ of energy to a BegoStone over a constant surface area controlled by a 3-D positioning system. Laser settings were 1J/10Hz and 2J/5Hz in both long and short pulse mode. Comminution efficiency was measured as loss of stone mass and fiber-tip degradation was measured simultaneously. The same laser and fiber were used in a pendulum model to measure stone retropulsion with a high-speed resolution camera. A BegoStone was attached to a silk suture and immersed in water. The laser was applied to the stone and retropulsion was considered displacement from the origin after a single fire. Comminution was significantly greater at higher energy (2J/5Hz) compared to lower energy (1J/10Hz) on both long and short pulse (p< .0001, p=0.0002). Long pulse improved comminution significantly at higher energy (0.420g vs 0.310g), but not lower energy (0.163g vs 0.247g)(p=0.0022, p=0.1419). At higher energy tip degradation was 1.308mm on short pulse and 0.335mm on long pulse, which was significant (p=0.0009). Tip degradation was also greater on short pulse at lower energy than long pulse (0.230mm vs 0.038mm), but this was not significant (p=0.7247). The results of the pendulum test showed that at higher energy, short pulse caused more retropulsion than long pulse (p<0.0001). At lower energy short pulse also caused more retropulsion, but this was not significant (p=0.6071). Increasing pulse duration may allow for better stone dusting with increased fragmentation efficiency, decreased tip degradation, and less retropulsion when using higher energies with a low-power laser.
