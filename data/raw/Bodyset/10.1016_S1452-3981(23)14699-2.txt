Nickel composites with co-deposited insoluble, solid lubricant particles such as MoS2 have been reported to reduce friction. It is known that hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), competes with nickel deposition. The influence of the parameters and their interaction effects on the peak current density of HER during the electrodeposition of Ni and Ni-MoS2 composite coatings were studied by fractional factorial design. The parameters and their ranges studied were; MoS2 particle concentration (0-30 g/l), temperature (30-50Â°C), pH (2-4) and two surfactants, namely; ammoniumlignosulfonate (ALS) and depramin-C (DC) (0-1 g/l). Electrodeposition processes were carried out from a typical Watts bath containing leveler, wetting agent and brightener by using a potentiostat. The peak current densities (ip) were extended to higher values and the peaks on linear sweep voltammograms became noticeable by increasing the scan rate from 20 mV/s to 100 mV/s over the range of 0 to 2.5 V. The peak current densities (ip) of HER for each experimental route were determined by fractional factorial design for two mineral processing surfactants; ammoniumlignosulfonate (ALS) and depramin-C (DC) using a statistical analysis software named Minitab [1]. Adding MoS2, decreasing temperature and increasing pH had decreasing effects on the peak current density of HER regardless of the surfactant used. On the other hand, the surfactants increased the peak current density.
