In this paper, we propose a dielectrically stabilized and reversible electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) platform based on a multi-layered insulator composed of amorphous fluoropolymer (AF1600), silicon nitride (Si3N4), and titanium dioxide (TiO2). Although TiO2 can reduce the electrowetting voltage owing to its high relative permittivity, κ, an EWOD platform composed of only TiO2 is vulnerable to current leakage. The proposed AF1600/Si3N4/TiO2 (20nm/20nm/20nm) EWOD platform exhibited enhanced dielectric strength as well as a low contact angle hysteresis within 2° of the droplet. Because a Si3N4 film has excellent dielectric strength as compared to AF1600 and TiO2 films, it can safeguard the EWOD platform from both current leakage and dielectric breakdown. The electrowetting capability of the AF1600/Si3N4/TiO2 EWOD platform was improved by means of a thin fluoropolymer film with a thickness of less than 20nm.Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a novel technique for controlling the wettability of a droplet placed on a solid surface by using an electric signal In addition, a layer of hydrophobic fluoropolymer is an essential layer of the EWOD platform because it ensures low contact angle hysteresis and a high initial contact angle for a droplet placed on the dielectric surface. However, the fluoropolymer layer increases the driving voltage because it acts as a low-  An alternating current (AC) voltage between a metal tip electrode and the ITO substrate electrode was applied using a function generator (DS345, Stanford Research). Before the AC voltage was applied, the signal was amplified 20 times using a linear amplifier (A400, FLC Electronics), as shown in For a droplet placed on an EWOD platform, the contact angle, Most EWOD-based devices utilize AC voltage to reduce the contact angle hysteresis and residual droplets on the EWOD platform A fluoropolymer thin film is an essential element of the EWOD platform because it functions as both a hydrophobic layer that ensures a large initial contact angle and a lubricator that reduces the contact angle hysteresis. Careful attention is required to control the thickness of the fluoropolymer film because it may cause an increase in Because realizing a very thin spin-coated AF1600 film is difficult owing to the high viscosity of commercially available AF1600 solution, the solution was diluted in order to control the film thickness. AF1600 can be tailored to have narrow solubility in selected perfluorinated solvents. Thus, AF1600 solutions with 1–6 In this paper, we propose a dielectrically stabilized and reversible EWOD platform based on a multi-layered insulator composed of AF1600, Si By inserting the coefficients summarized in In our experiment, an AF1600/Si In this paper, we proposed an EWOD platform composed of AF1600, Si This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the
