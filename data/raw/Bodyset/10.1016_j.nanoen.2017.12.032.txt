Thermal transport in nanoscale two-dimensional (2D) materials is of great scientific interest and has practical implications for energy related applications like thermal management of energy devices, composite battery materials and on-board thermoelectric power generation for sensors. The abilities to manipulate thermal transport in 2D materials is thus highly desirable for future nano energy technologies. In this work, we identify a general rule for controlling the thermal transport in 2D pentagonal materials through bond saturation. We use first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon properties of a series of pentagonal materials, including penta-graphene (PG), hydrogenated PG (h-PG) and fluorinated PG (f-PG), and find that the bond saturation of the carbon atoms through functionalization can reduce the bond anharmonicity and thus increase the phonon lifetime. We can follow this rule to predict very high thermal conductivity of other pentagonal structures with saturated bonds, including penta-CN2 (1027W/mK) and two three-dimensional counterparts of PG called T12-carbon (819W/mK) and AA T12-carbon (1049W/mK). Moreover, similar trend of bond saturation-induced thermal conductivity enhancement can be found in other 2D pentagonal materials, such as penta-SiC2 and penta-SiN2. The results from this work unveil a general bonding-thermal transport relation for 2D materials, which can provide important guidance for designing novel materials with desirable thermal transport properties for energy applications.The scientific and technological interests on two-dimensional (2D) materials have been greatly ignited by the discovery of graphene Lattice thermal conductivity of 2D materials as one property that can influence the performance and reliability in many applications like thermal management has attracted extensive interest. The thermal conductivity of over 2600 2D pentagonal materials are always buckled, but their thermal conductivity has been shown to depend on different factors. Wang et al. used first-principles lattice dynamics calculations to find relatively low thermal conductivity of PG compared to graphene, and it was attributed to the strong anharmonicity from the buckled structure In this study, we use the iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) with the first-principles force constants to study and compare the thermal transport properties of a series of 2D pentagonal materials and their 3D counterparts in order to provide insights to the question put forward above. By analyzing the phonon properties through lattice dynamics combined with Fermi's golden rule and bonding properties through electron localization function (ELF), we first identify a general trend of increasing thermal conductivity by saturating the bonds in PG, leading to very high thermal conductivity values of h-PG (634 To study the thermal conductivity and phonon properties, we employ the iteratively solution of the linearized phonon BTE with interatomic force constants derived from first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations To extract the force constants, the potential energy ( The harmonic force constants are computed from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) For all structures studied, the ultrasoft Rappe-Rabe-Kaxiras-Joannopoulos optimized pseudopotentials We first study and compare the thermal conductivity values of 2D pentagonal materials. The relaxed lattice structures of PG, h-PG, penta-CN Instead of functionalizing the PG to saturate the bonds, replacing the surface carbon atoms by nitrogen atoms, which have five valence electrons in the outermost electron shell and thus have up to 3 stable covalent bonds, will naturally result in a pure Beyond 2D derivatives, single layer PG can also stack with one another to form 3D structures ( We need to note that for fair comparison of the thermal transport capability of different 2D materials, we used a thickness of 3.14 Besides carbon-based materials, results from ref To help further analyze different phonon properties and understand the root reason for the bond-saturation-induced improvement in thermal transport capability, we further calculate the cumulative thermal conductivity of the above materials as a function of phonon frequency ( The thermal conductivity depends on three aspects of the phonon properties, namely group velocity, heat capacity and phonon lifetime, as suggested by As seen in The phonon group velocity ( To further confirm that the reason for enhanced thermal conductivity does not lie in the phonon harmonic properties, including the specific heat and phonon group velocity, room temperature thermal conductivity values are normalized by harmonic properties by using the method proposed by Lee et al. The last parameter that influences thermal conductivity is phonon lifetime, which is an anharmonic factor. The phonon lifetime of all materials at the last converged iteration of the BTE solution is shown in We further explore the reason for the observed difference in lifetimes. Phonon lifetime is a reflection of phonon scattering, which depends on two factors, namely the three-phonon scattering phase space Grüneisen parameters From the above analysis, we can see that reduced anharmonicity is the main reason for thermal conductivity increase from bond unsaturated PG to bond saturated h-PG, f-PG, penta-CN As mentioned previously, there are at least two different ‘types’ of atoms in the pentagonal structure: center layer atoms which are saturated and surface atoms which can be unsaturated. The bond between two neighboring surface atoms is studied as an example to illustrate how bond saturation changes bond symmetry and anharmonicity. As previous mentioned, we have generalized the bond saturation-thermal conductivity relation to other pentagonal materials ( In this work, through solving phonon BTE with inputs from first-principles calculations, we show that bond saturation can be a general strategy to enhance thermal conductivity of 2D pentagonal materials and their 3D counterparts.
