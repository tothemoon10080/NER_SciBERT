In the present study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch techniques are applied in order to obtain the nanomechanical properties (hardness, H, and elastic modulus, E) of chemical vapor deposited Co and Co3O4 thin films (promising candidates for magnetic sensing and data storage applications) and evaluate the functionality of the thin film–substrate system. A wear analysis is also performed based on the H/E ratio.The mechanical and tribological behavior of magnetic and storage devices is of critical importance in determining long-term stability and reliability of such devices. The good maintenance of the mechanical and tribological properties of the aforementioned devices can significantly impact their commercialization. Nanoindentation technique can be a useful tool for the measurement of stresses for the successful and reliable operation of such devices. The variation of nanomechanical/nanotribological response of sensors should be kept within a narrow range (defined percentage of range). Nanoscratch testing is a versatile tool for analysis of the mechanical attributes of thin films and bulk materials and can be used for a plethora of tests, where a single scratch with a ramped load is useful for critical load, film adhesion and mar studies In the present study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch techniques are utilized in order to investigate the nanomechanical (i.e. hardness, The films were grown in a vertical, cylindrical metallorganic CVD stainless steel reactor, specifically developed for the deposition of magnetic films, either singled or multilayered As far as the deposition of the Co X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were conducted using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuKα1 radiation (1.5405 The nanoindentation and nanotribological tests in this work were performed using a nanomechanical test instrument equipped with a Berkovich tip (120 The scratch tests performed in this work included three main segments. Firstly, a pre-scratch scan under a very low load (0.2 Cobalt oxide thin film was deposited in the form of Co It is important to evaluate the nanomechanical response in the overall tribological characterization of materials, as the contact between surfaces is usually initiated by the contact between surface asperities with contact areas only a few tens of square nanometers. In the present work, the load–unload curves of the probed materials are presented in In The A high Adhesion relation of a coating with a substrate is confirmed by using the Tresca׳s yield criterion and Tabor׳s relation, according to which, the load at the onset of yielding is proportional to It is known that many of the mechanisms of film failure begin with or directly involve plastic deformation. Consequently, a particular concern in the usefulness of thin films as protective overcoat materials in hard disk and/or wear-resistant applications is that these films must be highly resistant to plastic deformation during contact events. The film has to undergo a high proportion of elastic deformation occurring when indenting, resulting in high values of In In The Co It should be noted that friction anisotropy is actually a phenomenon with two degrees of freedom since one can vary either the relative orientations of the crystal lattices or the direction of shearing with respect to the crystal lattices. In literature, the shearing direction is fixed with respect to one surface lattice and rotation of the crystal lattices with respect to one another (this experiment could reveal the possible effects of surface lattice commensurability) In the present study, nanoindentation and nanoscratch techniques are utilized in order to investigate the nanomechanical (i.e. The authors wish to acknowledge
