This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal ( This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief of Minerals Engineering, formerly International Journal of Mineral Processing. The article duplicates significant parts of papers that had already appeared in Neural Comput & Applic, 23 (2013) 391-402. Neural Comput & Applic, 22 (2013) 689-701. Int. J. Damage Mech., 21(2012) 1202-1226. J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 358 (2012) 40-46. Compos. Part B, 43 (2012) 1293-1301. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that the paper has not been previously published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a misuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.
