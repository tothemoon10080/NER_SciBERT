The Co0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe2O4/graphene nanocomposite for electromagnetic wave absorption was successfully synthesized from metal chlorides solutions and graphite powder by a simple and rapid microwave-assisted polyol method via anchoring the Co0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe2O4 nanoparticles on the layered graphene sheets. The Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Mn2+ ions in the solutions were attracted by graphene oxide obtained from graphite and converted to the precursors Fe(OH)3, Co(OH)2, Ni(OH)2, and Mn(OH)2 under slightly alkaline conditions. After the transformations of the precursors to Co-Ni-Mn ferrites and conversion of graphene oxide to graphene under microwave irradiation at 170 °C in just 25 min, the Co0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe2O4/graphene nanocomposite was prepared. The composition and structure of the nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), etc. It was found that with the filling ratio of only 20 wt% and the thickness of 2.3 mm, the nanocomposite showed an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth (less than −10 dB) of 8.48 GHz (from 9.52 to 18.00 GHz) with the minimum reflection loss of − 24.29 dB. Compared to pure graphene sheets, Co0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33Fe2O4 nanoparticles and the counterparts reported in literature, the nanocomposite exhibited much better electromagnetic wave absorption, mainly attributed to strong wave attenuation, as a result of synergistic effects of dielectric loss, conductive loss and magnetic loss, and to good impedance matching. In view of its thin thickness, light weight and outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption property, the nanocomposite could be used as a very promising electromagnetic wave absorber.In the modernized society, the extensive use of electronic equipment facilitates people's daily life, but simultaneously produces severe electromagnetic radiation pollution. This pollution not only influences the normal work of radios, televisions, precision instruments, medical equipment and navigation equipment, but also causes many kinds of diseases such as nerve diseases, autoimmune diseases, reproductive diseases, circulatory diseases, and even malignant tumors Graphene materials, including few-layer graphene, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and graphene 3D structures, have been developed in recent years Magnetic ferrite, a kind of iron oxide with particular structure, has high permeability over the GHz range Currently, there are many types of ferrite/graphene composite absorbers, such as the NiFe Although there are many attempts on synthesis of multiple-ion ferrites/graphene material composites, it is still a challenge for them to present ultra-wide absorption bandwidth at a low filling ratio In the present study, for the first time, we successfully prepared a Co For preparing the nanocomposite, graphitic oxide was firstly synthesized using natural graphite powder (−325 mesh) by the Hummers method The phase compositions of the synthesized materials including the nanocomposite, were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANayltical Empyrean powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm) in the scattering range (2θ) of 5–80°. The chemical compositions of the materials were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, Agilent 725). The chemical states of the elements in the materials were determined by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a ThermoFisher K-Alpha spectrometer. The microstructures of the materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a Cu grid using a Tecnai G The electromagnetic parameters (complex relative permittivity and permeability) of the synthesized materials were measured by the coaxial line method using an Agilent n5230A vector network analyzer in the frequency range of 2–18 GHz. Before the measurement, the as-prepared powder were homogeneously mixed with paraffin (the mass fraction of CNMF/RGO nanocomposite was 20 wt%), and then the mixture was pressed into circular ring with 3.0 mm inner diameter, 7.0 mm outer diameter and 2.0 mm thickness. Then, the sample ring was embedded into a copper holder which was then connected to the waveguide of the equipment for measuring the electromagnetic parameters. To determine the electromagnetic wave absorption properties of each synthesized material, the corresponding reflection loss (RL) was calculated by the following equations The formation mechanism of CNMF/RGO can be illustrated as follows. During the synthesis process ( The phase compositions of GO, RGO, CNMF/RGO and CNMF are shown in The elemental chemical states of CNMF/RGO were demonstrated by the XPS spectra, as shown in  The morphologies and microstructures of the RGO, CNMF and CNMF/RGO were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In The magnetic properties of CNMF and CNMF/RGO were revealed by their magnetic hysteresis loops, as shown in   The electromagnetic wave absorption property of CNMF/RGO could be further explored, as shown in  As aforementioned, the ultra-high electromagnetic wave absorption performance of CNMF/RGO was attributed to its dielectric loss and magnetic loss. For better understanding, the dielectric loss mechanism of the nanocomposite was explored. According to Eqs. Hence, the Cole-Cole semicircle curve can be established by plotting To determine the magnetic loss mechanism of the nanocomposite, the roles of domain wall resonance, hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and natural resonance, should be identified It is known that an excellent EMA material should have strong attenuation and impedance matching. To identify the attenuation characteristics of the materials, the variations of the corresponding attenuation constants ( As shown in The impedance matching property of a material is usually demonstrated by its modulus of the normalized characteristic impedance ( Overall, the mechanisms of electromagnetic wave absorption in CNMF/RGO are summarized and illustrated in  In summary, the Co This work was partially supported by the
