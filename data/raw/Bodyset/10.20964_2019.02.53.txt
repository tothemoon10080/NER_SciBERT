The electrochemical behavior of tin was studied with cyclic voltammetry at glassy carbon electrodes in the fused LiCl-KCl at 450 °C. Metallic tin deposition on the glassy carbon electrode occurs at a potential of around -0.56 V with Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The diffusion coefficient D

                     2+ is determined to be 3.0×10-5 cm2s-1. At higher anodic voltage, Sn2+ is oxidised to Sn4+. The average number of electrons was determined to be 2 by using the difference between the peak and half peak potentials. Metallic tin was prepared in potentiostatic mode at -0.7 V versus Ag+/Ag reference for 4 hours. Mass transport towards the electrode is a simple diffusion process and the diffusion coefficient was calculated. The current efficiency for deposition of Sn was as high as 95%.
