The effects of high-pressure processing (HPP) and addition of carrot fibre on pork sausages have been studied using NMR T2 relaxometry and measurements of water-binding capacity (WBC) by centrifugation. Significant effects of temperature (raw, 40, 50, or 60°C), holding time (1s, 3, 6, or 9min), and addition of carrot fibre on the distribution and mobility of water were found. However, the effect of carrot fibre could not be explained by structural changes in the sausages when examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Correlations between T2 relaxation measurements and WBC determined by centrifugation revealed that T2 relaxation times were able to explain more than 90% of the variation in WBC for both non-pressure and pressure-treated sausages. However, only 49% of the variation was explained for pressure-treated sausages with carrot fibre, indicating that combining addition of fibre and high pressure treatment causes non-coherent changes in T2 NMR relaxation times.High-pressure processing (HPP) has been introduced in the meat industry as a mild preservation method producing safe and less processed foods, consistent with the consumer demand for minimal processed foods. Pressure treatment using pressure levels between 300 and 600 Pressure treatment induces conformational changes in meat proteins, revealing alterations in structure and texture. These changes are a result of depolymerisation, solubilisation, denaturation, aggregation and gelation of the myofibrillar proteins, and are dependent on the conditions of the pressure treatment applied ( High pressure treatment has been shown to improve water-binding properties, in non-cooked and cooked fish, pork, chicken, and beef products ( Dietary fibres have been shown to act as a protective agent against different diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and colon cancer and are therefore used as a functional ingredient in food ( Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) T The objective of the present study was i) to investigate the effects of pressure treatment, combining different pressure levels, temperatures and duration on structure, elucidated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), WBC, analyzed by centrifugation, and distribution of water analyzed by NMR T Two types of pork sausages were prepared, one without carrot fibre, named P1 and one containing carrot fibre, named P2. Meat emulsions, for sausages, were manufactured in a vacuum high speed cutter (V30L, Kilia, Germany) at 2880 The raw sausages were treated by HPP at Deutsches Institut für Lebensmitteltechnik, Quakenbrück, Germany, in a Wave 6000/55 equipment (NC Hyperbaric, Burgos, Spain), using tested levels of HPP of 500 or 600 Three sausages of each of the sausage types P1 and P2 were only heat treated at the three temperatures, 41, 51, or 61 In total 56 sausage samples (2 raw, 6 non-pressure-treated and 48 pressure-treated samples) were included in the study. For data analysis the sausages were split into four groups, high-pressure-treated samples without carrot fibre (P1 HP, Thin slices of the frozen pork sausages one from each sausage type, P1 and P2 (heated to 50 Images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100, AGR-3Q AOTF, Hertfordshire, UK), attached to a Nikon Eclipse E800 upright microscope. Excitation was with the argon laser beam at a wavelength of 488 Proton NMR T The obtained T WBC was determined by centrifugation, and values were obtained as follows: 5 Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression models were performed using the Simca-P+ software (Umetrics AB, New Jersey, US). PCA was carried out on T The microstructure of the pork sausages was visualized by application of CLSM ( PCA of the NMR T Distributed analysis of the T Analyzing the four treatment groups, P1 HP, P2 HP, P1 NHP, and P2 NHP, respectively, revealed differences in the relative areas and relaxation times of the T In order to analyze the effect of the other factors present in the study, the HP-treated and NHP-treated groups are analyzed separately in the following sections. A PCA score plot of the T A PCA score plot of the T Using the four treatment groups P1 HP, P2 HP, P1 NHP and P2 NHP or temperature, respectively, as class variables in the statistical analysis, a significant effect of both groups (P In order to investigate the effect of the different pressure treatment factors, HP-treated sausages and NHP-treated sausages were analyzed separately. NHP-treated sausages revealed a significant effect of temperature (P PLS regressions were performed using the entire T In order to elucidate if the change in WBC was a result of changes in the main population (T Water characteristics of HPP and heat-treated pork samples with or without added carrot fibre were investigated using NMR T Comparing the T PCA showed some separation between the four treatment groups (P1 HP, P2 HP, P1 NHP and P2 NHP) ( Dividing the sausages into the two groups, HP-treated and NHP-treated samples, respectively, made it possible to focus on the other factors present in the study. Both HP-treated and NHP-treated samples revealed a significant effect of addition of carrot fibre, where sausage type P2, containing carrot fibre, was characterized by a significant shorter T The present study revealed that addition of carrot fibre and temperature were the factors with the most pronounced effect on water behaviour in the sausages. However, small effects of holding time were also seen in the HP-treated samples ( WBC determined by centrifugation was shown to be affected by pressure treatment, and significant higher WBC was found in HP-treated sausages compared to NHP-treated sausages. This is consistent with earlier studies, in which increased water binding was observed in HP-treated samples ( The largest differences in WBC were observed between the two sausage types P1 and P2 ( WBC was strongly affected by the initial pressurization temperature, where sausages pressured at a lower temperature had a lower WBC, and increasing the pressurization temperature increased the WBC in the sausages ( Among the HP-treated sausages, pressure level and holding time were also shown to have an effect on WBC ( WHC, which expresses the ability of fresh meat to hold its own naturally occurring water, is an important quality trait. In addition, WBC, which expresses meat products ability to bind added water, is also important for the meat industry. WBC and NMR T Using the entire decay curve for PLS regression revealed good correlations to WBC where 90% and 98% of the variation of WBC is explained in HP-treated and NHP-treated sausages, respectively ( Changes in distribution and mobility of water as a result of high-pressure processing of sausages and addition of carrot fibre was detectable using NMR T The authors wish to thank the
