In this paper we follow the work of [7] to evaluate the scalability of contact law for a linear spring dashpot (LSD) model. Models are evaluated using a shear test box with Lees-Edwards boundary conditions. Afterwards we extend our analysis for a Hertz model and a limited analysis in cohesive contact model. Results demonstrate that Hertz model has the same behaviour as the scaled LSD model for both inertial and quasi static regime. In coarse graining we expect constant stresses values for different parcels sizes. Both models demonstrate an almost constant stress in the quasi-static regime, but a significant increase is obtained in the inertial regime. A limited number of analysis were also made for a JKR cohesive contact model.
