Osteomalacia is a rare metabolic bone disorder which can be caused by various diseases associated with a deficiency of calcium, phosphorus or an inhibition of the mineralization process. The patient exhibited bilateral hip fractures of a non traumatic origin and had received a prosthesis which had undergone mobilization. He presented muscle and bone pain lasting 3 years that limited movement. She reported no dentition or audiological changes, no prior medication or family history of kidney or bone disease. Laboratory analysis showed: normal CBC and venous blood gases, renal and hepatic profiles were normal except for elevated alkaline phosphatase (443 Suspecting hypophosphatemic osteomalacia we obtained the following test results in search of its etiology: normal serum protein on electrophoresis with absence of Bences Jones protein in the urine, normal tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen CEA, 15.3, 19.9, 125, alphaglycoprotein); we studied the patient for possible digestive malabsorption syndrome (endoscopic, X-ray study, histological and celiac antibodies) but results were negative; parathyroid study (neck ultrasound and sestamibi scintigraphy) was normal as were chest X-rays and abdominal ultrasound; a bone scan with Tc We started treatment with calcitriol (0.75 The parameters studied suggest that this case corresponds to osteomalacia characterized by insufficient mineralization of the osteoid formation in new bone metabolism points. Different diseases can lead to osteomalacia through mechanisms that cause hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia or defects in the mineralization process. The case of the patient under study is remarkable because it was not associated with any of the causes described in hypophosphatemic osteomalacia We could not, to date, find the mechanism that caused the disturbance, which require us to classify it as idiopathic and keep looking for new possible causes of this disease. Known cases of idiopathic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia are rare. The authors have no disclosures to make.
