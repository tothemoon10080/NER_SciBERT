Wrist arthroscopy has steadily grown from a mostly diagnostic tool to a valuable adjunctive procedure in the treatment of myriad wrist disorders. The number of conditions that are amenable to arthroscopic treatment continues to grow. A detailed knowledge of the topographical and intracarpal anatomy, however, is essential to minimize complications and maximize the benefits. Although wrist arthroscopy can identify an anatomic abnormality, it cannot be used to differentiate between an asymptomatic degenerative condition versus a pathologic lesion that is the cause of wrist pain. A thorough wrist examination is still integral to any arthroscopic assessment. This article focuses on the methodology behind a normal arthroscopic wrist examination and discusses some of the more standard arthroscopic procedures along with the expected outcomes.
