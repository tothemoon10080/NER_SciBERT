The Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cr6+ biosorption capacity of the Streptomyces rimosus biomass pretreated with NaOH was studied in the batch mode. Under optimal experimental conditions, a biosorption capacity of 30 mg Cu2+ g–1 biomass, 27.4 mg Zn2+ g–1 biomass and 26.7 mg Cr6+ g–1 biomass was obtained. The equilibrium data poorly fitted the Langmuir and Freundlich model isotherms over the whole range of initial Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cr6+ concentrations tested (0–300 mg L–1).
