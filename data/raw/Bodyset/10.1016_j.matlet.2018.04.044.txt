A strain of 10% is applied to 316L stainless steel specimens at strain rates of 7.7 × 104 s−1, 200 s−1 and 50 s−1 using vaporizing foil actuator (VFA) technique for the highest strain rate and dynamic plastic deformation (DPD) for the lower strain rates. There is a dramatic increase in hardness with increasing strain rate, rising to over 2.2 GPa at the highest strain rate. While the average twin thickness remained similar across different strain rate regimes, a dense criss cross pattern of twins is formed at the highest strain rate from activation of deformation twinning in non-parallel planes. This shows promise for VFA driven flyers process as a method for surface modification and hardening.Twinning mode of plastic deformation leaves behind twinned regions and interfaces that act as obstacles to further deformation by twinning or dislocation motion. High strength, ductility, wear resistance, thermal stability, improved fracture toughness and enhanced sub-critical fatigue crack growth life have been observed in metals with twin thickness in the nanometer regime Dynamic plastic deformation (DPD) using high strain rate compression (100–1000 s Impulse processing techniques like vaporizing foil actuator (VFA), explosive forming and electromagnetic forming have been developed for various manufacturing processes like metalworking and solid-state welding In the present study, we compressed 316L stainless steel specimens using DPD as well as the VFA technique. A strain of 10% at strain rates of 50 s AISI 316L grade of austenitic stainless steel with composition as mentioned in Where X-Ray diffraction (XRD) of the annealed and deformed specimens was conducted using a PANalytical Empyrean system. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 instrumen The SFE of the alloy is calculated to be around 37 mJm This work introduces VFA as a surface modification technique, distinct from LSP, SMAT and shot peening, which can be scaled to industrial use. The 83% increase in hardness with VFA demonstrated the efficacy of TB strengthening mechanism. The deformation at a high strain rate of 7.7 × 10 GSD, SH and AV Acknowledge support from
