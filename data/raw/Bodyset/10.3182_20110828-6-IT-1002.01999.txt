Abstract
                  The performance of a model predictive controller depends on the quality of the plant model that is available. Often parameters in a Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore milling circuit are uncertain and inaccurate parameter estimation leads to a mismatch between the model and the actual plant. Although model-plant mismatch is inevitable, timely detection of significant mismatch is desirable in order to prevent deteriorated control performance. This paper presents a simulation study of the detection of mismatch in the parameters of a ROM ore milling circuit model using a partial correlation analysis approach. The location of the mismatch in the MIMO model matrix is correctly detected.
