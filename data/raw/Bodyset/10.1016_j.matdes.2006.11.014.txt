In this paper, the authors propose mathematical expressions for the determination of different stress ratio parameters under plane and triaxial stress state conditions. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the hot forging features in the high strength sintered powder metallurgy 4%titanium carbide composite steel performs under different stress states, namely, plane stress and triaxial stress states. Cylindrical compacts with aspect ratios 0.45, 0.75 and 1.25 were prepared, sintered and forged at the temperatures of 1120±10°C. The investigation suggests that the experimentally determined relative density has a straight-line relationship with the new geometrical shape factor. The measured barrel radius of curvature is found to have a circular arc. Relationship is established between the measured barrel radius and the stress ratio parameters under plane and triaxial stress state conditions. An attempt is also made to establish a relationship between the various stress ratio parameters under plane and triaxial stress state conditions and the relative density.initial preform height, mm deformed height of the preform, mm initial diameter of the preform, mm contact diameter of the preform (top surface), mm contact diameter of the preform (bottom surface), mm contact diameter, mm bulged diameter, mm relative density initial preform density, g/cc theoretical preform density, g/cc deformed preform density, g/cc true Hoop stress, MPa true axial stress, MPa true radial stress, MPa mean or hydrostatic stress, MPa effective stress, MPa true axial strain true hoop strain Poisson’s ratio new Poisson’s ratio The manufacture of metal components by powder metallurgy (P/M) forging techniques embraces the high rate of conventional forging with low losses due to minimal machining requirements and excellent material utilization A plasticity theory for porous metals was proposed by Shima and Oyane In upsetting, the existence of frictional constraints between the dies and the workpiece directly affect the plastic deformation of the latter Narayansamy and Pandey The purpose of the present investigation is to establish a relationship between the barrel radius and various stress ratio parameters, namely, ( Iron powder of −150 The compacting pressure was controlled so as to obtain a density level of 7.612 After the sintering operation, the preforms were upset-forged to the different levels of height strain using a 100 The mathematical expressions used and proposed for the determination of various upsetting parameters of various stress state conditions are discussed below.
