Due to the dispersed distribution of the titanium component in various mineral phases and very fine grain size, it is difficult to recover the titanium component from the slag. In order to utilize titanium resources, selective enriching and selective growing of the titanium component from the molten slag is expected. In this paper, the selection of the best titanium enrichment phase and the effect of oxidization on the enrichment of titanium by blowing air into the molten slag were studied. The results showed that through oxidizing the slag, the content of the perovskite phase increases while that of the other titanium-bearing mineral phases decreases until they disappear. Most titania resources were enriched into the perovskite phase and increase in size. The process of enrichment and growth is easily carried out.
