Objective
                  In this study, we investigate the efficacy of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as a material for frontal sinus obliteration in a rabbit model.
               
                  Study Design and Setting
                  Twenty-four New Zealand White rabbits were divided into four groups, and the study was carried out to two time periods. Twelve rabbits underwent frontal sinus obliteration with fat autograft, and 12 rabbits underwent the procedure with DBM. At 12 weeks, six control and six study rabbits were killed. The remaining 12 rabbits were killed at 36 weeks. All specimens underwent radiologic evaluation with spiral CT followed by histologic examination for evidence of bony growth.
               
                  Results
                  Sinuses obliterated with DBM showed replacement of the sinus cavity by trabecular bone. Histology demonstrated significant progressive replacement of DBM by cancellous bone from 12 weeks (53.3%) to 36 weeks (78.8%). There were no complications observed as a result of the materials used.
               
                  Conclusion and Significance
                  DBM is a prospective material for frontal sinus obliteration. Long-term studies and human trials will further elucidate the role of this material.
