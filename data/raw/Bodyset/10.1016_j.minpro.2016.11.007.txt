It has been brought to our attention that a manuscript previously published includes information that may mislead readers. We refer to the article titled “Moisture content limits of iron ore fines to prevent liquefaction during transport: review and experimental study”, published in the International Journal of Mineral Processing, volume 148 (2016), pages 137–146. We refer to the vessels set out in Table 1, page 139. Listed within this table are said to be incidents where bulk cargoes were suspected to have liquefied on board bulk carriers. In this list was the ‘Alexandros T’. Further review of the available information has shown that there is no suspicion of cargo liquefaction being the cause of the ‘Alexandros T’ foundering and accordingly the ‘Alexandros T’ should have not been included in this list.
