A thermodynamic and experimental investigation to develop a new process for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur by a two-step process involving barium sulfide and barium sulfate has been carried out. In this process, the starting raw material barium sulfate is reduced by a suitable reducing agent to produce barium sulfide, which is used to reduce sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur vapor and regenerate barium sulfate. The results indicate that the BaS–

                      under a sulfur dioxide partial pressure of 8.7kPa. The reactivity increased somewhat during the first three cycles, but remained largely unchanged thereafter. This characteristic is important because the solids must be reusable for repeated cycles to avoid generating secondary pollutants. A pore-blocking model was found to fit the reaction rate. The reaction was essentially independent of sulfur dioxide partial pressure between 4.3 and 43kPa and has an activation energy value of 170kJ/mol (40.8kcal/mol). The reduction kinetics of barium sulfate with hydrogen gas is reported in Part II.Gas streams containing high levels of sulfur dioxide are generated from integrated gasification combined cycle desulfurization units and nonferrous metal smelters ( Therefore, it would be highly desirable to develop an alternative process to treat these high-strength sulfur dioxide streams. Conversion to elemental sulfur would have many advantages because it is inert as a solid and can easily be transported over long distances. A number of processes for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur have been suggested and developed previously. Because of the various problems associated with each of these previous processes, none are currently used commercially. These processes have been reviewed in earlier articles that describe a process through calcium sulfate and calcium sulfide ( This Part I presents the results for the reaction of sulfur dioxide with barium sulfide powder obtained by the hydrogen reduction of barium sulfate powder. The kinetics of barium sulfate reduction with hydrogen gas is reported in the accompanying Part II ( The process for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur without any secondary environmental problems was aimed to produce a gas phase product containing essentially pure sulfur by reacting sulfur dioxide with a solid. The solid product in this case must be reusable in the process to avoid generating a large amount of waste solids that require disposal. A number of possible reaction systems, including the NiS– The advantage of this process is that the gaseous product from Reaction (2) is essentially pure sulfur and that from Reaction (1) is water vapor ( The calculated equilibrium compositions for this system, in which several other possible compounds in the Ba–S–O(–H) system were considered, are shown in Experiments were carried out using a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) apparatus, which is often and conveniently used to study gas–solid reactions ( Sulfur dioxide gas (99.9% pure) was supplied by Union Carbide Co., and hydrogen (99.9% pure) and nitrogen (99.9% pure) gases were purchased from Air Products Co. The barium sulfate powder obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. was 98% pure and consisted of 40– The Cahn balance was first calibrated with standard weights. The solid sample in powder form was placed in a sample tray and suspended by a platinum wire. The reaction tube and furnace were brought into a proper position and the sample was heated to the desired reaction temperature in a stream of nitrogen. When the temperature reached the set value, the reactant gas was introduced into the reactor at a controlled rate. The weight change of the solid sample as a function of time was followed on a computer. The pressure inside the reaction tube was maintained at the atmospheric level (86.7 In preliminary experiments, tests were carried out in a horizontal tubular reactor to see if the two reactions indeed follow the thermodynamic predictions. For the BaS– Carrying out the reaction under increasing gas flow rates until the flow rate no longer affected the reaction rate eliminated the effect of external mass transfer. The effect of interstitial diffusion was also removed by decreasing the thickness of the powder layer until there was no change in the reaction rate with a further decrease in the thickness ( The reactivity of barium sulfide over repeated reaction and regeneration cycles is important because it should be used many cycles to minimize the amount of waste solid. It was shown for the CaS– As shown in At It is noted that the reaction rate was measured and is presented in terms of the conversion of solid BaS while maintaining a constant sulfur dioxide partial pressure. The rate of the conversion of a given amount of sulfur dioxide gas, which is of the ultimate interest, depends on the relative amount of BaS used: the larger the latter the faster the conversion. The The effect of temperature on the reaction rate between sulfur dioxide and barium sulfide in the second cycle is shown in the The effect of sulfur dioxide partial pressure was tested at 900 and Much as the reaction between calcium sulfide and sulfur dioxide ( The pore-blocking rate expression derived by The pore-blocking model expressed in Eq. The results for the effect of temperature in Thermodynamic analyses showed barium sulfide to be suitable for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur. This reaction scheme is attractive because the solid product barium sulfate can be reduced to regenerate barium sulfide without generating any waste solids. At The reactivity remained intact over the four cycles tested, which is important because the solids must be reusable for repeated cycles to avoid generating secondary pollutants.
