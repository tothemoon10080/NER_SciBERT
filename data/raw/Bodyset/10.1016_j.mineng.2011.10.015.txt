The Bond rod mill grindability test is a widely used tool to estimate the response of ores to rod milling. However, the mass of ore required to conduct the test, which can typically vary from about 8 to as much as 20kg, may represent a challenge when sample availability is critical. The present work proposes an alternative procedure, which is based on the size-mass balance model with a specific account for the acceleration of breakage rates of the coarsest size fraction, a phenomenon that is well documented to occur during rod milling. The model was validated for four materials, showing that it can predict the Bond rod mill work index with deviations below 10%. Requiring only 1.5–3kg of sample, the procedure is demonstrated to be a viable alternative to the standard test, whenever only a limited amount of sample is available.In spite of the overall shift since the 1970s to autogenous and semi-autogenous mills ( The classical method used to predict the specific energy consumption in grinding ores in rod mills was proposed by Fred Bond and is based on the work index ( While a number of methods have been proposed in the literature ( The paper proposes a simplified procedure that allows estimating the Bond rod mill work index using samples weighing from 1.5 to 3 The standard rod mill grindability test ( The The simplified batch rod mill test proposed consists simply of conducting the test on the same standard mill, but then the feed material is ground for a total of 10 (exceptionally 5, for very soft ores), 20, 30, 70 and, for very tough ores, 100 and, if needed, more revolutions with the same sample, that is reconstituted and placed back in the mill after size analyzes. Data from the batch grinding tests were modeled using the size-mass balance equation, taking into account the acceleration of breakage rates of the particles contained in the coarser size fractions in the charge ( The breakage rates of different particle sizes will increase as the fraction of particles contained in coarser size ranges become small. This can be represented by The least squares best fit values of the five model parameters were estimated using the Nelder and Mead optimization method in Matlab®. Once the breakage rate function and the breakage distribution function parameters have been estimated from the batch grinding tests, the Bond rod mill grindability test is emulated by computer simulation. In this it is assumed that the screening operation after each grinding cycle is ideal, which is a reasonable assumption for the relatively coarse sieve openings ( Typical results from fitting the model to the data are presented in  It is well-known that using the result of a standard Bond mill grindability test to investigate a range of product sizes is risky ( Evidently the present procedure, in analogy to all methods that are based on batch grinding tests results to predict Bond grindability indexes ( The simulation procedure that is proposed allows conducting the Bond rod mill grindability test with a fraction of the sample weight in comparison to the standard test, being particularly critical when sample availability is limited. It has the additional advantage of allowing to estimate the Bond rod mill work index for different grind sizes without requiring additional testing to be conducted. It is based on estimating the breakage rate and distribution parameters from a batch grinding test, and then emulating the locked cycle test by computer simulation. A comparison between measured and predicted values of Bond rod mill work index demonstrate the validity of the approach, which allowed predicting values with deviations smaller than 10% and 1 The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Brazilian research agencies CNPq, CAPES and Vale for the investigation.
