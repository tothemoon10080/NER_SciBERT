Electrodeposition of zinc on mild steel in acid chloride solution using as additive, different concentrations of ananas comosus (pineapple) juice extracts, was investigated. Different additive concentrations, plating time, and constant pH conditions were used for the experiments. The electrodeposition of zinc on mild steel was performed using a DC â€“ supply. The surface of the plated steel was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM); and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) for surface elemental composition analysis. Different surface microstructural features were obtained depending upon the concentration of the additive and the plating time. The corrosion resistance of the plated surface was also determined by gravimetric method. The quality of electrodeposition of zinc was good as indicated by the plated surface morphology.
