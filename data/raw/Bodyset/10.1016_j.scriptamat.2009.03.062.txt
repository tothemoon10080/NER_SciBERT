Recrystallized commercial purity aluminum samples were deformed to true strains of 0.095 and 0.262 by uniaxial tension. Microtexture data were analyzed to quantify orientation gradients between the grain interior and the grain boundary of nearest neighbor crystallites. The gradients were characterized in terms of the length over which a significant gradient was observed and the maximum misorientation. Estimated length ratios were observed to obey an inverse power law relationship with Taylor factor(s).Developments of in-grain orientation gradients are typical of polycrystalline plastic deformation Tensile samples were prepared from fully recrystallized commercial AA1050 sheets. As shown in A TSL OIM™ orientation imaging microscopy or EBSD system on a FEI Quanta™ 200Hv scanning electron microscope was used. For scanning “surface” grains, 0.5 and 0.1  From each strain, >150 grain pairs were selected at random, away from the hardness indentations. Each selected grain was >15 Line profiles were taken from the middle of the grain boundary to the center (i.e. approximate pixel barycenter) of the respective grain pairs ( The misorientation (Δ Δ Δ Δ This is shown graphically in    Each line profile thus yields two lengths for each pair of near-neighbor grains from which the ratio of lengths was found to be of most interest. Although the L No correlation was evident between The approach of this study is purely phenomenological. It does, however, establish for the first time a constitutive relationship for the length-scale of orientation gradients associated with near-neighbor grain interactions. It is fairly self-evident that the estimated ( The most successful model for crystal plasticity is the Taylor model Orientation gradients between near-neighbor grain pairs were estimated in terms of length (
