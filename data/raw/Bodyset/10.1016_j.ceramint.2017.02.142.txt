This study reports the effect of milling type on the microstructural, physical and mechanical properties of the W-Ni-ZrC-Y2O3 composites. Powder blends having the composition of W-1wt% Ni-2wt% ZrC-1wt% Y2O3 were milled at room temperature for 12h using a Spex™ 8000D Mixer/Mill or cryomilled in the presence of externally circulated liquid nitrogen for 10min using a Spex™ 6870 Freezer/Mill or sequentially milled at room temperature and cryogenic condition. Then, powders were compacted in a hydraulic press under a uniaxial pressure of 400MPa and green bodies were sintered at 1400°C for 1h under Ar/H2 atmosphere. Phase and microstructural characterization of the milled powders and sintered samples were performed using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), TOPAS software, scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer and particle size analyzer (PSA). Archimedes density and Vickers microhardness measurements, and sliding wear tests were also conducted on the sintered samples. The results showed that sequential milling enables the lowest average particle size (214.90nm) and it is effective in inhibiting W grain coarsening during sintering. The cryomilled and sintered composite yielded a lower hardness value (5.80±0.23GPa) and higher wear volume loss value (149.42µm3) than that of the sintered sample after room temperature milling (6.66±0.39GPa; 102.50µm3). However, the sequentially milled and sintered sample had the highest relative density and microhardness values of 95.09% and 7.16±0.59GPa and the lowest wear volume loss value of 66.0µm3.Metal matrix composites (MMCs) have been used in many industrial applications such as aerospace, automotive, aircraft, electronics especially due to their improved mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures Among the ceramic reinforcement particles, zirconium carbide (ZrC) is an important ultra-high temperature ceramic with excellent properties such as high melting point, high temperature strength and good chemical resistance Generally, mechanical alloying (MA) at room temperature has been used as powder preparation technique of W-based powders Elemental tungsten (W, Eurotungstene™, 99.9% purity) and nickel (Ni, Alfa Aesar™, 99.9% purity) powders were used as the matrix metal and as the activated sintering agent, respectively. Zirconium carbide (ZrC, Alfa Aesar™, 99.5% purity) and yttrium oxide (Y The content of the Ni activator was selected as 1 Room temperature milling was carried out in a Spex™ 8000D Mixer/Mill (at a rate of 1200 XRD analyses of the as-blended and milled powders, and sintered composites were carried out using the same diffractometer with the same conditions utilized for the pre-alloyed and pre-milled powders. The average crystallite sizes and lattice strains of the W phase in the milled powders were determined using a Bruker™-AXS TOPAS 4.2 software using the modified Scherrer's formula based on the broadening of the most intense XRD diffraction peaks (with (110), (200) and (211) reflections) fitted according to the Lorentzian profile by applying fundamental parameters approach Prior to the room temperature milling and cryomilling processes, it is essential to show the structure of the as-blended W1Ni-2ZrC-1Y  In order to understand the effect of different milling types at room temperature and/or cryogenic condition on the as-blended W1Ni-2ZrC-1Y   SEM images taken from the polished ( The density, microhardness and wear volume loss values of the bulk samples sintered from the S1, S2 and S3 powders are given in It can be stated that milling of W-based powders at cryogenic or sequential room temperature/cryogenic conditions was investigated at first time in this study. Considering the technology and properties of the composites, sequential milling is more effective to yield microstructurally and mechanically improved products for the brittle W-based systems. However, it has been recently reported that cryomilling can be used to obtain nanocrystalline structures of some Mg alloys In this study, the effect of different milling types (milling at room temperature for 12 XRD patterns of all milled W1Ni-2ZrC-1Y All sintered samples had the peaks of the dominant W and small amounts of Ni(W) solid solution and WC In the microstructures of the bulk samples sintered from the powders milled at room temperature and milled with sequential process, there were homogeneously distributed submicron-scale ZrC and Y There are large W grains and inhomogeneously distributed/clustered large ZrC and Y Sequential milling was found as the most effective process in blocking of the W grain coarsening and growth by homogenization of the inclusion particles. Cryomilled and sintered sample exhibited inferior hardness value (5.80±0.23 Sequentially milled and sintered sample had the highest relative density (95.09%), the highest microhardness (7.16±0.59 This study was supported by
