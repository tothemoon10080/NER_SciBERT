Fractures of the distal radius are the most common fractures that occur in patients between ages 15 and 75 years. Many methods for treating displaced distal radius fractures are available. All forms of treatment involve obtaining fracture reduction, which may then be maintained by casting, functional bracing, external fixation, percutaneous pinning, internal fixation, or a combination of these methods. This article discusses the indications and technique of fracture treatment with external fixation and, when required, adjuvant percutaneous pins.
