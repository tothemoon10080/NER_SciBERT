The utilization of Silico-Aluminous Bottom Ash (SABA), derived from bituminous coal combustion in power plants, was investigated as a raw material in the kiln feed for the production of ordinary Portland cement clinker. Three different raw meals were studied, containing natural raw materials with 0, 3 and 6wt% of SABA. The raw mixes reactivity was assessed in terms of unreacted lime content, following sintering at 1200, 1350, 1400 and 1450°C. Clinkers produced at 1450°C, were characterized through means of chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The characterized clinkers were used to produce cement specimens by co-grinding with suitable amount of gypsum. Accordingly, cement quality was evaluated by determining setting times, standard consistency, expansibility and compressive strength at 2, 7 and 28days. XRD and TG/DTG analysis were used for the hydration study evolution after 28days of curing. SABA presents a promising alternative in waste valorisation practice, as it can readily be used in the raw kiln feed as a partial replacement of ordinary raw materials.Coal remains one of the major fossil fuel resources used in power plants up to this day, a fact that is attributed to its relatively low cost and high availability, as it is the most abundant energy source and exists in large quantities worldwide. The power demand is estimated to increase by 60% before 2030 globally and, with the exception of renewable energy forms, coal still is one of the fastest growing energy forms within developing and developed economies. Approximately 30% of the global primary energy demands is provided by coal combustion in power plants, whereas the corresponding value for electricity generation reaches 42% It is well known that coal combustion results in large quantities of by-products being generated in power plants; the most important of which are fly and bottom ash, boiler slags and flue gas desulfurization residue. Fly ash accounts for 60 The annual coal combustion by-products is estimated to reach 800 Several investigations have been carried out regarding fly ash utilization in the last three decades, including the use as an additive in cement, in manufacturing of glass and ceramics, as a low-cost adsorbent, as light weight aggregate, as a filler material in concrete and road bases construction, in the production of zeolites, in the synthesis of geopolymers and as a soil amelioration agent in agriculture Silico-Aluminous Bottom Ash (SABA), produced in power plants during the bituminous coal combustion, has been ranked in the category of siliceous ashes, where Si, Al and Fe are the three predominant elements. In contrast, calcareous ashes, which derive from lignite combustion, contain higher amounts of calcium. Depending on the nature of coal source, SABA generally consists of 20–60 Concerning cement hydration, SABA is expected to exhibit significant pozzolanic properties due to its high glassy silica content. However, as its CaO content is low, its activation towards the consequent production of secondary CSH compounds requires an external Ca(OH) The aim of the present investigation is the synthesis, characterization and hydration of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) clinker produced by partially substituting aluminium and silicon containing raw materials with suitable amount of SABA. Three different raw meals were prepared and studied: one reference containing only natural raw materials and two others with different percentages of SABA substitution (3 SABA used in the present investigation was collected from a local coal power plant derived from bituminous coal combustion. It appeared as a porous, dark grey, granular by-product, and exhibited a relatively high particle size. Ordinary natural raw materials, specifically limestone, schist, bauxite and silica sand were used to prepare the raw meals. Particle size distributions of all materials were determined by laser scattering technique with a Mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser (Malvern) following ultrasonic-assisted dispersion in high purity ethanol; results are presented in The natural raw materials and bottom ash were mixed in appropriate proportions to synthesize two raw meals with 3 The burnability of each mixture was assessed by determining the CaO The produced clinkers were ground using a laboratory rotating ball mill to a specific surface area of approximately 3950 The as-received dark grey SABA used in this work appeared granular and porous, mainly because of sudden cooling through quenching in a water tank, and its particle size distribution is shown in The chemical composition of the as received SABA and the natural ordinary raw materials is shown in The main mineralogical phases of SABA and raw meals (before sintering) are presented in SEM analysis results in polished sections confirmed the above observations ( According to laser scattering results, a minor reduction in particle size of the final raw meals was observed directly relative to the addition of SABA, a fact that can be attributed to the nature and microstructure of the material. Due to the sudden cooling, during the bottom ash removal from the combustion chamber, SABA exhibits a granular and porous morphology, in contrast with the compact and dense structure of natural sand or schist, the raw materials which mostly replaced in the raw meal. Accordingly, SABA presented a higher grindability and its addition in the raw meal resulted in a reasonable shift of the particle size distributions to finer sizes. The results of the chemical analyses for the produced clinkers, along with respective Bogue-calculated mineralogical phases and clinker indices are presented in The degree of the predicted mineralogical composition formation was assessed by X-ray diffraction analysis of the sintering products ( The degree of crystallization due to solid state clinkerization reactions during sintering, is also evident from the clinkers micrographs obtained with scanning electron microscopy in polished sections ( The sintered clinkers were crushed and co-ground in a ball mill of 1.5 The results for setting times and water requirement, as determined by Vicat probe and Vicat needle apparatus, and the corresponding Le Chatelier expansion are reported in The main hydration products of all cement samples, after 28 Additional confirmation was derived by the thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis at 28 Silico-aluminous bottom ash, derived from bituminous coal combustion, mainly consisting of mullite (3Al
