The properties of commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) grade 4 produced by spark plasma sintering (SPS), cold isostatic press (CIP) and sinter and casting were compared. Pre-compacted bodies were isothermally held for 10 minutes at 1250°C under a minimum compaction pressure of 10 MPa for the SPS method, while the CIP and sinter method involved isothermal holding of pre-compacted bodies for 1 hour at 1350°C in the tube furnace under argon gas atmosphere. The casting of green bodies was performed under vacuum of 1x10-3 mbar using a ZrO2 melting crucible and a copper mold. The SPS and casting methods resulted in highly dense materials. The microstructural features were homogeneous and mainly consisted of plate-like α-Ti phase for all three technologies.
