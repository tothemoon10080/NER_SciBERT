The Australian Synchrotron, opening in 2007, will be a national facility that will benefit a broad cross-section of Australian scientists and technologists, including the geoscience community. It is a state-of-the-art 3 The initial suite of beamlines, described in the Australian Synchrotronâ€™s National Science Case ( Synchrotron methods are being applied by Australian researchers to address a range of geological and mineralogical problems. Some of these examples will be discussed in detail, together with their potential in future applications. Summary information is provided below: Microprobe methods are being used to characterise fluid inclusions in order to enhance a predictive modelling approach to mineral exploration. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements are being made under conditions that emulate ore formation and mineral processing operations. Simultaneous, high resolution X-ray diffraction and high sensitivity X-ray fluorescence measurements are being performed on a range of geological and process materials in order to determine structure/property relationships. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy are being used to characterise chemistry and structural relationships at mineral surfaces, providing important information for realising process improvements.
