Purpose
                  To evaluate outcomes of intra-articular distal radius fractures with displaced dorsal lunate facet fragments treated with a combination of volar plating and the use of a dorsal screw that integrates into the plate.
               
                  Methods
                  We reviewed a retrospective cohort of 22 patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of an intra-articular distal radius fracture with a volar plate in conjunction with the Frag-Loc Compression screw. Patient charts and radiographs were reviewed for clinical and radiographic outcomes.
               
                  Results
                  A total of 12 patients with a minimum 6-month follow-up who met all eligibility criteria were included in this study. There were 8 women and 4 men. The mean age was 55.2 years. Mean follow-up was 11.5 months (range, 6–21 months). The most common mechanism of injury was a fall from standing (75.0%). At final follow-up, all patients were able to return to their previous level of function. Bony union was achieved in all patients at the time of final follow-up. Average radiographic parameters at final follow-up were radial inclination 24.2° ± 5.3°, volar tilt 1.3° ± 5.2°, and ulnar variance 0.9 ± 1.7 mm. During the follow-up period, transient median nerve paresthesias were observed in 4 patients, with spontaneous resolution in 3 of 4 patients. Loss of articular reduction was not observed in any case.
               
                  Conclusions
                  This study demonstrates satisfactory clinical and radiographic results and minimal complications with utilization of a new fixation device for distal radius fractures with displaced dorsal lunate facet fragments.
