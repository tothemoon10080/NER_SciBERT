This work demonstrates the effective use of automatic sensor-based sorting technology as a viable separation method for rare earth element (REE) rich ores composed primarily of xenotime minerals with gagarinite-(Y) and fluocerite-(Ce, La) inclusions. A dual energy X-ray transmission (DE-XRT) sensor affinity was used to evaluate forty-two heavy rare earth element (HREE) ore grab samples from the Madeira deposit. These samples and separated products were scanned by the sensor under many operating parameters. Subsequent analyses, including petrographic and multi-element chemical analyses were performed on the grab samples. Specific mass tests were also compared with energy attenuation curves from the sensor, which correlated strongly with every concentration stage – the highest achieved density being 3.01 g/cm3. The best estimated HREE recovery from laboratory-scale sorting of the samples identified by the sensor was effectively 100%, however this occurred in conjunction with a mass recovery equal to 97% of the feed. Such results are expected knowing that the sample method was not entirely representative. Ongoing research into automatic sorting technology for the upgrading of Brazilian ores is being performed by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil.Pre-concentration of mineral ores through the use of sensor based sorting (SBS) technology offers many avenues for improving mine productivity and profitability. First, it reduces the amount of material which must be crushed, screened and processed downstream, thereby reducing the waste processed by the mineral processing plant and stored in tailings ponds after processing. Second, it reduces the water requirements during the beneficiation processing. Third, since both the amount of waste material and the water are reduced in the processing steps, it also reduces the electrical consumption of the mineral processing plant. Fourth, the drastic reduction of tailings dam size and processing water/electric requirements may critically reduce the complexities involved with permitting and reclaiming mining operations, thus reducing the cost of the entire operation ( Due to the high cost of SBS equipment, prospective distributors of automatic sorting equipment recommend a run of mine (ROM) production capacity requirement equal or superior to 300 kt per annum to be economic ( This research investigates the practicality of dual energy X-ray transmission (DE-XRT) SBS to ores that bear rare earth elements (REE). These are initial investigations as part of the pioneering work on evaluating sorting technology for beneficiating REE bearing ores. Thus far, researchers have only investigated this technology on artificial generated REE samples ( The REE ore samples used in this study were sourced from the Generally, SBS technology operation analyzes and classifies particles without having invasive contact with the material. Signals from the sensors are analyzed by computer to determine the unique properties of each particle and classify them against predetermined thresholds for levels of product or waste material content ( The SBS process involves four steps. First, the material is crushed and screened to uniform size before being transported to the sensor via a small conveyor belt. Then, it is exposed to the sensor and scanned for its material properties. The data from the scan is then passed to the computer data analysis, and finally the material is separated through a metal flap (  The DE-XRT sensor operates as a line scanner. Particles pass through X-ray radiation via conveyor belt and pixel data is generated for the field of view perpendicular to the direction of the conveyor belt movement. Data are generated from the resulting radiation energy signal that penetrates the object, and represent a direct measure of the X-ray energy transmitted as it passes through the sample material. When a particle is exposed to a DE-XRT sensor, its signal is registered by X-ray scintillators, as illustrated in While DE-XRT implies dual or two X-ray sources, in reality there is only one X-ray energy source. This source, however, produces a spectrum of energy which is segregated into low or high energy intensity levels through the use of the scintillators and the filter metal (0.6 mm Cu sheet). The attenuated energy is then captured as pixel data and sent for post-processing via an integrated software. The software receives this information as an electromagnetic spectrum energy disturbance in which the signal intensity         Laboratory-scale DE-XRT SBS equipment was used to perform multiple sorting simulations on 42 sample particles. Complementary validation of detected particles was conducted through multi-element, petrographic, and specific mass analyses that were subsequently performed on the separated samples. The specific mass analysis was performed using a gas helium (He) multi-pycnometer to ascertain if the particles detected by the SBS equipment were of high equivalent specific mass, since these particles were also higher in xenotime mineralization. The samples studied were taken from the More information about these identifications and their relevance to REE concentration may be found in ( It is important to note that the investigated material does not represent the The sorting equipment used for this study was a The following equipment operation parameters were constantly maintained: supply voltage of the X-ray source, belt speed of (0.5 m/s), and linear scan angle (75 degrees). The particles were presented to the DE-XRT sensor by the conveyor belt in a random order. Images were analyzed by the DE-XRT sensor through a dynamic pixel scale. Multiple scans of each sample were made to ensure that the results were repeatable. The system was operated by a control unit, which was housed in an industrial computer. Operators set separation criteria through software calibration of scanned images. Operator calibrations were tested multiple times to determine the most ideal threshold settings for each simulated sorting of the material. All sorting tests were replicated four times to ensure repeatability, which occurred without error, obviating the need to analyze the averages of the results in this case. The DE-XRT sensor calibration is exemplified below in The image treatment by the software allows using a false color scale, which shows high density particle volumes in yellow, intermediate density particle volumes in red, and low-density particle volumes in blue. The images illustrated in First, the particles were all placed on the conveyor belt together, scanned, and the selection criteria of the equipment was set to its highest threshold ( The process as illustrated in Only 22 samples were used for calibration purposes, the remaining samples were subsequently sorted based on the calibration. After the sorting tests were completed, multi element chemical analyses of the samples were performed by Actlabs – Activation Laboratories LTD, a laboratory located in Canada. The multi element chemical analysis tests were performed using mass spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-MS), and were repeated thrice for each sample. Petrographic description of some of the samples by thin sections was done by the Instituto de Geociências (IGEO) from UFRGS. This was done to evaluate the presence of xenotime and classify the minerals as either xenotime, BAG, CAG or albite rock. The petrographic analysis also aimed to evaluate Thorium and Uranium contents pertaining to the detection results. Gas multi-pycnometer analysis verifies the specific mass of a material using the Archimedes principle ( DE-XRT image analysis of the scanned particles using built-in software revealed that the equipment was capable of characterizing the samples into one of three classification zones, denoted by the two red lines ( Results from the multi-elemental analyses are shown in  Metallurgical recovery represents the ratio (in percentage) of the REE mass value recovered in the concentrate (C1 through C5) to 100% of the same REE found in all feed ( Considering the difference between C1, which falls under zone 1, and all other concentrations C2 through C5, A metallurgical accumulated recovery evaluation quantifies the percentage of LREE and HREE for every calibration setting. Accordingly, C2 represents the result of the best suggested calibration setting for HREE recovery, although further economic evaluation would be needed to confirm its viability.  The average contents shown from the multi elemental chemical analysis corroborate with the literature that characterizes the When considering the characteristics of the simulated concentrations, their REE contents differ on a logarithmic scale but follow similar patterns across the different elements analyzed. In Taking an exploratory interpretation of the cumulative contents of each concentration, which are shown in The mass recovery of the combined concentration of C1 and C2 represents a good metallurgical recovery, with over 70% of the LREE and HREE, and a low metallurgical recovery of ores rich in Sn, Ta, Nb, Zr, Th and U. Data of the metallurgical accumulated recovery of the LREE, HREE, metallic ores and thorite are evidenced in The distinction between samples rich in REE and those rich in metallic elements, Th and U can be found in As previously mentioned, xenotime (YPO The xenotime inclusions are regular – being composed of feldspar, cryolite or mica, gagarinite-(Y), fluocerite-(Ce, La), pyrochlore and thorite ( For concentrations C3 to C5, the pattern texture of granite albite from Phenocrysts of the feldspar were commonly changed to white clays and corroded, indicating hydrothermal events. The later quartz includes matrix minerals. Polylithionite is common, making it possible to see biotite alteration. Cryolite is abundant as an actor disseminating and corroding the matrix minerals. Zircon and columbitized pyrochlore are common ( The W or waste sample is basically composed of albitite ( The X-ray energy transmission data of the studied material are inversely proportional to the bulk density of the particles when correlated to the specific mass, considering that higher cumulative color values by sample area (in pixel units) represent lower specific mass. Specific mass data shows that the DE-XRT sensor allowed for the removal of samples from high to low density.  Specific masses, from stages C4 and C5, present similar values. In C1, C2 and C3, a bigger difference of these energy levels can be seen. The specific mass values printed in In particular, the medium energy levels of the masses in stages C4 and C5 present practically the same density compared to the medium specific mass values and the attenuated energy levels, which justify a possible overlap or variation in the graphic curves above when analyzing its levels of attenuated energy. It is possible to infer that equipment configurations might be adjusted to avoid albite rocks (W) in the process, or, simply, make the particles of the rare earth elements (C1 to C2) part of the process with the minor presence of other mineral ores. The purpose of this work was to assess an SBS DE-XRT sensor for separating real xenotime hosted REE ores and evaluate the results of sorting based on the same sensor. The concentrates made by the sorter were analyzed by multi-elemental chemical analysis, petrographic analysis, and gas pycnometer. The calibration images ( The multi-element chemical analysis results showed that the xenotime hosts significant quantities of both HREEs and LREEs. The first concentrations, C1 and C2, contained over 70% of the REE contents of the samples and only 15% ( Comparing the chemical characterization data with the petrography, it was possible to infer that the rich xenotime rocks were readily detectable by the DE-XRT sensor. The petrography analysis also confirmed the pegmatite’s mineralogical matrix clasts, the characteristic presence of the metallic elements, and the character of the waste rock. As for the gas multi-pycnometer, tests compared with the DE-XRT sensor data proved the detection capacity of the sensor for REE rich ores, showing that the higher attenuated energy level is the result of the clasts with the higher specific mass, rich in xenotime ( In conclusion, the DE-XRT sensor showed the ability to detect xenotime clasts, and sort them effectively into their own product stream from the grab samples provided for this study. Further work, including sorting tests that involve a more representative sample and an economic analysis of the potential product streams and equipment cost is required to further verify these findings and determine the suitability for the sensor to such a sorting processing for an industrial scale operation. These tests would need to address the issues of sample representation, machine operation without operator oversight, and the cost trade-off of the value stream added by SBS.
