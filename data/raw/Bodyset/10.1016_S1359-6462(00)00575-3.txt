The Ti The starting materials were pieces cut out from a cast pancake of a Ti-24Al-11Nb. Hot rolled strips of the Ti-24Al-11Nb alloy, with a reasonably good basal rolling texture, a weak basal texture, a non basal texture and a basal transformation texture were taken. Each of these samples was soaked for 30 minutes at 1173 K before being subjected to further rolling at the same temperature up to a maximum of 65% reduction in multiple passes with intermediate heating for 2â€“3 minutes for re-attaining the rolling temperature after each pass. The rolling was kept strictly unidirectional. The as-rolled materials were subjected to microstructural characterisation using a Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL JSM 840A). A few samples were also examined in a Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL 2000FX) operated at 160 kV. The X-ray pole figures were measured at half thickness level of the as-rolled materials using Cu     From the above results it is quite clear that all the four starting materials have a recovered and/or partially recrystallised microstructure, whereas a second rolling at 1173 K produces a typical deformation substructure consisting of cells [ The weak basal texture does not sharpen during subsequent deformation. The stability of a basal rolling texture during further high temperature rolling has been examined for Ti-6Al-4V alloy by Frederick and Lenning Moderate rolling deformation (65%) at 1173 K of a prior thermomechanically processed Ti-24Al-11Nb alloy with a weak basal texture or a non basal texture does not either improve the basal texture or lead to the formation of basal texture. The main texture components, in all the cases are ( The authors are grateful to Prof. G.
