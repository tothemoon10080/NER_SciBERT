                     34S values of three soil-growing plant species (Platanus Orientalis L., Osmanthus fragrans L. and Cinnamomum camphora) have been analyzed to indicate atmospheric sulfur. The foliar δ
                     34S values of the three plant species averaged −3.11±1.94‰, similar to those of both soil sulfur (−3.73±1.04‰) and rainwater sulfate (−3.07±2.74‰). This may indicate that little isotopic fractionation had taken place in the process of sulfur uptake by root or leaves. The δ
                     34S values changed little in the transition from mature leaves to old/senescing leaves for both the plane tree and the osmanthus tree, suggestive of little isotope effect during sulfur redistribution in plant tissues. Significantly linear correlation between δ
                     34S values of leaves and rainwater sulfate for the plane and osmanthus trees allowed the tracing of temporal variations of atmospheric sulfur by means of foliar sulfur isotope, while foliage δ
                     34S values of the camphor is not an effective indicator of atmospheric sulfur.Atmospheric sulfur deposition has increased in some Chinese areas during recent decades (e.g. Sulfur isotope ratios ( Mosses, being sensitive to atmospheric sulfur deposition, have been shown to be outstanding bio-indicators in a wide range of air pollution studies and isotopic ratios in mosses can be used to discriminate atmospheric sulfur sources ( In this study, we aim to assess the potential of using foliar We selected three plant species, plane tree ( For all the three selected plant trees, about 10 Rainwater samples were collected on the roof of a two-storey building in 2009. In order to collect enough water samples for isotope analysis, a sampler with a large polyethylene sheet (1.5 Measurements of ion concentrations in rainwater samples and soil washings were conducted on ion chromatography (Dionex, ICS-90) with a detection limit of 0.01 Foliage sulfur contents were measured by an elemental analyzer (Model PE-2400 II, USA) with an analytical precision of 1%. Calibration of the instrument with cystine standard (N141-0324, provided by Perkin Elmer) was carried out. Accuracy and recovery of sulfur contents were checked by analyzing a sample of this standard material after each set of eight leaf analyses. Plant samples were oxidized in a Parr bomb to convert all forms of sulfur present to sulfate. To assure complete conversion, hydrogen peroxide was added to all washings. Sulfate was recovered from plant washings by precipitating as BaSO The precipitates (BaSO Statistical analysis was conducted by SPSS 11.5, and graphs were mainly created with SigmaPlot 2000 software (both SPSS Science, Chicago, USA). Differences in contents and isotopic values between sites, foliar developmental stage or between foliar sulfur and atmospheric sulfur were tested for significance by using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure, and least significant differences (LSD) were used by a Tukey-HSD test to compare significant differences (at the 95% confidence level). Differences were considered significant at All the rhizospheric soils of three trees showed negative Sulfate concentrations in rainwater have a wide range, with an average of 13.2 The average Foliar sulfur contents of the three plants varied very widely from 0.11% to 1.08%, with a mean of 0.39 Most of the leaves showed negative For the plane tree, both the foliar sulfur contents and the foliar For the plane tree and the osmanthus tree, there was a significantly linear correlation between the The sulfur contents of young, mature and old/senescing leaves showed similar variation pattern for the three trees ( Using a one-way ANAVO analysis, we found that foliar sulfur contents of both the osmanthus tree and the camphor tree were significantly linearly correlated with wet sulfur deposition ( The natural variation in stable sulfur isotope ratios in vegetation has been widely used to delineate sources of S in different ecosystems ( Many previous studies indicated that soil Atmospheric sulfur includes natural sources such as biogenic emissions and anthropogenic sources mainly due to the combustion of fossil gas and fuels in the form of oil or coal, each of which has an inherent Previous work has shown that lichens ( The fate of sulfur absorbed by tree leaves includes translocation to roots, allocation from mature leaves to younger leaves and release to the atmosphere in the form of H Although there is some evidence that assimilation by some plants discriminates against It has been a long held view that the canopy had slightly decreased the It has been shown by In this study, although the average This study work was kindly supported by the
