The importance of gas dispersion variables on the flotation process has led to the development of techniques that allow measuring and monitoring them in flotation. In the case of bubble size, the most used methods are based on image analysis and, although these methods are well accepted, they have not been implemented to monitor the flotation process on a regular basis, mainly because they are labor intensive, require the manipulation of a well trained operator, and are difficult to automate. In the current work, an acoustic technique for measuring the bubble Sauter mean diameter, d
                     32, is introduced. The technique is based on the response of bubbles to an acoustic perturbation consisting of a modulated signal with frequencies F

                     2 corresponds to the modulating signal that varies from 1kHz to 10kHz. A linear empirical relation was found between the average intensity of the acoustic response of the bubbles, I

                     , and d

The acoustic method represents an alternative to the image analysis technique as a sensor to monitor the flotation process, however, it still depends on image analysis as an independent method for calibration.It is well known that flotation performance is affected by the gas dispersion in the flotation cell ( Among the available techniques for measuring bubble size ( Acoustic emissions represent an alternative to monitor gas-liquid dispersions. There are two kind of methods that can be implemented ( When a bubble is formed, its surface oscillates (pulsates), which perturbs the surrounding water, and a sound wave propagates through water in all directions ( The technique consists of sampling bubbles from the flotation cell, exposing them to an acoustic perturbation, and analysing their response. A schematic of the sampling procedure is shown in The dimensions of the acoustic chamber are: 35 As the bubbles pass through the acoustic chamber, they are exposed to a modulated signal produced with two function generators, each of them generating a sinusoidal signal, but of different frequencies: a carrier signal, which corresponds to an ultrasound frequency, The two signals are mixed to obtain a modulated signal with frequencies The bubbles respond to the transmitted signal inside the acoustic chamber, and their response is received by the second transducer, which acts as a receiver. Both transducers, transmitter and receiver, are located perpendicular to each other on the center of their respective chamber walls. The received signal passes through a band-pass filter that passes ultrasound frequencies, filtering out the audible range, before being demodulated by mixing it with A series of tests were performed in a two-phase system (liquid-air) to determine the relation between the signal received and the size of the bubbles being sampled ( It can be seen that there is a linear relation between the mean intensity of the received signal, i.e., the response of the bubbles to the acoustic stimulus, and the values of  In order to validate the technique, a series of 25 tests were run in a 2-phase system. To obtain a wide range of bubble sizes in the flotation cell, the agitation was varied between 300 and 600 The results validate the acoustic technique. The bubble Sauter mean diameters determined with the acoustic technique correlate well with those determined using image analysis, with a coefficient of determination In order to test the reproducibility of the technique, a series of measurements were performed, in triplicate, in a 2-phase system, at different conditions of bubble generation in the flotation cell: the frother (MIBC) concentration was varied from 5 to 30 The three runs follow the same trend, which corresponds to a typical curve of bubble size against frother concentration ( In order to test the technique in a more realistic condition, a series of measurements were performed in a 3-phase system (water-air-particles), with quartz as the solid phase, at a The values for The coefficients for both conditions, 2-phase and 3-phase, are summarised in As noted in With the technique presented in this work it is possible to determine the bubble Sauter mean diameter, An acoustic technique for measuring the bubble Sauter mean diameter, The authors would like to acknowledge the
