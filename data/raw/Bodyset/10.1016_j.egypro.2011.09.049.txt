The aim of this study is to prepare mesoporous TiO2 from high specific surface area nanosheets by simple hydrothermal method at 120°C of 12h using autoclave unit (Thai made). The shape, size by TEM, crystalline structure by XRD, BET-specific surface area and photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples were investigated. The XRD result revealed that the prepared nanosheets were amorphous phase. The specific surface area, average pore diameter and pore volume were 360.28m2/g, 3-5nm and 0.275 cm3/g, respectively. The crystalline structure of calcined nanosheets at 300-600°C was anatase TiO2 with decreasing in the specific surface area. The intensity of anatase TiO2 structure increased when the calcination temperature was increased. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of the calcined nanosheets was higher than those of the as-synthesized nanosheets and commercial nano TiO2 (P-25, JRC-01, JRC-03). This preparation method provided a simple routh to fabricate high photocatalyst mesoporous TiO2 using autoclave unit (Thai made).
