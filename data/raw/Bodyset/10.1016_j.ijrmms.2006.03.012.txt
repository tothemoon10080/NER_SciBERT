In the paper “Predicting the sawability of carbonate rocks using multiple curvilinear regression analysis”, International Journal of Rock Mechanics & Mining Sciences 41 (2004) 1123–1131, the authors conducted performance measurement of large-diameter saws on 13 different carbonate rocks in a marble factory in Turkey. They determined the values of cohesion, friction angle, uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, Schmidt hammer value, point load strength, impact strength, Los Angeles abrasion loss and P-wave velocity values in the laboratory by taking rock samples from the factories. They evaluated slab production and rock properties by using multiple curvilinear regression analysis and developed estimation models. Advancing rate of saw, saw diameter, depth of cut, tensile strength and impact strength were included for the best model. Alternative and more universal models were developed, including each rock property in turn, together with the rotational speed of the saw. The authors found these models by using the data from With the saw mentioned in the article, a strip having a cutting depth equal to the radius of the saw is not possible because the saw is connected to the main body with a shaft and retaining flange as shown in The suggested retaining flange diameter is 300 From this calculation, it is clearly seem that, using a saw with a diameter of 1260 The cutting depth (
