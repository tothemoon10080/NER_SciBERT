This study discussed the application of response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) for modeling and optimization of the influence of some operating variables on the performance of a lab scale thickener for dewatering of tailing in the flotation circuit. Four thickener operating variables, namely feed flowrate, solid percent, flocculant dosage and feedwell height were changed during the tests based on CCRD. The ranges of values of the thickener variables used in the design were a feed flowrate of 9–21L/min, solid percent of 8%–20%, flocculant dosage of 1.25–4.25g/t and feedwell height of 16–26cm. A total of 30 thickening tests were conducted using lab scale thickener on flotation tailing obtained from the Sarcheshmeh copper mine, Iran. The underflow solid percent and bed height were expressed as functions of four operating parameters of thickener. Predicted values were found to be in good agreement with experimental values (R
                     2 values of 0.992 and 0.997 for underflow solid percent and bed height, respectively). This study has shown that the RSM and CCRD could efficiently be applied for the modeling of thickener for dewatering of flotation tailing.
