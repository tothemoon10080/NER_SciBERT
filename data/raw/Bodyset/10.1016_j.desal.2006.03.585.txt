The subject of the investigation has been the possibility of anion extraction from fixing process rinse waters contaminated by Br−, S2O3
                     2−, SO4
                     2−, SO3
                     2−, CH3COO− and silver thiosulfate complex anions using Amberlite IRA-93 RF, Purolite A-845, Purolite A-500 and AB-17-8 anion-exchange resins. Weak base Cl− forms of both Amberlite IRA-93 RF and Purolite A-845 resins remove silver complexes and SO3
                     2− anions most effectively, while strong base Cl− forms of Purolite A-500 and AB-17-8 resins sorb preferably Br− anions along with silver complexes. The seeming sorption capacities of Cl− forms of Amberlite IRA-93 RF, Purolite A-845, Purolite A-500 and AB-17-8 resins estimated under the test conditions were 1.05, 1.95, 0.97 and 1.82 meq/cm3, respectively. The elution of anions from loaded resins does not run in full and the effectiveness of the regeneration depends on the anionic form of resin and solution concentration. The Cl− form of Purolite A-845 resin demonstrates the best sorption capacity among the tested resins. When the sorption capacity is not depleted, this resin sorbs in full all anions, with the exception of the CH3COO− anion, which is sorbed only partially.
