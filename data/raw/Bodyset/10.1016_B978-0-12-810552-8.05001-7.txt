There have been significant advances in rock mechanics and understanding of the behavior of rock with developments in science and engineering. This has occurred at the same time as there has been greater demand for the utilization of underground space that has in many cases pushed the limits in the engineering design of underground excavations while there has been the continual need to improve safety and reduce the cost of excavation. It is imperative, then, that research continues which will provide the knowledge necessary to underpin the design and development of new excavation techniques. The book summarizes and enriches the latest research results on the theory of rock mechanics, analytical methods, innovative technologies, and its applications in practical engineering. TheÂ book is divided into six chapters including such features as The material presented in this book contributes to the expansion of knowledge related to rock mechanics. The authors, through their extensive fundamental and applied research over the past decade, cover a diverse range of topics from the microbehavior of rock and rock properties through the interaction of large-scale rock masses and its effect on surface subsidence, mechanics of rock cutting, techniques to improve the strength and integrity of rock structures in surface and underground excavations, and improvement in approaches to modeling techniques used in engineering design.
