A comparative study was carried out on the CO2 hydrogenation activities and product selectivities of the titania-supported monometallic and bimetallic Fe-based catalysts prepared by one-step wet impregnation. Among the monometallic catalysts (Fe, Co and Cu/TiO2), only Fe/TiO2 catalyst exhibited some selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, while Co/TiO2 and Cu/TiO2 were highly selective only to CH4 and CO, respectively. The addition of a small amount of second metal (Co and Cu) on Fe showed the synergetic promotion on the CO2 conversion and the space-time yields (STY) of hydrocarbon products. The incorporation of K and La as promoters can further improve the activity and product selectivity to higher hydrocarbons, indicating that the promoted Fe-based bimetallic catalysts are promising for CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons.The increase in carbon dioxide emission is one of the major environmental issues since a direct link between the rise in global temperatures and CO The active metals Fe, Ru, Co, Ni and Rh that are active for the conventional catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) could also be employed for CO Recently, we reported on the bimetallic promotion on the selective CO The aims of this work are to study the CO Titania (AEROXIDE TiO The K- and La-promoted catalysts were also prepared by a wet impregnation method, wherein the mixed solution of KNO CO For analysis of Ar, CO, CH The catalyst surface area (SA), pore volume (PV) and average pore diameter (D XRD patterns of calcined catalysts were obtained using a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154059 nm) radiation, fixed slit incidence (0.25° divergence, 0.5° anti-scatter, specimen length of 10 mm) and diffracted optics (0.25° anti-scatter, 0.02 mm nickel filter). Data obtained at 45 kV and 40 mA from 20 to 90 (2 The XRD peaks of crystal plane (101) and (200) in anatase was selected to determine the lattice parameter of TiO Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed at ambient pressure in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 using hydrogen as a reducing agent. About 0.10 g of sample was charged in a U-shaped quartz tube reactor and held by quartz wool. Prior to the reduction program, the sample was heated in situ to 393 (10 K min The physical properties and crystalline structure parameters of calcined catalysts are summarized in  From The TPR profiles of the calcined Fe-Co/TiO The CO As mentioned above, Fe/TiO Combining Fe with the second metal (Co or Cu) on TiO On the other hand, adding more Cu into Fe evidently enhanced the RWGS reaction which exhibited a favorable production towards CO ( The addition of a small amount of second metal (Co or Cu) to Fe catalyst could, upon reduction, induce the formation of alloy which modify the adsorption and activation of CO Time-on-stream (TOS) performance of promoted Fe-based bimetallic catalysts for CO Although, the K-promoted catalysts gave a slightly lower CO The performance of TiO The titania-supported monometallic and Fe-based bimetallic catalysts were examined for CO This work was supported in part by the Pennsylvania State University through the EMS Energy Institutes and the Penn State's Institute of Energy and the Environment.
