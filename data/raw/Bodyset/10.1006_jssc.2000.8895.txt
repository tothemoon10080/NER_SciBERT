The existing literature on BaTiO3 shows that the role of the various solid solutions and phases formed as a result of flux additions has not been addressed satisfactorily. In particular, their influence on the dielectric behavior of BaTiO3 has been largely ignored. Thus, number of criteria for the choice of a flux material is discussed, and an overview of the various flux additives that have been used in BaTiO3 is presented. In this work, the effect of ZnO–B2O3 and the ZnO–WO3 fluxes on the dielectric characteristics is investigated and analyzed. Sufficient care is taken to address the effect of the various phases and solid solutions on the electrical and dielectric properties of BaTiO3. A defect chemistry model is proposed and used to explain the observed electrical properties.
