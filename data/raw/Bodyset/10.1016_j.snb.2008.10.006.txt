                     . The sensor with CuO electrode has showed the good transient responses but smaller EMF signal than the sensor with NiO electrode, while the sensor with NiO electrode has showed sluggish transient behavior but larger signal than the sensor with CuO. Addition of YSZ particles to NiO electrode gave rise to an increase in EMF response as well as a fast response and a recovery. Based on the microstructure of electrode and its polarization curves, the sensing principle of this type sensor was studied and discussed.
                  In addition, their sensing characteristics were examined in the mixture gas of NO2 and NO through EMF measurement and I–V characteristics. The responses of the sensors were correlated with NO and NO2 concentrations to elucidate the sensing mechanism of oxide electrode in contact with YSZ. From the relations between EMF and NO/NO2 concentrations for each electrode, the measuring method to detect NO, NO2 and total NO

In the case of pure NiO electrode, NO However, oxides with high catalytic activity sometimes show the large sensitivity. For example, Cr In our results, the order of sensitivity was NiO(+YSZ) The EMF responses of the sensors with NiO(+YSZ) and CuO sensing electrodes were measured from the various ratio of gas mixture of NO  According to the mixed potential mechanism of the cell structure of Eq. Combining Eqs. The mixed potential type NO In addition, the EMF responses of the sensors with NiO(+YSZ) and CuO sensing electrodes showed a linear dependence on the NO concentration while logarithmic dependence was obtained for NO This work was partially supported by the Regional Technology Development Program (Project No. 10027621), by the Automobile Component Base Technology Project of Korea Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy, by Korea Ministry of Environment as “The Eco-technopia 21 project” and by the Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2004-041-D00327).
