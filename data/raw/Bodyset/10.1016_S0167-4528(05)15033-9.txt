The conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates involves smelting, converting, and electro-refining to produce a copper-cathode product. The conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates does elicit some compelling reasons to seek an alternative hydrometallurgical process for the recovery of concentrate values. These include: capital cost; impurity tolerance; lower-grade copper–gold concentrates; mine to market optimization; recovery of valuable by-products; use of existing capital; and economics. Copper hydrometallurgy has been extensively studied as an alternative route to chalcopyrite concentrate treatment. Historically, a large number of hydrometallurgical treatment processes have been developed to treat copper concentrates.The conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates involves smelting, converting and electro-refining to produce a copper-cathode product. Sulfur in the copper concentrates is oxidized to sulfur dioxide during smelting and converting and is normally used to make by-product sulfuric acid. Iron in the copper concentrates reports to the slag, along with many impurity elements. Precious metals (Au, Ag and platinum-group metals (PGMs)) are recovered from the anode slimes produced by the electro-refining operation. The conventional treatment of copper concentrates by this method works well and recovers copper and precious metals as high-value products. Processes for the recovery of gold from polymetallic ores in general are discussed in Chapter 35, while the recovery of gold along with PGMs is detailed in Chapter 36. The conventional treatment of copper–gold concentrates does elicit some compelling reasons to seek an alternative hydrometallurgical process for recovery of concentrate values. These include the following:        These processes have all failed to achieve sustained commercial production due to one or more of the following list of shortcomings: Low copper recovery in the primary leach step Copper loss due to copper co-precipitation with iron-hydrolysis products Difficult or incomplete gold, silver and platinum-group-metal recovery from leach residue Unconventional and difficult electrolysis step Difficult elemental-sulfur recovery step from leach residue Excessive corrosion (especially chloride circuits) Difficulty in fixing toxic by-products in a stable waste-product Large energy requirements for mixing and oxygen dispersion Poor-quality copper product that requires electrorefining. Against this backdrop, significant advances have been made over the last few years in advancing the use of hydrometallurgy for copper ore and concentrate treatment. At the time of writing this chapter at least four separate commercial plants have started or are under construction for copper recovery from sulfate medium:     The methods for copper recovery from copper–gold concentrates are therefore increasingly well established. In each of the sulfate process cases above, precious metals are not present in economic quantities in the feed material. In general, the recovery of gold and other precious metals from such copper–gold concentrates has yet to achieve commercial success. The leaching of sulfide minerals can proceed by a variety of routes. These include oxidative, reductive and non-oxidative chemistries. Reductive and non-oxidative chemistries, while interesting and potentially very useful, are beyond the scope of this Chapter. With oxidative leaching, sulfide minerals can be oxidized by various oxidants including for example, molecular oxygen, ferric sulfate or ferric chloride, cupric chloride or chlorine. Both the sulfide mineral oxidation and the reduction of the various oxidants are governed by the thermodynamics of the system. One way of picturing the thermodynamics of a particular system is to draw a potential – pH diagram. This figure shows that chalcopyrite is stable at reduced potential. Upon oxidation under acidic conditions, chalcopyrite will alter to bornite, chalcocite, covellite and finally to copper ion in solution. It should therefore be possible to leach chalcopyrite under acidic oxidizing conditions. In practice, chalcopyrite is one of the most difficult sulfide minerals to leach. Various experimental studies and reviews of chalcopyrite leach chemistry have been conducted ( Chalcopyrite (CuFeS Chalcopyrite leaching with ferrous sulfate and elemental sulfur reaction products: The sulfuric acid balance is interesting. According to the various chemistries shown, acid is consumed when elemental sulfur and/or ferric sulfate are produced. Whenever sulfur is oxidized to sulfate and iron is precipitated, acid is produced as a net reaction product of leaching. In the case of jarosite precipitation, the production of acid is reduced due to the incorporation of sulfate in the jarosite iron-precipitate structure. The kinetics of chalcopyrite leaching are often slow in sulfate systems. At lower temperatures (<110°C), chalcopyrite leaches slowly and tends to accumulate elemental sulfur and iron-precipitate product layers. Diffusion through the product layers tends to slow leaching. It is also believed that a passive film forms on the chalcopyrite surface that suppresses the rate of reaction. This passive film is believed to be a copper At medium temperatures (∼150°C), initial chalcopyrite leaching kinetics are faster. However, liquid elemental sulfur tends to block the chalcopyrite surface on partially leached particles and prevents full extraction. This can be overcome with the use of surfactants and a medium fine-grind of the concentrate ( At higher temperatures (>180°C), chalcopyrite leaches quickly and completely with high elemental sulfur oxidation to sulfate. At 220°C, leach times of less than 1 Based on the chemistry of chalcopyrite dissolution reviewed above, it is now possible to look at different case studies for copper–gold concentrate treatment processes. The sulfate processes for copper recovery from copper–gold concentrates that have been commercialized or are under active development are listed in The Activox Process ( The total pressure-oxidation process (  The Phelps Dodge Company has now pioneered the large-scale application of total pressure-oxidation at the Bagdad plant in Arizona (  The washed autoclave residue is neutralized with lime in four stages. If precious metals were present (there are very low levels of precious metals in the Bagdad concentrate), the neutralized residue could be cyanide-leached. The total pressure-oxidation process is very suitable for application where the acid from pressure leaching can be used beneficially. The process has been commercially demonstrated at a large scale and could easily be scaled up to larger size if required. Total pressure oxidation for copper concentrate treatment should now be regarded as “proven” technology. The BIOCOP™ process was developed by the BHP Billiton biotechnologies group based in Johannesburg South Africa ( The BIOCOP™ flowsheet has a number of interesting features. Oxygen is used for bioleaching. This necessitates the provision of an oxygen plant. Previously, bioleach plants for gold and base metal applications were operated with air blowers. Arsenic may be removed in a separate step to produce a residue for disposal. Copper may be recovered by SX/EW. Excess acid may be used in heap leaching if appropriate. It is expected that for treatment of arsenical copper–gold concentrates a cyanidation circuit for recovery of gold from the bio-oxidation residue would logically be applied. This would be augmented by The Outokumpu Hydrocopper™ Process ( The copper-bearing solution is purified by pH adjustment to precipitate cupric ion (for recycle to the leach), cementation (aided by soluble mercury salt) for silver removal, base-metal precipitation using sodium carbonate and then finally an ion-exchange process for polishing minor impurities (using C-467 resin from Duolite). The purified cuprous solution is then treated with sodium hydroxide to precipitate hydrated cuprous oxide for hydrogen reduction to metal. The three major reagents needed for this process are chlorine, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen. These are all produced using a standard chloro-alkali cell. The use of electrochemistry for chemical manufacture, rather than for metal winning, is a major step forward in application of chloride technology. Chloro-alkali cells are typically operated at 3,000–6,000 The main reactions (for chalcopyrite leaching) are shown below: The successful leaching of gold requires a sufficiently high oxidation potential to form the aurichloride complex species. The process does not oxidize pyrite, so only gold that is exposed to solution in the concentrate/leach residue will be recovered by this method. Silver is directly leached into solution as a silver-chloride species and can be recovered by cementation on a mercury-coated copper granule. The mercury coating forms a silver amalgam upon cementation of silver. Outokumpu have commissioned a ∼1 The Anglo American Corporation/University of British Columbia (AAC/UBC) Copper Process ( The Anglo American Corporation/University of British Columbia process was evaluated in a continuous, fully integrated pilot-plant trial ( The consumption of NaCN was largely due to formation of NaSCN in the cyanidation, with a minor contribution from formation of copper and zinc cyanide complexes: A number of alternative methods for precious-metal recovery from elemental sulfur-containing residues have had historical and current interest. Thiosulfate leaching is a natural process for consideration ( The PLATSOL The PGMs, which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium and iridium, typically occur in nature in close association with base metals sulfides, such as those of copper and nickel. Gold, although not traditionally included as one of the PGMs, is also frequently found in these ore bodies in varying concentrations. There are a number of situations in which it is undesirable or uneconomic to treat gold and PGM concentrates by the conventional route. In these situations, direct oxidative pressure leaching of a concentrate to dissolve the base metals may provide the best process economics. As with matte leaching, gold and the PGMs remain in the pressure-leach residue. The PLATSOL A potential flowsheet for copper–gold ores may comprise an initial base-metal recovery step, followed by a PLATSOL The hydrometallurgical treatment of copper and copper–gold concentrates using chemical and biological leaching has begun to make inroads to the field traditionally dominated by smelting and refining. The field has tended to advance thus far by necessity or unique opportunity. The Mt. Gordon and Sepon processes were developed to recover copper from ores that were not easily amenable to conventional flotation. The total pressure-oxidation process has been commercialized by Phelps Dodge; the acid from the total-oxidation autoclave can be beneficially used in the stockpile-leach process at Bagdad, Arizona. The BIOCOP™ process has been applied at a unique opportunity at the Chuquicamata complex in Chile. Copper concentrates containing high arsenic concentrations, which are not easily treated through a smelter, will be treated through the commercial bioleach plant with by-product weak-acid solutions used for associated heap-leaching operations. The AAC–UBC and PLATSOL It is predicted that further niche applications of hydrometallurgy for concentrate treatment will continue into the future. However, the industry is still waiting for a technology that can compete on an operating cost/capital cost and metal recovery basis with the conventional smelting/refining process. The difficulty with all sulfate-based processes appears to be the oxidation of some elemental sulfur to sulfate during leaching. The cost associated with the sulfur oxidation process and then the process of sulfate control ( The chloride processes for concentrate treatment offer some promise in meeting the challenge of conventional smelting and refining technologies. Chloride processes are attractive due to rapid copper leaching, high solution strength, very low sulfur to sulfate oxidation and low temperature/atmospheric pressure operation. The INTEC process continues to be developed for copper concentrate treatment. The most challenging step for INTEC is the use of EW for metal recovery. Formation and recovery of copper metal dendrites by deposition in the INTEC EW cell can be difficult. The Outokumpu Hydrocopper process has the attraction of use of electrochemistry for reagent synthesis (chlorine/hydrogen and sodium hydroxide). It is significant that Hydrocopper is able to extract and recover gold from copper–gold concentrates using selective gold leaching in strong brine solutions.
