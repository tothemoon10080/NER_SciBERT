The current study was conducted to isolate a field strain of Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae, characterize its infectivity and the response to challenge under experimental conditions. The isolated strain (GC) induced a prepatent period of 14–15days p.i., a patency of 7±2days and a noticeable pathogenicity in infected goat kids. Challenge trials resulting in a decrease of oocysts per gram counts as well as a milder intensity of clinical signs in re-infected animals indicated the capacity of this strain to induce protective immune response. Altogether, the data reported in the present study suggest that the strain E. ninakohlyakimovae GC is a useful tool for the investigation of mechanisms of pathogenicity as well as host protective immune response in caprine coccidiosis, representing a valuable prerequisite for the development of future strategies in prophylaxis and control of this important parasitic disease in goat.Infections with different subspecies of the apicomplexan genus In contrast to other well characterized eimerian infections in the murine ( In general, the termination of The present study aims to isolate a defined strain of Majorera breed goat kids were purchased from a local farmer at the age of 1–4 For the isolation of a defined For harbouring oocysts, goat kids were orally infected at the age of 4 For experimental infections, goat kids were separated into three groups ( For coprological analyses, faecal samples were obtained daily on 13–21 For haematological analyses, blood samples were taken weekly by puncture of the After euthanasia of the goat kids, all animals were subjected to necropsy. All macroscopic lesions were annotated and tissue samples were collected from the intestinal mucosa (ileum, colon) and from the mesenteric lymph nodes. The tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Cross sections of 4–5 Faecal oocyst counts were logarithmically transformed and added by one (log The oocysts of Primary infected animals (group II) scarcely had parasitic stages in the examined tissue samples of ileum and colon, probably because necropsy was performed at the post-patent period, when most of the parasites had already finished their endogenous development; only some sexual stages of the parasite could be found as depicted in The prepatent period in both primary- and challenged-infected animals varied from 14–16 Patency of With respect to production parameters, group I (primary plus challenge infected goat kids, W4PI Although individual variations of clinical signs were apparent, all 4-weeks old primary infected animals showed clinical signs compatible with coccidiosis such as diarrhoea, dehydration, deterioration of the general animal condition, anorexia and, occasionally, prostration. Different degrees of faecal texture were observed, ranging from paste-like to completely liquid and sometimes explosive diarrhoea containing blood and pieces of mucosa ( As to blood parameters, the total protein serum level were moderately reduced in primary-infected goat kids (groups I and II) within days 14–17 p.i. ( At necropsy, the intestines of infected animals showed no relevant macroscopic alterations. Histology revealed a moderate hyperplasia of the intestinal epithelium and hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches (PP). Futhermore, a clear eosinophilic enteritis ( In this investigation we isolated a field strain of The pathogenicity of The clinical signs generally corresponded to those previously reported in naturally infected goat kids ( The onset of clinical manifestations coincided with patency and was most severe between days 16 and 18 p.i. in primary-infected animals which may reflect the massive host epithelial cell destruction in the caecum and colon ( Despite the severity of the clinical signs, haematological alterations were not as striking as would be expected, but were also found rather moderate in other As regards blood leukocyte counts, we found clear indications of an infection-induced eosinophilia, as well as increased numbers of monocytes in goat kids experiencing primary infection at the age of 7 Primary infections with the GC strain of Overall, we here present data on the isolation and characterization of a specific strain of The present work was funded by the
