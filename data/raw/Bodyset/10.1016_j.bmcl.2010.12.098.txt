5-Hydroxymethylcytosine has recently been characterized as the ‘sixth base’ in human DNA. To enable research on this DNA modification, we report an improved method for the synthesis of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5-HOMedC) phosphoramidite for site-specific incorporation into oligonucleotides. To minimize manipulations we employed a temporary protecting group-free 2′-deoxyuridine to 2′-deoxycytidine conversion procedure that utilizes phase transfer catalysis. The desired 5-HOMedC phosphoramidite is obtained in six steps and 24% overall yield from 2′-deoxyuridine.The canonical ‘ATCG’ bases of DNA can undergo covalent modifications on their purine and pyrimidine rings ( Recently, Kriaucionis and Heintz reported the presence of a novel human DNA modification, 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxycytidine ( Reported approaches to the preparation of In an attempt to devise an efficient and economical synthetic route in which the use of temporary protecting groups is avoided, we then investigated the direct hydroxymethylation Acid- or base-catalyzed hydroxymethylations We then considered the early introduction of a 5′-DMT protecting group ( In an attempt to improve conversion of To test the substrate scope of our optimized conditions for DMT tetrafluoroborate-based protection, the reaction was performed on a set of 2′-deoxyuridine derivatives ( A bottleneck in the subsequent steps was the conversion of 2′-deoxyuridine Phase transfer catalysis has been used for the efficient preparation of 3′,5′-diprotected 5-azidomethylcytidine The higher reactivity of the pyrimidine This procedure for 2′-deoxyuridine to 2′-deoxycytidine conversion of Attempts to Compound In summary, we have developed a substantially improved synthetic route to a protected precursor of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and have demonstrated that the product can readily be incorporated into oligonucleotides for biological applications.
