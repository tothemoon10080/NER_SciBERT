Leaching of platinum and palladium with alkaline cyanide solutions has been shown to be feasible for a number of leach modes. The platinum and palladium leaching will typically take place at elevated temperatures, which can range from 55°C on heaps or in tanks to between 120 and 180°C in autoclaves with a better degree of leaching occurring with higher temperatures. Some progress has also been made into the investigation of PGM (platinum group metals; Pt, Pd, Au) adsorption onto activated carbon at room temperature, but as typically higher temperatures (>55°C) are likely for the leaching of Pt and Pd, it is an important factor in the adsorption process of which the effect is still largely unknown. The effects of temperature, free cyanide and base metal (Cu and Ni) concentrations on the adsorption of PGMs from pregnant leach solutions onto granular activated carbon were therefore determined.
                  Common to most diffusion controlled processes, an increase in the adsorption rate of platinum, palladium and gold cyanide with an increase in temperature was observed. Experiments with consecutive contacts of the PGM cyanide solution onto the activated carbon, however, revealed that with an increase in temperature, the amount of PGMs that were adsorbed, decreased with each loading. In the absence of free cyanide and base metals, it was found that after 4 consecutive contacts, 99% of the total amount of Pt and Pd adsorbed at 25°C compared to 85% of the Pt and 83% of the Pd at 50°C. No difference could be seen between the adsorption of gold cyanide at 25 and 50°C after 4 contacts. It has also been established that the detrimental effect of free cyanide on the adsorption of PGMs will increase as the temperature increases. The detrimental effect of the presence of Cu and Ni is evaluated, based upon the amount of the base metals adsorbed at these conditions, which have been found to vary significantly with cyanide and temperature. Generally, Pt and Pd adsorption has been found to be significantly more affected by temperature, cyanide and base metals than the adsorption of gold and needs to be carefully taken into consideration with the design of a PGM adsorption circuit to ensure sufficient Pt and Pd recovery.Several authors have investigated the potential of leaching platinum and palladium with cyanide ( The mineralogy of PGMs is complex with a large number of sulfides, arsenides, tellurides and alloys. The primary base metal minerals are chalcopyrite, pendlandite, and pyrrhotite with nickel and copper grades of 0.2% and 0.1% found in the Merensky ore and up to 0.3% and 0.2% in the Plat reef ores ( Based upon the higher temperatures and higher cyanide concentrations required for platinum and palladium leaching, understanding the influence of temperature and further researching cyanide concentration on the adsorption of platinum and palladium onto activated carbon was therefore deemed important Furthermore, considering the amounts of nickel and copper occurring in South African PGM ores, the conditions and extent to which platinum and palladium adsorption will be affected, were also considered important for further investigation. The activated carbon used for the experiments is a commercially available coconut-based granular activated carbon supplied by Marlyn chemicals (Pty) Ltd-South Africa (BET surface area of 1200 It has been shown that PGM cyanidation occurs in the same manner as that of gold and that the reactions follow the Elsner equation to form stable complexes with cyanide, namely [Pt(CN) Two different methods were employed for the adsorption of the metal cyanide complexes onto the activated carbon: The traditional bottle-on-rolls method — Single component isotherm development Stirred vessels — Kinetic rate and continuous adsorption experiments to investigate the adsorption of PGMs at various temperatures, cyanide and base metals levels. Single component equilibrium isotherms were developed by contacting weighed samples of 0.6, 1, 2, 3 and 4 For both the kinetic rate and continuous adsorption experiments, the synthetic solution containing the mixed metal cyanides was divided into volumetric flasks, which were submerged into a water bath set at the desired temperature (25, 35 and 50 To determine the kinetics of adsorption with temperature, samples were taken at TIME For the consecutive loading test, 500 For the repeatability test, the experiment at 50 All samples were filtered using a 0.45 According to The equilibrium results for the Pt and Pd isotherms are shown in Though direct comparison to gold isotherms found in literature is difficult due to the many factors, that affect the adsorption of metal cyanide complexes, for example the activity  In addition to the geometry of the complex, Considering that the typical loadings observed in gold plants range from 200 ( Temperature remains an important factor in the activated carbon process. For gold processing, the importance of temperature is probably only related to the stripping of the gold in the elution process as the leaching and adsorption occur at ambient temperatures. For Pt and Pd, leaching will typically take place at elevated temperatures, which can range from 55 The first set of experiments investigated the adsorption rate of Pt, Pd and Au at 25, 35 and 50 From the Arrhenius plot ( The increase in adsorption rate with temperature (  PGMs adsorbed after a time t, intraparticle diffusion rate constant (mg/g the thickness of the boundary layer. In addition to an increase in adsorption rate, literature suggests that the equilibrium loading, however, will decrease as the temperature increases. Based upon this, the effect of temperature on the continuous adsorption of PGMs onto activated carbon was therefore investigated.  No difference can be seen between the adsorption of gold cyanide at 25 and 50  Similar to the effect of temperature, the effect of cyanide on the adsorption of platinum and palladium became more pronounced after consecutive loadings with the effect increasing with each contact. At the end of contact 4 (    From the experimental data shown in When both cyanide and base metals were present ( Since Cu and Ni adsorption is vastly different from each other, to understand the combined effect of temperature and base metals as well as the combined effect of cyanide and base metals on the adsorption of PGMs, it first has to be established what these effects are on the adsorption of the base metals individually. The total base metal adsorption after the 4 consecutive loadings can be seen in The copper adsorption in To interpret the change in PGM adsorption due to the presence of base metals, the quantity of base metals adsorbed, which actively take up sites on the activated carbon in the place of PGMs, was calculated and can be seen in According to The PGM adsorption at a high cyanide level, but at the different temperatures and in the presence of base metals, is shown in At a low cyanide level, where the total amount of base metals adsorbed was the same at 25 In general, it is rather difficult to come to a definite conclusion regarding the combined effect of base metals and temperature on the adsorption of Pt, Pd and Au. It can rather be concluded that temperature, the free cyanide, as well as the time of the adsorption will contribute to the Cu and Ni adsorption independently, which in turn will determine the amount of these base metals, which will take up sites on the activated carbon and compete with the PGM adsorption. One of the major advantages of gold CIP plants is that they are mechanically robust, handle plant upsets remarkably well and are highly tolerant to changes in feed composition ( Single component equilibrium isotherms were developed for Pt and Pd. To serve as a reference, the Pt and Pd isotherms were compared to gold isotherms from literature with the Pt isotherm found to be in a similar range as to that of the Au isotherms discussed. The Pd isotherm is shown to be significantly lower than the Pt isotherm at the same conditions and lower than any of the gold isotherms discussed from literature. An increase in the rate of adsorption of Pt, Pd and Au with an increase in temperature from 25 to 50 Ni and Cu adsorption at high and low cyanide concentrations and temperatures was found to be vastly different from each other. Nickel adsorption was found to follow a similar trend to that of platinum and palladium adsorption with the nickel adsorption decreasing with increasing temperature and cyanide addition and this effect increasing at both higher temperatures and cyanide addition. The effect of the mole ratio of Cu to cyanide to form different adsorbing tetra, tri and dicyanides of copper is well documented ( The authors would like to thank
