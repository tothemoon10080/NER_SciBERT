Open reduction and internal fixation of displaced acetabular fractures is now accepted as the standard of care. Ideally these fractures should be fixed at 5–7 days after injury and are more difficult to fix after 2–3 weeks. All operative treatment of acetabular fractures was performed in a tertiary centre and during most of this trial was undertaken by one surgeon (though this has increased to two in the last year). Between January 2002 and January 2004, 40 consecutive patients with displaced acetabular fractures were operated on. Data covered included surgical delay, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, co morbid factors, fracture type, congruency and postoperative complications and other risk factors were also recorded. Risk factors included dislocation, comminution, marginal impaction and femoral head injury. At follow up all patients had Harris Hip Scores and general satisfaction questionnaires completed. The results of the study showed that the target timing of 5–7 days was very difficult to achieve and in spite of other variables delay of more than 2–3 weeks was associated with poorer functional outcome.
