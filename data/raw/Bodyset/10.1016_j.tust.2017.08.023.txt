In coal mining, the entry roof with a weak plane (ERWP) is vulnerable to large relative displacement, and even caving influenced by the mining stress from the adjacent working face (AWF) for underground mining engineering. A typical field case in a chinese coal mine demonstrates that the mining abutment stress can strengthen the relative displacement along the weak plane for the entry roof. To address this conditions, a method to improve the width to height ratio (W/H) of the coal pillar to reduce the effect of the mining stress on the stability of the ERWP based on a numerical model is proposed. In order to improve the reliability of the numerical model, the double-yield model for the gob material, the Mohr–Coulomb model for the pillar material, and the interface element for the weak plane were validated in detail. The results of the validated model indicate that the relative displacement induced by the mining abutment stress is divided into four stages, and it decreases significantly as the W/H increases. In the final, the W/H more than 8 is determined to reduce the effect of the mining abutment stress on the ERWP. The modelling procedure can be repeated and is necessary in other geological and engineering conditions since the determined W/H may be another value.Three entries are developed on both sides of every longwall panel, called the three-entry system in US coal mines ( Most of the researches have studied the mechanical behaviour of entry with weak plane under static geological stress, which are helpful in the design of the entry ( Many other researches ( In this paper, we used the ERWP of tail entry II in panel II in the Xichuan Coal Mine as Xichuan coal mine is located in the city of Tongchuan, Shaanxi Province, China. The longwall top coal caving operation is developed using a two-entry system that is approximately 1200 Two measurement stations were established 30 The deformation of the roof and ribs occurred mainly in the beginning (approximately 25 The relative displacement of the roof mainly occurred in the ERWP ( A comprehensive numerical model was constructed with the geometric dimension being 130 This numerical model was divided into 1,060,800 zones in total. In accordance with the uniform zone dimensions and the solution time ( The left and right sides of the model were fixed in displacement along x axial direction. The front and back sides of the model were fixed in displacement along y axial direction. The bottom side of the model was fixed in displacement along z axial direction. Under the condition of the in situ stress test results, the vertical stress 9.85 The stress state for every zone in the model must be initialized in according with that in the field. Every zone was initialized with a horizontal stress −5.73 Assumptions: Every rock stratum in the numerical model was assumed as homogeneous and isotropic without the influence of the native fissures, tiny holes, geological faults and collapse columns, since the main problem is the effect of the mining abutment stress on the ERWP. The Mohr–Coulomb model was used to simulate the rock stratums since it was effective to explain the rock mechanical behaviour ( The surface displacement of tail entry II measured in the field (see In longwall mining, the process of roof strata caving, compaction, and consolidation is too complex to be represented by a reasonable mechanical or numerical model ( The material properties of the double-yield model as shown in A pillar sub-model consisting of three parts: roof, coal pillar, and floor ( The coal pillar material properties as shown in The Mohr–Coulomb criterion is widely applied to predict the shear strength of material with weak constituents because the material is vulnerable to shear failure once the shear stress on a plane within the material reaches the shear strength ( The dip angle of coal seam 4 is 4 degree, which nearly makes the abutment stress be perpendicular rather than parallel to the weak plane of the ERWP, and the mechanical parameters of the interface element will influence the compression strength of the rock mass significantly ( The uniaxial compressive strength of a rock mass with a weak plane obtained by the analytic solution Eq. To validate the model consisting of the Mohr–Coulomb model for the geological rocks, the Double-Yield model for the gob, the Interface Elements for the weak structural plane, and the Mohr–Coulomb model for the coal pillar, we selected the surface displacement and the relative displacement of tail entry II as the analysis targets for comparison with the monitoring results from the field as shown in Section The surface displacement of tail entry II was predicted by the model during the retreat of the AWF. The results are in good agreement with those measured in the field as shown in The relative displacement predicted by the simulation model, consisting of separation and relative displacement between the interlayer and the coal seams, is shown in Simulation of the implementation of the underground mining activities can be divided into four steps to predict the stress condition and relative displacement of the ERWP and to find a reasonable W/H to reduce the effect of the mining abutment stress on the stability of the ERWP. In the first step, the model involving the dimension, the grid size, the material, the geostatic stress and the boundary conditions was established based on the specific geological condition mentioned in the Section The measurement station consisting of fourteen measurement points was arranged in the tail entry II with 50 The overall stress relief is equal to the overall additional mining stress in the surroundings of the face during underground mining activity ( The retreating of the AWF has a great influence on the stress state of the ERWP, and that the influence range of the mining stress is 30 The relative displacement of the ERWP with different W/Hs presents four distinct stages influenced by the mining stress induced by the retreating of the AWF as shown in A reasonable W/H to protect the ERWP from the effect of mining stress can be set as more than 8 because the peak vertical stress above the solid coal is stable (see A reasonable W/H to protect the ERWP from the effect of mining stress can also be determined as more than 8 because the relative displacement of the ERWP has little relationship with the retreating of the AWF when the W/H is more than 8 (see The validated model is able to predict the evolution of the stress condition and the relative displacement for the ERWP under the condition of different types of W/H. Compared with the previous mining plan with a A comprehensive numerical model was carried out to predict the evolution of the stress condition and the relative displacement for the ERWP. Influenced by the mining abutment stress, the ERWP will undergo large relative displacement, which will induce large deformation and even caving. To improve the reliability of the numerical model, the double-yield model for the gob material, the Mohr–Coulomb model for the pillar material, and the interface element for the weak plane were validated in detail, and the model was validated by comparing the surface displacement and relative displacement with measured field data. The results of the validated model indicate that the evolution of the relative displacement induced by the mining abutment stress is divided into four stages, It will be stable (stage I), then increases slowly in the front of the AWF (stage II), then increases rapidly behind it (stage III), and then presents a trend of gradual stabilization (stage IV) as the AWF passes by. For any one of the four stages, the relative displacement above the coal pillar is much larger than that above the solid coal and that above the entry is the minimum. By increasing the W/H, the relative displacement decreases significantly, and the four distinct stages will disappear and the relative displacement will remain stable as the AWF passes by. In the final, the W/H more than 8 is determined to reduce the effect of the mining abutment stress on the ERWP. The modelling procedure can be repeated and is necessary in other geological and engineering conditions since the determined W/H may be another value.
