Recently, additives such as Na2SO4 and Na2CO3 have been proven to be capable of enhancing the reduction of phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore and the recovery of dephosphorized iron by magnetic separation. In this study, the behavior of phosphorus during the carbothermic reduction of a phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore in the absence or presence of Na2SO4 was characterized. Thermodynamic calculations of the reactions of fluorapatite with SiO2, Al2O3, or Na2SO4, phase transformations during reduction and the distributing characteristics of phosphorus in the metallic iron and non-metallic phases of the reduced pellets were investigated. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that SiO2, Al2O3, and Na2SO4 influence the reduction of fluorapatite significantly. XRD and SEM-EDS results confirm that when the oolitic hematite ore was reduced in the presence of Na2SO4, reactions between Na2SO4, SiO2, and Al2O3 are prior to the reduction of fluorapatite. Therefore, the phosphorus content of the metallic iron phase in the pellet decreased markedly. With the sodium sulfate dosage varying from 0% to 20%, the mean phosphorus mass content in metallic iron grains decreased from 0.877% to 0.02%. The dephosphorized iron is then recovered by magnetic separation subsequently.Oolitic hematite ore, which has a special concentric and layered oolitic texture as well as high phosphorus content (0.4%–1.8%), is regarded as one of the most refractory iron ore resources ( A direct reduction process is an effective method for the treatment of complex iron ores, which may be low grade, poorly dressable, or polymetallic ( During reduction of phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore, the dephosphorization is poor without the aid of additives during reduction roasting. There is an excessive content of phosphorus in the magnetic concentrate, which is then not suitable as a steelmaking feedstock. To illustrate the high phosphorus capacity of the above-mentioned sodium salts, the behavior of iron during the carbothermic reduction of oolitic hematite ore, in terms of the reduction degree of iron oxides and the coalescence of metallic iron particles, was examined ( Although Na The oolitic hematite ore used in this research was taken from Hunan province of China, assaying (mass%) 51.28 Fe The phase composition and the distribution fraction of phosphorus in the oolitic hematite ore were determined by the method of chemical phase dissolution. This procedure was described in details in our previous work ( Lignite was used as the reductant, and its composition was described in our previous work in detail ( The sodium sulfate was of analytical reagent (AR) grade. Oolitic hematite ore was crushed and ground to pass a 74 The reduction experiments were performed in a vertical electrical resistance furnace with a heat-resistant stainless pot (the schematic diagram of the vertical resistance furnace can be referred to in our previous work; The choice of roasting temperature of 1050 The powder pattern X-ray diffraction (RIGAKU, D/Max 2500, Japan) was carried out by using a copper Kα X-ray source, with a scanning angle in the range from 10° to 80° (2 To investigate the distribution characteristics of phosphorus in the reduced pellet, polished cross sections of reduced pellet, embedded in epoxy resin, were observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an energy diffraction spectrum (SEM-EDS, JEOL, JSM-6490LV, Japan). For the analysis of the P content of the metallic iron phase, eight sectors (labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) were chosen along the diameter of the cross section of the reduced pellet, and 5 metallic iron grains were randomly selected for EDS analysis within each sector. Moreover, EDS analysis was also used to help identify the composition of the gangue phases. The values of thermodynamic properties of the pure substances are obtained from a thermodynamic data compilation ( During the carbothermic reduction process, carbon gasification takes place as shown in Suppose that the carbon gasification reaction is carried out at a constant pressure of 1 It has been found that the reduction of hematite proceeds stepwise (Fe Gibbs energy changes of At P The reactions between Ca Additionally, the generated FeS is highly unlikely to convert into Fe or FeO in the reducing atmosphere, as the FeS can also form from FeO as shown in In the presence of various amounts of Na As can be seen in Moreover, with the increasing dosage of Na Phosphorus distribution characteristics in the metallic iron phase of the reduced pellets in the presence of various amounts of Na As shown in Thus, it can be deduced from With the increasing dosage of Na  When 10% Na Therefore, it indicates that fluorapatite is liable to react with acidic components involving SiO The behavior of phosphorus during the direct reduction roasting of a phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore in the absence or presence of sodium sulfate was investigated. Effects of sodium sulfate on the reduction of fluorapatite, phase transformation of phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore, and distribution characteristics of phosphorus in metallic iron as well as non-metallic phases were examined. According to the findings, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Thermodynamic calculation shows that the carbothermic reduction of Ca (2) Phase transformation of reduced oolitic hematite ore in the absence or presence of Na (3) Sodium sulfate enhances the Fe and P separation during the carbothermic reduction of phosphorus-rich oolitic hematite ore in mineralogical aspect. As the sodium sulfate dosage increased from 0% to 20%, the phosphorus mass content in the metallic iron grains decreased from 0.877% to 0.02%. The authors wish to express their thanks to the
