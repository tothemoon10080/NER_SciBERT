Acetabular fractures are rare, significant injuries involving the articular surface of the acetabulum. They are typically associated with a high-energy mechanism of injury, though fragility type fractures are now increasingly seen. Associated injuries to another organ system are seen in half of all cases. Radiographic assessment is performed using antero-posterior pelvic radiographs and Judet views, as well as computerized tomography (CT). Classification is based on the column theory and describes fracture anatomy in relation to the anterior and posterior columns. Non-operative treatment is indicated when there is less than 2 mm of articular displacement or when patient factors (such as associated injuries/co-morbidities) or soft tissue injury are incompatible with surgery. Open reduction and internal fixation is indicated in displaced fractures, total hip arthroplasty being used in unreconstructable injuries. Operative treatment involves difficult exposures and technically demanding reduction and fixation techniques. Significant associated injuries include neurovascular injury, bleeding, open fracture wounds, soft tissue injury, hip dislocation and femoral fractures. Late complications include post-traumatic osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis and heterotopic ossification. The goals of treatment should be to give the patient a congruent, functional hip whilst minimizing the complications from both the injury and surgery. Poor results are more likely if the reduction is non-anatomical.Acetabular fractures are rare but significant injuries that involve the articular surface of the acetabulum, with an incidence of three in 100 000 per year. A thorough understanding of the bony anatomy is key to the appropriate assessment and treatment of these complex fractures. The acetabulum is an inverted cup that sits on the infero-lateral aspect of the pelvis. The cup is inclined at 45% to the horizontal in the coronal plane, and 20 degrees anteverted in the sagittal plane. It is at the centre of the inverted Y-shaped innominate bone, which is formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium and pubis at the triradiate cartilage. Letournel described the acetabulum as being supported by an anterior and posterior column that make up the ‘legs’ of the inverted Y. Initial imaging is with plain radiography using the anterior posterior (AP) pelvis and Judet views. Judet views are two views taken at 45 degrees lateral to the AP projection in the axial plane; the obturator oblique and the iliac oblique views. Computerized tomography (CT) is used both to accurately define fracture anatomy and seek additional injuries, such as femoral head fractures and marginal impaction. This should be centred on the middle of the pelvis and include proximally the full extent of the iliac wings and the lumbosacral articulation, whilst distally the lesser trochanters of the hip should be visible. There are multiple lines that can be interpreted on the plain AP pelvic film (and Judet views) that describe the bony contour of the pelvis [ Iliopectineal line – follow the superior border of the superior pubic rami caudally to the greater sciatic notch. This is the bony outline of the anterior column. Ilioischial line – follow the superior border of the inferior pubic rami caudally to the ischium. This is the bony outline of the posterior column. Teardrop – This is the radiographic appearance of the space between the quadrilateral plate medially and the cotyloid fossa laterally. Roof/Dome of the acetabulum – This is the superior margin of the acetabulum. Anterior wall – follow the inferior border of the superior pubic rami laterally to the supero-lateral edge of the acetabulum. Posterior wall – follow the inferior border of the superior pubic rami laterally to the supero-lateral edge of the acetabulum. Femoral head – The femoral head should be congruent with the acetabulum. Shenton's line follows from the line of the inferior neck as it is continuous with the inferior border of the superior pubic rami. Obturator foramen – This should have a continuous, smooth outline. A fracture extending into the foramen represents a column fracture. If there is a transverse fracture line extending into the foramen then this may indicate a T-shaped fracture is present. A disruption of any of these lines represents a bony disruption and should trigger further evaluation. The obturator oblique [ The iliac oblique [ It should be noted that the iliac oblique of the left hip is also an obturator oblique of the right, and vice versa. CT should use a minimum cut thickness of 2 mm to allow accurate characterization of fracture anatomy [ Fracture lines not visible on plain radiographs Displacement of fractures Femoral head fractures Fractures of the pelvis/spine Intra-articular fragments Marginal impaction of the wall Assessment of the weight-bearing dome of the acetabulum Joint congruency Fracture fixation Letournel classified acetabular fractures according to the fracture anatomy. Elementary types: Posterior wall Posterior column Anterior wall Anterior column Transverse Associated types: Posterior column & Posterior wall Transverse & Posterior wall T-shaped Anterior column (or wall) & Posterior hemitransverse Both columns This widely used classification not only aids fracture description but also guides treatment [ Patients should be treated according to ATLS protocols. Those patients who have sustained injuries as a result of high-energy trauma warrant careful assessment. In the history, the mechanism of injury is essential to ascertain as this will characterize the amount of energy imparted to the patient as well as highlighting other potential injuries and concerns. ATLS driven examination and investigation is essential in all patients.   Associated injuries Head, spine, trunk, limbs Major blood loss G&S/Cross-match blood Tranexamic acid Major transfusion protocol Superior gluteal artery laceration especially with disruption of the greater sciatic notch (consider radiological embolization) Neurological injury Document neurology (sciatic, femoral, obturator function) Per rectum and perianal examination Exclude open fracture Per rectum, per vaginal & perineal examination Soft tissue evaluation Soft tissue evaluation is key when choosing surgical approach A Morel-Lavallee lesion is a shearing of the skin and subcutaneous tissues from their underlying fascia, typically over the greater trochanter. It represents a major soft tissue degloving Dislocated hip A dislocated hip requires prompt reduction to protect the femoral head from avascular necrosis, and chondral damage. This may be performed in the emergency department under sedation, or in the operating theatre Skeletal traction is commonly used and is indicated both following reduction of a dislocated hip with either hip instability (proven or suspected), and the reduction of central dislocations where there could be pressure on the femoral head. The traction pin should be applied through the distal femur and a 5 kg weight attached through stirrups. Proximal tibial and trochanteric traction pins are not advised (there is a significant incidence of knee injuries with acetabular fractures). Appropriate work-up for acetabular fixation is essential. This should include up-to-date documentation of examination (especially neurological, rectal, vaginal and perianal examination), bloods (full blood count, renal function, clotting profile) and imaging. Further pre-operative investigations include lower limb duplex scan to assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Thromboprophylaxis needs to be instituted. Consent should be obtained by an experienced surgeon due to the significant risk of complications. The ideal time for definitive fixation is once the overall physiological state of the patient allows and the appropriate surgeon, theatre team and equipment are available. These fractures do not typically require emergent fixation, however fixation is best performed within the first 7 days, when fracture fragments are more mobile and therefore more amenable to indirect reduction techniques. Pre-operative planning of the fixation is essential due to the complex nature of these injuries. 3D CTs and sawbone models can be used to plan fixation. Intra-operatively the patient should be placed on a radiolucent table. Traction is often required and can be applied through the specialized tables or manually through pulling on a leg or traction pin. The choice of surgical approach depends on multiple factors and includes the fracture pattern, soft tissue condition and surgeon experience. In essence the approach should be as minimally invasive as possible to allow accurate reduction and fixation of the fracture. The most commonly used approaches include the Anterior Intra-Pelvic (AIP), Ilio-inguinal and Kocher-Langenbeck, as described below. The extended Ilio-femoral approach is now very rarely used, due to the significant soft tissue disruption it entails and the prolonged rehabilitation that results. It is however the only approach that allows direct exposure of both columns.          Window 1 – Lateral to iliopsoas and the femoral nerve. Window 2 – Medial to iliopsoas and the femoral nerve, lateral to the femoral sheath. Window 3 – Lateral to the spermatic cord or round ligament, medial to the femoral sheath.        The majority of displaced acetabular fractures are treated operatively with internal fixation. The goal of treatment is to give patients a congruent hip joint with sufficient stabilization of fracture fragments to allow early range of movement while preserving soft tissues. Criteria for non-operative treatment include lack of patient fitness (due to the associated injuries or pre-existing co-morbidities) and soft tissues compromise around the hip (therefore inappropriate for surgical incisions). The significant time required for these conditions to settle may be so long that the healing fracture cannot then be reduced and fixation is therefore unlikely to be successful. Fractures older than 3 weeks are unlikely to reduce anatomically or have a good result. Non-operative treatment may also be considered where there are displaced fractures but with an intact weight-bearing dome. This was originally described through the use of roof arc angles of 45 degrees on each of the AP, obturator and iliac oblique radiographs. Some associated both columns fractures may be treated non-operatively when they display secondary congruence. These are displaced fractures but as no articular fragments are connected to the axial skeleton they can move with the femoral head, the joint remaining almost perfectly congruent. However, the fragments may displace enough that there is significant shortening of the limb or medialization of the femoral head resulting in reduced range of movement and impingement. In this situation reduction and fixation is preferred. Dislocated hips, with or without fracture, are a surgical emergency [ Fixation of acetabular fractures uses similar techniques to those used elsewhere in the skeleton. If possible, fragments are anatomically reduced, compressed with lag screws and held with neutralization plates [ Areas of articular surface that have been crushed and deformed at the edge of a fracture line (marginal impaction) need to be elevated and supported [ Fractures that are amenable to closed reduction, or are undisplaced, may be suitable for percutaneous screw fixation. Even with fluoroscopy this technique poses significant challenges to ensure accurate reduction and accurate screw placement, avoiding intra-articular penetration. Open reduction remains the most reliable treatment in most hands. Acetabular fractures in older patients, or those with pathological bone, may involve extensive crushing and fragmentation of the articular surface. This is often visualized on radiographs as a double concavity in the weight-bearing dome or ‘seagull sign’ [ Rehabilitation following acetabular fractures is often complicated by the associated injuries. If possible, early range of movement exercises should be undertaken to reduce stiffness and thromboembolic risk. Weight-bearing is usually restricted, typically to non- or touch-weight bearing for 6 weeks followed by a further 6 weeks partial weight-bearing. Acetabular fractures may be associated with other injuries that influence their management. Rarely, a hip dislocation may result in a fracture of the acetabulum (usually a posterior wall fracture) and the femoral head (Pipkin IV) [ Acetabular fractures associated with femoral shaft or femoral neck fractures may also be challenging. It is essential that the treatment of the femoral fracture does not compromise later acetabular reconstruction. Antegrade nailing of femoral fractures may result in a wound which compromises the approach required for acetabular fixation. Hence other methods of femoral fracture fixation, such as retrograde nailing or plate fixation, may be considered if acetabular fixation is also required. Antegrade nailing should only be done after discussion with the pelvic surgeon who will be treating the acetabular fracture. In these circumstances the incidence of HO is increased, though infection is not. High-energy, intra-capsular femoral neck fractures associated with acetabular fractures are complex injuries. They are often comminuted and require prompt, accurate reduction, which will often need to be open. The risk of AVN and non-union is significant. Fixation may be performed by extending the approach for acetabular fixation. Fractures of the acetabulum may be associated with pelvic ring disruptions. The treatment of each injury is on its merits but approaches and fixation techniques may be combined to treat both injuries at the same time. Periprosthetic acetabular fractures are relatively rare. These can either be early or late. Early fractures occur at the time of surgery i.e. when impacting an uncemented cup. Late fractures are a result of acute trauma in the presence of a well-functioning implant, or when bone has been weakened by failing implants. Minimally displaced, early fractures may be treated with protected weight-bearing if the cup remains stable. Complications in acetabular fractures may be as a result of the injury or the treatment. Bleeding from acetabular fractures is usually significant but rarely life threatening in isolation. Displaced fractures near the greater sciatic notch may lacerate the superior gluteal vessels and arterial injury may rarely require embolization. Blood loss at surgery can be large and the use of cell salvage has been advocated as a cost effective treatment, particularly in the treatment of associated fracture patterns. Nerve injury resulting from initial trauma usually affects the peroneal branch of the sciatic nerve (incidence of up to 30%). Heterotopic ossification results from muscle damage due to the injury or subsequent surgery. The extensive muscle stripping performed in extensile approaches made HO commonplace and is one of the reasons these approaches are now rarely used. Careful soft tissues handling, haemostasis and excision of damaged muscle (particularly gluteus minimus) are techniques used to limit HO. Prophylaxis for HO, using either indomethacin or radiotherapy, has been used, particularly in high risk cases such as extensile approaches. Although, it has been suggested that radiotherapy is more effective than indomethacin, Deep vein thrombosis is common following acetabular fractures, with an incidence of proximal DVT up to 34%. Patients with acetabular fractures often have multiple injuries, which may influence and confound outcome measures, making assessment of outcome difficult. Outcomes pertinent to the hip include hip scores, radiographic grading (osteoarthritis, AVN) or survivorship of the native hip joint. Matta reported 79% survivorship of the native hip in 816 acetabular fractures treated with internal fixation between 2 and 20 years. Fractures of the acetabulum are challenging in all respects. They are often associated with other significant injuries. They have complex classification systems based on difficult imaging. Operative treatment involves difficult exposures and technically demanding reduction and fixation. Poor results are likely if the reduction is not anatomical. The goals of treatment should be to give the patient a congruent, functional hip whilst minimizing the complications from both the injury and surgery. Surgical fixation should be performed in specialist centres.  Criteria for non-operative treatment Patient unfit or unwilling to undergo surgery <2 mm displacement with congruent hip Posterior wall fracture involving <20% wall height, or 20–50% wall height without dynamic instability Intact roof arcs Secondary congruence in associated both columns fracture  Management of traumatic hip dislocation Documentation of sciatic nerve function pre- and post-reduction Urgent closed reduction Application of skeletal traction if unstable Urgent discussion with specialist if new sciatic nerve palsy after reduction or irreducible closed Post-reduction CT to look for incarcerated fragments in hip joint  Surgical complications Bleeding Vascular injury Neurological injury Visceral injury (bladder & bowel) Compartment syndrome (secondary to vascular compromise) Soft tissue compromise & wound problems Infection Deep vein thrombosis/Pulmonary embolus Heterotopic ossification
