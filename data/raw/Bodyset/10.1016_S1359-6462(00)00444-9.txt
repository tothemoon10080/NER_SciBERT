Extensive researches have been made on the development of high damping alloys such as Mn-Cu A Co-32%Ni alloy was prepared using a high frequency induction furnace in a vacuum atmosphere. The chemical composition of the alloy is listed in The Co-32%Ni alloy subjected to quenching into water at room temperature and subzero-treatment at −196°C was cold-rolled at −140°C up to 30% in reduction of thickness for further increase of ϵ martensite content through stress-induced martensite transformation. The optical microstructures of the deformed alloy are shown in  In order to clarify the reason why the damping capacity is deteriorated with the increase in stress-induced ϵ martensite content, the hardness and TEM microstructure was investigated with respect to deformation degree. Taking The influence of deformation on microstructure and damping capacity of a Co-32%Ni alloy was investigated and the obtained results are summarized as follows. During deformation, only stress-induced α→ϵ martensitic transformation occurs and no additional phases except for α and ϵ are produced in Co-32%Ni alloy. When the Co-32%Ni alloy is deformed at −140°C, the damping capacity decreases in spite of the increase in ϵ martensite volume fraction. This result is caused by the fact that lattice defects (dislocations) introduced during deformation inhibit the movement of damping sources such as stacking fault boundaries and α/ϵ interfaces.
