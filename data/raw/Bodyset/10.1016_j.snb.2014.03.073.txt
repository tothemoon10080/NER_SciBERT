WO3 nanoigloos decorated with Ag-, Pd-, and Au nanoparticles are fabricated by soft-template method and self-agglomeration of metal films. The responses of WO3 nanoigloos decorated with metal nanoparticles to various gases such as NO2, CH3COCH3, C2H5OH, and H2 are much higher than those of bare WO3 nanoigloos. According to the surface decoration, WO3 nanoigloos show significantly different behaviors in the response enhancement, revealing that Pd-decorated WO3 nanoigloos exhibit the highest response to H2 together with fast response time to H2, C2H5OH, and CH3COCH3 (below 10s), Au-decorated WO3 nanoigloos exhibit the highest response to NO2. The catalytic effect of Ag is relatively weaker than Pd and Au nanoparticles, however, it exhibit the fastest response time to NO2. These are attributed to not only the varied catalytic activities of the metal nanoparticles, but also the different work function energies of them. Our results show that highly sensitive and selective WO3 nanoigloos decorated with metal nanoparticles can be an effective platform to fabricate an electronic nose for the further application of semiconducting metal oxide gas sensors.Chemiresistive gas sensors are of great interest due to their diverse applications including detection of pollutant, transportation industries, fossil fuel combustion control, medical diagnosis, artificial olfaction, and homeland security In this study, in order to compare the role of various noble metal catalysts for diverse gases such as NO Pt/Ti (150/30 SEM micrographs according to fabrication procedure of noble metal-decorated WO The microstructure and crystallinity of Pd-, Ag-, and Au-decorated WO   In order to precisely investigate the effects of Pd, Ag, and Au decoration in responses to the gases, the increase ratio of response ( Two sensitization mechanisms such as electronic and chemical sensitizations are involved in the response enhancement by Pd, Ag and Au In this background, the role of Pd and Au NPs for NO For practical applications, gas sensors should work reliably during long-term and repetitive operation. Also they should detect low concentrations of a target gas below the threshold limit value (TLV) or the lower explosion limit (LEL).
