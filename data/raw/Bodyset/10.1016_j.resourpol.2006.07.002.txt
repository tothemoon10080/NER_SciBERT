In the real option pricing model of valuation and decision making, the estimation of future volatility is a key input parameter. For traded commodities or financial assets, past volatility is used as a proxy for predictions. But, for projects, this approach is not feasible because, in most cases, historical data of traded projects are not available. As an alternate solution, it is usually assumed that project volatility is equal to that of commodity price. In order to investigate this assumption, we estimate the project volatility considering that both commodity price and operating cost evolve as a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). Results of a hypothetical gold mining project indicate that project volatility is higher than that of commodity price and it only drops to price volatility under very unrealistic industry conditions, such as very high prices or very low production costs. In addition, we find that project volatility is independent of production capacity and taxation, but depends on increments in price and cost, as well as strongly on their degree of correlation.More realistic valuation and decision making of most modern investments in projects can be carried out according to real option pricing, as argued by Current value of the project's cash flow ( Present value of the investment's cash flow ( Future risk-free interest rate ( Real option maturity ( Future dividend rate of the project's cash flow ( Future volatility of the project's cash flow ( Among these input parameters, future volatility, which is defined as the standard deviation of the rate of return of an asset is by far the most critical parameter of option pricing models. In the classical model, volatility is constant, but this may not be the case for long-lived assets, as discussed by Apart from its role in option pricing, the knowledge of future volatility allows producers and consumers to anticipate and take actions against undesired fluctuations of commodity prices and also to quantify the risk involved in each decision. Just to give a quantitative example of the mineral industry, the annual average volatility of selected metal prices over the period of 1998–2000 The estimation of past volatility of financial assets comes from historical data and may be used as a proxy of their future volatility. But this approach presents three main drawbacks when applied directly to project volatility estimation, including mine projects: (i) there are no recorded historical data values of traded projects; (ii) projects are different, since they have their own technical and financial characteristics; (iii) mineral projects are distinct, even in the case of two projects to produce the same commodity. For these reasons, in many cases, researchers such as The assumption of volatility of projects equal to that of commodity prices may be correct in two special cases: The project value is a linear function of commodity price. But, in most real cases, project value is a non-linear function due to effects of grade heterogeneities, fixed costs and taxation that take place in majority of the mineral projects. The correlation between commodity price and operating cost is positive and equal to 100%. In the long run at the industry level, price and cost may be perfectly correlated Alternatively, In this paper, we develop a model to estimate the volatility of projects that takes into account not only price, but also other components of cash flows such as operating cost, taxation, inflation, etc., as well as the correlation coefficient between components of cash flow. The main assumptions of the model are: (i) commodity price and operating cost are uncertain variables and evolve over time as GBM; (ii) commodity price and operating cost are correlated. Other cash flow variables are assumed to be known with some degree of certainty. The model of this paper will show that under these assumptions the volatility of projects is at least equal to the volatility of commodity price. This paper is organized as follows. Section ‘Some characteristics of mining projects’ describes some characteristics of mining projects. Section ‘A model to estimate the volatility of mineral projects’ presents the proposed model to estimate project volatility considering that commodity price and operating cost evolve as a GBM. Section ‘The volatility of a gold mine project and its implications in strategic decision making’ contains a numerical example using a hypothetical gold mine. Section ‘Conclusions’ shows the main conclusions and remarks. The return of investment in mining industry is risky because of uncertainties in orebody tonnage, grade, commodity price, taxation, environmental liabilities, etc. Among the industrial grouping of Fortune Magazine's annual list of the 500 largest firms ( Some reasons for this heavy presence of risk in mining projects are discussed in High capital intensity Long preproduction periods, which are caused by a number of factors, such as drilling and sampling of the orebody, financing liabilities, taxation, environmental constraints, technological innovation, etc., so that it may take periods ranging from 4 to 12 years to start-up production. Great exposure due to maturity time, geological factors, engineering parameters, macroeconomic conditions and political framework. The market risk is one of prime importance, especially in cases where transactions take place worldwide, but the concentration of the mineral is limited to few places. The stock of mineral resource is finite and the mine life is merely the length of time necessary to extract the orebody. The risk of changes in taxation rules is present in the return on mine investment in most nations, since there is a widespread understanding that mineral deposits are a kind of natural heritage to all mankind, not to private companies. The structure of investment analysis in mine investment is complex and interrelated. The geological risk is mostly concerned with orebody tonnage or volume. But ore is defined as the mineral mass or volume that can be extracted at a profit. Profit, in turn, depends on plant capacity, production cost and commodity price, among other variables. Since price and cost vary continuously over time, extractable ore tonnage or volume will change accordingly, although the physical stock of available ore decreases over time as production keeps on. This interaction among different variables generally makes the mine investment analysis much more complex than that of other investments. The first step is the estimation and validation of the geological model used to estimate the orebody's volume or physical stock of the mineral. The second step is the definition of the mine size or production rate, which, in turn, depends on the volume of mineral deposit. The operating cost depends on the production rate—the greater the production, the lower the production costs. The cutoff depends on the cost/price ratio, but, in turn, the operating cost depends on the mine size, production rate and ore quality, among other determinants. Unlike the concept of ore, grade ( Consider an investment in a gold mine project whose current value (               The first assumption is that the dynamics in For a finite mine project, having a constant production rate, the expected present value of future operational cash flow is (see On the other hand, if management has the flexibility to wait some time (at least four years) before taking the decision and choose the best moment to implement an action, the correct value of the investment opportunity is according to real option pricing theory, as described in These equations of valuation (5 and 6) and decision rule (7) require three main input parameters: (i) the volatility of the present value of the project's value cash flow ( In order to apply the model to estimate the volatility of mine projects, consider an open-pit gold mine project with expected value of technical, economic and financial parameters such as those presented in In The correlation between price and cost is assumed to be 0.8 as a first approximation, but, in fact, it may be any number between −1 and +1. Shortly, the problem of correlation will be addressed further with some details. The volatility of gold price ( A cash flow economic analysis shows that the Present value of the underlying project from future cash flow: Present value of the investment: Future risk-free interest rate: Future dividend rate of the project: The other parameter is the future volatility of the project's rate of return. Putting the data of In The volatility value of future cash flows depends on the difference between cash in and cash out. From Eq. The estimation of correlation between Since correlation is important, in As seen in Although the case of In practice, the correlation of gold The volatility of project is sensitive to the increase operating cost or decrease in commodity price. This may be the case of cost inflation and depression of gold demand. For the base case considering again that volatility of project is equal to that of price ( An increase in operating cost will increase the value of volatility of project, Results presented in Now, we are ready to evaluate the impact of underestimation or overestimation of In On the other hand, the value of investment opportunity is a non-linear function of The impact of volatility of project is very important for valuation and decision rule. If As discussed previously, the trigger value or optimal investment decision rule ( A negative correlation between This paper has criticized the use of volatility of commodity price as a proxy for projects, arguing that usually the volatility of commodities is lower than that of projects. But what is the error caused in the opportunity to invest? As the present value of project increases, the error also raises, reaching a peak of US$ 14.8 million if present value of project is US$ 200 million. After this value, the error diminishes and goes to zero if present value of project is above US$ 440 million. This behavior of the error reinforces the importance of good estimates of project volatility, especially when the option to invest is just at-the-money. There are two extreme cases: If present value of project is much less than US$ 150 million, the If present value of project is much higher than US$ 150 million and it is sufficiently high ( In both extreme cases, if the analyst assumes that If If Perfect positive correlation between Very high cost or low price, which seldom happens in the real world. Unrealistic case of absence of uncertainty in Finally, we can say that the common assumption used by This paper has focused on project volatility estimation and implications in valuation and investment decision making. Different from volatility estimation of financial assets, the volatility of projects depends not only on the dynamics in commodity price and operating cost, but also on their correlation and entire structure of cash flows. If the correlation between the price and costs is higher ( The common assumption that The authors would like to thank FAPESP, CAPES, Center for Petroleum Studies—CEPETRO, and CNPq for the financial support of this research and the suggestions and helpful comments from an anonymous referee in earlier version of this paper.
