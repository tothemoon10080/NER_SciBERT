In 1997 a pneumatic flotation unit went into operation at the Lohberg/Osterfeld hard coal preparation plant of DSK (Deutsche Steinkohle AG, Herne). Compared to earlier units in Germany the aerating reactor has been modified. The modified aerator uses the kinetic energy of the slurry to suck air into the reactor. The unit is designed to process 750 m3/h of slurry at an average solids concentration of 80Â±20 kg/m3. The two-stage unit comprises a rougher and a scavenger stage with a 67 m3 separating vessel each.
                  A series of plant investigations have been carried out in order to optimize the operating conditions and to increase unit efficiency. To accelerate the testwork the experiments were set up as a series of fractional factorial experiments. A detailed discussion of the experimental designs and their development is given. The results are presented. Various parameters that could not be controlled within the experimental set-up but show marked effects on process results are discussed and the benefit of statistical experimental designs for the interpretation of the results of plant investigations is shown.
