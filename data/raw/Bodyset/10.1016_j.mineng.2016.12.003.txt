The influence of temperature on bioleaching of a copper-silver concentrate of a black shale-ore was observed at 30, 48 and 76°C. Post-leach residues’ weights and copper contents decreased with increase in leaching temperature while the iron contents increased through more iron precipitation. A designed, incremental increase in the concentration of copper in solution resulted in Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans replacing a species of Acidithiomicrobium as the dominant iron-and mineral sulfide-oxidizing strain in the mixed culture used at 48°C. The temperature of bioleaching influenced the hydrometallurgical extraction of silver from post-leach residues. Thiosulfate was most effective with a high temperature bioleach residue while ferric chloride and copper/ammonium/thiosulfate was most effective with a low temperature bioleach residue.Extensive research and development of the use of microorganisms to extract base metals from mineral sulfide concentrates has led to only a few industrial scale demonstrations or operations: this partly reflects a lack of economic competitiveness, technical disadvantages of long residence times in bioreactors and, where chalcopyrite is present, incomplete copper extraction. Increased copper yields and concentrate dissolution rates can be achieved with cultures of moderately thermophilic bacteria ( The most useful moderately thermophilic bacteria for mineral sulfide oxidation appear to be species of Acidithiomicrobium and Some different extraction reagents were used to assess the influence of bioleaching temperature on availability of silver in post-leach residues to hydrometallurgical extraction. There has been little discussion previously of effects of bioleaching temperature on further downstream processing of post-bioleach residues in an industrial context, except with regard to the presence of sulfur compounds and their influence on cyanidation following biooxidation ( Hot HCl/HNO Cultures which had been maintained with pyrite as substrate for many years were grown with 1% (w/v) Lubin concentrate through several serial subcultures before use in leaching tests. The culture of mesophilic bacteria used at 30 Two mixed cultures of moderate thermophiles were used. One was used previously in laboratory reactors processing a nickel sulfide concentrate, in which Acidithiomicrobium strain P2 (then referred to as a novel The high temperature culture of archaea (grown at 75–80 Cultures were grown at 30, 48 and 76 Two mixed cultures of moderate thermophiles (Section Microorganisms were identified from sequences of 16S rRNA genes essentially as described previously ( The concentrate was leached with ferric iron at 70 Samples of post-bioleach residues (0.25 Leaching of the concentrate was observed at 30, 48 and 76 A mass balance of copper in solutions and residues after leaching gave between 90 and 95% recovery of the added copper, the apparent loss due to replacement of sample aliquots with medium during leaching. Analysis of final residues indicated over 98% copper extraction at the higher temperatures and an increase in silver concentration compared to that of the solid feed at all temperatures, consistent with approximately 1 The copper concentration in the medium was increased incrementally through serial cultures in air-lift reactors ( Two moderately thermophilic archaea were identified from 16S rRNA gene sequences. The first sequence was identical to that of a strain isolated in 1996 from a commercial gold/arsenopyrite-processing bioreactor (Fairview, South Africa; noted in Potential longer term adaptation of Acidithiomicrobium strain P2 to higher concentrations of copper was examined through exposure to copper during one year of regular serial culturing (over twenty serial cultures in each of three separate culture lines in shaken flasks with pyrite as substrate in the presence of copper at 3, 7 or 9 At the higher temperatures of bioleaching, despite increased precipitation of iron compounds, there was a greater decrease in solids, reflected in more copper extraction and greater acidity, presumably from more sulfide/sulfur oxidation. There was an almost threefold enrichment of iron in the residue from 70 The efficiency of silver extraction from post-bioleach residues by a particular procedure depended on the temperatures at which residues were produced ( A ferric iron-leached residue (in the absence of microorganisms) was produced for comparison with the high temperature bioleach residue ( A mineralogical analysis of the residues produced at high temperature was not performed but, in whatever form, silver essentially remained in residues during bioleaching and during the efficient ferric sulfate leaching of copper. Some precipitation of jarosite or similar compounds in the relatively sulfate-rich culture medium and ferric sulfate leach solutions could have trapped silver as argentojarosite in a process that can increase with temperature ( None of the procedures was particularly effective with the residue produced by the moderately thermophilic bacteria suggesting the mid-range temperature of bioleaching could reduce silver availability through a combination of factors. In practice therefore, an optimization of the PLINT Process with hot brine leaching (  Moderately thermophilic bacteria could be the most useful focus of further research and process development for bioleaching mixed copper sulfide concentrates similar to the Lubin concentrate, unless a stable, continuous leaching process with the potentially more effective (but high solids intolerant) high temperature archaea can be demonstrated. Of two of the potentially most useful mineral sulfide-oxidizing, moderately thermophilic bacteria for bioleaching base metal concentrates, The temperature of bioleaching of the copper-silver concentrate influenced the availability of silver in post-leach residues to some potential hydrometallurgical recovery process extractants. Thiosulfate was most effective with a high temperature bioleach residue, ferric chloride and copper/ammonium/thiosulfate were most effective with a low temperature bioleach residue. Silver was partially extracted by all of the reagents with residue produced at an intermediate temperature with moderately thermophilic bacteria, but none was as effective as the best reagents with residues from either lower or higher temperature bioleaching.
