This paper reviews the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for cyclone modelling on three-dimensional unstructured meshes using both the Reynolds Stress Turbulence model and Large Eddy Simulation. Results of the subsequent numerical simulations show consistent agreement compared with Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements at a series of axial stations throughout the length of a Stairmand high efficiency cyclone.
