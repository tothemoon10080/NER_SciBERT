The leaching kinetics of Tang-dan refractory low grade complex copper ore was investigated in ammonia-ammonium chloride solution. The concentration of ammonia and ammonium chloride, the ore particle size, the solid-to-liquid ratio and the temperature were chosen as parameters in the experiments. The results show that temperature, concentration of ammonia and ammonium chloride have favorable influence on the leaching rate of copper oxide ores. But, leaching rate decreases with increasing particle size and solid-to-liquid ratio. The leaching process is controlled by the diffusion of the lixiviant and the activation energy is determined to be 23.279 kJ/mol. An equation was also proposed to describe the leaching kinetics.
