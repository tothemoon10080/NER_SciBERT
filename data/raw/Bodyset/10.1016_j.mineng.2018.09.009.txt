The effects of multiple parameters on COD reduction were evaluated in detail using polymeric ferric sulphate as coagulant, polyacrylamide as flocculant, granular activated carbon as adsorbent as well as H2O2 and FeSO4·7H2O as Fenton reagents. Results showed that the adsorption and Fenton processes can effectively reduce the COD of tailings dam wastewater (TDW

                     ) from 183 mg/L to 51.9 mg/L and 50.0 mg/L, respectively, thereby satisfying the requirement of the emission standard (COD < 100 mg/L). The CF process is limited to reducing the dissolved COD in TDW and cannot meet the emission standards. Cost evaluation analysis showed that the cost of the adsorption process (3.57 US$/m3) was much higher than that of the Fenton process (0.35 US$/m3). Therefore, the Fenton process should be used in subsequent pilot experiments and industrial experiments. This study provided fundamental support for selecting an optimal technique in MPW treatment for practical applications to ensure the sustainable development of mines and environmental protection.Many types of industrial wastewater are produced with industrial development. These wastewaters usually contain a variety of pollutants ( Minerals processing wastewater (MPW) is an important part of industrial wastewater ( A number of studies have been reported using coagulation–flocculation (CF) ( CF is a relatively simple physical–chemical technique that may be successfully used for the treatment of industrial wastewater and is especially effective in removing suspended solids and colour from wastewater. O.S. Amuda and A. Alade investigated the treatment of abattoir wastewater that used alum, ferric chloride and ferric sulphate to achieve TSS and TP removal efficiencies of 65% and 32% respectively ( Adsorption is a process by which a substance is transferred from the liquid phase to the surface of a solid. The adsorption mechanisms between adsorbents and adsorbates are physisorption, chemisorption and/or ion exchange adsorption ( For the Fenton process, Fe Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate and compare the performance of the CF, adsorption and Fenton processes on the reduction of COD from MPW with the goal to reach the legal limits of release into natural waters (specifically COD < 100 mg/L). In the CF process, the effect of PFS dosage on COD reduction was studied. In the adsorption process, the effect of contact time, pH and GAC dosage on COD reduction were studied. In the Fenton process, the effects of reaction time, reaction pH, H Wastewater samples were collected from the Chaishan Tailings Dam in Shizhuyuan Mine, China. Samples were collected from the pulp inlet of the tailings dam and taken every two hours, over a total of eight hours a day, for three consecutive days. The samples were mixed together, thereby can ensuring that the sample used in the experiments was more representative. The time interval could represent the mineral processing conditions present during each month in the plant. The pulp samples were put into a sealed plastic bucket and settled for 8 h. Then, the clear liquid denoted as TDW was collected for the subsequent experiments. The TDW was colourless and had no visible suspended solids. Various chemical reagents were used in the minerals flotation process, and the underutilized reagents left in the wastewater led to a high COD. All of the COD is in the form of dissolved organic matter. However, determining the residual reagents quantitatively is difficult in our current conditions. The chemical compositions of the TDW are shown in Hydrogen peroxide (H The pH tests were performed using the jar test, in which 150 ml of the TDW was poured into each jar and placed on a magnetic stirrer (85-2, Changzhou Putian Instrument Manufacturing Co. Ltd., China). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). pH of the TDW varied from 2 to 12 and was adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid. After 5 min of stirring, 2 ml of the TDW was removed for COD analysis. Experiments were performed in conventional jar tests at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). A total of 150 ml of the TDW was added to a jar placed on a magnetic stirrer, followed by the addition of PFS at a desirable dose (100–2000 mg/L). Then, the mixture was stirred for 5 min. After the stirring was completed, 2 ml of the mixture was withdrawn for the COD analysis and the result was denoted COD Adsorption experiments were performed in a batch mode by using different doses of GAC with 80 ml of the TDW in 150 ml of a conical flask and then shaken on a rotary shaker (SHA-82A, Changzhou Putian Instrument Manufacturing Co. Ltd., China) at 140 rpm at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). Adsorption studies were performed with the pH ranging from 2 to 12.33, the GAC dose varied from 0.5g/L to 20g/L, and the contact time varied from 5 to 120 min. After the adsorption, the mixture was allowed to settle for 2 h. After the settling period, the supernatant was withdrawn for COD analysis. Batch experiments were carried out in 200 ml beakers at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). The pH value of the TDW was adjusted using sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. A total of 150 ml of the TDW was added to a beaker placed on a magnetic stirrer, followed by the addition of a certain amount of H The pH was monitored using a pH meter (PHB-4, Inesa, China). The COD was measured using international standards (e.g. “Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater”) ( In the Fenton process, the residual hydrogen peroxide has interference on the COD test. Some researchers added MnO pH has an important effect on the treatment of wastewater. Can-Zeng et al. found that multiple dye wastewater with a pH > 3 was favourable for CF treatment ( In this study, we used PFS as coagulant to treat the TDW. Contact time is an important parameter to determine the equilibrium time. A longer contact time ensures improved contact between the pollutants and adsorbents, which leads to higher removal of the pollutants ( The pH is an important parameter that affects the adsorption characteristics. It determines the surface charge of the adsorbent and the degree of ionization and speciation of the adsorbate ( The effect of the adsorbent dose on the adsorption of pollutants has been widely reported in the literature ( Fe The reaction time is an important parameter that affects the wastewater treatment capacity of wastewater treatment plants. The shorter the reaction time, the higher the corresponding treatment capacity. The results ( Reaction pH is an important factor that affects the efficiency of the Fenton process. As shown in The COD reduction efficiency of the Fenton process is related closely to the amount of Fe  In practical operations, the tailings dam generates approximately 20,000 m For the adsorption process: The calculation methodology of the costs of the Fenton process is similar with that of the adsorption process. This study shows that the adsorption and Fenton processes can effectively reduce the COD of TDW from 183 mg/L to 51.9 mg/L and 50.0 mg/L respectively, and meet the requirements of the emission standard (COD < 100 mg/L). The CF process is limited in reducing the dissolved COD in TDW and cannot meet the emission standards. In the CF process, COD In the adsorption process, equilibrium is reached when the contact time is 5 min and a low pH is beneficial to reduce the COD. An increase in the GAC dose is beneficial for the reduction of COD because of the increased surface areas and adsorption sites. In the Fenton process, COD Finally, the adsorption process (3.57 US$/m This research was supported by the
