A generalized expression for estimating the solubility or air gases (oxygen, nitrogen and argon) in saline solutions at atmospheric pressure is presented. The generalization is done for the Henry's constant (to consider the effect of temperature) and for the Setschenow parameter (to consider the effect of salt content in the solution), in terms of the acentric factor, the temperature, and the salinity expressed as the total content of salt. Accurate correlation and prediction of gas solubility is important in various scientific and technological fields and for the design of separation equipment in the chemical and mining-related industries. As a measure of the accuracy of the generalized model, the average deviation, the absolute average deviation and the maximum absolute deviation between correlated and experimental data are evaluated. The proposed model give absolute deviations lower than 1% with some few exceptions, and maximum deviations are always below 4%.The solubility of air gases in seawater and saline water solutions has been matter of analysis and study for many years, in several areas of knowledge such as oceanography, geochemistry, limnology, biology Air is formed mainly by nitrogen (~ Solubility of gases is needed to analyze gas hydrate formation Data on solubility of oxygen, nitrogen and argon in water and saline solutions have been reported in the literature and several sets of data are available. However, for repetitive calculations in design, modeling and process simulation, mathematical models that allow estimating the solubility at any salinity and any temperature (between the operating ranges of the process of interest) are preferred. Empirical and semi-empirical models have been proposed for estimating the solubility of gases in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity but general equations have not been proposed. The effect of the temperature is usually based on the Van't Hoff equation Pressure also affects solubility of gases and should be taken into account when the pressure varies in wide ranges. The effect of pressure on solubility has been well described in the literature and an approximate equation has been proposed by Krichevsky and Kasarnovsky The data available in the literature on solubility of air gases in saline solutions, the chosen data for analysis and the numerical method (optimization by regression analysis) constitute the main materials and methods described in this section. Solubility of gases in water and saline solutions has been reported in terms of the Henry's Law constant H (bar), the Bunsen solubility coefficient B (mL/L) or the gas solubility x (mol/kg). The Bunsen coefficient is defined as the volume of gas (at 1 Kennan and Pollack Several authors have proposed different models to correlate and to predict the solubility of gases in saline solutions. The rigorous approach based on the fundamental equation of phase equilibrium, that is the equality of fugacities of each component in each phase, has been used Garcia and Gordon The In solubility problems, the fundamental equation of phase equilibrium for the component in low composition (called the solute) defined as the equality of fugacities of the solute in both phases ( However, experimental observations indicate that a somewhat different procedure (but based on the fundamental equation) is more convenient when dealing with gases dissolved in liquids. The observation is that at low concentration of a given component (the solute), the fugacity of that component in the liquid phase In this equation, It is clear from this definition that Henry's constant depends on temperature and pressure, since the fugacity of the solute in the liquid phase depends on temperature and pressure. The dependency of H The second term on the right hand side of Eq. Within the ranges of solubility of air gases in aqueous solutions considered in this study (from 0.001 to 0.005 Also, the fugacity The effects of temperature and salinity seem to be more complex and therefore a simple perturbation procedure is not appropriate. If one analyzes the influence of temperature at constant salinity or the influence of salinity at constant temperature one can observe some especial peculiarities that explain why generalization is not a straightforward procedure. The As known, values of Henry's law constants for aqueous salt solutions depend on the composition and concentration of the solution. In general, the solubility of a gas decreases with increasing salinity (phenomenon known as salting out effect). However, the solubility could increase with increasing salinity (phenomenon known as salting in effect) The effect of salinity on the solubility of a gas in a salt solution is usually expressed through the Setschenow Eq. In this equation, k In this equation, H As indicated in A systematic study on the approximate representation of a function by rational fractions led the French mathematician Henri Padé to develop a method nowadays known as Padé approximants. These approximants have been used in several areas of science and engineering such as statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and estimation of physical properties Padé approximants are rational functions in which the numerator is a polynomial Q In Eq. The simplest Padé of a function of a single variable, F(z), is that in which the polynomials Q and R are of first order, as follows: This is one of the main models explored in this work to represent the temperature effect on both the Henry's constant and on the Setschenow parameter. Based on the specific models presented in the literature ( Different expressions for F The parameters of the model were obtained by regression analysis of experimental solubility data as described in The accuracy of the models was checked by determining the relative and absolute deviations between the calculated values of the solubility and the experimental data. Four cases are considered to cover several situations of modeling and analysis: The results for the correlation of the solubility “x” are organized in tables in which three statistical parameters are shown: the average relative deviation (%Δx), the average absolute deviation %|Δx The relative average deviation (%Δx) indicates how the results are dispersed around the experimental data while the average absolute deviation (|%Δx Solubility of air gases in pure water. The data available for the solubility of air gases in pure water was first analyzed using several models, including classical polynomial expressions commonly used in the literature, as those shown in Henry-Setschenow equation with Henry's constant for pure water (from In this study case the results obtained in the first case are used following Setschenow's ideas. This means that the effect of salinity at a given temperature is simply the addition of a linear function of salinity to LnH. This suggests a kind of perturbation theory in which the value of the Henry's constant is perturbed by another variable in an independent way: Other authors have found that Setschenow parameter k Henry-Setschenow Equation using Mixture data (excluding solubility in pure water). In this study case the same models analyzed in Henry-Setschenow Equation using Mixture data (including solubility in pure water). In this study case the same models analyzed in It must be mentioned that the model chosen as the best model (model C in To solve this and to have a predictive model, the following procedure was followed: (i) of the original 669 data points, 67 points were randomly chosen and were put aside; (ii) with the remaining 602 data points, the parameters of the chosen model (C in The final model, the parameters for this model and the deviations for the correlating and testing steps are shown in  A new generalized model to predict the solubility of air gases in saline solutions is proposed. Oxygen, nitrogen and argon are the gases considered and the saline solutions are mixtures of water with NaCl at several concentration (salinities), expressed in grams of salt per kilogram of mixture. The study and the results allow obtaining three main conclusions: i) the model keeps the simplicity of Henry's law and Setschenow contribution to account for the salinity on the solubility of gases; ii) the solubility of any of the gases can be obtained with good accuracy, giving absolute average deviations below 1.5%; iii) the simple Padé expressions resulted to a good choice for representing the temperature functionality of the Henry's constant and of the Setschenow parameter; and iv) the acentric factor shows to be a good representative parameter to distinguish data for the three different gases;  coefficient in polynomials ( coefficient in Padé expressions ( coefficient in Padé expressions ( Bunsen coefficients Celsius degrees general functions Henry's law constant Henry's law constant with pure water as solvent gas solubility in μmol/kg Kelvin degrees Setschenow constant degree of the numerator and denominator in Padé expression number of points in a data set pressure general Padé expression universal ideal gas constant; 82.06 (atm salinity absolute temperature (K) auxiliary parameter ( temperature in Celsius degrees ( percentage average deviation of solubility average absolute deviation of solubility maximum absolute deviation of solubility fugacity coefficient of the solute in the liquid phase fugacity coefficient of the solute in the gas phase saturation pressure of the solvent coefficients in Padé polynomials in Padé calculated solubility literature value of solubility partial molar volume at infinite dilution  argon atmosphere carbon dioxide equation exponential grams kilogram liters natural logarithm milliliters nitrogen sodium chloride oxygen  summation coefficient in Padé expressions in Eq. acentric factor  calculated literature maximum The authors thank the support of the
