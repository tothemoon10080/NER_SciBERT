The reductive leaching (decomposition) of chalcopyrite was studied in an attempt to find a suitable hydrometallurgical method for copper recovery. A chalcopyrite concentrate was leached under reducing conditions, where metallic iron served as a reductant. The studied parameters include agitation, temperature, particle size, acidity, and reductant and chalcopyrite amounts. The experimental results showed that it is possible to convert the refractory chalcopyrite to a rich copper sulfide (chalcocite), which is amenable to further treatment. The results of kinetic analysis of the leaching data under various experimental conditions indicated a reaction controlled by the solution transport of protons through the product layer, with an activation energy of 33.9 kJ/mol for sulfate media and 22.4 kJ/mol for chloride media. Based on the shrinking core model, the following rate equation was established for sulfate media:

                  The results of the kinetic analysis were utilized in developing a simple process for producing copper super-concentrates. The process still needs further investigation to demonstrate its viability.The hydrometallurgical treatment of copper sulfide concentrates is increasingly establishing itself as a viable route for the extraction of copper and recovery of associated precious metal values. This is attributed to the merits of this route that include suitability for low-grade and complex ores, high recoveries, competitive economics, and other operational features. A quick review of proposed hydrometallurgical treatment methods for chalcopyrite and other copper sulfides Although hydrometallurgy is put forward as a preferred alternative to pyrometallurgy, on the basis of economics and environmental protection, many of the proposed hydrometallurgical methods have the following features: codissolution of copper and iron, extreme conditions of temperature and pressure or very fine grinding of concentrates are required, quantitative yield of elemental sulfur is not achieved, precious metal recovery is difficult and several complex unit operations are needed for a complete flowsheet. These facts explain why hydrometallurgical routes for copper sulfide concentrate treatment have found little commercialization. Virtually all of the copper hydrometallurgical processes under current development use oxidative decomposition of chalcopyrite as the primary method of treatment. An alternate approach to treatment of chalcopyrite would be to perform a reductive decomposition step. This reductive decomposition would in effect transform the chalcopyrite to a much more reactive form (e.g. chalcocite), perhaps allowing further hydrometallurgical treatment of the reduced concentrate. The reductive method allows for the rejection of iron and some sulfur, where a rich copper sulfide (chalcocite) is formed, using a suitable reductant, such as metallic iron. Iron as a reductant has some advantages, including low price, good availability, and full compatibility with the leach solution. Reductive leaching is reported to be an electrochemical process composed of an anodic portion, which is the reductant dissolution, and a cathodic portion which is chalcopyrite reduction, i.e. collapse of its crystal structure. The thermodynamic description of chalcopyrite leaching can be found in Unfortunately, none of these studies resulted in commercial development. Where iron was used as the reductant, published work has been qualitative in nature. It is therefore desirable to understand the physical chemistry of the leaching reaction: We report here the results of such a study with emphasis on kinetic analysis, as was confirmed from chemical and microscopic analysis. Based on the results obtained, a simple process flowsheet is proposed. A chalcopyrite concentrate was obtained from Gibraltar Mine, McLeese Lake, BC, Canada. The detailed chemical analysis of the concentrate (ICP method) is given in The concentrate samples were prepared as follows: the bulk ore was first split by coning and quartering techniques, then a sample weighing around 35 kg was split again using a riffle to obtain a representative sample for the kinetic study. The obtained sample, around 2 kg, was first wet screened to remove extremely fine particles which could bias initial leaching data, followed by rinsing with acetone and/or ethanol to allow fast drying. The remaining sample was then subjected to a careful dry screening into discrete size fractions (monosizing). Desired size fractions were separated and kept under inert atmosphere to be used in the experiments. Unless otherwise specified, particle size used was −100/+200 mesh (−149/+74 μm). All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and were used as received. Analytical grade metallic iron used in the experiments was in powdery form (−600 mesh) and produced by electrolytic reduction. Deionized water was used in the experiments, which were performed under atmospheric pressure. Most of the experiments were done batchwise. The estimated amounts of concentrate and reductant were added to a solution at the required acidity level. The term “stoichiometric” refers to amounts of reactants as per Chemical analysis for iron and copper in the leach solution was done using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Leach residue was digested with bromine-water/aqua-regia mixture and the digestion solution was analyzed for copper and iron. With regard to This procedure was used to simplify the calculations because it was consistent with chemical analysis of leach residue. An alternative to this method is to estimate the amount of hydrogen sulfide generated using gas chromatography, which is beyond the scope of this research.  Many leaching processes for fine particles require agitation to suspend solid particles and allow efficient mixing in the leach solution. Reductive leaching is an electrochemical process that depends on efficient galvanic contact between the solid particles (metal sulfide and reductant). It is therefore possible that excessive agitation may interrupt galvanic contact, and this what was found from the experiments.  Temperature dependence can be used to estimate the apparent activation energy, enthalpy of activation and entropy of activation. It is widely accepted Experiments were performed to study the reaction temperature-dependence, which are summarized in For chemically controlled processes, small increments in temperature usually lead to tremendous enhancement of reaction kinetics. In the present case, the leach kinetics are only mildly affected by temperature. In addition, since leaching kinetics are not greatly affected by agitation speed ( The kinetic equation for reactions controlled by transport through a product layer There is a small discrepancy in the estimated value of activation energy and enthalpy of activation, which is common in most hydrometallurgical systems. It can also be attributed to experimental errors and the theoretical basis of both values. The estimated activation energy for the studied systems lies within the normal range for reactions controlled by a transport process in the product layer The value of enthalpy or energy of activation suggests that heat had to be provided to the leaching solution (that is, by increasing the temperature) to facilitate the reactions. This is evident from the performed experiments where some improvement in reaction kinetics was obtained by increments in temperature Temperature-dependence analysis also gives another important information, which is the required time for complete leaching under different temperatures, but with the same size fraction (−149/+74 μm). Based on the rate constants shown in The other important factor to be studied is the effect of particle size. Determining the proper particle size range is important for economic evaluation because it is directly related to power requirement, residence time in the reaction vessel, or reactor volume, and other ore preparation methods. Depending on the method explained earlier, discrete size fractions were prepared for leaching experiments. The smallest size fraction studied was −44/+38 μm and the results for sulfate and chloride media are summarized in The clear dependence on particle size is common for reactions controlled by a transport process in the product layer, which is perceived from Apparently, fine particles resulted in better conversion or enrichment of chalcopyrite. It can be concluded here that fine particles reduce the tendency of side reactions ( Utilizing the definition of the parabolic leaching rate constant, With these findings in hand, more explanation can be given to the observed behavior at different agitation speeds. According to It is necessary to understand the effect of acid concentration on reaction kinetics since acid is not only consumed in the reductive leach process, but also in the hydrogen evolution side reaction. The acid amount and concentration are directly related to process control (by solid pulp density) and economics. Acid type and concentration also affect the selection of materials of construction. It is not recommended to state an “optimum” acid concentration for leaching because this should be determined in conjunction with all other variables, and is dictated by the particular system. The best thing that can be done is to determine the reaction dependence on hydrogen ion concentration by studying it within some reasonable range (normally 0.1–1.0 M), and use that knowledge in further assessment.  It is clear from the indicated figures that hydrochloric acid is more efficient than sulfuric acid, with stoichiometric additions. This is attributed to the activity of the chloride ion, which will increase the activity of the hydrogen ion. Also, the free chloride ion might play some role in affecting the leaching rates. This is due to the fact that increasing the Cl From  By this analysis, the final forms of the kinetic models are written as: Iron as a reactant is expected to improve the reaction kinetics and increase final conversion of chalcopyrite. Due to the importance of side reactions, it is logical to accept that more than the stoichiometric amount of iron is required for such purposes. The direct effect of iron additions on leaching or chalcopyrite conversion can easily be seen from The effect of chalcopyrite on leaching kinetics is unlikely since the decomposition process is driven by the reductant, which will provide the required electrons, and acid, which will provide the protons, to complete After this detailed analysis of leaching kinetics, it is now appropriate to develop a schematic representation of the leaching process and discuss the possible rate determining steps in the studied systems. A schematic representation of the proposed leaching model is given in As the reaction proceeds, the new solid phase will appear as a product layer, which will cover the solid particles in the system. The exact nature of this layer was examined by SEM/EDX methods, and found to be an enriched copper phase. One analysis of the product layer gave an approximate composition in atomic percent of 61.22 at.% copper, 32.10 at.% sulfur and 6.68 at.% iron. The latter is a clear evidence for the validity of the leaching mechanism and the schematic representation of the leaching process. These results are also in conformance with the reaction stoichiometry and those obtained by wet chemistry methods. The product layer can be said to be thick and porous because reaction rates tend to level off in a short time and the observed nature of the reaction residue (a sintered or compact appearance) supports this argument. It is speculated that the product layer would cover chalcopyrite particles. Since the reaction kinetics are rapid and the chemical analysis of total iron in solution showed that it is the sum of added iron and that released from the chalcopyrite lattice, it can safely be assumed that passivation of iron particles by a product layer did not occur. This is also supported by the fact that no metallic iron was detected in the leach residue. The thick and porous product layer surrounds the CuFeS The nature of the product layer will limit the transport of different species, some of which are important to complete the reaction. It can limit the inward diffusion of protons or the outward diffusion of ferrous or sulfide ions. In the work done in this research, the only step that was proven to be rate determining, from the established leaching models in By these points, with the previous findings of less temperature sensitivity, and large dependence on particle size, it can finally be concluded that this system is controlled by the solution transport of a species or group of species through the product layer. Reductive decomposition of chalcopyrite with metallic iron is possible and this method of leaching can be utilized for the production of copper super-concentrates. Chalcocite is seemingly the new solid product (phase) of the leaching reactions. The results of this study can now be utilized in developing a simple process flowsheet for the production of copper super-concentrates by the method of reductive decomposition. The tentative flowsheet, shown in As can be seen, the flowsheet comprises few unit operations and has five main steps: leaching, solid/liquid separation, washing, iron removal and sulfur recovery. The final product is a copper-rich concentrate, which can further be treated hydrometallurgically or pyrometallurgically, depending on other factors. The flowsheet can be integrated into any existing process. The schematic model in The shrinking core (parabolic leaching) model was selected for fitting the experimental data. Diffusion of hydrogen ions through the product layer is believed to be rate controlling. Analysis of temperature and particle size dependence confirmed the selection of the parabolic leaching models. The fitted models are shown in Leaching kinetics are improved with increasing acid concentration and solution temperature up to a threshold value, while reaction rates are enhanced and final conversion is improved with decreasing initial particle size. Also, the leaching kinetics are much improved by increasing the iron to chalcopyrite molar ratio. The results from the kinetic study show that maximum conversion can be obtained under the following experimental conditions: mild agitation, a temperature of 65 °C, fine particle sizes (smaller than 74 μm), an acid concentration of 0.6 M, addition of twice the stoichiometric iron requirement. stoichiometric factor bulk fluid concentration, or acid concentration effective diffusivity of the fluid in the product layer. In this case, it is a function of molecular diffusivity, porosity, tortuosity, shape factor and roughness. initial particle diameter activation energy (kJ/mol) total iron content in chalcopyrite concentration of iron due to complete metal dissolution hydrogen ion or acid concentration reaction rate constant (min intrinsic parabolic leaching rate constant. initial particle radius ideal gas constant, 8.314 J mol coefficient of determination (a statistical value) fractional conversion with respect to solids (chalcopyrite particles) time recorded temperature (K) particle molar density (chalcopyrite) ratio of metallic iron used in chalcopyrite reduction to total added metallic iron ratio of total dissolved iron in solution at time
