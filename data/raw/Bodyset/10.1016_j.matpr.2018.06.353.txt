Cu-based composites reinforced by MWCNTs were developed by PM route and their microstructure, mechanical properties, sliding wear behaviour and crystallographic texture was investigated. The MWCNTs were synthesized by LPCVD technique and was functionalized using acid modification route. Cu-1, 2 and 3 wt. % MWCNT composites were developed by blending the Cu and MWCNTs powders which were later consolidated under a uniaxial load of 565 MPa and sintered at 850Â°C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. A significant improvement in relative density, microhardness and wear resistance of the composites was observed up to the addition of 2 wt. % of MWCNTs.
