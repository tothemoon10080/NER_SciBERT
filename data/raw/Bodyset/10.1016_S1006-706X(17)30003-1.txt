The interaction mechanism between the combustion products of pulverized coal injected and coke in the raceway of blast furnace was studied through thermodynamic calculation and experiments. The results indicated that additives significantly affected the melting property of coal ash in high temperature zone. Although the unburnt char, raw coal ash, and catalyzed coal ash failed to wet the coke surface, the wettability of the catalyzed coal ash on the coke was greater than that of the raw coal ash. Since the unburnt char had weak reaction with the coke surface, it showed little influence on the surface morphology of the coke. The interaction between the raw coal ash and the coke gave rise to the increase in the pore size on the coke surface. However, the raw coal ash only affected the coke surface and the entrances of the pores owing to its poor fluidity. After being melted, the catalyzed coal ash was expected to immerge into the inside part of the coke and then react with the coke, resulting in an expansion and increase of coke cavities. The raw coal ash and the unburnt char reduced the coke reactivity, while the catalyzed coal ash improved the coke reactivity. Thereinto, the coal ash containing Fe2O3 exhibited a larger influence on the reactivity than that containing CaO.
