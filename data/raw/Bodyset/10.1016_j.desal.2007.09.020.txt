The extraction and transport behaviour of uranium from nitric acid medium across a supported liquid membrane has been studied using di(2-ethylhexyl)isobutyramide as the carrier. The effects of experimental parameters such as nature of diluents, e.g., n-dodecane, benzene, chloroform, tert-butyl benzene, diethyl benzene, n-octanol, 1,2-dichlorbenzene, and 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether, the membrane thickness, and the nitrate ion concentration, on the extraction/transport behaviour of uranium are reported. The experimentally obtained and the theoretically calculated values of permeability coefficients for uranium transport have been compared for different diluents.
