A prospective study was performed on 25 patients (15 women, 10 men) with unstable fractures of the distal radius selectively treated with a dynamic type of external fixation combined with a hydroxyapatite spacer. The fractures ranged from type VI to type VIII according to Frykman's classification. The patients' mean age at surgery was 49 years (range, 19–75 years). The mean follow-up period was 2.5 years, and overall outcome was assessed using Gartland and Werley's demerit point system as modified by Sarmiento. Radial inclination was 26° ± 4° at the time of reduction and 26° ± 5° at follow-up, palmar tilt was 9° ± 2° at reduction and 8° ± 3° at follow-up, and ulnar variance was 1.4 ± 0.6 mm at reduction and 2.1 ± 0.9 mm at follow-up. The mean range of motion at follow-up was 80° ± 10° in flexion, 80° ± 10° in extension, 85° ± 10° in supination, and 80° ± 5° in pronation. The outcome in 24 of 25 patients was evaluated as excellent. In the surgical treatment of unstable fractures of the distal radius using external fixator, the fracture reduction should be supported with bone graft or a bone substitute, and a hydroxyapatite spacer was considered to be a useful substitute for a bone graft.
