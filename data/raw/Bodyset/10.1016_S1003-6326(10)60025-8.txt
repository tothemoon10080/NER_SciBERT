An effectively new technology of extracting vanadium from stone coals by high concentration sulfuric acid was researched. The effect of the concentration of sulfuric acid, leaching temperature, leaching time and helper leaching agent on the extraction of vanadium was explored. The results show that the optimal conditions of extraction are as follows: the concentration of sulfuric acid is 6 mol/L, the ratio of liquid to solid is 3:1; the temperature is 90 °C; the leaching time is 3–5 h, the diameter of the ore particle is less than 180 μm, and the concentration of helper leaching agent R is 6%. Under these conditions, the extraction of vanadium can reach 95.86%.
