Due to rapid sorption of phosphate released by mineralization processes, in most soils net organic P mineralization rates cannot be derived from changes in extractable inorganic P over time. Besides, a mechanistic understanding is only obtained if the individual gross P transformation rates are known. Available techniques for the quantification of gross P transformation rates rely on isotopic dilution principles. To unambiguously analyse the full dynamics and quantify all relevant simultaneously occurring P transformation rates in soil, we developed a numerical 33P tracing model. The tracing model combines a process-based numerical model with a parameter optimization routine to estimate gross P rates. Each rate can follow either zero-order, first-order or Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The tracing model was used to analyse a previously published dataset by Bünemann et al. (2012). The model was able to simulate the observed dynamics. However, gross organic P mineralization rates were lower than previously published. Net organic P mineralization rates tended towards zero, confirming the overriding dominance of microbial immobilization and re-mineralization processes in the studied grassland soil. The P tracing model presented in this study removes the need for the baseline of isotopic dilution due to physicochemical processes. The dynamic 33P tracing model, which takes into account simultaneous dilution and enrichment, presents an important advancement over the conventional estimation of gross P transformations in isotopic dilution experiments.Soil phosphorus (P) is present in inorganic and organic forms, and soil P transformations include physicochemical as well as biological processes ( In isotopic dilution approaches ( The main problem with this approach is the exact determination of microbial P immobilization due to uncertainties associated with a soil-specific correction factor (Kp) which accounts for incomplete recovery of microbial P during fumigation-extraction. Usually, the Kp factor has not been determined and is thus either taken from the literature (0.4, Compared to available analysis methods for soil P dynamics, the numerical methods and approaches to quantify gross N transformation rates are more advanced. Followed on from the dilution method developed by Here, we present the development of a dynamic A prerequisite for the successful application of advanced tracing models are suitable parameter optimization routines that are able to unambiguously determine a large number of parameters. Developments over the last years have shown that optimization routines based on Bayesian theory are particularly useful for parameter identification in tracing models ( The objective of this study was to develop a The dataset used in this study is described in detail by A homogenized sample from each of the four field replicates was labelled with Another subsample from each plot was used in an isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) experiment which was conducted in the presence or absence of a microbial inhibitor (HgCl For extrapolated as well as measured values of The E-value concept is based on the assumption that The conceptual model in this study ( Based on these conceptual ideas, we included two inorganic P pools: a fast inorganic P pool, P We also included two organic P pools (a fast organic P pool, P The model (          Each P pool in the model is defined by a differential equation describing the P transformation rates and an equation describing the associated relative specific activity The simultaneous equations are:   Each P transformation rate, A unique parameter set for each fertilization treatment was optimized for the entire duration of the study. For estimation of the kinetic parameters and thus quantification of the gross P transformation rates we used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which has the potential to simultaneously estimate a large number of parameters. This method has been used successfully to analyse In each iteration of the optimization routine, a new parameter set is tested and compared with the previous one. The change of each parameter is governed by a random step width and direction. After each model run, the misfit ( If the misfit is reduced (i.e. a better fit between the model and observed data is achieved) the new parameter set is accepted. Otherwise, if the misfit is increased, a Likelihood-function For final optimization runs, typically 50,000 iterations are calculated. Three sequences are run in parallel and the Gelman criterion, The initial pool sizes (in mg P kg P P P P P In preliminary model runs, the initial fraction r r r r r The observed data (P The selection of the setup which provided the best results was guided by Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) which takes into account the misfit between observed and modelled data (Eq. The output of the model provides the individual parameter averages ± standard deviations and the associated gross P transformation rates (average ± standard deviation). A correlation matrix is calculated for all parameters. Correlation values ( Based on the actual experimental repetitions, the least significant differences (LSD) between NK and NPK were calculated for each P transformation rate ( To compare the results from our study with studies where only net P transformation rates (e.g. net mineralization) are available, we calculated the net rates of P release from organic or inorganic P pools based on the actual gross mineralization and gross immobilization rates (biotic transformations) or the gross adsorption and gross desorption rates (abiotic transformations) (see In total, 9 different kinetic settings (a–i) were tested for NK and NPK, respectively, in runs with 10,000 iterations ( Since a run with 10,000 iterations gives only indicative AIC scores, with the Gelman criterion Observed and modelled values of the optimization runs with 50,000 iterations of setup g ( We tested also the effect of providing microbial rather than hexanol-labile P to the model, i.e. with initial and observed values of P In both fertilization treatments, the physicochemical transformations Over the duration of the modelled period (0–33 days), only small changes in pool sizes resulted from these P transformation rates, with a net transfer from slow to fast pools of 4.2 mg P kg The correlation matrix ( Our study has shown that it is possible to determine process- and pool-specific P transformation rates by the use of a The possibility to choose different kinetic settings for each P transformation proved advantageous ( Different kinetic settings of some P transformations ( Transformation rates based on zero- or first-order kinetics from large pools are often not very different over relatively short time periods ( Our modelling approach allows testing whether certain transformations are relevant in a given situation, as shown for example by leaving out  Regarding the P transformations associated with inorganic P ( The cumulative sum of all P transformations leaving or entering the P In the conventional approach, cumulative gross organic P mineralization is derived from the difference of measured and extrapolated E-values, which would translate into gross organic P mineralization rates of 0.6 ± 0.7 and 1.4 ± 0.2 mg P kg Net organic P mineralization rates calculated by the conventional approach for the entire 32 days of incubation were given as 0.6 ± 0.4 mg P kg The most important findings with respect to soil organic P transformations are the dominance of the fast mineralization Based on this study, three important recommendations for future Determine pool sizes and tracer distribution on at least 6 dates during an incubation of 30 days, with denser sampling at the beginning of the experiment. Additional sampling times should be carried out in longer incubations. Measure Minimize variation as much as possible. This new approach to quantify gross P transformations in soils based on isotopic dilution experiments presents an important advancement over the conventional estimation of gross and net organic P mineralization rates. It eliminates not only the need for the extrapolation of isotopic dilution due to physicochemical processes, but apparently also the use of a conversion factor to account for incomplete recovery of microbial P during fumigation-extraction procedures, since the resulting microbial P transformation rates were similar regardless of whether data were supplied to the model with or without application of the conversion factor. The modelling approach confirmed the dominance of microbial immobilization and re-mineralization processes over the mineralization of non-living organic P. However, gross organic P transformation rates estimated by the model were lower than previously published rates.
