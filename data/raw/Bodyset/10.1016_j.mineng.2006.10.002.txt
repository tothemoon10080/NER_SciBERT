Experiments have been carried out in a hydrocyclone and a Vorsyl separator using fine magnetite particles (less than 75μm sizes). Although at all the experimental conditions “fish-hook” has been observed, the shape of the curves is found to be different. Therefore, in this paper a set of new nomenclature has been proposed to quantify the differences in various shapes. An attempt has also been made to describe the effects of variables on the shapes of “fish-hook” in terms of the proposed nomenclature. At a given operating condition, it is also shown that the shape of a “fish-hook” remains unchanged.The recovery of fine particles in a hydrocyclone underflow increases with decrease in particle size beyond a critical particle size. This phenomenon is generally termed as “fish-hook” effect in the literature on hydrocyclone.  Experiments were carried out with ground magnetite (cut size equals to 28.6     The above-mentioned four parameters were measured for all the “fish-hook” curves generated at each experimental condition for both the units and they are also presented in From The occurrence of “fish-hooks” in case of Vorsyl separator further validates the mechanistic argument provided by From From the above-mentioned observations and discussions the following conclusions may be drawn: Occurrence of fish-hook in hydrocyclones dealing with fine particles is not random but definite. Occurrence of fish-hook is not restricted only to hydrocyclones but it will exist while processing fine particles using any centrifugal separator. The characteristic of a fish-hook remains unchanged at a given operating condition but it varies with changes in experimental condition and cyclone design. The proposed parameters are useful to differentiate the various shapes of fish-hooks.
