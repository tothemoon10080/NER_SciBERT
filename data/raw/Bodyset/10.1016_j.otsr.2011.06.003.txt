Surgical treatment of thoracolumbar spine fractures aims to achieve bony union and restore spinal anatomy. It may associate, as needed, decompression, reduction, graft and/or internal fixation, using a posterior, anterior or combined approach. Indications for an anterior approach weigh the pros and cons as well as the type of osteo-ligamentous lesion, degree of instability and patient's neurological status. The main interest of an anterior approach is to enable medullary decompression by corporectomy while allowing reconstruction of the anterior spine. The technique was less frequently used mainly due to its associated morbidity risk; but the development of videoscopy tools now allows less invasive surgery, compared to conventional thoracophrenolombotomy. Given also the mechanical drawbacks of posterior assembly in certain types of fracture, a video-assisted anterior approach is becoming more common. A conjunction of a staged anterior followed by a posterior approach has progressively developed, to address the needs of spinal trauma: this encompasses posterior surgical reduction-internal fixation, sometimes performed in emergency, with or without laminectomy followed by corporectomy, then anterior spinal reconstruction by graft with or without osteosynthesis to improve medullary decompression and avoid secondary correction loss and non-union. Adapting vertebroplasty techniques to spinal traumatology should gradually limit indications for an anterior approach for purely mechanical purposes; this later will, however, logically remain indicated when anterior spinal cord compression is present with associated neurological deficit, whether or not persisting after posterior reduction-osteosynthesis.Surgical management of thoracolumbar fracture has three objectives: to reduce the traumatic spine deformity, to restore spinal canal anatomy in case of medullary decompression, and to achieve consolidation by stabilizing the spine by osteosynthesis, sometimes associated to bone graft. To these ends, the approach may be posterior, anterior or combined, in whichever order. Presence of neurologic disorder and anatomopathologic fracture type determine the role of surgery in most reports, but indications for an anterior approach remain poorly defined. Surgical technique depends on the objective of the operation: osteosynthesis of an unstable lesion, medullary decompression by corporectomy, or reduction of traumatic displacement and/or graft for bone loss. Primary posterior osteosynthesis will determine the requirements of a subsequent anterior approach according to the resulting decompression and stability. Surgery is classically performed under selective intubation to collapse the operated lung. Projection of the fractured vertebra onto the wall of the thorax under image intensification determines the level of the incision, which should be exactly perpendicular to the vertebral body, as the distance between wall and spine entails a long instrumental trajectory. Installation in dorsal decubitus is recommended by certain classical authors The approach is either minimally invasive, if video-assisted Corporectomy should initially respect the anterior and posterior body walls. This has two advantages: it avoids beginning with the most hemorrhagic stage, which is intracanal bone fragment exeresis and also, by conserving the anterior wall, protects the prespinal vessels from any forward slip of a curette. Instrumentation includes chilled scissors, scissors or bone nibblers, straight or curved curettes and, for some authors, bone rasps To restore vertebral body height, Kaneda uses a distraction hook pivoting on the screw heads In order to avoid secondary correction loss, the graft should be set between the two vertebral plates adjacent to the fractured body¸ Many types of synthesis material are used, some of which were developed specifically for endoscopy. Many are based on body anchors introduced beforehand, onto which rods or plates are fixed ( Results are given for 19 series, comprising 1054 cases of surgery on an anterior approach; all or almost all cases are of dorsolumbar hinge involvement ( The risks inherent to an anterior approach to the thoracolumbar spine comprise prespinal arterial or venous wounds Without primary posterior stabilization surgery, mean surgery time ranges from 2.5 to 5.5 Material should be lateral, without contact with arterial vessels, as some cases of late aortic erosion by projecting plates or screws have been reported Pulmonary complications (atelectasia, pneumothorax, hemothorax or pneumopathy) occur in 5% to 15% of cases Certain French authors insist on medullary arteriography to select the side of approach, in order to conserve the intercostal artery from which the radiculomedullary (Adamkiewicz) artery originates, and which entails a theoretical risk of medullary ischemia in case of lesion Fifty to 100% of patients achieve postoperative grade 1 on the Frankel scale, with mean recovery of around 1.3 grades ( Mean preoperative canal stenosis was close to 50% in almost all series ( Deformity consolidation rates range from 85% to 100%, with a mean 10°–20° reduction in initial kyphosis ( Eighty to 95% of patients returned to work after their operation, 70 to 85% to their previous job An anterior approach is to be recommended on mechanical grounds, to repair anterior bone loss, and neurologically, to release medullary compression by removing intracanal bone fragments. It provides a one-shot solution: decompression by corporectomy, reduction by anterior spinal reopening, inter- or intrabody bone graft and, finally, plate osteosynthesis. Neurologic recovery rates are slightly better than in posterior surgery, with better spinal profile correction The prime drawback of the anterior approach lies in its technical difficulty Indications for treatment depend on the patient's neurological status, the acceptability or otherwise of the initial deformity and the degree of medullary canal stenosis, but also on the morphological and neurological evolutionary potential of the spinal lesion. For many authors, they also follow from the limits of the posterior approach in terms of the degree anterior spinal destruction, post-traumatic kyphosis and canal stenosis. The prime indication for an anterior approach in spinal traumatology is incomplete neurologic deficit related to medullary compression induced by canal stenosis which cannot be managed using any other approach Some 10% (607/6708) of cases of dorsolumbar spinal trauma are operated on with an exclusively anterior approach, and 5% (317/6708) with a combined approach Canal stenosis is mainly due to retraction of the posterior vertebral wall, which is more efficiently corrected on a direct anterior approach Results with laminectomy vary greatly between reports. Surgery time and hemorrhage are increased, and there is a risk of dural breech and of neurologic sequelae Intracanal bone fragments adhering to the disks are partially repositioned by the ligamentotactic effect of the PLL during restoration of vertebral body height and kyphosis correction, exerting indirect partial decompression. Total residual postoperative bone loss is usually less than 35% Dorsolumbar hinge trauma surgery using an anterior approach is not feasible in emergency. The question is thus whether to give priority to emergency treatment or to quality of decompression. Comparing neurological recovery after dorsolumbar hinge trauma with incomplete motor deficit of medullary origin treated by surgery using an anterior approach (i.e., with an interval of almost always at least a few days) versus a posterior approach (commonly performed in emergency) does not confirm any need for emergency intervention. In Kaneda's series, the rate of neurological recovery (142/145 cases of at least 1 Frankel-grade improvement despite 143 of the 145 operations being performed more than 48 There is at present no statistical proof of the interest of emergency surgery in partial paraplegia of medullary origin secondary to dorsolumbar hinge fracture. While there is no reason to delay surgery unduly, excellent neurological recovery has been reported for operations performed several weeks or months after initial trauma Where surgery is indicated, some authors systematically perform an isolated anterior approach to reduce kyphosis and to graft and osteosynthesize unstable fracture A reduction of 50% or more in canal diameter is the sign of medullary compression. Most authors then consider decompression logical, even without initial sensory-motor impairment, due to the risk of neurological aggravation in case of secondary displacement As Goutallier's myelographic study showed The acceptable degree of kyphosis following reduction of dorsolumbar hinge fracture remains unclear. It is certain that kyphotic sagittal post-traumatic spinal imbalance may induce pain and damage to adjacent levels, which attempt to compensate for kyphotic malunion by means of hyperlordosis, but there is no consensus as to the acceptability limit for kyphosis: 15° Traumatic kyphosis correction quality is better after anterior surgery, with less secondary correction loss Many series have shown that isolated posterior assemblies are insufficient, without repairing excessive anterior bone loss Anterior spinal reduction defects persist in some 20% of cases, causing non-union and reduction loss It should be borne in mind that the planned anterior second step is often (half of the time, in Parker's series) finally not performed The conditions thus need to be defined in which the stability of the posterior synthesis is insufficient to achieve bone lesion consolidation or posterolateral arthrodesis fusion. According to Farcy et al., in case of significant loss of vertebral body bone capital, indicated by a sagittal index of 15° or more, anterior graft is required, as consolidation is otherwise impossible even with posterior reduction and stabilization When posterolateral arthrodesis is not indicated, due to a normal disk aspect and/or the risk of long-term consequences (L2 fracture in very young patients with lumbar discopathy risk factors), rigid reduction-osteosynthesis with a posterior approach followed by pure vertebral body graft may be considered, with systematic removal of the posterior material at about 1 year so as to restore lumbar spine mobility after consolidation of the fracture. First widely used in the management of osteoporotic collapse, percutaneous anterior spine reconstruction using cement (polymethyl methacrylate) or bone substitute (phosphocalcic cement) is increasingly applied in true post-traumatic vertebral body fracture (Magerl type A, including diabolo (A2) and burst (A3) fracture) Anterior corporectomy-osteosynthesis-graft of dorsolumbar burst fracture restores near-normal anatomy, with effective neuromeningeal decompression. Neurological and functional results are good. Septic complications and postoperative neurologic aggravation are less frequent than in posterior surgery, but at the cost of greater bleeding, although this has been markedly improved by video-assisted surgery and new osteosynthesis materials. Most of our knowledge of indications in dorsolumbar hinge fracture surgery is founded on retrospective data, with choice of treatment guided much more by each school's history and beliefs Vertebroplasty adapted to spine trauma pathology should eventually replace indications for anterior surgery performed for purely mechanical purposes. The latter will, however, logically continue to play a role in the treatment of anterior medullary compression, whether or not induced by posterior reduction-osteosynthesis for complex fracture with associated neurologic deficit of medullary origin. Jacques Sénégas said, in 1988, of dorsolumbar fractures with neurologic lesions, that “ The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this article.
