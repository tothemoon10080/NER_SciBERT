This paper considers a Crank–Nicolson extrapolation scheme based on mixed finite element method to solve the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. We prove that the fully discrete scheme is almost unconditionally stable and convergent, i.e., stable and convergent when the time step is less than or equal to a constant. By a new negative norm technique, the optimal error estimates in

Meanwhile, the numerical investigations provide a sufficient support for the theoretical analysis.Consider the following three-dimensional incompressible MHD equations: The MHD system describes the theory of macroscopic interaction between electrically conducting fluids and electromagnetic fields. It consists of a viscous, incompressible fluid which has the property of electric current conduction and interacting with electromagnetic fields. There are lots of applications in astronomy and geophysics as well as engineering problems, such as metallurgical engineering, electromagnetic pumping, stirring of liquid metals, liquid metal cooling of nuclear reactors, electromagnetic casting of metals and measuring flow quantities based on induction, see [ It is known that for the nonlinear evolution problem, the fully implicit schemes are (almost) unconditionally stable, and need to solve a nonlinear system at each time step. Although an explicit scheme is easy in computation, it suffers a severely restricted time step size from stability requirement. However, there is a popular approach which is based on an implicit scheme for the linear term and a semi-implicit scheme or an explicit scheme for the nonlinear term. As shown in [ In this article, we give almost unconditional stability and optimal convergence analysis on the Crank–Nicolson extrapolation scheme based on mixed finite element method for solving the MHD equations The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
