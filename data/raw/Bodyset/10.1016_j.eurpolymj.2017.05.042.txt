Decomposition of poly(vinylidene fluoride-ter-hexafluoropropylene-ter-tetrafluoroethylene) terpolymer, a typical fluoroelastomer with high flexibility and high resistance to permeation of oil and excellent adhesive ability to other materials, in subcritical water (SubCW) was studied as a first example of the decomposition of the terpolymer with the aim of developing a technique to recover the fluorine element. Compared to the common fluoropolymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride), the terpolymer was considerably stable in SubCW. 19F NMR spectral analysis of the decomposition products obtained from the reaction at 300°C was carried out to better understand the decomposition mechanism. When the reaction was performed in SubCW at 300°C for 6h under argon, only a negligible amount of F− ions (1%) was released. Addition of H2O2 into the reaction system accelerated the mineralization of the terpolymer to form F− and CO2. Apart from these major products, small amounts of malonic acid and CF3H were detected. When this polymer was heated in SubCW at 350°C with 4.0M H2O2, both the yields of F− and CO2 reached up to 95%. These features indicate a quasi-complete mineralization of the terpolymer. Furthermore, the reaction in the presence of 4.0M H2O2 and stoichiometric amount of Ca(OH)2 at 350°C for 18h resulted in the formation of pure CaF2, a raw material for hydrofluoric acid, in 84% yield.Fluoropolymers are fascinating niche macromolecules for many items involved in high-tech applications (microelectronics, optics, buildings, industrial equipments, materials for energy such as fuel cell membranes, polymer electrolytes for lithium ion batteries, piezoelectric devices, and backsheets for photovoltaic modules, etc.). They are endowed with unique and outstanding properties such as high resistances to temperature, chemicals, ageing, ignition, and mechanical stresses Besides the above-mentioned applications, fluoropolymers must be involved in a recycling program and their waste treatment is challenging. The crucial issue deals with their elimination: incineration is the nowadays-adopted option, but this technique requires high temperatures to cleave the strong C Among fluoropolymers, terpolymer of vinylidene fluoride (VDF), hexafluoropropylene (HFP), and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), poly(VDF- Subcritical water (SubCW) is high-pressure liquid water (the temperature is above 100 Thus, it was worth studying the decomposition of poly(VDF- Poly(VDF- Subcritical water reactions were performed in a 31 The reaction involving stoichiometric amount of Ca(OH) The mass fraction of fluorine in poly(VDF- A GC system (GC 323, GL Sciences) consisting of an injector (temperature, 150 XRD pattern of the white precipitate obtained from the reaction involving Ca(OH) First, the reaction of poly(VDF- The decomposition of PVDF in pure SubCW is likely to proceed via dehydrofluorination First, C The scission leads to the formation of a C On the other hand, poly(VDF- To examine the possibility of increasing mineralization in pure SubCW, the reaction temperature was elevated from 300 to 350 The microstructure of the terpolymer contains HFP units located between two VDF units or between one VDF and one TFE units Once a double bond is formed in the polymer chain, the elimination of HF from the adjacent site is further facilitated. The double bond seems reactive because of the presence of the adjacent electron withdrawing CF Although the F To accelerate the mineralization of the terpolymer, reactions in the presence of H In the absence of H Reaction time in the presence of 6.0 To achieve complete mineralization of the terpolymer by use of H The time dependence of decomposition of the terpolymer at 350  For the H The hydroperoxide group is unstable and can induce scission in the main chain (Eq.
