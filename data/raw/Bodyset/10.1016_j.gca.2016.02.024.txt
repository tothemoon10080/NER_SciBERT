Shock-produced melt within crystalline basement rocks of the Steen River impact structure (SRIS) are observed as thin (1–510μm wide), interlocking networks of dark veins which cut across and displace host rock minerals. Solid-state phase transformations, such as ferro-pargasite to an almandine–andradite–majorite garnet and amorphization of quartz and feldspar, are observed in zones adjacent to comparatively wider (50–500μm) sections of the shock veins. Shock pressure estimates based on the coupled substitution of Na+, Ti4+ and Si4+ for divalent cations, Al3+ and Cr3+ in garnet (14–19GPa) and the pressure required for plagioclase (Ab62–83) amorphization at elevated temperature (14–20GPa) are not appreciably different from those recorded by deformation effects observed in non-veined regions of the bulk rock (14–20GPa). This spatial distribution is the result of an elevated temperature gradient experienced by host rock minerals in contact with larger volumes of impact-generated melt and large deviatoric stresses experienced by minerals along vein margins.
                  Micrometer-size equant crystals of almandine–pyrope–majorite garnet define the shock vein matrix, consistent with rapid quench (100–200ms) at 7.5–10GPa. Crystallization of the vein occurred during a 0.1–0.15s shock pressure pulse. Majoritic garnet, formed during shock compression by solid state transformation of pargasite along shock vein margins, is observed in TEM bright field images as nanometer-size gouge particles produced at strain rates in the supersonic field (106–108). These crystals are embedded in vesiculated glass, and this texture is interpreted as continued movement and heating along slip planes during pressure release. The deformation of high-pressure minerals formed during shock compression may be the first evidence of oscillatory slip in natural shock veins, which accounts for the production of friction melt via shear when little or no appreciable displacement is observed. Our observations of the mineralogy, chemistry and microtextures of shock veins within crystalline rocks of the SRIS allow us to propose a model for shock vein formation by shear-induced friction melting during shock compression.Shock veins in meteorites have received much attention owing to their association with minerals stable at high pressure and high temperature (e.g., In this study a network of shock veins from the Steen River impact structure of Alberta, Canada is described. The mineralogy, composition and micro-textures of impact-induced phase transformations associated with shock veins constrain the The Steen River impact structure (SRIS; 59° In early 2000, New Claymore Resources Ltd drilled three continuous but shallow diamond drill holes into the crater fill deposits of the SRIS (ST001, ST002, ST003). These cores are currently housed at the Mineral Core Research Facility in Edmonton ( Shock metamorphic effects may be described as deformation, transformation or a combination of these two processes. There is a distinct difference between those effects manifest in the bulk rock and those adjacent to, and in clasts entrained within, the shock veins. The crystalline basement rock, as represented by the ST003 core between 362 and 378 Host-rock minerals are cross cut by a network of interlocking, curvilinear to straight veins ranging in apparent width from 1 The matrix of the shock vein is opaque in plane light, ranging from black, reddish-brown to grey ( One FIB section was extracted across the interface between the orange almandine–andradite–majorite garnet and the shock vein matrix ( The occurrence of majorite-bearing garnet is restricted to those areas of the host rock where amphibole is cut by shock veins, and are absent in non-veined regions of the host rock. The composition, grain size and texture of shock-produced garnets – grains bordering shock vein margins and those garnet grains that define the shock vein matrix – are distinct, implying they formed by different mechanisms. Garnet crystals within the shock vein matrix are fine-grained, ⩽2 The spatial association between garnet and the shock vein, and the absence of this mineral in non-veined regions of the host rock, indicates that the garnet in the SRIS samples formed during hypervelocity impact. In both occurrences (adjacent to and within shock veins) excess silicon accommodated in octahedral sites in the crystal structure is indicative of formation at high pressure, which is well-documented experimentally (e.g., EMP data were collected on pargasite–almandine crystals in direct contact with each other ( Majorite is the alumina-depleted variety of the garnet supergroup, which forms at sub-lithospheric mantle pressures ( The coexistence of crystalline and amorphous plagioclase in crystalline basement rocks of the SRIS suggests a moderate shock pressure. The static compression experiments of The phenomenon – whereby high pressure minerals such as wadsleyite, ringwoodite, majorite, stishovite occur almost exclusively in and around shock melts – is well known from studies of shock metamorphism in meteorites (e.g., According to the experimental data of Another insight into the spatial distribution between shock veins and mineral transformations lies in the static compression experiments of Shock veins may form by a number of distinct mechanisms including shock wave collisions, friction heating along shear bands, or by the interaction of shock waves with void space (e.g., fractures, cracks, pores) during shock compression ( Crystallization of an almandine–pyrope–majorite garnet from melt indicates that the bulk composition of the shock vein is not that same as the host rock, i.e., the melt composition is more ferromagnesian and less siliceous than would result from bulk melting of plagioclase–orthoclase–quartz–pargasite–biotite gneiss. Such discrepancies in bulk composition are typical of friction melts where melting does not proceed according to the melting temperature of individual minerals, but instead is dependent on fracture toughness, Apparent displacement of host rock minerals are observed as micro-scale offsets (20–200 In bright field TEM images the shock-produced almandine–andradite–majorite garnet along the vein margin is itself deformed, forming an ultracataclastic texture of nm-size crystals ( Using the line of reasoning outlined in the preceding paragraphs, the shock veins have formed The first observation indicates that although slip was initiated during compression, deformation continued during pressure release to produce an ultracataclastic texture from shock-produced garnets and initiate incipient melting at low pressure to produce bubbles. The second observation is a well-documented phenomenon from shock veins in meteorites, attributed to the relationship between the shock duration (elapsed time between arrival of the shock wave and decompression), and the time it takes for the shock melt to crystallize by conduction of heat to the surrounding cooler host rock ( The observation of multiple phases of deformation on a single fracture-slip surface is significant because it is able to account for the production of friction melt via shear even when there is little to no appreciable displacement observed. For example field studies undertaken on pseudotachylitic breccias at the Vredefort Dome, South Africa, have called on injection from the melt sheet to explain their origin because small displacements/offsets along their margins are difficult to reconcile with a frictional melting origin ( In the same ST003 core sample from which the thin sections were prepared, a 2–6 This is the first study to investigate the mineralogy and microtextures of shock veins in a terrestrial impact structure at the nanometer scale. Our results provide critical constraints on the mechanism of shock vein formation that improve upon previous work. Based on the petrographic observations outlined in Sections The network of shock veins in crystalline basement rocks from the SRIS were initiated during the contact/compression stage of crater formation as the shock wave propagated through the rocks. Micro-faulting and shear generated local hot spots along slip planes. The crystalline basement rocks at >1.6 Our model for shock vein formation applies to the features described here from crystalline target rocks of the SRIS and similar features in other terrestrial impact craters ( One motivation for the study of shock metamorphic effects in meteorites is to deduce how many impact events are required to explain the observed deformation and transformation features. This relates to the interpretation of ages from the samples (crystallization versus shock-resetting) and to the size and frequency of impact events on their parent body. Temptation exists to assign multiple impact scenarios to meteorites when complicated micro-scale shock features are observed ( In this study we document a novel shock-induced amphibole to garnet phase transformation in the Steen River impact structure, which has previously been reported from a single terrestrial impact crater. The composition of majoritic garnet formed during shock wave passage through the crystalline basement rocks of this 25 Financial support for this project was provided by
