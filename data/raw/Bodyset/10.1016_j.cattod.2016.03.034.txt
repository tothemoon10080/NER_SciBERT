Manganese oxide nanorods with different crystal phases (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-MnO2) were prepared via a mild hydrothermal method, and examined as heterogeneous catalysts for the decomposition of H2O2 into active radicals and concomitant degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye at neutral pH. The catalytic activity of MnO2 nanorods was highly dependent upon their crystal structures, following the order of γ-MnO2

                     β-MnO2

                     δ-MnO2. Complete degradation of MB was achieved with γ-MnO2 in a short duration of 20min. Furthermore, γ-MnO2 exhibited much higher activity compared to iron-containing nanoparticles (Fe° and Fe3O4) and several reported catalysts in the literature. The observed trend in catalyst performance was discussed in terms of surface area, degree of crystallinity, and exposed facets. It was found that γ-MnO2 showed considerable activity over a broad range of pH and temperature as well as desired reusability for four consecutive cycles. Quenching studies indicated that hydroxyl radicals (OH) played a major role in the degradation of MB. These results provide important insight into the design of more efficient manganese oxide catalysts for wastewater treatment.The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), including chemical, photocatalytic, and electrocatalytic methods with hydrogen peroxide, and/or metal salts, ozone, and UV radiation have been successfully applied in wastewater treatment over the past decades Among various non-noble transition metal oxides, nanostructured manganese oxides (MnO The present study aims at investigating how the crystal structure of MnO All chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade, and solutions were prepared with deionized (DI) water (>18 The morphology and structure of particles were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JEOL-J840), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H-7600), and X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X’Pert diffractometer). The Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter were measured at 77 The catalytic reaction was performed at room temperature ( To test the recyclability of Total organic carbon (TOC) was quantified using a TOC analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCSH). The amount of Mn leached during recycling test was measured through an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Thermo IRIS-AP). For H  The catalytic activity of different MnO When MnO The degradation process followed the first-order kinetics with satisfactory correlation coefficients ( Generally, surface area has been considered the main parameter relating to the catalyst activity in heterogeneous catalysis, which allows us to assume that the rate of reaction can be increased by increasing the surface area. Indeed, The effectiveness of To investigate the influence of reaction conditions on the kinetics of MB degradation, the best catalyst of the prepared series,  As expected, the temperature increment from 25 The influence of pH on the degradation of MB with As real textile effluents contain not only dyes but large amounts of inorganic solutes, the impact of common inorganic salts, such as NaCl and CaCl The reuse of a catalyst is an important issue to be fulfilled from a practical point of view. It depends upon how many times a catalyst can be recycled and the regeneration method. In this study, the spent The redox reactions of a Mn To probe the generation of In summary, by a facile and mild hydrothermal route, we have obtained This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) (No. 2011-0028723), “The GAIA Project” by Korea Ministry of Environment (RE201402059), and by the Future Research Program (2E26252) funded by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST).
