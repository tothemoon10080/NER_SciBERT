We read this article with great interest because the authors explained very well the role of the noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan in predicting successful shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) in children. A study by Tealab et al The HU is a rather easy parameter to measure on noncontrast computed tomography, but it should also be kept in mind that the HU measurement depends on the size and density of the stone and also on resolution (ie, slice width of the CT scan). In a another study, by Zarse et al, This opened another direction to use CT to view stone structure, rather than to simply measure the HU to predict the success of shockwave lithotripsy. Further clinical studies are required to define the relationship between stone structure observed by CT and stone fragility in shockwave lithotripsy, in addition to the HU number.
