A practical strategy for the reduction of nanogap width has been investigated using liquid nitrogen freezing of Pd-sputtered elastomeric substrates. Two types of hydrogen gas sensors, in which no pre-strain and 25% elongation were applied to Pd films on the elastomeric substrates, showed extremely low detection limits of less than 300 and 200ppm, respectively, after liquid nitrogen freezing and recovery to room temperature. For the non-strained sensors, the nanogap width was measured to be about 90nm, whereas it was more reduced to 25nm on the elongated sensors. Both sensors exhibited perfect On–Off switching, fast response, and good reversibility, which are based on the nanogap open–close mechanism upon exposure to hydrogen gas. These results provide a valuable clue for reducing nanogap width, thereby improving the hydrogen-sensing capabilities of nanogap-based On–Off hydrogen sensors.With the rapid progress in the design of chemical sensors over the past several decades, nanoscale gaps have been of great interest to researchers interested in improving the sensing performance such as response time, sensitivity, and selectivity Here, we report a practical method for reduction of the nanogap width to below 100 The elastomeric substrates were fabricated by mixing PDMS elastomer (Sylgard 184 Silicon Elastomer Base, Dow Corning) with a curing agent (weight ratio After all samples went through these processes, they were divided into two different categories. For half the samples, 2–3 liquid nitrogen droplets were dropped on the Pd film. The other samples were put under a tensile strain (25% in this case) exerted by a tensile machine, then liquid nitrogen was dropped on the Pd film. The processed films were brought under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL Ltd., JSM-6500F) and an optical microscope (OM, Olympus Co.) for close examination of surface morphologies.
