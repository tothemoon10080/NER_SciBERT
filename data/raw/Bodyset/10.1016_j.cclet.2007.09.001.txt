This paper investigated average cluster sizes (ACS) and cluster size distributions (CSD) at different shear rates by Brownian dynamics in non-, bi-, and uni-polar systems with partly charged superfine particles. The investigation indicates that clusters in non-polar systems are the weakest and easiest to be damaged by increasing shear stresses; charged particles play important and different roles: in bi-polar system, it intends to strengthen clusters to some extent provided that the sign-like ions homogeneously arranged; in uni-polar system charged particles cracked the clusters into smaller ones, but the small clusters are strong to stand with larger shear stress. The relationship between ACS and shear rates follows power law with exponents in a range 0.18â€“0.28, these values are in a good agreement with experiment range but at the lower limit compared with other systems of non-metallic cluster particles.Investigation into microstructures and properties of metallic superfine particles in a light medium is a very active field recently, the scope of the investigation dealt with both macro- and micro-scopic aspects. In macroscopic property aspects, research includes effective pair potentials Simulation details include potentials chosen, governing equations and boundary conditions used as well as simulation start, quantities of interest extracted and analyzed, etc., please refer to paper ACS is average property of a system. It is defined as   In the three systems clusters in non-polar systems are the weakest, so it has the largest slope with increasing shear stresses; charged particles, especially in uni-polar systems, weaken the clusters remarkably due to the repulsive forces from sign-like ions. The relationship of ACS and shear rates follows power law, the exponents range between 0.18 and 0.28 in the conditions considered. This figure ranges at the lower limit compared with the other systems of non-metallic colloidal systems ( This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 50474037) and The Natural Science Funds (No. BK2006078) in Jiangsu Province of China.
