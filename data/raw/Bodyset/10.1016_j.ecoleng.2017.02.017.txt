Reed bed systems (RBS) represent an innovative and ecologically sound treatment method for the stabilization of sludge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which is also able to provide several ancillary ecosystem services. In this study, the performance of sludge stabilization achieved during the operation of an RBS for the stabilization of excess sludge extracted from a WWTP located in Central Italy (“La Fontina” WWTP, 15,000 p.e.) was studied. In order to evaluate the process of sludge stabilization, parameters representing the biochemical, chemical and chemico-structural properties of organic sludge matter have been tracked during the entire period of operation (6 years).
                  The main aim of this paper is to monitor the stabilization process of sludge organic matter occurring during the main RBS operational stages (commissioning, operation and resting), in order to derive useful rules and parameters for the formulation of novel guidelines for RBS design and operation.
                  Each singular operational stage was characterized by the predominance of a specific process of organic matter stabilization as follows:
                  
                     
                        
                           1)
                           During the commissioning phase, the mineralization of fresh organic matter turned out to be the primary process, as highlighted by the values of water soluble carbon (4195mgC/kgdw) and dehydrogenase activity (25.5mgINTF/kgdwh) reached at 24 months;
                        
                        
                           2)
                           During the operating phase, the mineralization of pseudo-stable organic matter proved to prevail over the humification process, as demonstrated by the decrease of toluene (from 27.5% to 22.9%) derived from chemical-structural organic matter characterization performed by the Py-GC technique;
                        
                        
                           3)
                           During the resting period, humification and sanitation processes became predominant, thus enabling a final safe reuse of stabilized sludge as biosolids for land application, proved by the absence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and by the values of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (1.53mg/kgdw), di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (3.63mg/kgdw), nonyl-phenols (20.9mg/kgdw), and linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (4.99mg/kgdw).During the commissioning phase, the mineralization of fresh organic matter turned out to be the primary process, as highlighted by the values of water soluble carbon (4195 During the operating phase, the mineralization of pseudo-stable organic matter proved to prevail over the humification process, as demonstrated by the decrease of toluene (from 27.5% to 22.9%) derived from chemical-structural organic matter characterization performed by the Py-GC technique; During the resting period, humification and sanitation processes became predominant, thus enabling a final safe reuse of stabilized sludge as biosolids for land application, proved by the absence of Natural treatment systems, such as constructed treatment wetlands and waste stabilization ponds, have long been recognized as sources of ecosystem services beyond their primary function of water quality improvement, and as key constituents of a green infrastructure approach to water treatment. Ecologically engineered treatment systems have been identified as sources of provisioning services (such as biomass production for energy generation), regulating services (such as carbon sequestration), habitat and cultural services ( Constructed wetlands or reed bed systems (RBS) for sludge dewatering and stabilization can be considered as an ecological technology also able to provide several ancillary ecosystem services. In RBSs, sewage sludge is loaded onto the surface of the basins over several years, where it is dewatered, stabilized and turned into biosolids with a high dry solid content for use as an organic fertilizer on agricultural land ( The RBS technology was clearly proven to be effective not only in dewatering the sludge ( A better comprehension of the stabilization processes occurring in RBSs can enable the possibility to formulate new guidelines for reed bed design and operation, thus leading to improve the competitiveness of RBS sludge treatment by making it more efficient and reliable ( The main aim of this paper is to monitor the process of sludge organic matter stabilization, in relationship to the three main RBS operation phases of commissioning, operation and resting. It is possible to state that different organic matter stabilization phases prevail during the different phases of operation. To achieve this purpose, parameters correlated to chemical, biochemical and chemical-structural properties of organic sludge matter were determined and correlated each other by statistical methods. In this paper we report results about the stabilized sludge during one entire cycle (6 years) of full operation (commissioning, operating loading/resting phases, resting period before emptying) (  Sludge sampling was carried out since December 2005 for 6 years (3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 and 72 months). For each bed, five subsamples were taken, which were mixed in order to obtain a representative sample of each bed. The samples were collected near the gravel layer, after removing plant material. About 20 days before the sampling, the sludge applications were stopped. The last sludge loading was applied after 60 months, and then the full system entered its final resting phase. Characteristics of sewage sludge from WWTP are reported in pH was estimated on water extract (1:10, w/v), while TOC and TN were assessed by RC-412 multiphase carbon and FP-528 protein/nitrogen (LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA). Water soluble carbon (WSC), fulvic acids (FA), and humic acids (HA) were determined according to the method of Chemical-structural analyses were performed following The time courses of the studied parameters were fitted using the logistic curve, a model widely reported for biodegradation of organic compounds such as LAS in sea waters ( The logistic curve is given by the function Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences ( The pH decreased significantly over time, reaching lower values at the end of each different management period. Both processes occurred at the same rate, as proved by the insignificantly different rate constants obtained by the logistic model: 0.025 and 0.073, for WSC and DHase, respectively. Moreover, the logistic fitting obtained the final values of 3178 Also hygienization level was an important parameter to track in order to assess the effectiveness of RBSs in stabilizing sludge. The transformations of organic matter during the stabilization process, with special reference to the formation of humic substances (humification), have a key role in monitoring the effectiveness of RBSs in sludge stabilization. Humic substances can be classified in two different components: fulvic acids, which identify the less stable part of humic matter, and humic acids, which include the most stable fraction of humic matter. Fulvic acids significantly decreased over time, particularly during the commissioning period, and reached their lowest values at the end of the operational period and during the resting phase ( Interesting results, in terms of representativeness of the stabilization process, came also from the chemical-structural organic matter characterization performed by the Py-GC technique ( The detected total metal concentrations ( The procedure for heavy metal fractionation allowed us to individuate the following four fractions characterized by the decreasing degree of bioavailability: Fraction 1 (exchangeable fraction) which is the most mobile portion, potentially toxic for plants. In this fraction, metals are adsorbed on sludge components or present in the form of Fe and Mn hydroxides; Fraction 2 (reducible fraction) where heavy metals are strongly bound to Fe and Mn oxides, but get thermodynamically unstable when in acidic and anoxic conditions; Fraction 3 (oxidizable fraction bound to organic matter) where heavy metals are complexed by humic substances and become soluble when organic matter is degraded in oxidizing conditions. This fraction is considered to be neither bioavailable nor mobile; Fraction 4 (residual fraction) which is considered to be not extractable and in an inert form, with heavy metals included in crystalline structures within the residuals solids. The concentrations of different metals (expressed in mEq/kg) were summed for each fraction ( The aerobic conditions of the basins affected not only the extent of mineralization and humification, but also the biodegradation of toxic organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPE), di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS). The presence of these compounds may affect the possible land application of stabilized sludges as biosolid; hence, it is important that RBS managers monitor the presence of such compounds, especially during the final resting period. For this reason, several European countries ( As reported by Similar reduction levels can be observed for NPE and DEHP, which are hydrophobic compounds deriving from hygienic/cleaning products and plastic softeners, respectively. At the end of the operative phase (60 months), NPE declined of about 33.4% from the initial content of 62.9 The PCA of the data set indicated 76.3% of the data variance as being contained in the first three components ( In the PC3 This study demonstrated the pathways of organic matter stabilization occurring in a sludge stabilization reed bed during a complete 72 month-long cycle. The biological stabilization, depending on fresh organic matter, was underlined by the decrease of water-soluble carbon, dehydrogenase activity, fulvic acids and bioavailable heavy metals. The mineralization of pseudo-stable substances and the progressive humification were clearly proven by the humic acid content and by the trend of chemical-structural parameters. Each different operational phase was characterized by the prevalence of a specific process of organic matter stabilization: The mineralization of fresh organic matter was the main process observed during the initial commissioning phase; The mineralization of pseudo-stable organic matter prevailed over the humification process during the central operating phase; The humification process became prevalent during the final resting period. Moreover, during the last resting period, a significant reduction of persistent organic compounds and faecal bacteria indicators was reached, thus enabling a possible safe reuse of stabilized sludge as biosolids for land application. Finally, the logistic fitting described the overall trend of the organic matter sludge stabilization, thus allowing us to provide useful information for the formulation of new reed bed design and operation guidelines. Additional studies devoted to the quantification of the ecosystem services provided by RBSs are advisable, as they could further improve the competitiveness of this environmental-friendly technique of sludge stabilization over conventional technologies especially in green urban infrastructure planning.
