Introduction
                  Biodentine is a new bioactive cement that is similar to the widely used mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). It has dentin-like mechanical properties, which may be considered a suitable material for clinical indications of dentin-pulp complex regeneration such as direct pulp capping. The purpose of the present study was to compare the response of the pulp-dentin complex in human teeth after direct capping with this new tricalcium silicateâ€“based cement with that of MTA.
               
                  Methods
                  Pulps in 28 caries-free maxillary and mandibular permanent intact human molars scheduled for extraction for orthodontic reasons were mechanically exposed and assigned to 1 of 2 experimental groups, Biodentine or MTA, and 1 control group. Assay of periapical response and clinical examination were performed. After 6 weeks, the teeth were extracted, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and categorized by using a histologic scoring system.
               
                  Results
                  The majority of specimens showed complete dentinal bridge formation and an absence of inflammatory pulp response. Layers of well-arranged odontoblast and odontoblast-like cells were found to form tubular dentin under the osteodentin. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the Biodentine and MTA experimental groups during the observation period.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Within the limitations of this study, Biodentine had a similar efficacy in the clinical setting and may be considered an interesting alternative to MTA in pulp-capping treatment during vital pulp therapy.
