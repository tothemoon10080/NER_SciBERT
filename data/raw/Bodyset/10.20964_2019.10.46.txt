Given the better electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of one-dimensional materials compared with multi-dimensional materials, high-purity one-dimensional nano-sized cuprous oxide rods, as anode materials for sodium ion batteries, were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. A rod width of approximately 150 nm and X-ray diffraction patterns were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Compared with irregular nano-sized cuprous oxide, cuprous oxide nanorods demonstrated a high initial capacity of 380 mAh∙g-1 and good reversible capacity of 245 mAh∙g-1 at a capacity retention of 59% after 50 cycles. These results demonstrated the great application potential of the proposed material for sodium ion batteries. In addition, the Na ion diffusion coefficient have been quantitative analyzed by EIS, reflecting the good diffusion coefficient in one-dimensional materials. This work might provide a reference for the selection of the shape of energy storage materials.
