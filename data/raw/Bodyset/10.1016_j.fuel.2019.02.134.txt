The authors apologize for 5 errors identified in the above article. In Abstract and Conclusions, the highest methane production was obtained in the co-degradation with <0.075 mm of coal and 10 mm of rice straw, not 0.125–0.150 mm coal and 5 mm of rice straw. In Section 3.2, the volatile solid (VS) contents of rice stem, rice leaf, and rice root were respectively 88.27%, 89.46%, and 92.55% instead of 92.55%, 88.27%, and 89.46%. In Section 3.3, when the coal particle size was <0.075 mm and rice straw particle size was <0.250 mm, the maximum methane production was 201.27 μmol/g coal instead of 101.27 μmol/g coal. In Section 3.3, when the coal particle size was 0.125–0.150 mm and rice straw particle size was 10 mm, the maximum methane production was 200.19 μmol/g coal instead of 355.19 μmol/g coal. The sentence “The maximum methane production of the 10 mm coal was achieved on the 57 In The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused.
