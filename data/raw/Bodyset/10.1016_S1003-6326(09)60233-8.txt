The co-extraction behavior of galena-pyrolusite in a sodium chloride solution and the electrochemical mechanism of this process were investigated, and some factors affecting the leaching rate of Pb and Mn were optimized. The results show that all the factors such as the concentration of NaCl, HCl and pyrolusite ore, reaction time, temperature, adding times of HCl, affect the leaching rate of Pb. The main affecting factors are the concentration of NaCl, reaction time and temperature. The Tafel polarization curves and EIS plots of the galena and pyrolusite in the NaCl solution demonstrate that during the oxidation process of galena mineral electrode, film forms on the galena surface, which prevents galena from deeper oxidation. However, the film resistance can be greatly reduced in the presence of sodium chloride, thus promoting the reaction rate of galena.
