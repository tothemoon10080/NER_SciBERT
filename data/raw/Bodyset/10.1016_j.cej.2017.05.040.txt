                     ) was developed in this study. The dissolution kinetics of partially dehydroxylated lizardite particles was accurately described, and the passivating effect of amorphous silica precipitation on the dissolving particles was quantitatively measured. The passivation by amorphous silica was found to inhibit the Mg release rates, and the inhibitory effect was stronger at 60°C than at 30°C. An empirical correction to the dissolution rates was found to be sufficient to describe this inhibitory effect. A well controlled, semi-continuous experimental set-up that could run both single- and two-step CO2 mineralization experiments was built, and the empirical correction together with the kinetic models that describe the various events that occur during a CO2 mineralization process were quantitatively validated. The presence of NaCl or NaHCO3 did neither reduce the passivation behavior of amorphous silica nor enhance the CO2 mineralization performances significantly at these operating conditions.exponent in the description of the surface area of a porous shell [–] particle dosing rate [min stoichiometric index for Mg during the dissolution of silicate species crystal density of hydromagnesite [g solution density [kg stoichiometric index for Si during the dissolution of silicate species specific surface area of the PSD measured by BET method [m specific surface area of the porous shell [m concentration of aqueous solute [mol Sauter mean diameter [m] dissolution rate of silicate species dissolution rate of silicate species particle size distribution [m fugacity of CO molar flow rate of the gas entering the reactor [mol molar flow rate of the gas absorbed into the solution [mol molar flow rate of the gas exiting the reactor [mol particle size distribution for species particle size distribution for species growth rate [m particle dosing rate [mg index for a silicate species in a particle [–] lumped rate constant for the precipitation of amorphous silica [mol lumped mass transfer coefficient [m solubility product [–] volume shape factor [–] characteristic length of hydromagnesite particle [m] molar mass [g mass of water in the reactor [kg] moles of silicate species moles of silicate species total number of moles of a Mg remaining in the entire PSD of dissolving PDL particles [mol] total number of moles of a Si remaining in the entire PSD of dissolving PDL particles [mol] total pressure [bar] partial pressure of CO flow rate of solvent [kg mass of CO overall precipitation rate of hydromagnesite [mol overall precipitation rate of amorphous silica [mol specific dissolution rate for a silicate species saturation index of silicate species time varying reactive surface area of a silicate species time varying reactive surface area of a silicate species temperature [K] time [min] dosing period [min] molar volume of gas phase [L volume of gas phase [L] mass of serpentine added to the reactor [mg] CO CO mole fraction of CO mole fraction of H mole fraction of N carbon capture and storage 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties mass flow controller mass flow meter mass spectrometer population balance equation partially dehydroxylated lizardite polyether ether ketone piping and instrumentation diagram particle size distribution polytetrafluoroethylene The climate goal of the Paris Agreement adopted during COP21 in December 2015 is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 In order to speed up the kinetics of this process, ex situ CO The dissolution of any silicate mineral is inhibited by several kinetic phenomena. This makes the accurate estimation of these phenomena extremely important in order to engineer solutions that overcome most of these limitations. In this regard, there have been several studies in literature that have performed detailed investigations on the dissolution kinetics of various silicate minerals and on the precipitation kinetics of carbonates. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these kinetic models has been successfully extended in order to quantitatively predict the dynamics of an ex situ CO In our earlier studies The precipitation of amorphous silica on the dissolving silicate surface during a carbonation process has been reported by a number of studies in literature. Pioneering work on aqueous CO In addition to amorphous silica, the precipitation of carbonate minerals on the surface of the dissolving silicate may result in passivation effects. In an earlier study, we had observed the possibility of the precipitation of amorphous silica at The summary above refers to just a few of the several studies in the literature that have demonstrated the complex dynamics of amorphous silica passivation. In general, the development of a general kinetic model for amorphous silica passivation will be extremely challenging and perhaps not feasible. Instead, the passivation behavior of the secondary phases may have to be assessed for the dissolution of each silicate material at its relevant operating conditions. The primary objective of this study is to extend the kinetic models for the dissolution of PDL particles obtain model parameters that describe the dissolution of this non-characterized particle size distribution (PSD) of PDL particles, measure the passivation behavior of amorphous silica during the dissolution of PDL particles and include this effect in the dissolution kinetic model that we have developed in our earlier studies validate the kinetic models that we have developed by predicting the dynamics of single- and two-step CO A single-step mineralization process is one where the dissolution of PDL particles and the precipitation of carbonates occur simultaneously in the same reactor. On the other hand, a two-step process has a higher degree of freedom, since the dissolution of PDL particles and the precipitation of magnesium carbonates occur in two different reactors. In this publication, we will first introduce the various experimental set-ups and methods that are used in this study. The experiments performed include the dissolution of these PDL particles in the absence of any secondary phase precipitation, the dissolution at operating conditions where the precipitation of amorphous silica is expected, and the CO PDL particles were obtained from Shell Global Solutions International as a milled sub-125 Three different experimental set-ups were used for the various experiments performed in this study. A first set of isothermal dissolution experiments of PDL particles at atmospheric pressure conditions were performed in the experimental set-up that was introduced and used in an earlier study The effect of amorphous silica passivation on the dissolution kinetics of PDL particles was investigated in a different experimental set-up, as shown in Batch dissolution experiments of PDL particles were performed at 30 Single- and two-step flue gas CO On the gas upstream side, the set-up can be used to select between synthetic flue gases of 10 The reactor solutions are circulated between the two reactors by means of two HPLC pumps, Pump1 and Pump2 (Jasco PU987). Inlet filters of pore size 2 In order to feed PDL particles into the pressurized reactor R1, a custom solid dosing system was built. The solid dosing system is calibrated to dose a known flow rate of PDL particles into the reactor. A detailed description of the solid dosing system and its calibration is provided in Single-step CO Two-step CO The synthetic hydromagnesite seed particles used in the mineralization experiments were found to be brittle. The use of magnetic stirring bars can potentially result in the breakage of these particles.The breakage of hydromagnesite seeds during the start-up phases of the single- and two-step experiments were measured separately. This is reported in In this section, we present the general equations that describe the changes in the gas, the liquid, and the solid phase properties during a CO N Water vapor in the gas phase is in instantaneous equilibrium with the aqueous solution. The effect of non-volatile solutes on the partial pressure of water vapor is neglected, and the density of the solution is equal to that of pure water. The gas stream leaving the reactor is completely dry. The gas phase is well mixed. For experiments where an assumption of The speciation reactions occurring in the aqueous solution are at equilibrium. The flow rates of the solvent entering and leaving the reactor are identical, and the change in the mass of the solvent in the reactor is negligible. The change in the volume of the aqueous solution and of the solid particles during any experiment is very small compared to the total volume of the reactor; so the volume of the gas phase is assumed to be constant. The only secondary solid phases that can precipitate out during the dissolution of PDL particles are synthetic hydromagnesite and amorphous silica. The formation and growth of any magnesium silicate species from a supersaturated solution is kinetically infeasible. The various assumptions regarding the solid properties of PDL particles and synthetic hydromagnesite made earlier Hydromagnesite precipitation occurs only through the growth of the hydromagnesite seeds. The nucleation and growth rates of amorphous silica on the entire surface of PDL particles from a supersaturated solution are high. The mass balance for water in the reactor is In the above equations, In this reactor operating at constant temperature,  The value of A PDL particle consists of multiple silicate species, distinguished by the label The overall rate for the release of Mg and Si during the dissolution of PDL particles can then be written as: The rate of instantaneous precipitation of amorphous silica on the PDL particles can be written as The growth of hydromagnesite in a well stirred reactor can be described by its PBE: The overall precipitation rate, Based on the film theory for mass transfer In this section, we will present the experimental and simulated results for the various experiments that were performed in this study. The results will be presented in a logical order where the dissolution of an unknown batch of PDL particles are first characterized and their CO In our earlier studies  The experimentally measured PSD of this wide distribution of sub-125 We had classified the model parameters that describe the dissolution of PDL particles into three categories, namely stoichiometric parameters, structural parameters, and kinetic parameters Therefore, the two structural parameters Having estimated the dissolution kinetics for the sub-125 In order to be able to describe the reducing dissolution rates of the different silicate species in PDL particles due to amorphous silica passivation, a physical model that employs diffusive transport equations for the various aqueous species could be developed    The value of Although we have developed a simple, yet good description for the passivating effect of amorphous silica on the dissolution of PDL particles, the applicability of this empirical correction under CO Four single-step CO In an earlier study on single-step CO We have earlier measured the growth rates of synthetic hydromagnesite at 90 The solubility product of synthetic hydromagnesite,  In the first period which starts from In the second period, we continue to dose PDL particles into the reactor, but the dissolving particles experience passivation due to amorphous silica precipitation. As a result, the dashed and the solid lines in In the last period, PDL particles and hydromagnesite continue to dissolve and precipitate, respectively. The slowing dissolution rates of PDL particles, and therefore the slowing precipitation rates of hydromagnesite, result in an increase in the downstream CO From  Having shown the validity of the kinetic models in being able to predict single-step experiments, we now demonstrate its ability to predict the two-step experiments, MZ05 and MZ06, performed in this study. The difference between these two experiments is the temperature in reactor R1,  The performance indices listed in In this study, we have demonstrated a systematic procedure that allows one to start off with an uncharacterized batch of PDL particles, to eventually be able to predict its CO Very often, the feasibility of a CO The authors thank Daniel Trottmann (ETH Zurich) for his help with the experimental set-ups.
