High phosphorous oolitic hematite ore is one of typical intractable iron ores in China, and the conventional beneficiation methods are found to be impracticable to remove phosphorus from the ore effectively. Better beneficiation index were gotten by direct reduction roasting with dephosphorization agent followed by two stages of grinding and magnetic separation. P content decreases from 0.82% in the raw ore to 0.06% in the magnetic concentrate, and the total iron grade increases from 43.65% to 90.23%, the recovery of iron can reach 87%. Mechanisms of phosphorus removal in the beneficiation of high phosphorous oolitic hematite ore by direct reduction roasting with dephosphorization agent were studied using XRD, SEM and EPMA. The results showed that about 20% of the apatite in the raw ore transferred into phosphorus and volatilized with the gas in the process of reduction roasting, while the rest 80% apatite was not involved in the reaction of generation of phosphorus, and remained as apatite in the roasted products, which was removed to tailings by grinding and magnetic separation. A small amount of phosphorus existed in the magnetic concentrate as apatite. The oolitic texture of raw ore was partly changed during roasting, resulting in the formation of nepheline in the reaction between the dephosphorization agent, SiO2 and Al2O3 in the raw ore, which greatly improved the liberation degree of minerals in the roasted products, and it was beneficial to the subsequent grinding and magnetic separation.
