Cortical bone grafting is commonly required in the finger, hand, and carpus when managing bony trauma. A donor site that can provide a small or large amount of cortical bone graft that is easily accessible and within the same surgical field would be the ideal donor site. In high-energy injuries, a long cortical graft may be needed to reconstruct massive bony defects. In low-energy injuries such as scaphoid nonunions in which a wedge graft is needed, a reliable and easily accessible source of bone grafting would be beneficial. Although the traditional iliac bone grafting can be used, this option requires a separate sterile field to be prepared and may lead to donor site pain and morbidity. We propose an option that places the donor source close to the hand and wrist. The radial aspect of the distal radius metaphysis/diaphysis is superficial, which makes access and closure simpler than other alternatives. Furthermore, the technique only partly violates 1 of the 3 surfaces of the radius so that there is minimal weakening of the integrity of the bone and the likelihood of fracture is low. In this article, we describe the indications, contraindications, surgical technique, and postoperative management of the radial aspect of the distal radius metaphysis/diaphysis as a source of bone grafting.
