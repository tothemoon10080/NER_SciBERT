Quartz (SiO2), one of the main gangue minerals in the tin-bearing iron concentrates, has an uncertain effect on the volatilization behavior of tin during the selective reduction volatilization (SRV) process. In this study, high purity quartz was added into the tin-bearing iron concentrates to investigate the tin volatilization behavior affected by SiO2 under CO–CO2 atmosphere of 10–70vol.% CO at 900–1100°C. In order to eliminate the interference of iron oxide in the iron concentrates, the reduction behavior of natural cassiterite and the mixture (20wt.% cassiterite and 80wt.% quartz) was also determined. Effect of SiO2 on the phase transformation of SnO2 was conducted using SEM–EDS, chemical phase analysis, etc.A selective reduction volatilization (SRV) process of tin recovery and pellet preparation for blast furnace iron-making from the tin-bearing iron concentrates, also named a coal-based rotary kiln reduction process, has been developed and successfully performed in the pilot-scale and semi-industrialization tests by the authors' group Previous studies have indicated that the tin-bearing iron concentrates are mainly composed of magnetite, quartz, calcite and cassiterite Both of SnO Some researchers reported that the reaction activity of SnO in the SnO–SiO Although there have been numerous investigations on the SnO–SiO Particularly, quartz is one of main gangue minerals in the tin-bearing iron concentrates The influence of quartz on the tin volatilization ratio and phase transformation of SnO Samples of the tin-bearing iron concentrates and natural cassiterite were the same as those given in Natural quartz powders, obtained after crushing and milling, were analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer (LS-POP6; Zhuhai OMEC instrument Co., Ltd.; China) and XRD (XRD, D/max 2550PC, Japan Rigaku Co., Ltd). The testing results are shown in As shown in All the simulative reduction roasting tests were conducted in a horizontal resistance furnace. And the schematic diagram of experimental equipment was reported previously Because it was difficult to determine the phase composition of tin for the trace content, and the findings in After quenched in liquid nitrogen, the roasted samples were divided into two parts. One part was finely ground to 100% less than 0.074 The experimental flowsheet for analyzing the chemical phase of tin is shown in As presented in Metallic tin (MSn) A 0.2000 SnSiO The washed residue from step (a) was put into a 200 SnO The residue obtained from step (b) was first melt with mixed flux of zinc powder and NaOH and then dissolved with HCl. The content of tin in the residue was used to assay the content of SnO The volatilization ratio of Sn was calculated according to the following equation:  where    The effect of quartz on the Sn volatilization ratio at various CO/(CO The CO content refers to the CO volume concentration in the CO–CO The results shown in Fixing CO content of 30 As presented in  As presented in Previous researches showed that the SnO The phase components of the roasted products (Sample A, B, C and D in It was seen from In order to further determine the phase components in the roasted products, SEM–EDS analysis results of Sample D are shown in The results in Previous researches presented a pseudo-binary phase diagram of “SnO–SiO It can be concluded from On the other hand, SnO in the liquid phase of SnSiO Effect of quartz on the volatilization ratio of Sn at roasting temperatures in a range of 950–1100  Quartz has a sharp effect on the reduction behavior of SnO It can be seen from Based on the findings in It is known that SnO SnSiO  Quartz has an obvious effect on the volatilization behavior of SnO SiO The proper CO content range for the tin volatilization is narrow, so it is difficult to be controlled accurately in industrial production. However, the residual quartz in the tin-bearing iron concentrate could help to expand the operation range of CO content and reduction temperature.
