A new class of nanostructured photo-electrocatalyst Eu3+ doped yttrium orthovanadate–zinc oxide–reduced graphene oxide (YVO4:Eu3+–ZnO–RGO) nanohybrid was developed by a simple electrostatic self-assembly at room temperature, using ZnO, YVO4:Eu3+ and RGO as building blocks. Interaction among YVO4:Eu3+, ZnO and RGO is indicated by variation in hydrodynamic diameter (H
                     D) and zeta potentials of the products as compared to their individual components, thus suggesting that YVO4:Eu3+–ZnO–RGO is a nanohybrid and not a physical mixture. Electrochemical response of this nanohybrid towards the redox couple of Fe(CN)6
                     3−/4− was investigated before and after UV irradiation. Apart from quenching of the green emission of ZnO in photoluminescence spectrum, which serves as a probe to monitor the interfacial electron transfer from excited ZnO to RGO, degradation in electrochemical redox process provides an additional path to monitor interfacial electron transfer.Graphene, a monolayer of sp Zinc oxide (ZnO) exhibits remarkable features such as wide band gap (3.37 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV), photoinduced activity under UV irradiation and high electrochemical stability. These intrinsic properties of ZnO have attracted intensive research efforts towards versatile applications such as electrochemical sensor for the detection of cancer (hepatoma) cells Motivated by these facts, many research groups have incorporated two or more UV active semiconductor oxide nanoparticles (NPs) such as TiO Herein, we report a facile way to incorporate YVO All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. Yttrium nitrate, (Y(NO During synthesis of 5 at.% Eu In the typical procedure, Zinc acetate ((CH Graphite oxide was prepared from graphite according to modified Hummers method The crystallographic phases of YVO The schematic picture of synthesis of YVO As discussed in previous studies, UV irradiation of semiconductor oxide–graphene nanohybrids such as ZnO–graphene and TiO The morphologies of YVO Raman scattering is strongly sensitive to the electronic structure and proves to be an essential tool to characterize graphene nanohybrids as well as other semiconductor oxides. In case of ZnO, a strong peak is appeared at ∼437.0 cm The Raman spectrum of YVO  To further examine the interfacial electron transfer between RGO and ZnO during UV irradiation, electrochemical studies of nanohybrid before and after UV irradiation along with RGO were performed through cyclic voltammetry.
