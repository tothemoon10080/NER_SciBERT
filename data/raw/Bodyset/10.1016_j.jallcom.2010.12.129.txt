Microstructural investigation on Ti63.5Fe30.5Sn6 and Mg72Cu5Zn23 alloys reveals that bimodal eutectic structure containing the synchronization of structural and spatial heterogeneities in the spherical lamellar entity homogeneously forms upon solidification. Furthermore, the bimodal eutectic Ti63.5Fe30.5Sn6 and Mg72Cu5Zn23 alloys present the enhancement of both strength and plasticity at room temperature compared to the recently developed high strength Ti- and Mg-based alloys. This implies that the bimodal eutectic structure can be one of the effective ways to improve the plasticity of the high strength alloys.Nano/ultrafine grained materials or bulk metallic glasses have been highlighted due to an extraordinary high strength compared to conventional coarse grained materials Recently, it has been reported that an outstanding mechanical properties under room temperature compression can be obtained by controlling the spatial heterogeneity, e.g. lamellar spacing, in Fe- In the present study, as a first step to interpret the effect of the bimodal eutectic structure on the strength and plasticity, we have successfully fabricated the bimodal eutectic structure in Ti A Ti    The TEM image in  The Ti This work was supported by the Global Research Laboratory (GRL) Program and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MEST) of
