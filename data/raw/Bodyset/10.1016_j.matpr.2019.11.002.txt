As the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) contains high number of metals, e.g., Au, Cu, Ni, etc., the separation and recovery of Au as one of precious metals have become very interesting in science, environmental and economic purpose. In this study, adsorption as eco-friendly chemical method has been applied for separation and recovery of gold from PCB with chitosan/SiO2 coated on iron sand magnetic material (MM@SiO2/Chi) as a selective natural-based adsorbent. The works included preparation and characterization of adsorbent, metals destruction in PCB, a deep understanding on the adsorbent performance (at pre-determined optimum condition) with repeated use for selective adsorption-desorption of those three metals (Au, Cu and Ni) has been investigated. Result revealed that MM@SiO2/Chi showed a very high performance with repeated use and was selective for Au with the selectivity factors of αAu/Cu and αAu/Ni of 22.68±1.36 and 7.04±0.84, respectively. Gold in PCB with the concentration of 2.93±0.01mg/g could be separated from Cu and Ni with the recovery percentage of 76.12±0.83%.
