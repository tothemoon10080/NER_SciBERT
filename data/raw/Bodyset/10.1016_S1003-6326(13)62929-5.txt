The leaching behavior of main metallic sulphides in zinc concentrate under atmospheric oxygen-rich direct leaching conditions was studied through mineralogical analysis. The results show that the sulphides dissolve obviously except pyrite. Based on the relationship between elemental sulfur and the residual sulphides in the leaching residue, the dissolution of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, covellite and galena is assumed to follow the indirect oxidation reactions, where the acidic dissolution takes place firstly and then the released H2S transfers from the mineral surface into bulk solution and is further oxidized into elemental sulfur. The interface chemical reaction is further supposed as the controlling step in the leaching of these sulphides. The direct electrochemical oxidation reactions are assumed to contribute to the dissolution of pyrrhotite, which is controlled by the diffusion through elemental sulfur layer.
