Modeling natural gas transportation networks poses a number of challenges due to the significant non-linearities associated to the governing equations. Pressure (nodal or p-) formulations and flow (nodal-loop or q-) formulations are the most commonly deployed approaches used to formulate gas flow network models. They treat nodal pressures and pipe branch flow rates as primary unknowns, respectively, and the Newton-Raphson method is the typical choice used to solve the resulting system of pipe network equations. The major disadvantage of Newton-Raphson methods is their tendency to hopelessly diverge when good initializations for the unknown pressure and flow variables are not available. In order to overcome this drawback, a linear-pressure analog approach, applicable to the p-formulation, was recently proposed to formulate an initial-guess-free solution protocol. However, solving the q-formulation rather than the p-formulation would be an alternate, practical, and desirable way to study gas flow in pipeline networks because the system of equations is predominantly linear—with the exception of the loop equations. Linear Theory and Hardy Cross methods have been used in the past solve such q-formulation. Unfortunately, these methods are not initial-guess-free and have been shown to become potentially unstable and thus inefficient because their convergence is also strongly associated with the availability of good initial guesses. This work proposes a linear-rate analog method capable of effectively solving the q-formulation. Through case studies, the proposed linear-rate analog method is shown to be a robust and initial-guess-free solution scheme to effectively model horizontal and inclined natural gas pipeline networks.Reliable modeling of natural gas transportation networks continues to increase in importance as a result of increased energy demands and production from large unconventional gas fields ( Governing equations of gas pipe flow in networks are derived from energy conservation statements for steady state conditions ( In order to overcome this obstacle, This study pursues to extend this previous work by presenting a linear- In the This work aims to solve governing equations for natural gas flow in conduits using the In this summation (Equation It should be reiterated at this point that the resulting system of equations generated using the  Therefore, Equation The earlier successful development of linear-pressure analogs for the solution of gas networks motivated the exploration of linearization of the loop equations in Rearranging Equation On the basis of Equation In Equation  The linearized set can be straightforwardly solved via any linear solver of simultaneous equations, and flow rates can be calculated as a result. With flow rates and the specified nodal pressure in the problem, nodal pressure distribution can be directly calculated along with pipe pressure ratios ( In this section, the linear rate analog is implemented to solve the same horizontal pipeline network presented by    Additional numerical experiments were carried to quantify the impact of using different initial Expressing the linear rate analog resistivity terms using Equation Therefore, for the very first iteration, this equation becomes: In order to consider the elevation of the pipeline network, Equation In this case, the pipeline conductivity is written in terms of equivalent pipe lengths, as shown in Equation In Equation Following the development presented in Equations As a result, Kirchhoff's second law (Equation Again, ξ Linear- In this work, a linear Linear- The numerical performance of the linear- The linear- Computational savings associated with the use of linear-  American Gas Association pipeline conductivity of a pipe branch connected by nodes gas demand at an arbitrary node pipeline diameter pipeline toughness Fanning friction factor elevation difference between nodes pipeline length pressure of an arbitrary node gas flow rate of a pipe branch connected by nodes pipeline node pressure ratio pipeline specific resistivity gas constant, with a magnitude of 10.732 pipeline resistivity of pipe branch connected by node pipe elevation parameter gas supply at an arbitrary node temperature gas compressibility factor  gas specific gravity Linear- gas equation unit conversion factor directional sign term of a close pipeline loop transformation variable  average value equivalent branch upstream node branch downstream node standard condition first iteration
