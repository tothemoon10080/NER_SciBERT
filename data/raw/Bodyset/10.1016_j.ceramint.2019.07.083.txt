This paper is focused on the physical evaluation of ceramic granules of Al2O3, Al2O3-13 wt% TiO2 (AT-13) and TiO2 obtained from alumina and titania nanoparticles by pelletisation in a rotating drum. The results were compared with those of both sintered and non-sintered granules of similar chemical compositions and particle size distributions which were spray dried, as well as with those of TiO2 pelletised granules blended with atomised alumina particles. The results obtained indicated that the physical characteristics of the pelletised granules conferred them a free-flowing behavior which was similar to that of the spray-dried granules. However, the TiO2 pelletised granules blended with harder atomised alumina particles disintegrated and, therefore, exhibited a poor flowability. Additionally, it was evident that the ceramic coatings fabricated from pelletised granules displayed a structure which was as or more compact than those of the granules obtained from agglomerated powders by spray drying with or without sintering, apart from being more compact than that of the coatings deposited from TiO2 pelletised granules blended with atomised alumina particles. The above findings indicate that the alternative pelletising method is potentially useful for the use of agglomerated nanoparticles as feedstock in the fabrication of bi-modal structured flame-sprayed ceramic coatings.Bi-modal structured thermally sprayed ceramic coatings, fabricated from either nanometric or submicrometric agglomerated particles, are being widely used to protect metallic substrates owing to their good performances in demanding mechanical and thermal conditions and in biomedical and environmental applications, among others [ Nanometric or submicrometric agglomerated powders, which are commercially available for thermal spraying, are mainly granulated by spray drying process [ In the spray drying process, an aqueous suspension of nanometric or submicrometric particles containing a binder is atomised trough a nozzle, which allows control of the size, distribution, trajectory and speed of the drops. Furthermore, it is possible to control the energy required to form an aerosol according to the size distribution and the content of starting particles in the suspension, as well as by the feed rate. Each drop which is constituted by water, particles and binder is exposed to a hot air flow in a drying chamber, where the heat required to evaporate the liquid is supplied; the hot air drags the dry particles with it towards the classifier cyclone. Thanks to the interactions between the particles in the drying chamber (collisions, electrostatic effects and the effect of the added binder), the formation of agglomerated materials with different morphologies and particle size distributions is achieved. Subsequently, the agglomerated particles are transported to the classifier cyclone, wherein the bigger particles fall into a collector cup located at the bottom. Finally, the finer particles are dragged upwards through the gas exhaust pipe to a filter, where they are collected [ On the other hand, tumble or growth agglomeration (also called pelletisation) is performed in inclined discs (pans) or rotating drums. It is widely used in mineral processing and fertiliser granulation in order to obtain high-density “balls” or pellets with a granule size distribution of 2–20 mm by means of the tumbling action caused by the balance between gravity and centrifugal forces [ In this study, a nozzle developed by the University of Antioquia-Colombia was used to spray a binder in a rotating drum in order to agglomerate nanoparticles by an alternative pelletisation method. The granules obtained were used as feedstock material to fabricate bi-modal structured thermally sprayed coatings. The coatings obtained were compared with those sprayed from sintered and non-sintered granules which were spray dried, as well as with that fabricated from Al The alumina and titania powders fabricated by US Research Nanomaterials Inc, with average particle sizes of 80 and 18 nm, respectively, were agglomerated in the laboratory by using both the alternative pelletisation method and the conventional spray drying process in order to obtain Al Furthermore, the commercial alumina microparticles manufactured by Oerlikon Metco, namely SFP 105™, were atomised in an oxy-fuel flame and subsequently blended with 13 wt% TiO The Oerlikon Metco, SFP 105™ Al The powders produced in the laboratory, as well as those commercially fabricated by Oerlikon Metco, namely 6103™, 6221™ and 6231A™, which correspond to Al An alternative pelletisation method was used to agglomerate nanoparticles in a rotating drum, which was equipped with a binder feeder system which comprised a peristaltic pump Masterflex Prior to the pelletisation process, the viscosity and wettability of the aqueous binder solutions with different weight percentages of polyvinyl alcohol were measured; these solutions were then pumped and sprayed using the feeder system of the equipment in order to determine which of them can be atomised to produce a fog. The viscosity was measured according to ASTM Agglomeration tests were previously carried out to establish the most adequate parameters for obtaining granules with the particle size distribution indicated above. Better granules were obtained by feeding 15 g of powder into the drum, which was subsequently rotated at 80 rpm in order to produce a cascading motion of the particles. Subsequently, the following were pumped through the internal hose of the feeder system: 5.45 ml of the binder solution for Al A Toption TP S-15™ spray dryer ( The spray drying parameters were established from the preliminary tests carried out to obtain granules which are suitable for the fabrication of coatings by flame spraying process. The morphology of the agglomerates obtained in the laboratory by pelletisation and spray drying methods, as well as of those fabricated from Oerlikon Metco 6103™, 6221™ and 6231A™, was analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which was carried out using JEOL JSM-6490LV equipment. Additionally, the particle size distribution was determined from the SEM images by using Image J software. Considering that the flowability of the feedstock powders in the thermal spraying equipment used to fabricate the coatings is based on Hausner ratio, this parameter was determined for the particles agglomerated in the laboratory, as well as for those of Oerlikon Metco. The particles agglomerated in the laboratory, as well as those fabricated by Oerlikon Metco 6103™, 6221™ and 6231A™, were used as the feedstock powders for obtaining flame-sprayed coatings by using an electromechanical chamber, which was equipped with a Castolin Eutectic Terodyn 2000™ torch. This chamber was fabricated by the University of Antioquia-Colombia and allows control of the flow rates of the powders, the combustion and powder feed gases, the spraying speed, and the spraying distance; it also measures the preheating temperature of the substrate, among other spraying parameters. In order to identify the coating samples, they were codified according to the chemical composition and powder preparation process, as follow. A was used to denote Al The flame used to fabricate the coatings was produced by feeding to the torch mixtures of acetylene and oxygen (indicated in The substrate on which each coating was deposited was selected according to its potential application. The alumina and AT-13 coatings are generally used to protect steels exposed to tribological effects, whereas those of TiO The enthalpy of the flame used to fabricate the coatings was calculated using the Jets&Poudres software, based on the spraying parameters shown in The structures of the coatings were analysed at their cross sections by using SEM; the cross sections were obtained after mounting the samples with an epoxy resin and cutting with a diamond blade. Finally, the samples were grinded and polished according to ASTM On the other hand, the Vickers microhardness was measured on the polished surface of each coating according to ASTM SEM observations allowed us to establish the idea that all the powders are constituted of particles with micrometric size distributions, as shown in Furthermore, blowholes were evidenced in some of the particles spray dried in the laboratory which were not sintered, as observed in For its part, the AT-13 blended powder is constituted by solid and spherical alumina particles (d Regarding the Oerlikon Metco 6103™, 6221™ and 6231A™ commercial powders, it was evident that they were more spherical than the powders spray dried in the laboratory ( The size and geometry of the particles in a powder affect its flowability, since they influence the inter-particulate interactions. Hausner ratio predicts the propensity of a given powder sample to be compressed. This parameter is used to express flowability, since it reflects the importance of inter-particulate interactions. These interactions are generally less significant for a free-flowing powder, for which the bulk and tapped densities will be relative close in magnitude [ The aforementioned results indicate that the bulk and tapped densities of the granules processed in the laboratory by pelletisation and spray drying without sintering, as well as those of the Oerlikon-Metco 6103™, 6221™ and 6231A™ spray-dried and sintered powders, are relatively close in magnitude. Further, these powders can be considered as free-flowing, since their Hausner ratios are lower than 1.25. However, it is important to note that the powders agglomerated in the laboratory by pelletisation and spray drying were not sintered and, consequently, they could be more friable than those commercially available, which were manufactured by spray drying and sintering. On the other hand, although the alumina atomised particles can be considered as free-flowing owing to the Hausner ratio being 1.14, the Hausner ratio of the AT-13 blended powder is 1.32, which suggests a poor flowability which is attributed to the small size of TiO The SEM images indicated that the structure of the alumina coatings sprayed from powders contains fully melted lamellae (FML), cracks, voids or pores, as well as partially melted particles (PMP) and partially melted lamellae (PML), which are characteristic of thermally sprayed coatings [ It was possible to establish that, in the alumina coatings, the structure of the A Additionally, it was evident that the fine particles in the PML of the A The large quantity of the PMP which constitute the A A previous study has indicated that the hottest zone of the oxyacetylene flame produced from a mixture similar to that used to fabricate this coating displays a length close to 85 mm and a temperature which reaches 2180 °C [ The enthalpies of the flames used to spray the coatings from pelletised and spray-dried granules were 5739 and 6067 J/s, respectively. The energies of these flames were sufficient to melt the pelletised and spray-dried granules, which were not sintered, but insufficient to melt the spray-dried and sintered granules manufactured by Oerlikon Metco. These results indicate that the growth of the particles which constitute the spray-dried granules during the sintering process makes it difficult to melt them. Additionally, the more compact structure of pelletised granules facilitates the sintering of fine particles that constitute them, during their flight in the flame, which increases their cohesion and the size of the fine particles remaining in the PML of the A On the other hand, it was evident that the fine particles constituting the PML of the coating sprayed from granules spray dried without sintering were not sufficiently sintered to resist the energy applied by the electron beam during the SEM analysis, which resulted in their detachment from the coating; see Similar to those of the alumina samples, the structure of the AT-13 coatings is constituted by FML, PML, PMP, pores or voids and cracks, which are characteristic of bi-modal structured thermally sprayed coatings [ Furthermore, the SEM analysis allowed us to establish the fact that the addition of 13 wt% TiO From the above findings, the structure of the AT-13 coatings is composed of lamellae with a good stacking, even in the coating fabricated from the spray-dried and sintered granules of Oerlikon-Metco 6221™, which is constituted by submicrometric particles, which can be harder to melt in the flame ( Additionally, it was evident that the quantity of PML (which retain the fine particles that constitute the granules used to fabricate the coatings) in the structure of AT-13c coating is higher than those in AT-13p and AT-13s. This is because AT-13c was thermally sprayed from granules composed of submicrometric particles, whereas AT-13p and AT-13s coatings were fabricated from granules shaped by nanoparticles, being the last ones easier to melt completely. Furthermore, the fine particles in the PML of these three coatings remained well bonded together and no detachment due to the electron beam was observed during the SEM analysis, which indicated that these particles were sufficiently sintered during the formation of the coating ( For its part, the structure of the AT-13 coating fabricated from alumina atomised particles blended with TiO The above findings indicate that the enthalpy of the flame (5739 J/s) used to fabricate this coating is excessive for retaining the fine titania particles in its structure, nevertheless, a flame with a lower enthalpy (5223 J/s) was not used because it could not melt the atomised alumina particles. Furthermore, the low thickness of this coating, which was caused by the low flowability of the feedstock powder, which hindered its continuous supply during the thermal spraying process, is evident ( SEM analysis of the TiO The cumulative distribution functions for the microhardness values of the coatings with changes in the Weibull modulus are shown in As is evident in Alumina and titania nanopowders were agglomerated using an alternative drum pelletisation method to obtain granules of Al The results indicate that drum pelletisation allows us to obtain micro-sized, spherical-shaped and compact granules, with free-flowing, which are similar to those obtained by spray drying with or without sintering. Although the pelletised granules exhibit sufficient mechanical resistances for transport and thermal spraying, when they come in contact with harder particles like atomised alumina, they can be disintegrated, which decreases their flowability. The fact that compact and mechanically resistant granules can be obtained by drum pelletisation without sintering to prevent the growth of the fine particles constituting them, which improves the melting ability of these granules in an oxyacetylene flame, makes it possible to use them as feedstock in the fabrication of flame-sprayed coatings. Drum pelletisation is a suitable method of agglomerating nanoparticles, with low water and energy consumptions; the agglomerates can be used as feedstock for thermally sprayed coatings, even for those of alumina, which are difficult to flame spray, to obtain a bi-modal yet compact structure. According to the aforementioned details, drum pelletisation is an alternative method which can replace the spray drying and sintering processes and is frequently used in the preparation of granules which are used as raw materials in the fabrication of bi-modal structured coatings.
