The structure of the rock mass is a very important information, according to the results of the work of many researchers, the main parameter is taken into account to estimate the correct fragmentation as the structure of the rock mass by the discontinuities that divide them, the purpose of our work is systematically and numerically measure the orientation of discontinuities by the method of structural analysis after sampling lines using the technology of the stereographic projection of St√©reonet Version 2015 system in terms of the aggregate quarry Heliopolis - Guelma - Algeria and adequately characterize the massif by the method of scan line to determine the orientation and location of the main families, to estimate a number of geometric parameters such as distance, frequency, surface area and the fracture density. The results have shown that the massive studied through four operating areas is cut by three main families of discontinuities, a dominant primary family orientation inclined position, a prominent family in secondary vertically oriented position, tertiary family in predominantly horizontal orientation position. The structural analysis distinguished the average fracture density.
