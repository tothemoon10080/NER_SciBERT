Management of pilon fractures of the distal tibia remains a challenge due to significant soft tissue injury, bone comminution and articular damage. Surgical treatment can be associated with complications leading to poor outcome. This study evaluates the medium term outcome of early, definitive fixation of these fractures with a fine wire circular Ilizarov frame, initially, spanning ankle joint. 58 consecutive patients (mean age 43 years) between 2006 and 2010 consisting of 35 type III fractures, 16 type II and 7 type I fractures (Ruedi and Allgower) were reviewed with a mean follow up of 2.75 years. Outcome was analysed using clinical, radiological and a foot and ankle disability index. All complications were recorded. Good outcome with low complication rate was achieved with this technique.
