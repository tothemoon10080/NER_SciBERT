Imdex Ltd has decided to retain its micaceous iron oxide (MIO) business after all. Last year, the company had declared that this was a non-core business and put it up for auction. Evidently, no serious candidates came forward to purchase the business. Now Imdex is spending A$1.5 M on an upgrading programme, covering its mineral processing, milling and warehousing facilities at Jandakot (Western Australia). The companyâ€™s deposit at Mount Gould is considered to be the largest known deposit of micaceous iron oxide in the world, with reserves of 236,000 tonnes. The Jandakot processing plant currently produces about 6000 tonnes/y of marketable material. Industrial Minerals, May 2003, (428), 9
