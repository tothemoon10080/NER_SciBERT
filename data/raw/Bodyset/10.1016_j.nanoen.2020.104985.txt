Advances in surface chemistry and manipulation of fully inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (CsPbI3-QDs) have enabled improving the charge transport and photovoltaic performance of CsPbI3-QD thin films by replacing their native long-chain, insulating ligands with short-chain ligands. However, the conventional approach based on formamidinium (FA) replacement removes the hydrophobic protective layer, opening the path for moisture penetration and resulting in poor device stability. We demonstrate that short-chain and hydrophobic phenethylammonium (PEA) cations, instead of FA, are efficiently incorporated only onto CsPbI3-QD surfaces, confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared, H nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations. PEA incorporation leads simultaneously to improved photovoltaic performance and moisture stability of resultant CsPbI3-QDs without any change in size, fully inorganic composition, and dimensionality of CsPbI3-QDs. Therefore, PEA-incorporated CsPbI3-QD solar cells show a high device power conversion efficiency of 14.1% and high moisture stability, retaining over 90% of the initial performance after 15 days under ambient conditions.Fully inorganic CsPbX Hydrophobic colloidal synthetic methods using long-chain hydrocarbon ligands such as oleate (OLE) and oleylammonium (OLA) afford high-quality, monodisperse CsPbI To explain in details, hydrophobic OLAs occupy the A sites of ABX Low-dimensional (i.e., 2D or quasi-2D) layered perovskites are considered as potential candidates to address the low moisture and ambient stabilities of 3D organic/inorganic hybrid perovskites [ Herein, we demonstrate that aromatic-ring-based phenylalkylammoniums are used for replacing bulky OLA ligands of CsPbI Lead (II) iodide (PbI Synthesis and purification process of CsPbI Fluorine-doped Tin Oxide (FTO) substrates were sonicated in order of detergent water, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol each for 10 min for washing. In order to remove contaminants, the washed FTO substrates were irradiated in an UV/O Current density‒voltage ( Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy were employed utilizing a Thermo Scientific Nicolet6700. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured with using an AVANCE Ⅲ 400 (Bruker) instrument. The mass spectroscopy was employed utilizing a JMS-700 MStation mass spectrometer (JEOL) and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) was used as a matrix solvent for the measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns was obtained by a Bruker D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ ¼ 1.5406 Å). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were gained utilizing a Hitachi HF-3300 and W electron source. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption were carried out utilizing a PerkinElmer Lambda750 UV–vis–near infrared spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured employing a Horiba Scientific Flouromax-4 spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired using a Hitachi SU8230. The electroluminescence (EL) spectra were obtained using a QE Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optic). The space charge limited current (SCLC) curves of each electron- and hole-only device were measured by Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under dark. The electron and hole mobilities were calculated based on the Mott-Gurney equation following the previous report [ DFT calculations were carried out using the Quickstep module [ Monodisperse CsPbI FT-IR spectra revealed the relative amounts of native insulating ligand residuals on the Ac-exchanged CsPbI We sought to replace the OLA ligands with aromatic-ring-based phenylalkylammonium cations (i.e., PA, BA, PEA) instead of FA. We first investigated the effect of neat EtAc solvent on the Ac-exchanged thin film before post-treating with a phenylalkylammonium iodide solution. Neat EtAc treatment (pink line) decreased the oleyl and ammonium IR peaks, indicating that OLA ligands were detached from the QD surfaces and even partially remained [ Replacement of OLA ligands with phenylalkylammonium cations was further investigated using a Mass spectra were also measured and normalized to the intensity of the Cs It has been reported that the black cubic-phase of CsPbI We also confirmed the cubic-phase stabilities using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of Ac-exchanged CsPbI We obtained HR-TEM images of Ac-exchanged CsPbI Based on the above-discussed results, we found that the native long-chain OLA ligands are successfully exchanged to short-chain FA and PEA cations via FAI and PEAI post-treatment (10 s) of Ac-exchanged CsPbI These phenomena were confirmed using PL spectra in details ( We also investigated the PL spectra of FAI and PEAI time-dependent post-treatment on Ac-exchanged CsPbI We performed HR-TEM measurements to investigate the morphological changes arising from FAI and PEAI post-treatment with different reaction times ( We fabricated solar cells using Ac-exchanged CsPbI Ac-exchanged CsPbI The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra obtained from Ac-exchanged CsPbI We also investigated the device stabilities of Ac-exchanged CsPbI Ac-exchanged CsPbI It has been known that CsPbI We demonstrated the incorporation of aromatic-ring-based PEA cations, instead of conventional short-chain, hygroscopic FA cations, into the A sites of CsPbI  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
