The comparison of different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), i.e. ultraviolet (UV)/TiO2, O3, O3/UV, O3/UV/TiO2, Fenton and electrocoagulation (EC), is of interest to determine the best removal performance for the destruction of the target compound in an Acid Orange 6 (AO6) solution, exploring the most efficient experimental conditions as well; on the other hand, the results may provide baseline information of the combination of different AOPs in treating industrial wastewater. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) in the effects of individual and combined ozonation and photocatalytic UV irradiation, both O3/UV and O3/UV/TiO2 processes exhibit remarkable TOC removal capability that can achieve a 65% removal efficiency at pH 7 and O3 dose=45mg/L; (2) the optimum pH and ratio of [H2O2]/[Fe2+] found for the Fenton process, are pH 4 and [H2O2]/[Fe2+]=6.58. The optimum [H2O2] and [Fe2+] under the same HF value are 58.82 and 8.93mM, respectively; (3) the optimum applied voltage found in the EC experiment is 80V, and the initial pH will affect the AO6 and TOC removal rates in that acidic conditions may be favorable for a higher removal rate; (4) the AO6 decolorization rate ranking was obtained in the order of O3

The spent dye solution, along with unreacted chemicals, is discharged into the wastewater treatment system. Residual colors in wastewater are difficult to remove entirely by biological and/or chemical treatment processes. The effluent containing residual color and compounds that are not easily biodegradable, may cause environmental concerns and may be aesthetically displeasing. Although sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) added to effluent may remove residual colors effectively, its high cost and environmental problems of biological toxicity must be taken into consideration Ozonation is one of the AOPs that has been applied in water treatment for years. Because of its strong oxidative ability, ozone can degrade organic pollutants The Fenton reaction is one popular AOP method in decolorization that combines Fe Decolorization occurs mainly through the reaction of OH Electrocoagulation (EC) has been developed in recent years and employs the electrochemical reaction to produce metal ions at the anode, causing the metal ions to immediately undergo further spontaneous reactions to produce corresponding hydroxides and/or polyhydroxides at the cathode The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of six AOPs, i.e. UV/TiO The chemical structure of AO6 is shown in All ozonation experiments were performed in an airtight reactor with an effective volume of 5.5 The Fenton process serves both oxidation and coagulation functions in this study. H The reactor for the EC experiments was designed and the flow diagram is illustrated in The AO6 stock solution was prepared prior to all ozonation experiments, and the pH of the AO6 solution was adjusted to the desired value by adding phosphorous buffering solution (Aldrich). The experimental conditions were divided into three systems: O Liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor at desired time intervals in the course of the experiments to analyze their properties. The residual dissolved ozone in the samples was removed by stripping with nitrogen. According to the test results, the residual dissolved ozone with the initial value of 5 The Fenton experiments were carried out in a stirred batch reactor and the temperature was controlled at 25 The stock solution was adjusted to the desired pH (4.5, 7 and 10) by adding HCl and NaOH and pumped upward through the serpentine channel between the iron plates at a feed rate of 0.9 A UVâ€“vis detector (Model Cintra 20, GBC Scientific Equipment, Australia) was used to examine visible wavelength from 400 to 700 The results of conventional parameters of ozonated AO6 solution are shown in The effects of   The Fenton experiments in this study can be divided into two stages, one is to find the optimum pH for maximum degradation; the other is to apply the optimum pH and explore the effects of different ratios of Fe Effect of the different ratios of [H Under the same HF, the increase of [H The experiments using the EC process in this study were intended to explore the effects of applied voltages and pH on AO6 decolorization and TOC removal. The EC process includes three reactions: electrolytic reactions, coagulant formation, and removal of the coagulation of the pollutant with coagulant by floatation or sedimentation The effect of pH was investigated and carried out at pH 4.5, 7 and 10 with  The AO6 decolorization and TOC removal efficiency results of selected AOP methods are illustrated in The comparison of different AOPs is, on the one hand, of interest to determine the best removal performance and the most efficient experimental conditions for the destruction of target compound in dye solution, and, on the other hand, to provide useful information for the baseline of the combination of different AOPs in treating industrial wastewater. The following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental work: Photocatalytic ozonation exhibits remarkable TOC removal efficiency, in that both O The optimum pH and the ratio of [H The optimum applied voltage for the EC experiment is 80 Among the investigated AOPs in this study, the quickest AO6 decolorization rate was obtained by Fenton process. The ranking was in the order of UV The support of this project by the National Science Council (Project No. NSC 91-2211-E-002-024) of Executive Yuan, ROC, is gratefully acknowledged.
