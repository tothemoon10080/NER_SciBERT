Despite the potential application of lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) battery, recovering Ti and Li from the spent batteries remains a largely unexplored but important topic. In this contribution, a process including leaching, extraction for the separation of titanium from leaching liquor and synthesizing TiO2 nano-particles by a homogeneous precipitation method is presented as a successful strategy. Various operating parameters were optimized, affording more than 97% leaching efficiency of both Ti and Li at a sulfuric acid solution of 4M, H2O2 of 20vol.%, solid-to-liquid ratio of 0.025gmL−1, leaching temperature of 80°C and leaching time of 4h. In the case of the extraction, the solvent extraction efficiency of titanium about 99% can be achieved with 30vol.% primary amine N1923 as an extractant and kerosene as a diluent at highly acidic condition, organic phase/aqueous phase (O/A) ratio 2:1 within 10min of contact time in ambient temperature, while the solvent extraction efficiency of lithium is only 1.4%. The raffinate was concentrated from 0.74gL−1 to 1.11gL−1 by evaporation, then lithium carbonate was precipitated by adding saturated solution of sodium carbonate affording 85% recovery. Finally, the stripping was fast with equilibrium time of 10min with 2M H2SO4 and titanium stripping of 98%. The results of XRD and SEM show that the size of as-prepared TiO2 powders is 100–200nm from the stripped solution by the homogeneous precipitation method.Nowadays, lithium titanate (Li An alternative approach to addressing the spent batteries as well as obtaining high value-added metal salts is to separate electrode materials from the current collector prior to acid leaching. The overall recycling technology consists of two broad categories: physical based technologies and chemical based technologies ( Many reagents were tested for the solvent extraction of titanium (IV) from sulfuric acid solution (  Primary amine extraction system composed of primary amine N1923 ( The recovered titanium obtained by an extraction process is a feasible alternative for producing high purity TiO Based on the previous findings, a promising process for recovering titanium and lithium from spent lithium titanate battery and producing TiO During the recovery process, the spent Li The leaching experiments were investigated to determine the optimum leaching efficiency of spent Li At the end of each leaching, a sample of the aqueous phase was analyzed. The leaching solution was diluted with double distilled water. Primary amine N1923 was treated by sulfuric acid solution. For the determination of extraction distribution isotherms, the required acidity for the aqueous feed was adjusted with H First, sodium sulfite solution was added dropwise into the solution for removing hydrogen peroxide complex, and then urea and SDBS were mixed with the above solution under stirring condition at 95 The metal concentrations in solutions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer instruments, U.S.A.). The obtained nanometer TiO The effect of acid concentration on the leaching of Ti and Li was examined using 20 The effect of H   It can be seen in In this study, the extraction of titanium using N1923–kerosene system from sulfuric acid leaching liquor is investigated. The leaching liquor contains 5.62 The effect of N1923 concentration (10–50 The effect of O/A ratio on the extraction of titanium and lithium is studied at maintaining 30 Titanium loaded organic containing 5.55 Sodium sulfite solution was dropped into the stripping solution until the solution became colorless, which was crucial because the orange-red titanium hydrogen peroxide complex is stable and difficult to be precipitated and hydrolyzed. As noted by several studies ( The raffinate was concentrated from 0.74 Based on the experiment of the leaching process, the use of a reductive agent H The extraction studies showed that the Ti extraction percentage achieved 98.8% at 30 Nano-scale anatase TiO The authors acknowledge with gratitude the financial support of the
