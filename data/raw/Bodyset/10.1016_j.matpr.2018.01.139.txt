Light weight, high strength metallic alloys are of primary interest in the present day industries. Aluminium alloys occupy a unique position in industries because of its light weight. Lately much work has going on in enhancing the mechanical properties of the Aluminium by Friction Stir Processing (FSP), which is a surface modification technique. The various process parameters for FSP have a significant impact on the end result. The present study investigates the effect of various process parameters on Friction Stir Processing of Aluminium alloys. The process parameters selected for this study are speed (rpm), feed (mm/min) and depth of cut (mm). Three levels of speed, feed and depth of cut were selected and experiments were designed on the basis of Taguchi Orthogonal array. Experiments were conducted on CNC machine with specially designed FSP tool, having shoulder diameter of 20mm and pin diameter of 5mm. Optimum parameters value were obtained using Taguchi method. Confirmation experiments were also carried out. The documented results show that the micro hardness of the Aluminium gets improved during FSP.
