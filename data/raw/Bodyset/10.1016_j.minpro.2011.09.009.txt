In a number of unit operations (e.g., leaching and dewatering) used for valuable metal (e.g., copper, gold) recovery from mineral ores, the process water quality may significantly impact on slurries' rheological behavior. In this study the effect of dissolved ions' type (Al(III), Fe(III), Cu(II) and K+) and concentration on muscovite slurries' interfacial chemistry modification and rheological behavior was investigated in the pH range 3–10 and 25°C. At alkaline pH, specifically adsorbed metal ions and/or their surface nucleated hydroxide products dominated the particles' interfacial chemistry leading to formation of weak to moderate gelform slurry. The higher shear yield stresses displayed in the pH range 5–10, is attributed to enhanced van der Waals attraction and emergence of additional attractive forces (e.g., electrostatic-charge patch, adsorbed ion-particle bridging, surface nucleation and cementation). At pH<4, however, the mineral surface chemistry changes were consistent with adsorbed hydrated metal ions and slurry displayed dispersed sol behavior due to repulsive hydration or structural forces. The extent of slurry shear yield stress enhancement/attenuation, induced by particles' zeta potential changes, strongly depended upon pH and metal ions' type and concentration. At high ionic strength (0.10–0.60M), the metal ion mediation decreased in the order of Al(III)>Cu(II)>Fe(III)>K+ for zeta potential and Fe(III)>Cu(II)>Al(III)>K+ for pulp rheology. At low ionic strength (0.01–0.06M), whilst the metal ion-mediated zeta potential changes followed the same order, for rheology enhancement it changed to Cu(II)>Al(III)>K+
                     >Fe(III).Effective control of the rheological behavior of concentrated aqueous mineral dispersions sometimes becomes challenging due to intractable gel formation encountered during hydrometallurgical operations ( Enhancement of rheology of colloidal dispersions mainly occurs due to surface/interfacial chemistry modification leading to the predominance of attractive DLVO (e.g., van der Waals, electrostatic) and/or development of non-DLVO (e.g., cementation, ion–ion correlation) forces ( Several studies have shown the influence of hydrolysable metal ions and the resulting specific adsorption of metal hydroxy complexes on particle surfaces resulted in increased attraction between particles and enhanced rheological behavior ( Muscovite (ideally, KAl The first objective of the present work is to investigate the influence of Al(III), Fe(III), Cu(II) and K High purity (> For interfacial chemistry characterization, the particle zeta potential ( Rheological behavior of 30 The non-Newtonian and Bingham plastic behavior of low shear yield stress dispersions was revealed by the flow curves measured with the concentric cylinder rheometer. As the estimation of shear rate values by Haake rheometer's software is routinely based on Newtonian behavior approximation, it needs to be corrected for non-Newtonian fluids ( The corrected flow curves were fitted with a simple two-parameter Bingham plastic model (Eq. Particle zeta potential of 8 In return pH sweep, as the dispersion pH was raised from 3 to 10, zeta potential curves followed different paths reflected in a bifurcation and slight shift of the iep to a higher pH value (CR2). Noticeably, the magnitude of particle zeta potentials on return pH sweep is dispersion solid loading-dependent. The higher the solid content, the greater the bifurcation effect or the smaller the magnitudes of negative zeta potentials on return pH sweep. These observations are in good agreement with previous studies on high-Fe substituted muscovite ( Complementary solution speciation analysis performed to further probe the links between observed zeta potential trends and the concomitant pulp chemistries.

Similar pH-dependent shear yield stress data have been reported for fluorite, kaolinite, silica, zirconium oxide and ammonium phosphate dispersions in the presence of Al(III), Fe(III) and Cu(II) ions ( The influence of supernatant Al(III), Fe(III), Cu(II) and K Financial support for the project from
