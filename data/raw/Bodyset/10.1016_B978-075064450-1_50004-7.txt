This chapter explains different ore handling procedures that may account for 30-60% of the total delivered price of raw materials and covers the processes of transportation, storage, feeding, and washing of the ore en route to, or during, its various stages of treatment in the mill. Since the physical state of ores in situ may range from friable or even sandy material to monolithic deposits with the hardness of granite, the methods of mining and provisions for the handling of freshly excavated material vary extremely widely. Ore that has been well broken can be transported by trucks, belts, or even by sluicing, but large lumps of hard ore may need individual blasting. Modern developments in microsecond delay fuses and plastic explosive have resulted in more controllable primary breakage and easier demolition of very large occasional lumps. The broken ore from the pit, after blasting, is loaded directly into trucks, holding up to 200t of ore in some cases, and transported directly to the primary crushers. Storage of such ore is not always practicable, because of its “long-ranged” particle size that causes segregation during storage, the fines working their way down through the voids among the larger particles. Extremely coarse ore is sometimes difficult to start moving once it has been stopped. The ore is transported through the passes via chutes and tramways and is loaded into skips, holding as much as 30t of ore, to be hoisted to the surface. Large rocks are often crushed underground by primary breakers in order to facilitate loading and handling at this stage.
