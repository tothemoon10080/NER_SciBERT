In the present paper, the interactions between a cavitation bubble and a spherical particle are experimentally investigated with the aid of high-speed camera. The cavitation bubble is generated by a focused laser beam with the bubble size adjusted through energy dissipater. A series of experimental work is conducted with variations of the bubble sizes, the particle sizes and the distance between the bubble and the particle. Based on the collapsing process of cavitation bubble near the particle, three cases (mushroom-shaped, pear-shaped and spherical-shaped collapses) are quantitatively identified and the criterions for separating three cases are also given in terms of non-dimensional parameters. Furthermore, transitions between the aforementioned cases during parameter variations are also shown together with several examples. Finally, some special cases (e.g. collapse of two bubbles near the particle) are also discussed with typical collapsing process shown.Cavitation plays an important role on the various kinds of flows (e.g. hydraulic machinery In the literature, traditional research methods for investigating the bubble-particle interactions are mainly based on the macroscopic observations In the present paper, the interactions between a laser-induced cavitation bubble and a spherical particle are experimentally investigated with the aid of a high-speed camera. The present study mainly focuses on the influences of the spherical particle on the processes of bubble collapse and the generation of micro-jet of cavitation bubbles. A wide range of parameter zone (e.g. in terms of the bubble radius, the particle radius and the distance between the bubble and the particle) is investigated in detail. The sections of the present paper are organized as follows.  A high-speed camera (Phantom V1212) is employed to record the whole process of the dynamics of the laser-induced cavitation bubble near a stationary particle. In our experiments, several different recording speed (represented by the frames per second, “fps” for short) were employed during experimental tests (e.g. from 90,000 fps to 240,000 fps). Finally, we found that 90,000 fps was fast enough for recording the phenomenon with the exposure time 1 μs for each frame. Hence, if not specified, the interval time between frames is 11.1 μs and the resolution of the images given in the present paper is 256×256. During the experiments, a digital delay generator was employed for the synchronization between illuminating light source and the high-speed camera. The experiments were conducted at the room temperature.  In the present paper, with the given particle fixed in the chamber, a series of experiments with different In Eq. In this section, firstly, a typical process of dynamics of bubbles near a spherical particle is introduced based on our experimental data. Then, all the experimental data are categorized into three typical cases based on the collapsing process of cavitation bubble. For each case, the main characteristics of the case are introduced based on the demonstrating examples. Finally, the transition between different cases with parameter variations are further discussed with the aid of several examples. For the purpose of comparisons,  Here, we take In this section, the primary characteristics of the observed three cases will be introduced.  Case 1: This case corresponds to the data with large value of Case 2: This case corresponds to the data with medium value of Case 3: This case corresponds to the data with small value of In this section, the transitions between different cases are fulfilled with parameter variations (e.g. varying        If we further increase the distance In this section, a quantitative analysis of the parameter zone for the three cases are given and discussed. For the evaluation of  In order to investigate the influence of the scales of the particles on the mechanisms of the bubble-particle interactions, a series of experiments with two other different scales of the particles ( In this section, the interactions between bubbles and a large particle (   Case 1: During the bubble collapse, a mushroom-shaped bubble appears (referring to subplots Nos. 12–14 in Case 2: During the bubble collapse, a pear-shaped bubble appears (referring to subplots Nos. 11–13 in Case 3: As shown in Thus, three typical cases proposed in In this section, the interactions between bubbles and a small particle (   Case 1: During the bubble collapse, a mushroom-shaped bubble appears (referring to subplots Nos. 10–12 in Case 2: During the bubble collapse, an approximately pear-shaped appears in the subplot No. 14 of Case 3: As shown in As shown in the  In this section, except above typical cases, some special phenomena are also observed in our experiments and will be discussed here.   In the present paper, the interactions between a laser-induced cavitation bubble and a stationary and spherical particle have been experimentally investigated with the aid of a high-speed camera. In our paper, cases with different scales of bubbles and particles are analyzed in detail with a focus on the cavitation bubble dynamics (especially the bubble collapsing process and the jet formation). The main characteristics of each case have been qualitatively and quantitatively discussed based on plenty of examples together with the transition between different cases shown. Based on the detailed analysis of our experimental data, the following concluding remarks could be given: The presence of the particle shows great influences on the cavitation bubble dynamics in terms of both the collapsing shape and the jet formation. The phenomenon of bubble-particle interaction could be categorized into three typical cases based on the collapsing process of the cavitation bubble i.e. mushroom-shaped, pear-shaped and spherical-shaped collapse. The scale of particles and bubbles does not show significant influences on the aforementioned three categorized cases but will alter the non-dimensional values separating the three cases. The potential applications of the present findings include the validations of the computational code and the establishment of the bubble-particle interaction model for industrial-scale flow (e.g. coupling with the commercial computational fluid dynamics model). This work was financially supported by the For experimental data with small values of χ, the bubble mainly keeps spherical shape. Hence its maximum bubble radius could be directly obtained using the software Phantom Camera Control (PCC) application. For the experimental data with large values of χ, the shapes of the bubble are non-spherical (e.g. nearly elliptical shape as shown in subplot No. 5 in
