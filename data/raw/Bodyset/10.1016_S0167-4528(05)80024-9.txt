This chapter discusses how the developed theory can be used, and models can be calibrated so that these could provide a framework to link recycling to the CAD design software of the design engineer. It can easily be understood that the weight and composition of the ELV's being the input of the shredding and PST trial are all different and therefore the population of ELV's selected determine the statistics guiding the shredding and PST trial and its achieved mass balance and recycling rate. The recycling rate of passenger vehicles is determined by various statistically distributed parameters, such as the design of the car. Therefore, the calculation of the recycling rate based on this large-scale industrial trial should take cognizance of the statistical nature of the recycling rate. The measured standard deviation around each data point (mass and element flows) are used in the least-square fit to reconcile the mass balance around each individual unit operation in the plant as well as over the total flow sheet, within the statistics of the collected data.
