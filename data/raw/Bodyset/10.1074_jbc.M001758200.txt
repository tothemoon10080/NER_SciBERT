Unique cell cycle control is instituted in confluent osteoblast cultures, driving growth to high density. The postconfluent dividing cells share features with cells that normally exit the cell cycle; p27

                      is decreased, free E2F DNA binding activity is reduced, and E2F4 is primarily nuclear. E2F4-p130 becomes the predominant E2F-pocket complex formed on E2F sites, but, unlike the complex that typifies resting cells, cyclin A and CDK2 are also present. Administration of dexamethasone at this, but not earlier stages, results in reduction of cyclin A and CDK2 levels with a parallel decrease in the associated kinase activity, dissociation of cyclin A-CDK2 from the E2F4-p130 complexes, and inhibition of G1/S transition. The glucocorticoid-mediated cell cycle attenuation is also accompanied by, but not attributable to, increased p27

                      levels. The attenuation of osteoblast growth to high density by dexamethasone is associated with severe impairment of mineralized extracellular matrix formation, unless treatment commences in cultures that have already grown to high density. Both the antimitotic and the antiphenotypic effects are reversible, and both are antagonized by RU486. Thus, glucocorticoids induce premature attenuation of the osteoblast cell cycle, possibly contributing to the osteoporosis induced by these drugs in vivo.glucocorticoid(s) cyclin-dependent kinase CDK inhibitor mouse mammary tumor virus green fluorescent protein dexamethasone internal ribosomal entry site Glucocorticoids (GC), GC are antimitogenic in several cell types. Remarkably, however, this effect is mediated via diverse mechanisms. For example, inhibition of lymphoid cell proliferation, which partly accounts for the anti-inflammatory property of GC, is mediated by a decrease in the levels of G Abrogation of osteoblast cell cycle progression may contribute to impaired bone formation in two ways. First, cell proliferation is simply required to provide enough cells capable of new bone formation. Second, the cell cycle may have additional, more specific roles in phenotype development, similar to the clonal expansion necessary for adipocyte differentiation ( Like other osteoblastic cell lines, MC3T3-E1 cells are phenotypically heterogeneous ( Cell cycle analysis was performed according to Darzynkiewicz For transient transfection assays, MC3T3-E1 cells were plated in six-well plates (80,000 cells/well), and the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method of Chen and Okayama ( Whole cell lysates were prepared using 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 50 m Between 60 and 100 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane using Mini Trans-Blot Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad), and immunodetection was performed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. The fluorographic signals were quantified by densitometry of the film using the AlphaImager 2000 system (Alpha Innotech Corp.) Results from one representative experiment out of three independent experiments ate shown for each analyte. The murine p27 cDNA ( Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (5 μg) were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described ( Whole cell extracts (see above) were subjected to immunoprecipitation essentially as described previously ( Calcium deposition was demonstrated histochemically by Alizarin red staining of 70% ethanol-fixed cultures as described previously ( Tissue culture medium and Hanks' buffer were purchased from Life technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from Omega Scientific (Tarzana, CA). Dexamethasone, RU486, RNase A, protease inhibitors, salmon sperm DNA, mouse IgG, and rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. NaF and Na MC3T3-E1 is a preosteoblastic cell line that undergoes a staged developmental process, leading to deposition and then mineralization of the extracellular matrix within ∼2–4 weeks after plating ( Lack of inhibition of cell cycle progression by GC in preconfluent cultures (Fig. To address the mechanism underlying the GC-mediated attenuation of cell cycle progression in postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells, we initially determined the effect of DEX on expression of the CDIs p21 and p27, which play a role in the antimitogenic activity of GC in hepatoma, lung alveolar, and osteosarcoma cells ( In contrast to p21, Fig. E2F proteins play a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation of numerous cell cycle regulatory genes (reviewed in Ref. Competition analyses were performed to characterize the protein-DNA complexes, initially in preconfluent cultures (Fig. The abundance of E2F4-p130 complexes in preconfluent actively proliferating MC3T3-E1 cells was unexpected, because E2F4-p130 complexes typically form in cells that undergo growth arrest, replacing E2F4-p107 complexes ( Analysis of the E2F complexes in postconfluent untreated MC3T3-E1 cells is presented in Fig. As shown in Fig. To address the hypothesis that DEX inhibits postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cell cycle progression by dissociating cyclin-CDK2 from E2F4-p130 complexes, supershift analysis was performed with antibodies to CDK2, cyclin A, and cyclin E. Indeed, CDK2 antibodies strongly affected the E2F4-p130 complex ( We next addressed the identity of the cyclin component, responsible for tethering (and probably activating) CDK2 to the E2F4-p130 complex of postconfluent nontreated cells. To this end, we added cyclin A antibodies to the supershift reaction that already contained anti E2F4 antibodies. Fig. DEX-induced elimination of cyclin A and CDK2 from E2F4-p130 complexes of postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. Persistence of inhibitory E2F-p130 complexes requires that CDK2 kinase activity be reduced ( To begin addressing the significance of the developmental stage-specific antimitogenic effect of GC to bone formation, we initiated exposure of MC3T3-E1 cultures to DEX on day 3, 4, 5, or 6 ( The pleotropic effects of GC in cells may be explained, in part, by a multitude of mechanisms of action of the activated GR. These mechanisms include transcriptional activation and repression; autonomous action and interactions with other transcription factors ( The antimitogenic activity of GC can be either reversible, such as in murine T-lymphoma ( The restoration of the cell cycle profile following DEX withdrawal prompted us to examine whether the inhibitory effect of DEX on development of the osteoblast phenotype would also be reversible. Cells were treated for 10 days as in Fig. Cell proliferation and differentiation are partially overlapping processes. During the differentiation course of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, a developmental switch occurs, which is responsible for persistent proliferation after confluency. Most notably, the cell cycle that drives growth to high density is inhibited by pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids, while the cell cycle driving growth toward confluency is not. The cell cycle machinery of postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cultures is distinct from that operative in preconfluent cells. Some of the alterations in the cell cycle machinery, which occur during MC3T3-E1 growth to high density, typify cells undergoing growth arrest. Among these alterations are (i) an increase in p27 levels with a reciprocal decrease in p21 levels, as previously reported for rapamycin-arrested T lymphocytes ( MC3T3-E1 cells display a unique behavior of the RB-related protein p130. First, as opposed to many cell types in which p130 is a marker of growth arrest ( Administration of DEX to postconfluent MC3T3-E1 cells results in attenuation of the G Whether the down-regulation of cyclin A and CDK2 alone is sufficient to mediate the GC attenuation of the osteoblast persistent cell cycle remains to be addressed by forced expression of these proteins. However, it is already clear that the antimitogenic mechanism of GC in MC3T3-E1 cells differs from that observed in lymphoid ( Chronic exposure to GC We are indebted to Vijaya Rao and Lian Liang for technical assistance, to Drs. V. Sartorelli for suggestions, and to Drs. J. Lees (MIT), M. Pagano (New York University), A. Schönthal, T. Fung, and F. Hall (University of Southern California) for reagents.
