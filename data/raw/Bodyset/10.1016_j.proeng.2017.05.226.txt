Axial splitting is an important failure mechanism in rock engineering. This failure mechanism is particularly observed in the vicinity of free surfaces of rock structures. Different possibilities such as existence of defects, pores and micro-cracks in the rock specimen have been attributed as the cause of axial splitting in the literature. Based on some physical uniaxial compression tests on Pennsylvania blue sandstone, an alternative theory for axial splitting is proposed. In this theory, axial shear cracks are considered that are induced because of non-uniform deformation of the specimen ends. Dislocation along these axial shear cracks is the cause of rock lateral dilation which results in radial stresses. The radial stresses push out the cylindrical thin shells of the specimen. Consequently, radial cracks are developed which subsequently cause rock spalling in mode-I fracture. The proposed failure mechanism is discussed within the framework of a simplified theoretical model. The prediction of the model is then compared with the physical observations. In addition, a discrete element bonded particle system is utilized for rock simulation in uniaxial compression testing. The prediction of the numerical model is consistent with the physical observations.
