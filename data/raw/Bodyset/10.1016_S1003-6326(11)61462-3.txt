α-Bi2O3 powders were prepared from nanometer Bi powders through low-temperature oxidation at less than 873.15 K. XRD, SEM, TEM and HRTEM were used to characterize the structure and morphology of Bi powders and Bi2O3 particles. Kinetic studies on the bismuth oxidation at low-temperatures were carried out by TGA method. The results show that bismuth beads should be reunited and oxidized to become irregular Bi2O3 powders. The bismuth oxidation follows shrinking core model, and its controlling mechanism varies at different reaction time. Within 0–10 min, the kinetics is controlled by chemical reaction, after that it is controlled by O2 diffusion in the solid α-Bi2O3 layer. The apparent activation energy is determined as 55.19 kJ/mol in liquid-phase oxidation.
