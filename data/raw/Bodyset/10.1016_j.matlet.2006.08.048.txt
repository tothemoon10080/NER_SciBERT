By radiating a linear polyethylenimine–HAuCl4 aqueous solution with natural sunlight, we obtained polyelectrolyte-protected gold nanoparticles, and the size of such gold nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the molar ratio of polyelectrolyte to gold.Nanosized particles of noble metals hold promise for use as advanced materials with novel electronic, optical and thermal properties as well as catalytic properties due to their potential applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, material science and their different interdisciplinary fields Polyelectrolytes have been widely used as both building blocks for the creation of multilayer thin films LPEI and HAuCl The formation of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by UV–vis spectrum of the resulting gold solution, as shown in The morphology and size of as-formed gold nanoparticles were further determined by TEM. To examine the influence of the molar ratio of LPEI to gold on the formation of such gold nanoparticles, we prepared another two gold samples with molar ratio 1:1 and 10:1 of LPEI to gold, respectively.
