This chapter explains the methods of disposal of mill tailings, the disadvantages of earlier disposal processes, and concept of tailing dam. The disposal of mill tailings is a major environmental problem that is becoming more serious with the increasing exploration for metals and the working of lower-grade deposits. Apart from the visual effect on the landscape of tailings disposal, the major ecological effect is usually water pollution, arising from the discharge of water contaminated with solids, heavy metals, mill reagents, and sulphur compounds. Waste must therefore be disposed of in both an environmentally acceptable and, if possible, economically viable manner. Disposal is governed by legislation and may involve long-term rehabilitation of the site. The nature of tailings varies widely; they are usually transported and disposed of as slurry of high water content, but they may be composed of very coarse dry material such as the float fraction from dense medium plants. Because of the lower costs of mining from open pits, ore from such locations is often of very low grade, resulting in the production of large amounts of very fine tailings. The design, construction, and operation of tailings dams are a major consideration for most new mining developments as well as for many existing operations.
