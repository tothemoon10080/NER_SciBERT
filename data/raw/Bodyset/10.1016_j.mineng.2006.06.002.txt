The global scenario marked by decreasing profit margins forces the mining and metallurgical industries to reduce their operating costs, while simultaneously having to find ways to maintain or increase product quality. This becomes all the more difficult with the trend towards more complex, large-scale configurations and plant-wide integration, as well as the tendency to run processes closer to their operational limits, despite a lack of experienced operating staff, owing to increased personnel turnover and downsizing, or lack of adequate training for operators. As a result of these conditions, the use of advanced process engineering tools for improved process operations is fast becoming These were some of the issues that were discussed at the Process Systems for the Metallurgical Industries ’05 symposium held in the Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town, South Africa – a venue that gave ready access to some of South Africa’s premier tourist attractions to the delegates hailing from among other Australia, Belgium, UK, USA, South Africa, Ethiopia, Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The two-day conference, sponsored by Limn (David Wiseman Pty Ltd.), started off with an introductory poster session, where six papers were presented. The poster session was followed by four technical sessions, viz. Process Fault Detection and Identification, Process Modelling and Design, Process Improvement and Optimization, as well as Advanced Control and Smart Sensors. Authors were invited to submit full papers to
