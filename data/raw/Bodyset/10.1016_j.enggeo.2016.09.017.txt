This study presents stability charts for estimating the stability of rock mass slopes that are suitable for the generalized Hoek-Brown (GHB) failure criterion based on the strength reduction technique. First, in order for implementing the GHB strength reduction, the estimation for the local Mohr-Coulomb (MC) friction angle and cohesive strength from the GHB criterion was incorporated into the strength reduction process in ABAQUS 6.10. Second, stability charts for calculating the FOS of rock slopes with a specific slope angle of β

                     =0 are proposed based on this method. Third, the disturbance weighting factors f

                        β
                      are used to quantify the effect of the rock mass disturbance factor and slope angle on the rock slope stability evaluations. Combined with the stability charts based on β

                        β
                      can be used to calculate the FOS of rock slopes with various slope angles under different blast damage and stress relief conditions. Finally, the stability charts were applied to two real case studies to illustrate the applicability and validity. The results for the two cases demonstrated good agreement with those from the other charts and the FEM software ABAQUS 6.10. The proposed charts provide a simple and straightforward way to estimate the FOS of the rock mass slopes directly from the GHB parameters.Conducting stability analyses of rock slopes remains a significant issue for geotechnical engineers because it plays a vital role in many civil and mining engineering projects, such as open pit excavation and large dam construction. Various methods have been proposed for determining rock slope stability. One of the common methods for evaluating rock slope stability is the use of stability charts. Although numerous sophisticated slope stability software packages, such as SLOPE/W, FLAC, and ABAQUS, have made graphical methods and charts obsolete, stability charts are still routinely used in practice because they provide a convenient and efficient tool for the preliminary and rapid assessment of slope safety. The Hoek-Brown (HB) failure criterion surmounts the shortcomings of the conventional MC criterion. It was initially proposed by Hoek and Brown in 1980 and since then, the HB failure criterion has been broadly applied to predict failure in a wide range of intact rock and heavy jointed rock masses as Groups I and III in The However, it remains difficult for engineers to develop the stability charts of rock slopes based on the GHB criterion because there are at least seven input parameters ( Through adopting a simple way to implement the nonlinear strength reduction for GHB criterion, this paper provides stability charts for estimating the FOS of the rock mass slopes directly from the GHB parameters. The proposed charts can be adopted as useful tools for the preliminary stability assessment of a rock slope. According to our review on previous studies, LEM is the most extensive means for evaluating slope stability in the development of stability charts for the GHB criterion, e.g., Recently, In addition, through theoretical derivation, Eq. LAM is another commonly used approach for 3D slope stability analysis to develop the charts for GHB criterion.  As an alternative to LEM or LAM, over the last few years, finite element method with strength reduction technique (SR-FEM) has been widely accepted and used among engineers and researchers because it can not only automatically locate the critical slip surface (shape and location) of the slope, but also take into account the stress-strain behavior and give the progressive shear failure of the slope in complex geometries and loading conditions (e.g., To use the nonlinear strength finite element method for calculating the FOS of rock slopes, the local cohesive strength The stress state of a micro-unit at critical failure is illustrated in According to Eqs. The strength reduction technique is typically applied to the FOS calculations by progressively reducing the MC shear strength parameters (cohesive strength When strength reduction technique for the MC criterion is applied to the slope stability analysis, FOS in Eq. When the nonlinear strength envelope e.g., GHB criterion, is introduced into the slope stability analysis, the above definition of FOS in Eqs. One of the most promising ways to perform the strength reduction for a nonlinear failure envelope like the GHB criterion is to estimate the local MC friction angle and cohesive strength for each element of the slope. Eqs. Build the slope model according to the slope geometry and generate grid elements. When the basic parameters of the rock mass (the deformation modulus The solution obtained for the elastic stress in When the local MC friction angle The elasto-plastic analysis is performed using the reduced When the elasto-plastic iteration calculation arrives at a given number of iterations ( The plane strain illustration for the slope-stability problem investigated in this paper is shown in The investigations of real slope cases demonstrate that the average value of slope angles in a real field is A distinct trend of increases in the FOS with increasing  As illustrated by the relationship between the FOS and the input parameters based on the GHB criterion, the disturbance factor The disturbance weighting factor  The proposed stability charts provide an easy and straightforward way to determine the FOS of a given rock slope. The process can be described as follows: First, the value of FOS This real case, extracted from The parameters for calculating the FOS for Case 1 are summarized and listed in The case selected here for slope instability analysis is a rock slope of the Kisrakdere coal mine in the Soma lignite Basin in western Turkey. The geometry of the failed slope could be illustrated according to the necessary data collected by For this case, The current study presented stability charts for estimating the stability of rock mass slopes based on the GHB criterion using the nonlinear strength reduction technique. The charts presented can be adopted to determine the FOS of rock slopes directly from the GHB parameters ( In order to implement the GHB strength reduction in the FE program ABAQUS 6.10, the estimation for the local MC friction angle and cohesive strength from the GHB criteria was embedded in the strength reduction analysis. Then the validity and effectiveness for this estimation have been tested by a slope example. The results in Base on the GHB strength reduction method, stability charts were proposed in The weighting factors The proposed stability charts were applied to two real case studies to illustrate the applicability and validity of the charts. The results for the two cases demonstrated good agreement with those from the other charts and the FEM software ABAQUS 6.10. This study received financial support from the program
