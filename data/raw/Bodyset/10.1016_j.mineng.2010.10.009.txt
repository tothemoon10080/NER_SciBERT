The atmospheric pressure sulphuric acid leaching characteristics of Adatepe (Eskişehir, Turkey) laterite ore that has recently been put into operation was investigated. The effects of sulphuric acid concentration (5–95%), temperature (20–95°C) and time (30–240min) on leaching were determined by nickel, iron and arsenic analyses. The amounts of Ni, Fe and As in solution were observed to increase with increase of temperature from 20°C to 70°C for sulphuric acid concentrations between 5% and 95%. Further increase of temperature to 95°C showed that the dissolution of Ni, Fe and As were increased until 60% sulphuric acid concentration and over 60% a decrease in the dissolution percentages was observed due to the probable formation of nickel and silicon containing ferric sulphate type compounds that cause nickel loss from the leach solution. Experimental results showed that maximum nickel dissolution of 99.2% at 95°C could be reached in 120min of leaching time for a sulphuric acid concentration of 60%. The congruency of Ni dissolution with respect to Fe was found to be congruent over about 25% Ni and 15% Fe dissolution values. XRD analyses on the residues obtained after leaching showed that it was not required to dissolve all goethite phase to reach maximum dissolution of nickel contained in the sample. An activation energy of 30.36kJ/mole was determined for Ni dissolution showing that leaching is controlled by external diffusion and chemical reactions.Although the lateritic deposits constitute the largest reserves (73%) of world’s nickel resources, only 44% of the global nickel production is supplied from these ores and the remaining is supplied from the sulphide ores ( The nickeliferous laterite ore deposits are generated by a weathering process of which the top layer is mainly hematite (<1.0% Ni), below is the limonitic zone with ∼1.5% Ni followed by a transition layer having 1.5–2.4% Ni and finally there is a saprolitic layer with up to 4.0% Ni followed by unweathered serpentine bed-rock at the base of the deposit ( The saprolitic layers due to their higher Ni content are commonly treated pyrometallurgically, resulting in the production of either ferronickel or matte ( In this study, sulphuric acid dissolution behaviour of Adatepe (Eskişehir, Turkey) laterite ore that has recently been put into operation was investigated under atmospheric conditions. In the leaching experiments, ground Adatepe lateritic nickel ore was used. The 100%, 80%, 50% and 20% of the ground ore was found to be finer than 435, 263, 102 and 19 FT-IR analysis of the ore sample ( In the leaching experiments, Merck grade concentrated sulphuric acid of 96.5% by weight ( The effects of sulphuric acid concentration and temperature on the dissolution of nickel, iron and arsenic for 30 The filtrate obtained after leaching with 60% H Considering the results of 30 Further tests were done at 70 An evaluation of the Ni dissolution at 95 The kinetic data collected at different temperatures for 60% H The congruency of nickel with respect to iron was investigated using the experimental extraction values ( Sulphuric acid leaching tests performed under atmospheric pressure on Adatepe (Eskişehir, Turkey) lateritic ore (Ni: 1.28%) show that 98.6% and 99.2% of Ni can be leached in 120 An activation energy of 30.36 The increase of sulphuric acid concentration above 60% at 95 The financial support (Project Number: 108M364) of Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) and the supply of ore samples by Şenka A.Ş. are thankfully acknowledged.
