The solubilities and complex phase equilibria for the system of MnSO4·4H2O+MgSO4·7H2O+H2O+CH3OH were determined at the temperatures 291.2 and 301.2K over the methanol mole fraction range of 0.00–0.12.The solubility data were used for modelling with the modified extended electrolyte non-random two-liquid equation. The salting-out effect of MgSO4 and methanol on the solubilities of two manganese salts (MnSO4·H2O and MnSO4·4H2O) are represented in the several thermodynamic figures as a function of temperature. The solventing-out effect was stronger than the salting-out effect, which results in a decrease of the solubilities of manganese, salts even though the solubility of MnSO4·H2O decreased and solubility of MgSO4·4H2O increased as temperature increased.Data on the solubility of manganese sulphate hydrates in water, and in aqueous alcohols is essential for salting-out crystallisation studies This paper is a continuation of our thermodynamic study on the effect of different organic solvents on the solubility of a variety of manganese sulphate hydrates in water, and in water–alcohol mixtures and also to check the accuracy of the correlations and predictions of the liquid-liquid-solid equilibrium by our modified extended NRTL model. In this study, the solubility of MnSO The solubilities of salts in the system MnSO Precalculated quantities of methanol were weighed and mixed with a solution of fixed masses of water and magnesium sulphate heptahydrate (APS Chemicals Ltd.) to create solutions of various mole fractions ( The concentration of salts in aqueous solution was converted to molality unit of water-free basis, i.e. excludes the water in the hydrated salt. To improve the accuracy of the experimental results, duplicate experiments were performed for each data point. The duplicate experimental values were all within 1%. To study the effect of methanol on the solubility of MnSO In earlier papers Crystallisation of MnSO The Pitzer–Debye–Hückel contribution  The solubility data for MnSO We defined apparent components as water (1), methanol (2), magnesium sulphate (3) and manganese sulphate (4). In the ion-specific electrolyte solution model, five species (water, methanol, Mg  Our crystallisation research shows that manganese sulphate could have seven hydrates (mono- to heptahydrate) as crystal phase.
