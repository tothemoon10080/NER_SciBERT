After some years of applying diverse advanced control systems by using self-developed automation schemes, vendor expert systems, university-developed systems or a combination of such, a number of lessons regarding the need for such systems, their areas of applicability as well as their key performance indicators emerge as general guidelines to be used in future developments in Minera Los Pelambres. Their main characteristics, capabilities and limitations as well as our experience with them are also presented. As a conclusion, the main factors that determine success (or failure) of advanced control strategies are discussed.
                  The different technological approaches implemented are discussed further and a case study for optimizing SAG mill operation is also presented.
                  This paper discusses the needs of advance control technologies and strategies in the mining industry, including the impact of these technologies on best practices for their implementation, their operation and long term sustainability.
