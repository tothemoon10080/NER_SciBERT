Reaction ignition and chemical mechanisms in volume combustion synthesis of TiB2 via TiO2–B2O3–Mg precursors were studied using in-situ differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and thermochemical modeling. Mg–TiO2 samples ignited at 607°C through a sudden single step solid-solid reaction while Mg–B2O3 samples ignited at 810°C after melting of magnesium. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that reduction of TiO2 occurs in multiple steps and forms intermediate compounds. Results showed that heat released from the first reaction between TiO2 and Mg ignites the reactions between Mg, Ti and B2O3 resulting in the formation of TiB2. Samples with larger TiO2 particle size or a higher sample surface to volume ratio showed a two-step reaction behavior and the released heat in the first solid state reaction was insufficient for the propagation of the reaction throughout the sample. In addition, Mg3B2O6 undesired by-product was formed as a result of this two-step reaction.Ti, MgO Ti MgO, MgB MgO, Mg MgO, TiB In recent years, boride ceramics have been extensively developed due to their specific properties. Titanium diboride, one of the most stable boron compounds has high hardness and melting temperature, good thermal and electrical conductivity as well as resistance to oxidation up to 1000 Combustion synthesis is known as a rapid, facile and cost-effective method for the production of fine titanium diboride particles using low-cost materials Physical and chemical properties of the product such as particle and crystalline size, product yield and formation of undesirable by-products depends on various variables, such as reactants type, particle size and stoichiometric ratio Several attempts have been made to clarify the mechanisms of the reaction in the combustion synthesis of TiB TiO Two binary mixtures, Mg:B The pellets were suspended in the middle of a 5 In other sets of experiments the effect of heat loss from the samples to the surroundings and TiO The phase composition and morphology of the products were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), respectively. The phase formations during the synthesis were calculated using FactSage    Theoretical adiabatic combustion temperature of 1TiO These results are in good agreement with the findings of Weimin et al.    Theoretical adiabatic combustion temperature of B    Rate of temperature increase depends on the difference between the volumetric heat transfer rate between the sample and surroundings and the volumetric rate of heat generation within the sample In order to examine the delay in the ignition, two sets of experiments were conducted; first set with changing the sample surface area to volume ratio,  The second set of experiment with delayed ignition was related to the sample of −44 Based on the thermodynamic calculations, XRD and the DTA results of the samples with single or two-step ignition phenomena the following reactions series is proposed for formation of TiB (only two step synthesis) Chemical mechanisms and reaction ignition in volume combustion synthesis of Mg–TiO The reactants particle size has a significant impact on the ignition temperature. In samples with 0.3 The balance of heat generated by the combustion reaction and heat transfer between the sample and surroundings controls the steps where the reaction propagates throughout the sample. Samples with larger particle size, −44 In the Mg-TiO A two-step reaction resulted in the formation of non-equilibrium Mg
