Objectives of this study are to probe the effect of reducing agents on physicochemical and electrochemical properties of manganese oxide. Manganese oxide is synthesized by chemical reduction of KMnO4 at room temperature using ethylene glycol, hydrazine hydrate, Na2S2O3, potassium iodide, formic acid, citric acid, and NaBH4. All as-prepared manganese oxide samples are analysed by powder XRD, FE-SEM and FT-IR. It is found that manganese oxide prepared using formic acid and sodium thiosulphate have nanorod or nanowire type morphology as confirmed by FE-SEM analysis. Electrochemical properties of samples are studied in aqueous medium (1 M Na2SO4) by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. Due to the rod type structure formic acid sample shows high surface area (117 m2g−1) and high porosity (0.1331 cc g−1), which results into high specific capacitance of 155 Fg−1 at 0.64 Ag−1.Present energy crisis of world can be addressed through efficient energy storage and conversion devices Manganese oxides also possess very good specific capacitance value with comparatively cheap price Generally, MnO Specific capacitances of MnO The simplest synthesis procedure for MnO MnO Electrochemical studies were conducted in 1 M Na Powder XRD patterns for as-synthesised MnO Identification of the attached functional groups was done by using FT-IR analysis. Morphological study was carried out using FE-SEM for various samples of manganese oxide. FE-SEM images of all the samples are shown in Electrochemistry data for all samples at different sweep rate and current densities are presented   in supplementary information as a figure S1. A comparison is drawn in Specific capacitances of 64, 43, 88, 23, 103, 83, and 24 Fg Here, I (A/g) is current density, m is loaded material and  Nanostructured manganese oxide synthesised by reduction of KMnO  The author(s) declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
