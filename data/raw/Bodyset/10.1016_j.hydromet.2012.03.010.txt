Copper sulfate (66–323g/kg H2O; ~25–110g/L Cu+2) and sulfuric acid (10–233g/kg H2O, ~10–200g/L) solutions were reacted with copper metal at temperatures between 50 and 95°C to form Cu+ until equilibrium was attained. Samples were collected into an NH4Fe(SO4)2·12H2O solution to convert cuprous to ferrous, which were then titrated with standard Ce(IV) using very dilute ferroin as the indicator. In order to estimate solution compositions in volumetric units (e.g. g/L) the densities of the parent CuSO4–H2SO4 solutions at the reaction temperatures were used. Some additional density data, beyond that available in the literature was needed. Density as a function of temperature and masses of CuSO4 and H2SO4 per kg of water was fitted to an empirical equation. Density was also estimated based on known concentrations of Cu+2 and H2SO4 in g/L and temperature using an alternative correlation. Cuprous concentrations were determined as mol/kg of sample. Cuprous concentrations in g/L were fitted to an expression of the form:

                  where [Cu+], [Cu+2] and [H2SO4] are in g/L at specified temperature T (K) and V–Z are empirical constants. The empirical expression simulated the measured [Cu+] to within ±3.6%. The cuprous concentrations were also fitted to the same type of equation using concentrations on the molal scale. These matched the experimental values to within ±3.5%. Varying sulfuric acid concentrations were found to have only a modest influence on the equilibrium cuprous concentrations. With 10–200g/L H2SO4 and a given [Cu+2] the difference between the highest and lowest [Cu+] was 7% at most. At 95°C with a solution containing 107–109g/L Cu+2 and 10–200g/L H2SO4, the [Cu+] was 1.70–1.75g/L.Cuprous ion may be generated in the presence of a cupric salt and copper metal. Aqueous cuprous sulfate has uses as a reducing agent in hydrometallurgical applications. Vale uses cuprous sulfate to remove selenium and tellurium impurities from copper sulfate–sulfuric acid electrolyte prior to electrowinning. The Se(IV,VI) and Te(IV,VI) species are reduced to insoluble copper selenides and tellurides. Cuprous is generated by contacting the electrolyte with copper metal at temperatures of nearly 100 The accurate determination of cuprous ion involves significant challenges. In sulfate solution the reaction between cuprous and oxygen is extremely rapid. Secondly, concentrations of cuprous also may be quite low (on the order of 1 The equilibrium, The equilibrium constant increases substantially with increasing temperature because Reaction All chemicals used for cuprous-containing solutions were reagent grade or better: CuSO Cuprous determination experiments were conducted in a sealed 2 Sampling for cuprous determination was accomplished by applying positive pressure of argon gas to the reactor and forcing solution to flow through a polypropylene filter (30 Copper sulfate–sulfuric acid solution densities were estimated at various temperatures, maintained to within ± Known masses of equilibrated cuprous solution samples were analyzed. In order to estimate the cuprous concentrations in g/L, as well as [Cu The constants that gave the best fit are provided in However, some studies reported cuprous concentrations (mol/L) in CuSO The constants A–E that gave the best fit are provided in Next, for a given volumetric composition at a temperature at which the solution was prepared, the density of this same solution at some other temperature can be calculated using the correlation of Eqs. Cuprous concentrations for various Cu For any given solution composition, the cuprous concentrations rose exponentially with temperature. To a first approximation, neglecting speciation considerations, the cuprous concentration might also be expected to be nearly proportional to [Cu The effect of acid concentration is small, though not negligible, and it is greatest at the lowest temperatures. Varying acid concentrations (~ There are two other reports on cuprous concentrations in copper sulfate–sulfuric acid solutions and at temperatures above room temperature. The first is by The second report in the literature on cuprous concentration with varying [Cu In this work several tests were applied to verify that equilibrium had been reached. The Cu A test was done to verify that the sampling methodology was reliable. A solution containing 122.8 A thermodynamic model for the results would have to incorporate the various equilibria involved in the system. This would include Reaction Equilibrium cuprous concentrations were determined for CuSO The authors wish to thank Vale for their support of this work.
