An ionic liquid assisted electroless plating is adopted to prepare continuous and dense Ni-Cu dual coatings on the surface of ZTA particles. The effects of l-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim]BF4) additive, NiSO4 and CuSO4 concentrations on the surface morphologies, coating thickness, and element content of Ni-Cu dual coated ZrO2-toughened Al2O3 (ZTA@Ni-Cu) particles have been characterized systematically. Results show that with incremental addition of [bmim]BF4, suspended Ni-Cu particles in plating bath can be diminished but the incubation period and plating time of Ni-Cu coatings are prolonged significantly. The addition of 20 g·L−1 [bmim]BF4 is optimum for the preparation of uniform and compact ZTA@Ni-Cu particles. Besides, the thickness of Ni-Cu coating is about 20–30 μm and the Cu element content can be controlled in the range of 14.10–60.76 at.% through adjusting Cu(II) ions concentration. Furthermore, the possible reactions and deposition sequences for the preparation of Ni-Cu coatings on ZTA surfaces are analyzed and an empirical model of the deposition process assisted with [bmim]BF4 additive is also proposed to expound the function mechanism of [bmim]BF4 additive and the formation process of Ni-Cu coatings on ZTA surfaces.Metal-based composites reinforced by ceramics have been widely used in the fields of mineral processing, cement production, and wear-resistant equipment due to their high strength, hardness and wearability, as well as good plasticity and impact toughness [ Currently, electroless plating has been regarded as one of the simplest and effective techniques for the preparation of metals or alloys onto the conductive or non-conductive substrates [ Herein, Ni-Cu dual coated ZrO All the chemicals used in this experiment were purchased commercially with analytical grade (>99.90%) from The preparation of ZTA@Ni-Cu particles was carried out by electroless plating assisted with [bmim]BF The morphology and element distribution of the samples were examined by SEM and EDS (TESCAN VEGA 3 and ZEISS model). The cross section of the samples was prepared by encasing the ZTA@Ni-Cu particle in resin, followed by mechanical polishing. The phases of samples were analyzed by XRD (D/Max-2200 model) with Cu Ka radiation at a scan rate of 10 ZTA is a ceramic material with non-catalytic and non-conducting surface. The adhesion between this substrate and Ni-Cu coatings are intrinsically poor because of the high substrate/metal interfacial energy [ The SEM micrographs of ZTA@Ni-Cu particles prepared by electroless plating assisted with different concentrations of [bmim]BF The elemental distribution presented in Ni-Cu coating of ZTA particles is evaluated by EDS analysis, as shown in  For investigate the effects of Ni(II) and Cu(II) concentrations on the morphology of Ni-Cu coatings, the SEM micrographs of ZTA@Ni-Cu particles prepared by electroless plating at different NiSO  As analyzed above, Cu is not as good a catalyst as Ni for the oxidation of hypophosphite reducing agent due to its positive standard redox potential. So, hypophosphite is not recommended during the reduction of Cu, although it can provide a low cost and green system compared to other reducing agents, like formaldehyde [ According to above analysis and references [ Therefore, the possible deposition plating of Ni-Cu coatings on ZTA surfaces assisted with [bmim]BF  Continuous and dense ZTA@Ni-Cu particles with cauliflower-like morphology are successfully prepared through electroless plating assisted with [bmim]BF The addition of 20 g·L The possible reactions and deposition sequences for the preparation of ZTA@Ni-Cu particles have been discussed. A mechanism model for the deposition process is also suggested, which emphasizes the influence of [bmim]BF  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
