Formation of epitaxial cobalt silicide films on (100)Si using Co/Ti, Co/Hf, and Co/Nb bilayers has been investigated. The crystallographic orientations of the silicide films formed after annealing these metal bilayers on (100)Si at 800°C were found to depend strongly upon what thin metal layer was used as an epitaxy promoter. Perfect epitaxy of CoSi2 was obtained using Co/Ti/(100)Si. Local epitaxy of CoSi2 was obtained using Co/Hf/(100)Si, while epitaxy of CoSi2 was not obtained for the Co/Nb/(100)Si system. Epitaxial growth of CoSi2 in these Co/metal/Si systems seems to be related to the formation and decomposition of stable reaction barriers like Co–Ti–O and Hf–Si–O compounds at high temperatures. These stable reaction barriers formed at high temperatures make uniform diffusion of Co atoms possible, resulting in the growth of epitaxial CoSi2.Titanium silicide and cobalt silicide are the two most widely used silicides for the self-aligned silicide (salicide) technology The refractory metals listed above can reduce the native SiO Byun et al. P-type (1 The reactions of the Co/metal bilayers with Si during rapid thermal processing have been studied. The glancing angle XRD spectra for the Co/Ti/(1 The epitaxial growth of CoSi After annealing at 500°C, an intensity peak corresponding to a ternary compound of Co–Ti–O is also detected in the XRD spectra shown in The XRD spectra of Co(15 For Co/Nb/(1 To investigate the redistribution of each element, AES depth profiling was performed.  Various ternary compounds formed during the initial stage of the reaction seem to play a role of the reaction barrier for the formation of epitaxial CoSi This work was supported by Samsung Electronics Co.
