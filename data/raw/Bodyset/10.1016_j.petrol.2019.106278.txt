The effects of joint roughness on the peak shear strength of fractured rock mass has been extensively investigated. Among these investigations, Barton's JRC-JCS model has been well recognized for its capability to characterize surface geometry. However, shear strength estimation is still a major challenge because of the difficulties involved in accurately calculating the joint roughness coefficient (JRC). Thus, alternative methods such as statistic methods based on fractal theory have been proposed to evaluate the impact of surface morphology on rock joints. Extensive evidences show that, the application of the fractal dimension alone cannot produce a satisfactory estimation of either the JRC or the peak shear strength. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the peak shear strength of rock joints by adopting the fractal theory and via a numerical simulation. Gosford sandstone taken from Sydney Basin is adopted as the rock materials for both numerical validation and shear strength investigation. Along with numerical simulations on shear strength, a linear function has been proposed to describe the correlations among the root-mean-square of the first derivative of fracture profile (Z2), fractal dimension and the standard deviation. The peak shear strength is then accurately interpreted as a function of joint roughness indices: fractal dimension (D), standard deviation (SD) and Z2. Predictions by the proposed equation are compared with both the numerical simulation results and that reproduced by Barton's equation. Good agreement has been achieved even when the joint roughness coefficients (JRC) is varied which proves that the proposed equation is highly accurate and can be reused in other related applications.Correction of the friction angle Cohesion in parallel bond model Friction angle in parallel bond model Normal stiffness of parallel bond Normal stress at contact Shear stiffness of parallel bond Basic friction angle Exponent index, typically ranging from 2 to 3 Joint wall compression strength Normal stress Parallel-bond force Parallel-bond moment Peak friction angle Peak shear strength Unconfined compressive strength Horizontal distance between the adjacent points Parameter related to rock types Parameter related to joint roughness Proportionality constant Fractal dimension Elastic modulus Dashpot force Linear force Power spectral density Joint roughness coefficient Wave number related to wavelength Normal stiffness at particle contact Shear stiffness at particle contact Length of the profile Number of segments Standard deviation Height of the discrete point Root-mean-square of the first derivative of a profile Rock mass classification is a complex engineering problem that involves analyzing fracture distribution and joints, factors that will critically impact the mechanical behavior and engineering properties of rocks as encountered in most petroleum and mining engineering practices ( The pioneering work by Barton's JRC-JCS model ( Despite the investigations made by the aforementioned researchers, there is still no consistent conclusion on the relationship between joint geometry and the shear behavior of jointed rock, or unified criterion for the description of fracture geometry characteristics. Thus, numerical methods such as discrete element method (DEM) have been employed to capture the shear behavior of jointed rock ( The main objective of this paper is to investigate the peak shear strength of rock joints based on fractal theory and numerical simulation. Specifically, the effects of fracture roughness on peak shear strength of Gosford sandstone is investigated by using a discrete element model known as PFC2D (Particle Flow Code developed by ITASCA Company, The mathematical model proposed by It is known that the fractal dimension is the measurement of surface texture, and tends to fall into the range between 2 and 2.5 in nature ( The commercially available PFC2D software package is used in this study because it is highly effective at solving problems relating to rock behaviors and its ability to implement the discontinuous element, such as rock fractures and joints ( The force-displacement law for each component in Eq. In this study, an unconfined compression test on Gosford sandstone taken from Sydney (Sydney Basin, Australia) is employed to calibrate the micro-parameters in PFC2D. The unconfined compression test was conducted on a cylinder specimen with a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 100 mm as presented in The details of the calibration process can be found in the work by The accuracy of the PFC2D model for simulating the shear behavior of jointed rock is numerically validated through the direct shear test on the rock with a planar joint. As shown in For the direct shear test on the rock with plane fracture, the shear strength depends on the friction between the adjacent surfaces, which can be expressed as follows: The shear stress-displacement curves under normal stresses of 1 MPa, 2 MPa and 4 MPa are presented in In order to investigate the effects of fracture roughness on shear strength and develop a generic model to characterize the shear behavior of jointed Gosford sandstone, direct shear tests on jointed specimens with different rough fractures are conducted. A 2D profile of the fracture surface is generated based on the synthetic fracture model presented in section The shear stress-displacement curves for the selected fracture profiles (with a standard deviation of 0.6 mm, fractal dimension ranging from 1.6 to 2.2) under different normal stresses are presented in With the presence of fracture roughness, the shear strength formula can be modified to become: Based on the simulation results of direct shear tests, the correlation among peak friction angle ( The correlation among Z Inspired by the experimental work conducted by Subsequently, the relationship between peak friction angle, Z In the proposed equation, the effect of roughness on shear strength is utilized through the parameter Z Note that, the value of Z As observed, there is no consistent correlation between JRC and the statistical parameter Z In order to figure out the discrepancies between the predicted shear strength and numerical results, the calculated Z The effect of fracture roughness on peak shear strength was investigated through numerical simulations on direct shear test of Gosford sandstone. Following conclusions could be obtained. A simple yet effective method is proposed to generate rock fracture for the investigation of rock joints. This is accomplished through the generation of two parallel rough walls with a certain aperture, which is different from the smooth-joint contact model ( The mathematical model proposed by The correlations that occur among Z A logarithmic equation was proposed to predict the peak shear strength of Gosford sandstone. The comparative analysis between solutions reproduced by the proposed equation and Barton's method demonstrated that the proposed equation can capture the peak shear strength under a large range of JRCs, and the resulting predictions match the numerical results with acceptable accuracies. Moreover, by studying the effects of sampling intervals, it was demonstrated that the Z The research presented in this paper is founded by The following is the Supplementary data to this article: Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
