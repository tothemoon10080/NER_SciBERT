Hydraulic impact hammers have been used widely in Istanbul metro tunnels since 1992. This paper summarizes recent studies and explains the basic principles of the proper selection of hydraulic impact hammers. First data on 600 different hydraulic impact hammers available in the market are analyzed and the relationships between operational variables, such as hammer operating weight, impact energy, recommended excavation weight and size, are investigated in order to make some recommendations on how to calculate the efficiencies of impact hammers and to select proper hammer for a given job. A detailed study is also realized on Levent–Maslak tunnel drivages. Overall performance of tunnel drivages, the relation between Rock Mass Rating (RMR) and net breaking rate of hammers are also explained and compared with previous results obtained in other hydraulic hammer applications in Istanbul tunnel drivages. It is found that the net breaking rate of an impact hammer decreases linearly with RMR.Initial investment for mechanical boring of tunnels is found to be high in most cases. Conventional drilling and blasting is not the most feasible or economical for rock excavation, especially in urban area due to environmental and social restrictions. Hydraulic impact hammers mounted on an excavator carrier or backhoe has gained acceptance in several phases of mining and civil engineering fields, such as tunnel excavation, breaking of oversized boulders in quarries and open pit mines, selective mining where special demand are made on mineral purity, demolishing concrete structures, and trenching when the ground is too hard to be removed with an excavator. Hydraulic impact hammers have been used widely in mining and civil engineering applications since 1960 ( Pneumatic powered percussive rock drilling tools have been used for many decades in mining and tunnelling industries. However, they were noisiest equipment in the mine and tunnels and around 80% of the noise deriving from its exhaust. Introduction of hydraulic hammers in both industries was environmentally revolutionary since hydraulic hammers had no exhaust and were less noisy ( The prediction of the performance of impact hammers is important for the practicing engineer since a contractor is always interested in predicting the machine performance prior to starting a tunnel project so as to define the tunnel drivage economy. Bilgin suggested instantaneous or net breaking rate of the hydraulic impact hammers could be calculated using power of the impact hammer, rock compressive strength and rock quality designation values ( In the light of the information given above, one of the main objectives of this research study is to contribute further to the proper selection of hydraulic impact hammers and to the methodology of predicting their breaking performances. There are in the market more than 27 companies producing a wide range of products. A recent study done by The working principle of a modern hydraulic hammer is simple. There is a piston moving up and down and striking against the tool end. To produce big energy pulses during downwards strokes, the hammer is equipped with an accumulator that is able to supply needed oil volume in a very short time. A hydraulic pump charges the nitrogen gas accumulator continuously. Hydraulic hammer can be mounted on virtually all models of backhoe, excavator or wheel loaders. Specific energy is a good indicator of breaking energy and different research works demonstrate that specific energy defined as the energy to break the unit volume of the rock is inversely proportional to impact energy ( Eq. There is no standard that may be used to compare the performance of hydraulic hammers. The technical data in sales literature is very inhomogeneous and sometimes even misleading. However, if the basic information of different hammers is analyzed in the same way, quite competent comparisons can be made. The ratio of output power to input power is the hammer efficiency and may be used to compare the efficiency of hydraulic hammers. The relevant Eqs. A numerical example for the efficiency of an impact hammer chosen from Impact hammer: “Rammer G130 City”;        The efficiencies of 362 hydraulic hammers with reliable data having complete information on operational parameters were calculated using Eq. Hydraulic impact hammers may be mounted on many different types of excavators and powered by the hydraulic system of the carrier machine. Many carriers have auxiliary valves that can be used to operate a hydraulic hammer. Balance of moment forces between excavator and hammer weights are given in Eq. The first comprehensive work on the theoretical performance prediction of the hydraulic hammers was done by A review of research on the mechanics of breaking rocks with impact hammers is presented and the blow of high-energy impact is discussed by An empirical formula has been derived by An empirical approach towards analysis of rock breaking under direct impact and laboratory conditions is suggested by Bilgin analyzed the data accumulated for many years in tunnel drivages of Istanbul Metro and suggested instantaneous or net breaking rate of the hydraulic impact hammers can be calculated using the following empirical equations ( The power of the impact hammer may be calculated either from Eq. Independent studies show that net breaking rate of impact hammers has a close relationship with rock mass cuttability index as described above ( Bilgin also showed that Schmidt hammer rebound value is a good indicator of rock characteristics and gives significant correlation with net breaking rates of impact hammers when the rock formation is grouped based on RQD values ( Rock formations are called locally Trakya Formation of the Carboniferous age and consist of fine to coarse-grained strongly fractured mudstones, shales, sandstones and conglomerates. Some diabase and andezite dykes have also been encountered while driving the tunnels and these rocks affected tunnel progress rates negatively, as they are significantly harder than rock excavated along the major part of the route. Belgrad Formation of Neogene age consisting of silty and sandy formations is found in upper zones in some places. The compressive strength of the rocks of the Trakya Formation change between 22.1 Two parallel tunnel lines start from Seyrantepe and finish at Maslak (Darussafaka) and have a total length of 16,189 Rock bolts, wire mesh, shotcrete, steel arches (girders) and final concrete lining are used as support and reinforcement elements. The thickness of shotcrete is 20 Umbrella arch support system is used in Neogen aged soft formations in Shaft 3 and Shaft 5 as seen in On the performance of impact hammer, i.e. net breaking rate; a detailed study is conducted in the four tunnel lines of Shaft 4 on three shifts per day. Volvo EW160B and EC180B excavators were used with MTB 85 hydraulic hammers having the following characteristics: Hammer weight Impact energy Blow frequency, ( Oil flow Operating pressure Time spent for breaking the rock, rock bolting, mucking, shotcrete, wire mesh, and waiting for different purposes were recorded carefully and analyzed to see overall performance of tunnel drivage. Site geologists also recorded RMR of the tunnel faces. As seen from It is interesting to note that for the same RMR values, net breaking rate of hydraulic hammer in lower bench is twice more than upper bench. This may be explained by the difference of hammer application. In the application of lower bench, the free face plays an important role in favor of net breaking rate. Moreover, this could also be due to the orientation of the hammer. The hammer may have been predominantly vertical for the lower bench and horizontal for the upper bench so the mass of the hammer was more effective for the lower bench. The overall performance of tunnel drivages in Istanbul-Maslak tunnels is seen in Hydraulic impact hammers mounted on an excavator carrier or backhoe has gained worldwide acceptance in mining and civil engineering industries. First, data on 600 different hydraulic impact hammers available in the market are analyzed and the relationships between operational variables, such as hammer operating weight, impact energy, recommended excavation weight and size are investigated. According to the data obtained, and the graphs illustrated in the paper, a project planner or site practitioner can currently select a reliable hydraulic hammer for a given rock formation in the feasibility stage of a tunneling project that a hydraulic hammer is planned to be used. Some concepts for comparing the efficiencies of impact hammers are also given. Although in the previous studies it was demonstrated that RQD values were a useful parameter to predict the net breaking rate of impact hammers, it is found in this study that net breaking rate of impact hammer may be also predicted usefully by RMR values. In this study, in situ observations in Maslak–Levent tunnels including the geology of the area, method of construction, and the performance of impact hammers are given. In relation to data obtained and analyzed, in the lower bench, impact hammer whose mass of the hammer tool may have been predominantly vertical for the lower bench, works more effectively than those that is experienced in the upper bench. Some recommendations are made for further efficient applications of impact hammers such as using gathering arms to eliminate time spent mucking. This study showed that the time spent mucking in impact hammer applications is one of the main factors affecting the efficiency of hammering as noted in early works. Manufacturers may consider adding the muck collecting tools to the excavators to eliminate the time spent the muck from the tunnel face to the transporting vehicles behind the excavator.
