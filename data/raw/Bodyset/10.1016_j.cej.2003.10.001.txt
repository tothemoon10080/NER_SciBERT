This article develops a structural model for the dissolution of non-porous ore particles, referred to as “sporulation” kinetics. This model is based on the assumption that the particulate can be modelled as an ensemble of reactive solid grains (e.g. metallic oxides) embedded into a solid matrix (gangue). The solid matrix may not be chemically inert with the result that, during the dissolution of the ore particle, the solid matrix “sporulates”, i.e. grains of the reactive solid are progressively released from the ore particle into the liquid solution, due either to mechanical fragmentation or to chemical dissolution of the matrix itself. This model is applied in order to interpret the dissolution kinetics of manganiferous ores, which differs significantly from the corresponding kinetic behaviour of pure MnO2 particles.fragmentation rate liquid reactant ( fragmentation kernel liquid reactant concentration dimensionless liquid reactant concentration (= molar concentration of the solid reactant referred to the liquid solution volume kinetic rate coefficient for the dissolution of the metal oxide kinetic rate coefficient for the dissolution of the solid matrix weight distribution function of oxide grains within the ore particle ( solid matrix (gangue) weight function of metal oxide embedded in the ore particle up to the radius overall particle mass average molecular weight of the ore particle distribution function of oxide grains in the liquid solution at time distribution function of ore particles in the liquid solution at time number of ore particles oxide grain radius at time ore particle radius at time solid reactant time temperature gangue volume within the ore particle at time metal oxide volume within the ore particle at time ore particle volume at time solid reactant conversion solid matrix (gangue) conversion see dimensionless kinetic rate coefficient for the dissolution of the metal oxide dimensionless kinetic rate coefficient for the dissolution of the solid matrix see parameter entering the distribution unit step function see stoichiometric coefficient of the dissolution reaction of the solid matrix ( see stoichiometric coefficient of the dissolution reaction of the solid reactant ( distribution function of oxide grains within the ore particle ( gangue density gangue molar density oxide grain density oxide grain molar density ore particle density ore particle molar density dimensionless time dissolution rate of pure reactant solid particles ( spatial average stoichiometric loading conditions evaluated at time dimensionless variable (unless otherwise explicitly stated) Non-catalytic fluid–solid reactions are a class of industrially relevant operations whose structural properties of solid particles influence and modify the reaction evolution. The overall evolution of the kinetics depends on several concurring processes: (i) the reaction kinetics sensu stricto and, specifically, the dependence of the dissolution rates on the concentration of fluid reactants; (ii) transport effects and mass-transfer limitations; (iii) the structural properties of solid particles; and (iv) the occurrence of mechanical/dissolution processes leading to particle fragmentation and break-up induced either by the mechanical stirring or by the dissolution kinetics itself Within the broad category of “structural properties of solid particles” several features may be identified, which can be further classified into several subcategories: (i) surface heterogeneities; (ii) particle ensemble properties; and (iii) intraparticle heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of the solid reactant within the solid pellet. Each of these properties leads to a specific modelling since it influences the overall reaction evolution in a different way. Surface heterogeneity implies the occurrence of rough external surfaces induced, e.g. by the superposition and the intermingling of crystallites and crystalline planes. Surface heterogeneity can be modelled either by means of fractal concepts Particle ensemble properties refer to the occurrence of a spectrum of particle sizes. In the presence of a broad particle size distribution, the evolution of the reacting system can hardly be modelled by lumping together the particle ensemble and by considering an effective particle with an average radius. Indeed, the assumption of uniform particle size may induce severe kinetic misinterpretation of the kinetic process, leading to gross scale-up processes, in the presence of a broad distribution of particle radii The third origin of heterogeneity refers to the spatial distribution of the reactive solid within the solid particle, made by an inert matrix, within which reactive grains are embedded. Obviously, this situation cannot occur in the case of solid particles made of pure reactant. The modelling of this kind of heterogeneity, specifically oriented towards gas–solid non-catalytic reactions has been extensively investigated by Szekely et al. The grain model, in its classical formulation, refers to porous particles in which the solid reactant, in the form of spherical grains, is embedded within an inert matrix which is permeable to the flow of gaseous reactants and products. Therefore, the non-uniform (radial) distribution of solid reactant modulates the interplay between intraparticle diffusion of gaseous reactants/products and the reaction occurring at the boundary of each grain. Grain models have been successfully applied to several gas–solid reactions of industrial interest (for a review see For initially non-porous particles, the crackling core model proposed by Park and Levenspiel For what concerns liquid–solid systems, i.e. towards dissolution and leaching kinetics, intraparticle heterogeneity induces many different and complex phenomenologies and a structural model specifically suited for leaching kinetics should take into account the fact that intraparticle heterogeneity may also play a significant role in non-porous particles, due to dissolution/break-up of the solid matrix, thus exposing reactive grains to the liquid solution. This article addresses a new model referred to as the sporulation model, which is based on the assumption that, during the dissolution/fragmentation of the ore particles, reactive grains are released in the liquid phase. This article is organised as follows. This section attempts to classify the different structural models able to describe the evolution of non-catalytic liquid–solid reactions in the presence of non-porous pellets, by focusing on the influence of ensemble and intraparticle heterogeneity. Let us assume that solid pellets contain a reactive species Mathematical models can be conveniently subdivided into two main categories, depending on the type of heterogeneity that is accounted for. Let us first consider the case of pure reactive solids. In this case, ensemble heterogeneity plays a leading role in the evolution of the reaction, with the result that an accurate model combines the kinetic information (rate of dissolution associated with Let The term Intraparticle heterogeneity means that solid particles are not exclusively composed by the reactant From the setting of the problem described earlier, it is clear that the central issue in the development of structural models which account explicitly for intraparticle heterogeneity resides in the interplay between the dissolution kinetics of the solid reactant The sporulation model, which will be developed in the following sections, is specifically suited to accounting for the intraparticle heterogeneity, by describing the interplay between the dissolution of the solid reactant and the dissolution of the matrix. Model development is preceded by a short description of the physical problems and experimental results motivating the basic model assumptions. As a test case let us consider the dissolution kinetics of manganiferous ores. The recovery of metals and particularly of manganese from mineral ores is an important industrial issue. A series of hydrometallurgical processes have been developed both with and without reducing agents. One of the processes developed makes use of sacchariferous reducing agents (glucose in the present analysis). Recently, bioleaching of manganese by iron-oxidising bacteria has been addressed Manganese extraction using carbohydrates as reducing agents consists of a complex network of chemical reactions involving partially oxidised products derived from carbohydrate degradation in acidic media. The manifold of intermediates and their variability with carbohydrate sources led to the formulation of a preliminary kinetic model considering the following overall chemical reaction The manganiferous ore considered in this study comes from an Italian mine located in North Latium and is primarily made up of manganese as pyrolusite (MnO We made use of a small reactor in order to ensure a good level of homogeneity of the liquid–solid solution with the simple use of a magnetic stirrer. Different experiments have been performed for increasing stirring speeds confirming that : (i) a good level of homogeneity of the liquid–solid solution is attained; and (ii) mechanical fragmentation effects are indeed negligible. Leaching test were performed in different loading conditions considering the global reaction reported in Experiments have been also performed with MnO A thorough understanding of ore leaching kinetics is made complex by the structural properties of the particles and by the spatial distribution of MnO By referring to Velardo et al. A surplus of sulphuric acid, the other operating parameters being fixed, does not increase the overall conversion so that, for pure MnO Let us now consider the dissolution kinetics of manganiferous ores, made by MnO The overall conversion–time curves The results depicted in these figures lead to the following observations: (i) the dissolution rate increases monotonically with temperature ( These experimental observations indicate that a chemical dissolution of the solid matrix (gangue) occurs for manganiferous ores due to the presence of sulphuric acid, and this phenomenon speeds the leaching process up significantly. In point of fact, the chemical dissolution of the solid matrix, together with mechanical stirring, enhances the release of oxide reactive grains from the matrix into the liquid solution. In other words, sulphuric acid acts as a fluid reactant for the dissolution of both oxide grains and the solid matrix. For this reason, in the case of manganiferous ore particles, the sulphuric acid loading condition The fact that the sulphuric acid is the limiting reactant, is confirmed by The fact that the solid matrix undergoes a dissolution process is confirmed by granulometric data reported in Different experiments, performed for increasing stirring speeds (not reported here), support the idea that fragmentation effects are indeed negligible with respect to solid matrix dissolution. No agglomeration or coating of larger particles can be hypothesised from the analysis of granulometric data. The experimental results depicted in The structural model discussed further, and referred to as The mechanism underlying the sporulation model is depicted in The sporulative release of solid grains within the liquid phase increases the wetted surface of the solid reactant In order to simplify the treatment, the ore particle density Following The distribution of oxide grains within the ore particle is described by the function Let The evolution equation for In the case of a polydisperse mixture of solid particles, it is necessary to introduce a distribution function The inclusion of ensemble heterogeneity within the sporulation model forces to modify the population balance The functions and coefficients characterising the sporulation model are not completely arbitrary since their functional form and value should be consistent with the overall mass balance. The assessment of the overall mass balance induces quantitative constraints on the function The physical constraint on It is important to observe that it is possible to derive another more strict inequality for Under this hypothesis In Let us conclude this presentation of the sporulation model by considering the explicit expression for the overall conversions In the case of Without loss of generality, we consider the simplified reaction scheme: By introducing the dimensionless variables and parameters: In the case of zero-order kinetics for the consumption rates of the solid matrix and oxide grains ( From In the case of first-order kinetics for the consumption rates of the solid matrix and oxide grains (   In this section we formulate the sporulation model in the more general setting of a non-uniform radial distribution of metal oxide within the ore particles. In this case, the ore particle density According to the simplified reaction scheme, Let us indicate with The sporulation model, for a uniform ensemble of ore particles and a non-uniform radial distribution of metal oxide, attains the form:  As expected, the conversion We applied the sporulation model to interpret the dissolution kinetics of manganiferous ores, discussed in From granulometric data reported in The parameters that need to be determined from the analysis of experimental data are A preliminary analysis of the experimental data reported in This observation has two important consequences: (i) the characteristic time  The “homogeneous” sporulation model is capable of a quantitative prediction of the influence of a surplus of sulphuric acid (see The sporulation model is a versatile structural model specifically suited to describing the dissolution kinetic in leaching processes involving non-porous ore particles. It accounts explicitly for intraparticle heterogeneity by describing the interplay between the dissolution kinetics of the main solid reactant (e.g. metal oxide) and the dissolution/fragmentation of the solid matrix (gangue). The core of the model is the choice of the grain distribution The “homogeneous” sporulation model, developed for a uniform ensemble of ore particles and constant particle density, has been successfully applied to the analysis of dissolution kinetics of manganiferous ore particles which differs significantly from the dissolution kinetics of pure MnO The sporulation model can be easily generalised to include the effect of polydispersity of the solid mixture, of the ore particle fragmentation (see
