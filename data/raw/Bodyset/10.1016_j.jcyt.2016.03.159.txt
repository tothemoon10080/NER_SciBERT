As the second most abundant intracellular cation, magnesium exists mostly in bone and the amount of magnesium is dynamically regulated by skeletal remodeling. Previous studies showed that accelerating bone mass loss occurs in post-menopause animals when their magnesium intake is insufficient and increased magnesium intake alleviates the osteoporotic symptoms. However, high magnesium status has been reported to lead to mineralization defects possibly due to the magnesium substitution for calcium in hydroxyapatite structure. In the present study, we used murine and human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to investigate the effect of high extracellular magnesium concentration on osteogenic differentiation and the role of magnesium transporters in the mineralization process. We verified the differentiation efficiency by observing cell morphology, expression profiling of osteogenic marker genes, and performing alizarin red staining (
