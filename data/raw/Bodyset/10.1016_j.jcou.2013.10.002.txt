This paper reports on Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts that are active and selective for synthesis of olefin-rich C2
                     + hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation. The combination of Fe and a small amount of Co led to a dramatic bimetallic promotion of C2
                     + hydrocarbons synthesis in CO2 hydrogenation on Fe–Co/Al2O3 catalyst with 15wt% total metal loading. The addition of K to Fe–Co/Al2O3 catalyst further improved the formation rate of C2

                     + hydrocarbons was successfully synthesized using K-promoted Fe–Co/Al2O3 catalysts with high K loadings (Co/(Co+Fe)=0.17atomatom−1, K/Fe≥0.5atomatom−1) using CO2 as a carbon source.Catalytic conversion of CO Until now, the hydrogenation of CO Dramatically different catalytic properties of Co and Fe catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO The aim of this work is to explore CO Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts were prepared by a pore-filling incipient wetness impregnation method using gamma-alumina (Sasol PURALOX TH 100/150, BET surface area Hydrogenation of CO CO   It should be noted that the optimum Co/(Co As shown in The conversions and selectivities of all monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are summarized in The effect of K addition on the activities and selectivities of Fe–Co bimetallic catalysts were then studied.  The addition of K also increased olefin to paraffin ratio (O/P) of C  By combining Fe and a small amount of Co on an alumina support, we have discovered a strong bimetallic promotion of C This research is supported in part by the Pennsylvania State University through Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment.
