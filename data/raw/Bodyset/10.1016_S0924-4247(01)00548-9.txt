In this paper it is reported a special technological solution to improve the performance and to simplify the fabrication process of the miniaturized magnetostrictive delay line (MDL) obtained by thin films technology. In order to increase the sensitivity level without adding new difficulties in the reliability of the sensing element, we conceived and realized a new configuration of miniaturized MDL using a magnetoresistive sensing three-layered structure. According to this configuration, MDL arrangement can be miniaturized, without the use of the receiving coil fabricated by thin film technology and photolithographic techniques, allowing thus a simple fabrication process and a high output signal level.Magnetostrictive delay line (MDL) principle is used in many applications for sensing force, position, displacement, pressure and proximity One of the most preferred materials for the MR sensor is permalloy. This material has zero magnetostriction, low values for the uniaxial anisotropy and exhibits magnetoresistive effect Î” In order to use a magnetoresistive (MR) multilayer-like structure instead of thin film receiving coil for flux change sensing, we studied the magnetic properties and MR response of the three-layered structure based on Ni The schematic arrangement of the miniaturized MDL on a silicon wafer using a multilayer-like structure The MR response of a MR thin film is determined by the angle between the magnetization and the sense current The nonlinear MR response in the applied field (square characteristic) is caused by the parallelism of magnetization We decided on the simplest way, namely, to rotate The three-layered MR sensing structure with a In SAL biasing, a Ni  The weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and low magnetostriction are the most important material requirements to control the domain structure and to ensure a low strain induced anisotropy for the MR thin films, respectively The characteristics of the MR Ni According to The response of the three-layered MR structure used in miniaturized MDL arrangement at the magnetoelastic waves which propagate in MDL is under investigation. In this paper, we have presented a new miniaturized MDL arrangement fabrication technology and configuration using a three-layered MR structure based on Ni The results obtained for the material characteristics and the dependence of the output voltage on the external magnetic field of the MR structure obtained by us show that the Ni The use of three-layered MR structure allows to simplify the fabrication process of the miniaturized device based on MDL technique and to maintain a high output signal level.
