Montmorillonite (Mt) and illite (Ilt) were ground for different times under wet condition and sequentially subjected to organic modification by dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC). The influence of the grinding time on the obtained products in terms of DDAC loading and

                      adsorption were evaluated. Multiple techniques were used to characterize the changes in structure and morphology before and after mechanical or organic modification. Compared with Ilt, Mt showed a stronger resistance to mechanical treatment due to its swelling property. Silicon nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si NMR) spectra and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples ground for 30min indicate the disintegration of Ilt and exfoliation of Mt, resulting in increase of

                      uptake by 147% for OIlt and 13% for OMt. Three stages in the grinding Mt can be proposed, including the separation of large particles into small particles, exfoliation of small particles, and disintegration of exfoliated single layers. In contrast, two stages are involved in the grinding Ilt, which are the destruction/exfoliation of large particles and further disintegration of small exfoliated layers.Perchlorate ( Although plentiful techniques such as acid activation ( Illite is a type of 2:1 non-expandable clay mineral with the general formula expressed as ( High-purity Na-montmorillonite (Mt, Kunipia-F) from the Kunimine Industries Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) with a cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 1.114 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ground Mt before and after modification by DDAC with diffraction angles 2 Fifty milligrams of OMt or OIlt was dispersed in 50 After the grinding and DDAC modification of Mt and Ilt, the obtained OMt and OIlt were supplied to measure the DDAC content and adsorb Irrespective of whether OMt or OIlt was measured, the DDAC content and As shown in FTIR spectra of ground Mt and Ilt before and after DDAC modification are shown in Morphology changes of Mt and Ilt after mechanical treatment in the first step and following DDAC modification are shown in The specific surface areas, pore volumes and average pore diameter ( When Mt and Ilt were ground for 30 The negative charges of Mt or Ilt are mainly caused by isomorphic substitution, resulting in the high resistance of surface charge against the variation of pH. The zeta potential value of Mt in a wide pH range was stably maintained, which has been proven in a previous study ( Mt or Ilt modified by DDAC without grinding at first step showed adsorption capacities of 0.518 and 0.210 The disintegration of Mt under wet grinding can be mainly divided into three stages ( Compared with Mt, the disintegration of Ilt is less complicated and mainly consists of two steps ( In contrast with Mt, the wet grinding of Ilt significantly influenced the DDAC loading and Financial support was provided to KS by the  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
