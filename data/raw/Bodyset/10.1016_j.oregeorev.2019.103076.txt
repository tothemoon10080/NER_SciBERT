Natural variability of stable Te isotope compositions in terrestrial settings, including hydrothermal ore deposits, and the geochemical conditions that control their compositions are poorly understood. Previously published Te isotope data on tellurides, sulfides, and native tellurium are limited in number and derived from samples that were geologically unconstrained with regards to their location within an ore deposit. Here, we have obtained a range of values of δ130/125Te of −0.47 ± 0.13 to 0.66 ± 0.13‰ (n = 13), relative to an in-house, gravimetrically prepared Te standard of 99.9999% Te metal, for located samples of sylvanite ((AuAg)2Te4), krennerite ((Au,Ag)Te2), and native tellurium from the alkaline igneous rock-related Emperor gold telluride deposit, Fiji. Based on similarities in the geologic setting of the alkaline-igneous rock related gold-silver telluride deposits in Colorado (Cripple Creek, Boulder County, and La Plata) with Emperor, and the narrow range of δ130/125Te values for tellurides and native tellurium from Emperor and previously published, unlocated samples from Colorado deposits (Cripple Creek, δ130/125Te = −0.53 to 0.44‰, n = 13; Boulder County, δ130/125Te = −0.25 to 0.16‰, n = 7; La Plata, δ130/125Te = −0.78 to 0.0.17‰, n = 11), it is likely that the main factor controlling the range of isotope values in these epithermal systems is the Te isotope composition of the genetically-related alkaline igneous source rocks. In comparison, previously published unlocated samples of tellurides from the giant orogenic Golden Mile Au deposit, Kalgoorlie, Australia, show an isotopic range of δ130/125Te = −1.00 to 0.51‰ (n = 6) and appear to have been more affected by the metamorphic nature of the ore fluids and/or the higher degree of water-rock interaction during hydrothermal fluid transport. It is speculated that the zonation from isotopically heavy to light Te isotopic compositions with distance from the likely causative intrusion within the Emperor deposit is primarily controlled by Rayleigh fractionation of isotopes within the ore fluid.The study of non-traditional stable isotopes as they apply to ore-forming systems (e.g., Fe, Se, Cu, Zn, Hg, Tl, Pb) has provided insight into metal transportation and deposition mechanisms, the sources of ore-forming metals, and the overall formation of metallogenetic systems (e.g., Models concerning the origin of hydrothermal gold deposits (e.g., orogenic, epithermal, reduced intrusion-related) have been strongly influenced by geochemical information derived from the light stable isotope systematics of O, H, C, and S, with more limited applications by non-traditional stable isotopes (e.g., Hg, Although there are 38 known isotopes and 17 nuclear isomers of tellurium (atomic mass ranging from 105 to 142), there are eight stable isotopes of tellurium: Recently, The current reconnaissance study reports variability of stable Te isotopes in tellurides and native tellurium from the ~10 M oz. intrusion-related, low-sulfidation epithermal Emperor gold-telluride deposit, Fiji, and is the first Te isotope study of spatially constrained samples of minerals in the system Au-Ag-Te in an ore deposit. Because the causes of variability of Te isotopes in ore systems are largely unknown, the Emperor deposit is an ideal location to assess their variability due to the well-constrained geology, geochemistry, and mineral paragenesis (e.g., The Fiji Islands are located on an offset between the west-dipping Tonga-Kermadec and east-dipping Vanuatu subduction zones. The associated arc system was active from the early Eocene to the middle Miocene ( The mineralization formed in two styles, low-grade uneconomic porphyry Cu and spatially related, contemporaneous epithermal Au mineralization characterized minerals in the system Au-Ag-Te ( The tellurides at Emperor occur mainly spatially associated with pyrite in quartz veins and are subordinate in abundance to sulfides. They formed in three (Stages II, III, and IV) of eight hydrothermal stages ( The samples for this study are from underground locations and drill core, and consisted predominantly of quartz-carbonate veins that contained visible tellurides. Due to the generally fine grained nature of the tellurides (on the order of microns) and their intergrowth with other fine-grained tellurides in stages III and IV only monominerallic grains of tellurides in Stage II that were coarse enough to drill were analyzed here. Samples of sylvanite (n = 7), krennerite (n = 5), and native tellurium (n = 1), from five different ore zones/flatmakes (Matanagata (n = 1), Matanagata East (n = 5), Prince William (n = 4), Dolphin (n = 1), and the UFZ lode in the R1 zone (n = 2)) were analyzed. Details of the mineralogy and mineral chemistry of samples used in the present study are given in The sampling of individual tellurides and analytical methodology for Te isotope measurement are outlined here, but are presented in detail in The dried samples were dissolved in 4 mL of Samples were analyzed for isotopic variability using a Nu Instruments Nu Plasma MC-ICP-MS at the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) in Ottawa. As no internationally-recognized standard exists for Te isotope measurements, all samples were compared to an in–house, gravimetrically prepared Te standard made from an ingot of Johnson-Matthey Corporation, Alfa Aesar Puratronic 99.9999% Te metal. It should be noted here that the standard chosen was arbitrary and has no direct implication for the provenance of terrestrial Te. Sample and standard solutions were introduced into the instrument using solution nebulization at a concentration of 2 ppm Te with 1 ppm Cd added to each to correct for temporal shifts in instrument mass bias. Samples were analyzed five times, with each analysis comprising 30 cycles of measurement. A sample-standard bracketing method was employed, alternating samples and standards for each analysis.
