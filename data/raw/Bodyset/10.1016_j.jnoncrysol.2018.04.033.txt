In this paper, the crystallization kinetic of amorphous Fe0.7Nb0.1Zr0.1Ti0.1 was studied by differential thermal analysis to produce an appropriate amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure for improving the soft magnetic properties. Amorphous Fe0.7Nb0.1Zr0.1Ti0.1 alloy without metalloids was prepared by mechanical alloying of pure elements. The results showed that Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model was able to explain the crystallization kinetic of products as:

                     . Moreover, volume diffusion control with three dimensional growth of the nuclei was the predominant mechanism of crystallization. The simulation results confirmed that by employment of kinetic model, it was possible to control the microstructure as combination of amorphous/crystalline phases and enhance the saturation magnetization from 59 to 142 A·m2/kg and reduce the coercivity from 2.05 to 0.14 kA/m by controlling of crystallization progress at specific predefined α value.Todays, soft magnetic materials, especially Fe based alloys, have significant applications in industries due to their acceptable soft magnetic properties respect to the polycrystalline types as well as lower eddy current losses than the other similar crystalline alloys [ Generally, amorphous/nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys are combination of different elements including ferromagnetic transition metal element (TL), transition metal element (TE), metalloid (M) and noble metal (NM) as nucleation agent [ Rapid quenching and mechanical alloying are the most common techniques for preparation of amorphous alloys [ Accordingly, the presence of metalloids is not necessary for amorphization during the mechanical alloying. To best of our knowledge, a few studies [ Side by side comparison of literatures in The soft magnetic properties of Fe based amorphous materials can be enhanced by formation of stable nanostructures composed of nanosize crystals in an amorphous matrix [ To the best of our knowledge, the kinetic analysis is a powerful technique to control and estimate the progress of transformation during the heating. Kinetic analysis methodology: it depicts the type of kinetic study, i.e., model free isoconversional method or model fitting; Complexity: It determines the characteristics of transformation as single step and/or multi steps, parallel and/or consecutive; Proposed kinetic equation: It responses to this question that if dα/dt equation for crystallization process proposed or not; Proposed mechanism: It depicts the administrated mechanism during the crystallization and is one of the kinetic analysis output; Physical meaning of mechanism: It determines that if the proposed mechanism by kinetic studies is confirmed by additional evidences, e.g., XRD, SEM or TEM observations or not; Employment of kinetics modeling as a technique for controlling of phase amount: It is related to the ability of dα/dt equation to control the ratio of crystalline and amorphous phases during the crystallization. As shown in On the one hand, the necessity of the presence of combination of amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure in certain ratio for improvement of soft magnetic properties (e.g. higher saturation magnetization as well as lower coercivity and low magnetostriction), on the other hand, the possibility of preparation of certain ratio of amorphous/nanocrystalline microstructure by employment of kinetic modeling of crystallization, emphasis on the significance of this study. Moreover, non-isothermal kinetics modeling of amorphous Fe In present study, firstly, the Fe based amorphous alloy was produced without using the metalloids and in the presence of Zr, Ti and Nb as alloying elements using mechanical alloying method. Then, the proposed crystallization kinetic equation as relation between α (i.e., the fraction of crystallization of amorphous phase) and t (i.e., the time of heating), is employed to control the final microstructure in a way that the nanocrystalline phase with grain sizes smaller than the exchange length (typical values are about 20–40 nm for Fe based alloys [ The Fe 7 ± 0.5 mg samples of prepared amorphous alloy were selected to investigate the crystallization kinetics through DTA/TG (German NETZSCH-STA 409C thermal analyzer) in a dynamic (50 ml/min) Ar atmosphere at various heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min within the 20 to 1000 °C [ Structural characterization was carried out by XRD spectra in the range of 2θ = 20–100° by an EQuniox 3000 powder diffractometer with Cu target. Moreover, the formation of amorphous phases was confirmed using TEM (Philips CM30). The kinetic model was employed to control the amount of amorphous/crystalline ratio and improve the magnetic properties of products during the crystallization. In this investigation, the cooling process was tried to be as fast as possible by increasing the Ar rate after crystallization process. The percentage of crystalline phase estimated using image processing of TEM bright field images by randomly measuring the surface of at least 50 crystalline regions surrounded by amorphous phase. Similar estimation was done using XRD patterns of annealed samples. The crystallite size was estimated by Scherrer method and the contribution of instrumental factor in the width of the XRD line profiles was removed from the observed profile using the XRD pattern of a completely annealed sample. Magnetic properties of the samples were analyzed using VSM on the lakeshore 7404 with external magnetic field up to 20,000 G. Model fitting and model free (isoconversional) methods are the most common strategy for studying of solid state kinetics in non-isothermal approaches. Because, T and α change in the same time for non-isothermal investigations, the model fitting method cannot give an appropriate distinction between temperature dependence, k(T), and the reaction model, f(α). Thus, any f(α) instead of the true one can be used for fitting the experimental data that leads to extreme variation in Arrhenius parameters to compensate the difference between assumed and true values of f(α). So, the results of the model fitting method are unreliable. Generally, the model fitting method gives only a value of the activation energy for whole stages of the process. However, it cannot indicate the effect of temperature and extent of conversion variations on the reaction mechanisms and kinetics [ The relation between the reaction rate and temperature can be explained by Arrhenius equation [ The advanced isoconversional method, proposed by Vyazovkin, was employed to estimate the variation of E Overlapping of parallel or consecutive reactions is the main source of activation energy variation during the progressing of transformation. Hence, deconvolution of overlapping reactions is necessary for any kinetic analysis. This study used the proposed methodology by Shahcheraghi et al. [ Generally, f(α), E and A By employment Eq.   As shown in To study the crystallization kinetic of amorphous Fe The changes of α as a function of T is estimated by the employment of Eq.   The main phenomena during the mechanical alloying can be considered as cold welding, fracturing and rewelding of raw materials. As a consequence, the number of imperfections as well as internal strains is increased, significantly. These defects act as initial nucleation sites during the crystallization of Fe The main portion of defects in crystalline materials belongs to dislocations, grain boundaries and vacancies. While, in amorphous materials, instead of these defects, there are three-dimensional clusters of vacancy that collapse during the heating and produce some planar defects as quasi-dislocation dipoles [ Since the quasi-dislocation dipoles are the most important sites for saving of elastic stresses and act as the suitable nucleation sites during the crystallization [  It was necessary to note that during the crystallization of amorphous alloy, diffusion of especially larger alloying elements into the lattice structure of Fe as a matrix is more difficult and consequently enhanced the thermal stability of proposed alloy in comparison with the similar alloys that used metalloid elements as alloying agents (  The good agreement between the experimentally obtained Sh(α) curve and the proposed method obtained Sh(α) curve (b = 5 °C/min) in By determination of dα/dt (Eq. It is necessary to note that to maintain the appropriate soft magnetic properties, the grain size of crystalline portion of proposed alloy must be lower than 20–40 nm for Fe based alloys [ The formation of crystalline phase is checked using the crystallinity degree (CD) determined by Eq. Image analysis of TEM bright field images after crystallization progress to α = 0.7 (   In present work, the amorphous Fe The authors gratefully acknowledge
