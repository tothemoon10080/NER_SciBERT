                     )-expansion method is an interesting approach to find new and more general exact solutions to the nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs) in mathematical physics and engineering. In this paper, the method is applied to construct exact solutions involving parameters for the foam drainage equation. When these parameters are taken to be special values, the solitary wave solutions, the periodic wave and the rational function solutions are derived from exact solutions. These solutions might be imperative and significant for the explanation of some practical physical phenomena. It is shown that the method is an easy and advanced mathematical tool for solving NLEEs.Since the world around us is inherently nonlinear and NLEEs are widely used to describe compound corporeal phenomena in various fields of sciences, especially in mathematical physics and engineering such as mathematical biology, magneto fluid dynamics, water surface gravity waves, electromagnetic radiation reactions, ion acoustic waves in plasma, fluid mechanics, chemical kinematics, geochemistry, bio-genetics, acoustics, chemistry, biology, protein chemistry etc, many powerful methods to seek exact solutions of NLEEs have been proposed.
