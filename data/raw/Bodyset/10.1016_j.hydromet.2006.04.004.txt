The solvent extraction of europium(III) from nitrate medium (0.1 M or 1 M) with acidic chelating extractants HL in chloroform, at 25 °C, has been studied. The extractants are either 3-phenyl-4-acylisoxazol-5-ones (acyl = benzoyl, “HPBI”, and p-tert-butylbenzoyl, “HPtbBI”), or substituted 4-acyl-5-hydroxypyrazoles 1-(p-nitro-phenyl)-3-phenyl-4-lauroyl-5-hydroxypyrazole, “HNPPLP”, and 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-(p-tert-butylbenzoyl)-5-hydroxy-pyrazole, “HPMtbBP”, of various acidities. In all cases europium is extracted by cation exchange as EuL3,org. Because of their higher acidity, extractions performed with 4-acylisoxazol-5-ones occur at lower pH range than with 4-acylpyrazol-5-ones. The order of extraction efficiency is: HPMtbBP (pK

                     =4.1)<HNPPLP (pK

                     =1.2). The nature of the cation of the inorganic salt used to fix the ionic strength has no effect on the extraction. Due to the competitive complexation of Eu3+ by NO3
                     − in the aqueous phase, the extraction from nitrate medium is less efficient than from perchlorate medium: the order of extraction is NaNO3

                     ≈LiNO3
                     <NaClO4. Extraction was also studied in other diluents and increased in the order: chloroform<1,2-dichloroethane≤benzene≈toluene≈hexane. The same order was observed for europium extraction with several other β-diketones. On the basis of values found in literature, trends of extraction of europium with β-diketones in several diluents are proposed.For the better management of extractants used in the nuclear industry during the reprocessing of nuclear fuel, it would be preferable to use extractants composed only of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen atoms, “CHON-Extractants” ( Among the other objectives of the nuclear industry, the separation of lanthanides (Ln) and minor actinides (An) from other fission products is of interest, after the extraction of uranium and plutonium. This reduces the storage volume of radioactive waste and avoids problems in fuel fabrication and in reactor irradiation ( The heterocyclic β-ketoenols 4-acyl-isoxazol-5-ones and 4-acyl-pyrazol-5-ones, obeying the CHON-Extractants rule, constitute an interesting area of research. Indeed Rao, Manchanda and Mohapatra consider 4-acyl-isoxazol-5-ones as promising extractants for uranium ( In the present work, europium(III) has been selected in the series of lanthanides because it is the element generally taken as representative of lanthanides for inter-groups Ln/An comparisons, in particular with americium(III). Four heterocyclic β-ketoenols have been chosen as extractants to complete previous data about europium(III) extraction, with the aim of comparing the properties of a series of extractant molecules with various acidities and lipophilicities [ Contrary to the majority of research on the extraction of Ln by β-diketones that have been carried out from sodium perchlorate medium, the present work deals with extractions from nitrate medium. It was chosen because the aqueous solutions during the reprocessing of nuclear fuel are rich in nitrates. It is also the case for some solutions used in the commercial production of lanthanides ( Chloroform has been used as diluent in this study to allow comparisons with much previous data ( The preparation of HPBI, HPtbBI, HNPPLP and HPMtbBP has been detailed in previous papers ( For a given chemical species The extractions were performed using a batch technique in thermostatted vessels (25.0 The behaviour of an acidic extractant in an aqueous–organic system is described by its acidity constant in aqueous phase Thus, Let us consider a dilute metal ion The thermodynamic constant of equilibrium  However, [  For the same extraction process described by the equilibrium This equation shows that the variation of log The values of the p Typical experimental distribution curves log This stoichiometry was also established by several authors for the extraction of europium by other 4-acyl-5-hydroxy-pyrazoles and 4-acyl-isoxazolones in various solvents ( For every extraction system, the value of The averaged values are reported in As the nitrates and alkali ions frequently accompany lanthanides in industrial solutions, it is worthwhile to know if they affect the extraction process efficiency. Therefore, the influence of the cation and anion of the inorganic salt used to control the ionic strength and that of the concentration of the nitrate ion was considered. The solvent extraction of europium with HPBI or HPtbBI in chloroform from sodium nitrate medium, potassium nitrate medium or lithium nitrate medium was carried out. Experimental distribution curves log To determine the effect of the nature of the inorganic anion upon the extraction efficiency, some extractions of Eu Comparing the apparent extraction constants from 1 M ClO This observation allows the calculation of an approximate value of the apparent extraction constant of europium with HPMBP in aqueous 0.1 M nitrate medium, from the constant determined in perchlorate medium at the same ionic strength: For HPMBP, log The variation of the nitrate salt concentration from 1 M to 0.1 M was found to have no detectable effect on extraction. The values of the complexation factor log (1+ Some representative curves of europium extraction from sodium nitrate medium with HPtbBI and HPMtbBP in different diluents, chloroform and toluene for both extractants and 1,2-dichloroethane for HPtbBI, are shown in The corresponding apparent extraction constants are reported in These values show that for every HL: HPBI, HPtbBI, HPMTFP, HPMBP, HPMtbBP and HTTA, the extractions carried out with toluene and benzene are highest than those with chloroform. This phenomenon was already reported for the extraction of divalent metals by β-diketones ( Since the weakest extractions are obtained with chloroform, it was chosen as a reference diluent for quantitative comparisons. For a given compound HL and a diluent “dil”, let us define: The values of Δlog chloroform In a first approach, we have tried to connect this trend with some physical properties of the various diluents, like the dielectric constant, the dipole moment or the polarity constant. But it proved that none of these properties provide an overall explanation. Thus, the nature of the extractants and the extracted metal must be taken into account. It is known that a strong interaction between the diluent and the extractant, i.e. a strong solvation, results in a lowering of the extractant activity in the organic phase, and hence results in a decrease of the extraction yield, according to the extraction equilibrium. Hexane has a very weak interaction with extractants since its C−H bonds are not polarized. A similar behaviour must be expected with kerosene. In the case of benzene and toluene, their interaction with the extractants used in this work would be primarily due to π–π interactions between phenyls that are likely weaker than most hydrogen-bond interactions. However, these ligands may form two kinds of H-bonds with chloroform ( The similar magnitude of the variation Δlog To obtain a better understanding of some of the above observations, these results may be compared with those obtained in previous articles upon copper extraction with the same extractants, in toluene ( However, there are rather well known differences of complexation behaviour between europium and copper, such as the coordination number higher for europium (9 to 12) than for copper (4 to 6) (  The significant difference in extraction of europium between HPBI and HPtbBI in nitrate and perchlorate medium, which is not observed in the case of copper, may be caused by the more ionic character of the bonding of Eu For both metal ions, the extractions performed in toluene, benzene or 1,2-dichloroethane are more efficient than in chloroform. However, the nature of the extracted metal has an influence upon the value of Δlog Europium (III) is extracted from aqueous nitrate medium with various heterocyclic β-keto-enols HL (HL= HPBI, HPtbBI, HNPPLP and HPMtbBP) in chloroform as EuL The nitrate ions induce competitive effects: the europium complexation in the aqueous phase that reduces the extraction efficiency is counter-balanced by the salting out effect at high ionic strength, so that the extraction is not sensitive to the nitrate concentration between 0.1 M and 1 M. Dichloroethane, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons diluents allow comparable and strong extraction of europium, compared to that obtained with chloroform. This trend was confirmed for several β-diketones.
