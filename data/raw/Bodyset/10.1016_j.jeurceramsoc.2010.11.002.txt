The wear behaviour of a monolithic alumina and an alumina–aluminium titanate laminated structure was studied. The laminate, containing surface fine grained alumina layers and internal composite layers with 10vol.% of aluminium titanate, showed relatively low (≅20MPa) compressive residual stresses at the surface. Interfaces between layers were constituted by large alumina grains (up to ≅50μm) that promoted toughening due to crack deflection and branching. Wear tests were performed on square specimens (30mm×30mm×6mm) using the pin-on-disc method. The laminates showed higher wear resistance than the monolithic alumina. The analysis of the results together with SEM-EDX observations was performed to identify possible wear mechanisms. The wear resistance improvements are discussed in terms of the residual stresses in the laminate and the properties provided by the special microstructure of the interfaces.Ceramic materials can significantly improve the response of components and pieces for applications involving contact loadings due to their high hardness, potentially low friction, excellent corrosion resistance and ability to operate under extreme conditions as high temperatures. In particular, alumina materials are widely considered to be excellent candidates for wear-resistant components due to their high hardness. As an alternative to monolithic materials, the laminated configuration arises as a microstructural design strategy, that may be defined as extrinsic, for developing more flaw tolerant ceramic materials. In laminates, a suitable combination of layers with different compositions or microstructures yield improved mechanical response with respect to that exhibited by each individual layer. In a first group, it has been shown that laminated structures can be properly designed on the basis of the development of surface compressive residual stresses during cooling from the sintering temperature, giving rise to large improvements in strength and surface toughness On the other hand, on the basis of the toughening mechanisms identified for stress free natural structures, residual stress free laminated materials with stiff layers separated by weak interfaces combine both high strength and a pronounced flaw tolerant behaviour because the potential activation of crack deflexion along the interfaces before penetrating the contiguous layer. A third group of residual stress free laminated materials with strong interfaces between high strength, stiff and hard surface layers and weak, heterogeneous and/or microcracked (i.e. flaw tolerant) internal ones combine the better of the two approaches just described. These materials would be ideal for applications involving contact and thermal loadings, because they could develop internal zones of diffuse damage, avoiding an effective surface structural degradation of the material. According to this last design approach, an alumina–aluminium titanate laminated structure with relatively low compressive surface residual stresses A monolithic material of monophase alumina and one layered structure combining two external and one central alumina layers with two internal alumina Monolithic and layered plates (≈70 Densities of the sintered compacts were determined by the Archimedes's method in water (European Standard EN 1389:2003) and the relative density for monolithic alumina materials was calculated considering 3.99 The true average grain size was determined by the linear intercept method on microstructural images performed by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM, Hitachi, S-4700, Japan) on polished and thermally etched surfaces, considering at least 200 grains for each phase and using the correction factor 4/ Vickers indentation tests were performed on polished surfaces at 50 Young's modulus of the alumina material was determined from the resonance frequency of bars tested in flexure (Grindosonic model MK 5, J.W. Lemmens, Leuven, Belgium); the sample size was 4 Fracture toughness and work of fracture were determined by 3 point bending tests on Single Edge V Notch Beams (SEVNB) of 4 Reported grain size, hardness, Young's modulus, fracture toughness and work of fracture values are the average of at least three measurements and errors are the standard deviations. Sliding wear tests were conducted on square samples (30 The features of the wear track were analysed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Cambridge Instruments, Stereoscan 360, UK) coupled with analysis by dispersive energies of X-ray (EDX, Oxford Instruments, Inca Energy 300, UK). The laminated structure containing surface alumina layers is schematically represented in Characteristic microstructures of the materials are shown in The main features of the microstructure of the laminated structure are shown in In The average stationary values of the coefficient of friction,  Characteristic worn surfaces of the pins and the ceramic specimens are shown in The wear tracks of the monolithic specimens ( The average wear rate values determined for the monolithic alumina material (2.3 The examination of the wear tracks in In spite of the similar wear mechanism for both materials, the pins slid against the laminates showed lower average wear rates ( First, the differences of the mechanical properties between monolith and laminate ( Effectively, as described elsewhere, Another possible explanation for the different wear resistance of monolith and laminate is the thermal effect that takes place in the couplings during the tests. In the disk wear track, the heat dissipation at the contact point is determined by the thermal conductivity ( A rough calculation of possible additional heating of the worn surface in the laminate due to the refractory behaviour of porous interfaces can be estimated from the heat flux schematically represented in For a calculation purpose, a flash temperature of approximately 500 A heat flux similar to that calculated for the monolithic specimen ( To summarise, from the different possibilities studied to explain such different wear resistances, in spite of the similar wear mechanisms, the higher fracture toughness associated to surface compressive residual stress developed in the laminate appears to be, at least in part, responsible of the improved behaviour in the laminated specimen. However, as discussed previously on the basis of average experimental values, this improvement is larger than expected from the bettered mechanical properties in the laminate. Concerning this discussion, it also has to be emphasized that even though hardness values of the monolithic and the laminate are statistically the same, hardness of the monolithic alumina is highly variable, that must be related to other parameters: the higher fracture toughness of the laminate ( This slight microstructural difference observed in the laminate (more homogeneous microstructure in the surface alumina layer) would also explain the improved wear resistance. The model of Evans The results of some preliminary experiments exploring the wear resistance of an alumina–aluminium titanate flaw tolerant laminated structure with low residual stresses are presented. The wear mechanism of the laminate is the same as that of a reference monolithic alumina fabricated using the same conditions as that of the laminate and, thus, with similar microstructural parameters. The laminate presents higher wear resistance in terms of total volume loss of material, the possible factors responsible for this behaviour are: The higher fracture toughness in the laminate associated to surface compressive residual stress developed in the surface layers. The more homogeneous microstructure of the surface alumina layers in the laminate as compared to that of the alumina monolithic material with some grains larger than 10 The financial support of the Project MEC MAT2006-13480 C02 and the Postdoctoral Fellowship MEC EX-2006-0555 (Spain) is acknowledged.
