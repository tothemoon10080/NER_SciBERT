The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the alien invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) in the nutrient dynamics of temperate estuarine systems (oligohaline areas) under climate change scenarios.
                  The scenarios simulated shifts in climatic conditions, following salinity (0 or 5) and temperature (24 or 30 °C) changes, usual during drought and heat wave events. The effect of the individual size/age (different size classes with fixed biomass) and density (various densities of <1 cm clams) on the bioturbation-associated nutrient dynamics were also evaluated under an 18-day laboratory experimental setup.
                  Results highlight the significant effect of C. fluminea on the ecosystem nutrient dynamics, enhancing the efflux of both phosphate and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the sediments to the water column. Both drought and heat wave events will have an impact on the DIN dynamics within C. fluminea colonized systems, favouring a higher NH4-N efflux.
                  The population structure of C. fluminea will have a decisive role on the impact of the species, with stronger nutrient effluxes associated with a predominantly juvenile population structure.Invasive alien species (IAS) introduction has increased considerably in aquatic ecosystems in recent decades, as a result of expanding commerce, aquaculture and shipping activities (  A distinct mechanism which may also affect biogeochemical dynamics is bioturbation and bioirrigation; the first influences the distribution of sediment particles (by sediment reworking), while the latter will have an impact on solutes (by burrow ventilation) within the sediment and at the sediment–water interface ( Global climate change, with altered frequencies and intensities of extreme weather events (floods, droughts and heat waves), together with mean sea level rise, are expected to have adverse effects on natural and human systems ( Massive mortality events have been reported for  The experimental apparatus ( Water in each tank was replaced after 24 h to remove excess nutrients associated with sediment manipulation during assembly. Different For the small-sized individuals alone, the most abundant size class at the collection site, the density effect was also tested, using a control with no fauna and three density treatments with 6, 12 and 24 individuals (mean biomass per tank: 9.0, 18.8 and 35.7 g wet weight per 144 cm For comparison purposes, in all experiments Control tanks (without For both experiments, salinity, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration were monitored in the water column and water samples (10 mL) collected at day 0, day 3, day 6, day 12 and day 18 of incubation from each tank, for nutrient analysis. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (PO The data were statistically tested with a Permutational Multivariate Analyses of Variance – PERMANOVA for a three-factor, crossed repeated measures design, to test the response of the concentration of nutrients to the fixed factors size (four levels: control, small, medium and large), salinity (two levels: 0 and 5) and temperature (two levels: 24 and 30), and with time as a repeated measure (3 replicates per time). PERMANOVA is an analysis of variance to test one or more factors, using permutation methods and on the basis of a resemblance matrix ( Prior to the PERMANOVA, the homogeneity of within-group dispersion among tested factors (size, salinity and temperature) was tested with PERMDISP analyses, also with the Euclidean distance as resemblance matrix, as PERMANOVA is sensitive to differences in the multivariate dispersion among groups. For the density experiment, both PERMDISP and PERMANOVA were also applied using the same procedure as with the size experiment (each data point as variable) on a Euclidean Distance basis to test the response of the nutrient content to the fixed factor density, with four levels (control, 6 inds, 12 inds and 24 inds), with replication (3 replicates). All the analyses were performed using PRIMER v6 software with the PERMANOVA add-on package ( Nutrient fluxes to the water column were expressed in terms of concentration change over time. The data obtained per unit of time was modelled by nonlinear regression analysis, using GraphPad Prism 6 (trial version) that uses the least-squares fitting method and the method of Marquardt and Levenberg for adjusting the variables; this method blends the method of linear descent and the method of Gauss-Newton. The one-phase exponential association model (eq. For each nutrient, a half-life (the time it takes to reach half of the equilibrium value) was calculated (T Measured salinity for the category “salinity 5” was 4.5 ± 0.3 (mean ± standard deviation). Regarding temperature, measured values for treatment 24 °C were 23.6 ± 1.0 °C, and for the 30 °C one 29.8 ± 1.2 °C. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were generally higher for the 24 °C treatment (8.0 ± 0.4 mg L Nutrient concentrations at time 0 (C0) were respectively 0.08 mg L Within-group dispersion was significant for the factor size for both PO The 2-way interaction size x temperature was significant for all nutrients, which means that size may have constrained the response to temperature ( For PO While salinity was not significant, NO A more in-depth study on the kinetics of the nutrient release was performed for phosphorus and nitrate, the prevalent form of nitrogen ( Within-group dispersion was non-significant in the density experiment. Density was significant for all nutrients (p-perm <0.02). However, the pairwise comparisons were not significant (p-perm>0.08) due to the low number of possible unique permutations (10). Still, some patterns were apparent, with the concentrations of the control generally lower than the ones with fauna ( Kinetic modelling revealed that, similarly to what was observed for the size experiment, Considerable scientific attention has been devoted to the impact of Overall, our study reinforces the significant effect of Still, for the same biomass, the population structure emerges as the main factor governing nutrient release, with enhanced dissolved concentrations in the small and medium sized The observed enhancement of phosphorus release by the presence of Regarding the dynamics of DIN (NH These results highlight the importance of population structure on the dissolved nutrient dynamics, especially considering the die-off events reported for this species ( One of the main objectives of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of hypothetical climate change scenarios on the dissolved inorganic nutrient dynamics of Contrary to the most common behaviour in transitional ecosystems with salinity gradients, the increase in salinity did not favor phosphate release into the water column; instead, dissolved PO The heat wave scenario (temperature increase), in turn, only enhanced NH Overall, the present research highlights the significant effect of The authors would like to thank all colleagues who helped in field and laboratory work.
