This paper discusses how modelling and simulation can be used in predicting the recovery of platinum group elements (PGE) in flotation process. In platinum group ores, commonly a floatability component approach is used where each element is divided in model fitting to two or three components. This approach has the problem of breaking the natural association of platinum group element in minerals, floatability components do not have any physical meaning and as the model fitting problem is ill-posed, comparison of different tests by floatability component parameters is difficult. To avoid this modelling and simulation here is based on minerals. Additionally, the mass proportion of fast floating material was fixed on the basis of mineralogical study and results achieved in laboratory flotation tests. Finally as the rougher and cleaning flotation was performed in fixed chemical regime the model fitting was done for both rougher and cleaning stages simultaneously using cascade model. It was found in this way a number of model fitted parameters decreased giving possibility to compare tests results easier but still reaching good fit between observed, modelled and simulated data. The developed model was used in screening the best flotation conditions and to forecast the metallurgical performance in full scale process.
