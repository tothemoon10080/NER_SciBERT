Calcification of arteries is common in advanced age, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and hypertension and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. mTOR is an intriguing candidate as a regulator of osteogenesis, because it is characteristically associated with cellular metabolism and longevity through its effects on cell growth, proliferation, and survival rather than on bone metabolism. Signalling through mTOR is complex. It is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family and functions as an intracellular sensor for energy metabolism, nutrient availability, and cellular stresses and regulates cell growth and metabolism to adapt to environmental changes. Although mTOR is now considered a major player in lipid and glucose metabolism, its role in the vasculature is still largely unknown. There is some evidence that it regulates vascular Ca Of particular interest, adiponectin was found to inhibit mTOR-induced osteogenic differentiation.
