The objective of the present study was to assess the relative contributions of microbial (mineralization of non-microbial organic phosphorus and microbial phosphorus) and physical–chemical (diffusion of phosphate ions at the solid-to-solution interface) processes involved in replenishing the soil solution with phosphate ions. This assessment was carried out across soil depths and subsystems in a forest ecosystem. Major differences in the contribution of microbial processes (CMP%) were found between soil layers and subsystems, corresponding with differences in soil organic matter and Al and Fe oxide contents. CMP% significantly decreased with increasing soil depth (from 87–100% in the forest floor to 2–16% in the 90–120cm mineral soil layer). Tree fine roots were mostly concentrated in the top soil layers where microbial processes dominated. Consequently, estimates of CMP% in the entire soil profile were also affected by the vertical distribution of tree fine roots. We assumed that including fine root densities leads to a more correct estimation of the role of microbial processes (CMP%=31–52% in the entire soil profile, up to 75% in one particular site). To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of the relative contributions of the different processes involved in replenishing the soil solution with phosphate ions based on soil properties and fine root distribution.Phosphorus (P) is essential for living organisms and, together with nitrogen, is often a limiting factor for plant growth in forests, grasslands and croplands ( Diffusion of iP at the solid-to-solution interface (a physical–chemical process; transfer of iP from the soil solid constituents to the soil solution under a gradient of concentration; It requires improved understanding of the relative contribution of physical–chemical and microbial processes in supplying available P. In other words, we need to know which are the main processes that control soil P availability ( Although iP diffusion fluxes have been widely studied and quantified, microbial processes have rarely been evaluated because direct quantification of organic P mineralization is difficult ( The main objective of the present study was to assess the relative contributions of physical–chemical (diffusion of iP at the solid-to-solution interface) and microbial processes (mineralization of non-microbial organic P and microbial P) in replenishing the soil solution with iP in a wide range of surface and deeper soil layers (forest floor and mineral soils down to a depth of 120 The “ On the basis of the understory composition, the rate of colonization by plants and the hydraulic architecture of the surface water streams ( Our evaluation of the relative contributions of physical–chemical and microbial processes controlling P availability was based on a process-based approach and the conceptual diagram presented in We compiled data from 144 soil samples (24 sites and six soil layers: forest floor (i.e. holorganic O horizon above the organo-mineral horizon; sum of OL, OF and OH sub-horizons), 0–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–90 and 90–120 Here, microbial processes were added to the data set to enable evaluation of the relative contributions of physical–chemical and microbial processes. To this end, a pedotransfer function was used to estimate microbial biomass P based on soil properties. This pedotransfer function was built using other top and deep soils ( Since physical–chemical properties and P status of our study sandy soils are generally equal in the 90–400 Tree fine root density was quantified in a total of 34 sites (eight grass moorland sites, seven fern moorland sites, 15 heathland sites and four coastal dunes; only 3–4 sites per subsystem for the 30–120 A mixed linear model with site as a random effect was applied to test the general effects of depth and subsystem and their interaction for each P status or fine root variable. Differences between subsystems in a given soil layer were tested using one-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni  CMP% decreased with increasing soil depth ( Considering the entire forest floor Tree fine root density significantly decreased with increasing soil depth, and in deep soil layers it was higher in heathland sites than in the other subsystems ( CMP% in the forest floor In agreement with our first hypothesis, major differences in CMP% were found between soil layers and subsystems. We were however surprised to observe the highest CMP% in coastal dunes (and to a lesser extent in heathland sites) despite low organic matter contents in these sites ( Our results suggest that the non-microbial organic P fraction is a large but recalcitrant and slowly available P fraction through mineralization particularly in deep soil layers (see comparisons between total non-microbial organic P and non-microbial organic P mineralized in one year in In agreement with Fine root length densities of In agreement with our second hypothesis, the relative contributions of the different soil layers to plant nutrition and therefore CMP% in the entire forest floor plus the 0–120 Published data gathered in other contexts and surface mineral soil layers suggests generally lower CMP% in croplands than in ecosystems with permanent vegetation, like the forest ecosystem used for our study. These findings are based on previously published data acquired using process-based approaches ( Only physical–chemical processes at the solid-to-solution interface are commonly considered in studies of soil P availability and in diagnostic systems developed for soils continuously cropped for decades (e.g. In the present study, the relative contributions of microbial and physical–chemical (diffusion of iP at the solid-to-solution interface) processes in replenishing the soil solution with iP were assessed for different soil depths and for the entire soil profiles of different subsystems of a forest ecosystem. In agreement with our first hypothesis, major differences were found among soil layers and subsystems as a result of differences in soil organic matter and Al and Fe oxide contents. In particular, we found significant decreases in CMP% with increasing soil depth (from 87–100% in the forest floors to 2–16% in the 90–120 We thank Alain Mollier, Alice André, Anne Gallet-Budynek, Céline Gire, Christian Barbot, Christophe Nguyen, Elise Jolicoeur, Etienne Saur, Frida Andreasson, Lionel Jordan-Meille, Loic Prudhomme, Marc Pucheu-Plante, Maya Gonzalez, Nathalie Gallegos, Pascal Denoroy, Stéphane Thunot, Sylvain Pellerin, Sylvie Milin, Sylvie Niollet, Victor Jean-Paul-Romero and Xavier Cavard for their helpful discussions or for their help in soil and root sampling, soil analyses and root data acquisition.
