Experimental measurements and DFT atomistic modelling were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms for gasification chemistry of char with CO2 gas. The molecular models used were based on experimental representations of coal chars derived from the vitrinite- and inertinite-rich South African coals at 1000°C. The HRTEM and XRD techniques were used to construct parallelogram-shaped PAH stacks of highest frequency in the vitrinite-rich (7×7) and intertinite-rich (11×11) char structures. Computations were executed to get the nucleophilic Fukui functions, at DFT–DNP level, to elucidate the nature and proportions of carbon active sites and quantify their reactivity. The DFT–DNP-computed reaction pathways and transition states, to obtain the energy of reaction and activation energies for the gasification reactions of CO2 with active carbon sites were examined. These results were compared with TGA experimental results at 900–980°C. The mean nucleophilic Fukui function of the H-terminated char models and active sites located at similar edge positions decreased with increasing size of char molecules and followed the sequence: zigzag>armchair>tip active sites. The mean DFT–DNP values for the activation energy of 233kJmol−1 at the reactive carbon edge was in agreement with the experimental 191±25kJmol−1 and 210±8kJmol−1 for the respective chars.Definition [Units] Arithmetic mean [–] Frequency of modal class minus that of previous class [–] Frequency of modal class minus that of following class [–] DFT–DNP atomistic activation energy or energy barrier by generalised synchronous transit method (∼ Enthalpy [kJ Single point energy calculations (Simulations) [–] Number of aromatic carbons per cluster [–] Size of interval [–] (Re)active carbon site [–] (Re)active carbon site [–] Cross polarisation–magic angle spinning [–] Inter-layer spacing for a group of A modelling program that uses DFT [–] Experimental activation energy [kJ Reaction energy by generalised synchronous transit method (∼ΔH) [kJ mol Nucleophilic Fukui function [–] Electrophilic Fukui function [–] Radical Fukui function [–] Function of absolute temperature [–] Function of CO Carbon aromaticity, [–] Lumped pre-exponential factor [min Lower boundary of median interval [Å] Total pore length per unit volume [m Crystallite diameter [Å] Median [Å] Number of data points used [–] Reaction order [–] Partial pressure of CO Initial reactivity of chars [min Lumped reaction rate [m Reaction rate [m Standard deviation [–] Initial surface area [m Time [s and min] Absolute temperature [°C and K] Time for fractional carbon conversion of 90% [min] Single negative frequency from generalised synchronous transit method [cm Fractional conversion of carbon [–] Skewness [–] Initial porosity of char samples [%] Peak position/XRD angle of scan [radians] Gamma band/peak [–] Dimensionless structural parameter for char pores [–] Definition Advanced Laboratory Solutions Carbon to carbon bond/site (National) Centre for high performance computing (Cape Town) Density functional theory Direct inversion of the iterative subspace (for SCF convergence) Double numerical polarisation basis set Differential thermal analyser Fukui function Nucleophilic, Electrophilic, radical Fukui functions Generalised gradient approximation Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital High performance computing (NWU) High resolution transmission electron microscopy Laboratory of applied molecular modelling (NWU) Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital Linear synchronous transit (method to search for TS) Minimum energy pathway Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy North-West University Polyaromatic hydrocarbons Potential energy surface Quality of fit Quadratic synchronous transit (method to search for TS) Root-mean-square for convergence Random pore model Self-consistent forcefield Scanning electron microscopy Thermogravimetric analyser Temperature-programmed desorption Transition state X-ray diffraction Economic and environmental constraints necessitate research into higher efficiency coal utilisation to develop advanced technologies with reduced greenhouse gas emissions. A study of coal gasification is part of this effort. Coal gasification is a complex process that involves reactions with O Various aspects of coal gasification by CO While molecular modelling studies have been conducted into the reactivity of oxygen, steam and CO The present investigation deals with reaction mechanisms between CO Experimental work relevant to molecular models is based on: (i) the characterisation of the two de-ashed chars, and (ii) constructing a molecular model based on HRTEM data from these chars The chars were prepared by heating inertinite- and vitrinite-rich South African Gondwana coals of the Permian Age to 1000 The char models used for modelling studies were based on the HRTEM results shown in The DFT computational requirements restrict the model size for tractable calculations, and the utility of a single graphene sheet to model the coal char is a major concern of the present studies. The SCF convergence for the 11 The edge carbons of the aromatic carbon sheets from the HRTEM were terminated with hydrogen to give polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) char models, following Radovic and Bockrath assertions that structures with entirely free edge carbons were unlikely, but likely with hydrogen termination The modelling study discussed in this investigation commences with the loss of H to form reactive carbon edge or free active sites, followed by chemisorption of CO Molecular models have been proposed to simulate structures with various types of active sites, e.g. the basal plane, armchair, zigzag and tip The DFT geometry optimisations of the char models were performed with the DMol The 1-scf energy calculations were performed on geometry optimised structures to determine the Fukui function (reactivity indicator). The Fukui function, A general mechanism of the reaction of CO The TS were searched by LST/QST methods The objective of the experimentation undertaken was to obtain the results of activation energy using particle reaction kinetics, and compare these with those obtained from the reaction rate modelling based on the molecular structure (atomic reaction rate). For this purpose, experimentation was carried out using a thermogravimetric analyser with the random pore model reaction modelling Isothermal char–CO The isothermal gasification experiments were carried out with CO The intrinsic reaction rate equation based on the random pore model was evaluated according to the method proposed by Everson et al. The relevant random pore model expressions are shown in Eqs. The present work involves the size of the graphene structure consistent with the low energy differences reported by Pham and Truong Fukui function as a reactivity indicator, allowed for the modelling sequence that commences with loss of hydrogen to form active C∗ sites, followed by chemisorption of CO Substantial research have found that the chemical interactions between carbon molecules and reactant gases take place at the edge’s active carbon atoms for coal based char models and also for non-coal char models The definition, position and numbering of H-terminated The results indicate that reactivity of H-terminated char models and active sites located at similar edge positions decreases with increasing size. In addition to this, the reactivity analysis of the respective char models show that the The Fukui function values on the H-terminated edge carbons are taken as indicative of the sites that would form C It was postulated that during CO Consequently, the carbon edge (reactive edge) composed of reactive sites C The utility of single graphene sheets (or ribbons) as models for coal-char gasification studies presents a number of challenges. Pham and Truong have shown that the size of the graphene ribbon increases in length and width, its orbital energy gap decreases, with the lowest energy gap obtained for ribbons of length >8; they also demonstrate the errors in the total energies as a function of the ribbon length at different levels of theory Char models have generally used selected active sites for DFT studies on the interactions of carbonaceous surfaces and gaseous reactants, with the remaining edge carbons capped with hydrogen atoms The C-H bond breakdown for the benzene molecule was evaluated to obtain the activation energy (energy barrier), Δ The mean Δ It is reasonable to infer from this, that data on electronic states, and resulting variations in computed energy values for these small molecules, may lack a direct relevance to mechanisms involving coal derived char, since changes in the size of the molecular model and number of active sites, would lead to changes in electronic states. For example, it may be speculated that stacking of sheets, as found in graphite, may impact on the π delocalised electrons, and active sites located above and below edges may also impact on the electronic states and configurations of chemisorbed CO Chemisorption of CO   The MEP includes a description of the reaction and provides the energy barrier (activation energy) and the minimum energy path between a pair of stable states These values are in contrast to high values reported for perfect and defective basal carbon planes by Cabrera-Sanfelix The Examination of bond distances on the structures of CO The change in geometry of the CO This mechanism is the breakage of the char(O⋯CO) bond. The char(CO The current approach has been to obtain an average value. However, it is noted that the mean Δ When the transition state is sufficiently refined, the computational procedure will provide The chemistry considered for loss of the second CO is the thermal decomposition of the six membered carbon ring at elevated temperatures and the result is the loss of gaseous CO and formation of either a five member ring in the char substrate, or loss of CO and formation of additional active C∗ sites for further chemisorption of additional CO Numerous computations were performed to find transition state structures for the decomposition reactions. The decomposition of the 6-member carbon ring yields a CO (or C The decomposition reaction energetics presented in The structures for the C The major focus of the current investigation has been to compare computer molecular modelling results obtained using a simple molecular model with experimental results from char gasification.

The CO The data is consistent with a mechanism for CO Chemisorption of CO Yield of the first CO gas molecule: Two structures may form; one is a stable chemisorbed CO Yield of the second CO gas molecule: A number of quinone-type char(CO) structures form after loss of the first CO. These structures may decompose to form CO and relatively stable five member carbon rings in char; however where stable 5 member rings are not energetically favoured, these do not undergo ring formation but instead may form additional C The DFT modelling of CO This work is based on the research supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation ( Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
