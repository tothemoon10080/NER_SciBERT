I have read the paper First of all, it is important to emphasize that the conclusion made by the authors is the result of some limited experimental work performed on limestone, marble and travertine, which mainly belong to ‘Group a’ rocks given in We must bear in mind that rock density, porosity, mineral grain size, cementation degree and heterogeneity may well affect the critical specimen volume required for Shore hardness tests. Different rock groups may behave differently under impact loads, mainly due to their elasticity and intergranular structure. For example, Rabia and Brook It is also possible that further work may even necessitate the establishment of different Finally, I appreciate and accept the presented contribution of the authors as the first step of an attempt to determine standardized Shore hardness values, and would like to repeat the pronouncement of Vincent Van Gogh: “Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together”. I hope the authors find the preceding remarks valuable.
