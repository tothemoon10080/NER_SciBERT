A new device, MAGCLA™, which is capable to separate and classify particles according to their magnetic susceptibility, was developed by the authors. In a previous article the equations of movement for non-magnetic particles in this new device were analyzed and in this paper the limiting conditions set by the different variables and equations of movement are presented for the case of the non-magnetic particles. The knowledge of these limiting conditions is important as they set the boundaries within which we may manipulate the MAGCLA™’s operating and design variables.angle between the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier and the horizontal axis and the normal direction angle between the total velocity and the rotational axis angular velocity of the body of the MAGCLA™ friction coefficient for the surface of the separator–classifier on the tangential direction rotational displacement friction coefficient in the density of the fluid density of the particle acceleration of the particle cross-sectional area of the particle acceleration on the acceleration on the tangential acceleration of the particle total acceleration of the particles acceleration on the drag coefficient force acting on the particle frequency of the rotation of the trunk of the separator–classifier friction force in the friction force acting on the direction tangential to the surface centrifugal force drag force total force acting on the direction tangential to the surface gravity acceleration height of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier overall current intensity flowing in the superconducting cable mass of the praticle force exerted by the surface on the particle weight of the particle radial distance between the particle and the geometrical center radius of the cylindrical part of the body of the separator–classifier external radius of the central collector internal radius of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier initial radius of the fed particles radius of the particle fictitious radius to account for the deviations to ideality radius of the superconducting magnet plus cryostat system space covered by a particle in one turn, in the tangential direction time theoretical adimensional parameters that measure the disparities between theory and practice velocity of the particle in the volume of the particle velocity of the particle in the direction of the movement velocity of the particle in the tangential direction of the circular movement tangential velocity of the particle total velocity of the particle initial height of the fed particles minimum space covered by a particle in a turn, in the tangential direction rotating period of the trunk of the separator–classifier MAGCLA™ is a new magnetic separator and classifier that is being developed by Augusto and co-workers In Refs. The operating limiting conditions for MAGCLA™ are obtained by setting the movement to the conditions we are interested in. This means that most of the limiting conditions described below are obtained by solving the equations of movement or force balance for some specified value or sign (for the device to perform as desired) of the operating variables ( Detailed description of the apparatus working principles may be found in the literature The approximations considered in Ref. In order to separate the non-magnetic particles from the remaining ones, the net tangential force described by Eq. Dividing this inequality by cos Solving inequality Hence condition As 0 Thus, we have obtained a pair of conditions  An alternative pair of conditions may be obtained if we solve inequality As the system is impossible when 1 Hence, a limiting condition for The new pair of limiting conditions for  If we compare the two pair of conditions for ( Thus, if, for example, we need to maintain a low rotation velocity (e.g. because of economical reasons), then to lower the limiting value of For expressions The function increases with In the ideal separator and classifier, the lowest radius corresponds to Summing up, the pairs of limiting conditions of the variables   The friction coefficients on the rotational and tangential directions are different, and so their limiting conditions are analyzed in separate. For the Therefore it may be concluded that for expression If the coefficient For the Substituting in inequality If instead of considering the movement of the particles relatively to a static observer, we consider it relatively to an observer placed in the central axis of rotation of the apparatus rotating at the same speed, we verify that the movement of the particles will take place only in the upwards-tangential direction. This means that all the non-magnetic particles fed in the same position follow exactly the same path. The minimization of the interparticle bumps is one of the objectives that must be considered in the idealization of any magnetic separation in order to increase its efficiency; in our case, this will be accomplished if the particle-radius of the non-magnetic particles is below a certain critical value. This critical value is computed bearing in mind the upwards-tangential movement of the non-magnetic particles: it will be half the minimum distance traveled by the particle in a generic turn As the time spent by a particle to make a full generic turn Making The second term of Eq. As from the limiting conditions derived before based on Therefore, the maximum radius of the particle must obey the following condition: As long as this maximum radius is complied, we may assure the non-existence of any bumps between particles in their upwards movement. In the cases where we need to use particles presenting a radius higher than the one allowed by the limiting expression The theoretical background of a new magnetic separator and classifier (MAGCLA The Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia is acknowledged for its Post-Doc Grant – SFRH/BPD/6964/2001 (P.A.

It is important to verify the influence of Hence, we may conclude that the expression inside the function arc It is also important to analyze the influence of Therefore we may conclude that a more limited value of
