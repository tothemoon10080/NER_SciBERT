This work shows that aqueous solutions of clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid), the bioactive metabolite of various lipid-regulating drugs, up to saturation at pH 3.0 are efficiently and completely degraded by electrochemical advanced oxidation processes such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton with Fe2+ and UVA light as catalysts using an undivided electrolytic cell with a boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode and an O2-diffusion cathode able to electrogenerate H2O2. This is feasible in these environmentally friendly methods by the production of oxidant hydroxyl radical at the BDD surface from water oxidation and in the medium from Fenton's reaction between Fe2+ and electrogenerated H2O2. The degradation process is accelerated in photoelectro-Fenton by additional photolysis of Fe3+ complexes under UVA irradiation. Comparative treatments by anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2, but without Fe2+, yield much slower decontamination. Chloride ion is released and totally oxidized to chlorine at the BDD surface in all treatments. The decay kinetics of clofibric acid always follows a pseudo-first-order reaction. 4-Chlorophenol, 4-chlorocatechol, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone and 2-hydroxyisobutyric, tartronic, maleic, fumaric, formic and oxalic acids, are detected as intermediates. The ultimate product is oxalic acid, which is slowly but progressively oxidized on BDD in anodic oxidation. In electro-Fenton this acid forms Fe3+–oxalato complexes that can also be totally destroyed at the BDD anode, whereas in photoelectro-Fenton the mineralization rate of these complexes is enhanced by its parallel photodecarboxylation with UVA light.The detection of a large variety of pharmaceutical drugs and metabolites including analgesics, anti-inflammatories, antimicrobials, antiepileptics, beta-blockers, estrogens and lipid regulators as emerging pollutants in waters at concentrations from nanograms to micrograms per litre has been recently documented Clofibric acid (2-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-methylpropionic acid) is the bioactive metabolite of drugs such as clofibrate, etofibrate and etofyllineclofibrate, widely used as blood lipid regulators because they decrease the plasmatic content of cholesterol and triglycerides Recently, powerful indirect electrooxidation methods such as electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton are being developed for water remediation This paper reports a comparative study on the degradation of clofibric acid by electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton using an undivided electrolytic cell with a BDD anode and an O Clofibric acid, 4-chlorophenol, hydroquinone, The solution pH was determined with a Crison 2000 pH-meter. Aliquots withdrawn from treated solutions were filtered with Whatman 0.45 The concentration of chloride ion in treated solutions was determined by ion chromatography with a Shimadzu 10Avp HPLC chromatograph fitted with a Shim-Pack IC-A1S, 100 All electrolyses were conducted in an open, cylindrical, undivided and thermostated cell containing 100 Comparative treatments were made for solutions containing 179 The above comparative study shows that photoelectro-Fenton is the method with highest oxidation power due to large enhancement of the destruction of final products by UVA light, then being the best AEOP for the treatment of wastewaters containing clofibric acid. Electro-Fenton also yields much faster degradation than anodic oxidation, but its oxidation power drops significantly at the end of electrolysis because final products are difficultly oxidized by The influence of current density and clofibric acid concentration on the oxidizing ability of the above electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes was explored. It was found that these experimental parameters showed the same trends in both AEOPs, as expected if they mainly affect the behavior of the electrolytic system. These effects are depicted in It is well-known that reaction of chloroaromatics with hydroxyl radical leads to the release of chloride ion The above findings allow concluding that the mineralization of clofibric acid involves its conversion into CO   The decay of the metabolite in the different electrochemical methods was followed by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography, where it exhibited a well-defined peak at The comparative kinetics of the removal of clofibric acid with generated strong oxidizing agents (mainly BDD( On the other hand, The effect of current density on the decay kinetics of this compound was further explored for the electro-Fenton treatment. As can be seen in A 179 The evolution of aromatic intermediates during the different treatments of 179 From the above results, a general reaction sequence for the initial degradation of clofibric acid is proposed in Ion-exclusion chromatograms of solutions treated by the two anodic oxidation methods displayed peaks ascribed to small contents of generated carboxylic acids such as 2-hydroxyisobutyric at  According to these considerations, It is demonstrated that AEOPs such as electro-Fenton with Fe Financial support from MEC (Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia, Spain) under project CTQ2004-01954/BQU and the grant awarded to I.
