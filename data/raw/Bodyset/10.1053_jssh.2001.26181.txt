The unstable scaphoid fracture can be treated by a variety of different methods, including open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), percutaneous fixation with either K wires or cannulated screws, and arthroscopically assisted reduction and internal fixation (AARIF) with various cannulated screw systems. The drawbacks of ORIF include extensive soft tissue dissection, disruption of the nondominant volar blood supply, division of the radioscaphocapitate and radioscapholunate ligaments and volar capsule, and prolonged rehabilitation. Percutaneous fixation avoids these drawbacks yet relies on fluoroscopic guidance alone to assure accurate reduction of the scaphoid fracture fragments and optimal positioning of the implant in the apex of the proximal pole. Plain radiography and fluoroscopy are limited in their ability to provide detailed visualization of the oddly oriented scaphoid, and this limits the accuracy of the percutaneous technique. AARIF avoids the limitations of ORIF yet allows direct visualization of the scaphoid fracture site and assures accurate reduction of the fragments before and during definitive arthroscopically assisted internal fixation. AARIF also assists in accurate targeting of the proximal pole apex, or ″sweet spot,” in addition to allowing detection of concurrent pathology in the radiocarpal or midcarpal joints. This article outlines 3 of the currently available techniques for scaphoid AARIF. Copyright © 2001 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand
