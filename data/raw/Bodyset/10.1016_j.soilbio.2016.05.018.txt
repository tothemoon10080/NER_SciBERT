Snowpack in winter is very sensitive to climate change, and may in turn induce complex effects on nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. This study synthesized data from 41 publications based on snow depth manipulation experiments and conducted a meta-analysis to assess the general responses of 12 variables related to terrestrial nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics to altered snowpack depth. Our results indicated that increasing snow depth significantly increased foliar N (+4.5%) and microbial N (MBN, +35.9%), but significantly decreased soil N2O efflux (−34.1%). However, altered snow depth did not significantly affect soil dissolved organic N (DON), total inorganic N, nitrate and N leaching. The decreased net nitrification (−24.8%) by deeper snowpack suggested that less soil N transformed to nitrate, which might contribute to reduce soil N losses. Since increasing snowpack depth promoted MBN, the unchanged net N mineralization and soil ammonium content were probably due to limitation of the soil N availability and other soil abiotic factors rather than soil microbes. In addition, long-term and snowfence or shelter methods generated the most significant effects on N dynamics for snow addition or removal experiments, respectively. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of how N cycling responses to altered snow cover under climate change scenarios.Climate change has influenced Northern hemisphere snow cover through directly altering annual snowfall patterns and indirectly modifying the timing of snowmelt and freeze-up ( The insulating snow cover may dampen soil temperature fluctuations, resulting in higher activities of microbial metabolism and enzymes, thereby increasing organic matter decomposition and N mineralization rates. The higher N mineralization may increase nutrient availability, which in turn increase microbial N immobilization and plant N uptake ( The substrate quality for microbes from root and microbial mortality may also change with changing snow cover. Root and microbial mortality are main N sources and play critical role in N cycling processes under snow cover, especially in tundra ecosystems where nitrogen is strongly limiting ( All plant species can take up N through root systems when snow is present, while the uptake ability varied among species ( In the past two decades, snow cover manipulation experiments which simulated increasing winter precipitation in the form of snow (snow addition), or less winter precipitation in the form of snow and increasing occurrence of midwinter thawing events (snow removal), were conducted around the world to investigate the responses of terrestrial N pools and dynamics. While numerous studies have been conducted, a data synthesis is still unavailable. The present study compiled 570 observations from 41 individual studies and provided a comprehensive analysis to identify the general pattern of the effects of snow manipulation experiments on terrestrial N pools (soil dissolved organic N, soil inorganic N, soil NH We collected data from journal articles which terrestrial nitrogen pools and dynamics were reported in response to altered snow cover (snow addition or removal). In this study, we searched the references by using the search terms “snow” and “nitrogen” or “freeze-thaw” and “nitrogen” in the Web of Science resource. A total 570 observations of 12 variables (Supporting Information, For each publication, we noted the snow cover manipulation type (addition or removal), experiment location, snow cover manipulation method, ecosystem type, sampled seasonality, treatment duration, and the response variables. We also collected soil temperature and moisture values of control and treatment plots if reported. Data in the original paper’s figures were extracted by Engauge software (4.1). If the standard deviation was not reported, we calculated it from standard error and sampling size. A few studies did not report either standard deviation or standard error, we approximated the missing standard deviation by multiplying the reported mean by the average coefficient of variance (CV) ( Each study was grouped into one of these four ecosystems: tundra, grassland, forest and cropland ( For each individual observation of snow manipulation experiments, the effect size ( Based on the entire dataset of snow removal and addition, increasing snowpack depth significantly increased microbial biomass N (MBN, +35.9%) and foliar N (+4.5%), but did not significantly affect soil dissolved organic N (DON), soil inorganic N (INON), soil NO The observed numbers of DON, soil inorganic N, MBN, foliar N, net N mineralization, and N The effects of increasing snowpack depth on MBN (+31.7%) and foliar N (+6.2%) were most significant by snowfence method, while the effect of the shelter was most significant for soil DON (−41.2%, Snowpack manipulation experiments have been conducted in snow cover periods, but different seasons showed different responses ( The effects of increasing snowpack depth on MBN and foliar N were most significant in long term, even though the number of observations on MBN in long term was only six. On the contrary, increasing snowpack depth significantly decreased N Nitrogen mineralization is considered as a critical source for plant inorganic N carried out by soil microbes. The effect of increasing snowpack depth on net N mineralization was significantly positive in tundra (+70.0%), and significantly negative in grasslands (−57.3%), but was not significant in forests ( The response of net ammonification to increasing snow depth was not significant ( Increasing snowpack depth significantly decreased the net nitrification by 24.8% but significantly increased denitrification by 32.0% ( Overall, increasing snowpack depth did not significantly alter soil DON, and total soil inorganic N as well as its two dominant components: soil ammonium and nitrate ( The ecosystem types also induced different effects of snowpack treatment on soil DON and inorganic N ( Previous studies have found that plants generally could take up N during cold seasons ( In our meta-analysis, both foliar N and MBN had greatest response to increasing snowpack depth in grasslands than in other ecosystems ( Increasing snowpack depth decreased N Previous studies indicated that the contribution of denitrification and nitrification to N In general, the effect of increasing snowpack depth on N leaching was insignificant ( Altered snow cover generates complex responses of terrestrial ecosystem biochemistry processes, but this study suggests coherent responses in many N pools and dynamics. The results revealed that increasing snowpack depth generally increased foliar N and soil N retention via microbial N. Decreased nitrification as a result of increasing snowpack depth could reduce the production of soil NO This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the The following are the supplementary data related to this article: Appendix S1 Summary of the references and data used in the meta-analysis of altered snowpack on terrestrial nitrogen dynamics.
