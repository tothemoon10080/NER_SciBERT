This paper presents and discusses detailed field and laboratory studies concerning boreability prediction of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) used in Kozyatagi-Kadikoy metro tunnels in Istanbul in a highly fractured rock formation. The determination of some design parameters and performance prediction of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) are carried out using full-scale rock cutting test. The intact rock samples having minimum sizes of 1.0×0.7×0.7m are obtained from shale and limestone (Kartal Formation) along the tunnel line. The rock samples are subjected to full-scale laboratory rock cutting tests with different depth of cut and cutter spacing values using a constant cross section (CCS) disc cutter of 330mm in diameter. Cutter forces, i.e., thrust force, rolling force and specific energy values are recorded for each cut. The results of the tests are first used to calculate TBM design and performance parameters such as torque and thrust requirements and cutting rates. In the second part of the research, the field performance of the TBM is recorded with the aid of data acquisition system installed within TBM and the predicted performance and design values obtained from full-scale rock cutting tests are compared with the field values. It is observed that fractured characteristics of the rock formation affect tremendously TBM performance and predicted values differ from the field data in some extend. It is believed that the results will serve as a guide for efficient selection and use of TBMs.Turkey is a very fast developing country and there are many tunneling projects going on and designed for very soon applications, mainly; public transportation (metro), drinking water and sewerage, water transport for hydropower projects and roadway tunnels. The first metro tunnel, called Tunel, is the 574 The TBM technology – well known tunnel excavation technique – have reached a very high level of development and nowadays 10–50 A considerable amount of work by many researchers has been carried out that can be related to the behavior of rock under a cutter. The basic parameters affecting performance of the machines depend on intact rock and rock mass properties, water income, machine diameter, power, torque, thrust, rotation speed, cutter type and size, and cutter spacing. Results of the works on performance prediction may be generally classified as theoretical, semi-theoretical, and empirical models and field trial of real machines. The theoretical models are based on the analysis of the forces or the specific energy required to excavate a unit volume of rock and to relate that to the intact rock properties such as rock compressive, tensile and shear strength, rock mass properties such as rock quality designation (RQD) and finally machine specifications. Theoretical studies usually do not give realistic values due to complex nature of the rock material. Examples of theoretical and semi-theoretical works can be found in ( Empirical performance prediction models are mainly based on the past experience and the statistical interpretation of the previously recorded field data. The accuracy and reliability of these models depend on the quality and amount of the data. It is usually difficult to collect large amount of and high quality data in the field. Empirical approaches are the most widely used in the tunneling industry. One example to field data and rock mass properties is the Norwegian hard rock prognosis system developed by the Full-scale rock cutting tests combined with physical property tests are probably the most reliable production estimation technique presently available, where the cutter forces are measured by full-size cutters in large rock samples with a linear cutting machine (LCM). However, a comprehensive, accurate, and reliable production estimation methodology is still being under investigation by researchers. Several potentially different approaches tend to be combined in practice. The most reliable prediction method in competent rock formation presently combines theoretical and empirical methods by measuring cutter forces and then adjusting the results for ground conditions and machine limitations ( Performance prediction and the determination of some design parameters of TBMs are becoming very crucial for tunneling industry since they are critical elements in the pre-planning of a mechanical excavation project. In this paper, a case study is analyzed with a detailed field and laboratory study concerning in Kozyatagi-Kadikoy metro tunnels in Istanbul. Kozyatagi-Kadikoy project, located in Asian Side of Istanbul, Turkey, is a twin metro tunnel line excavated by earth pressure balance (EPB) TBM which may be operated in closed or open mode. The tunnel is owned by the Istanbul metropolitan municipality and is currently under construction by the joint venture of Anadoluray. A line from Kozyatagi to Yenisahra station, which is approximately 1 The rock formation in Kozyatagi-Kadikoy metro line is a highly fractured with mean RQD values of 21%. Magmatic rock inclusions such as andesite and dasite dykes intrude frequently through sedimentary rock formations. The thickness of the dykes ranges from 10–20 The performance prediction of TBMs using full-scale rock cutting tests in the laboratory showed reliable results in competent rocks in the past ( Uniaxial compressive strength, Brazilian tensile strength, static elastic modulus, Schmidt hammer and density of the rocks are performed based on ISRM suggestions ( The full-scale linear cutting machine (LCM) tests measure cutting forces acting on a cutter while cutting competent rock. Full-scale testing minimizes the uncertainties of scaling and any unusual rock cutting behavior not reflected in its physical properties. General schematic view of the full-scale rock cutting rig used in the experiments using constant cross section (CCS) disc cutters is presented in The force data is used as input for selection and design of a mechanical excavator, selection of a cutter, definition of optimum cutting geometry and prediction of performance. The individual cutters on a TBM always operate on a rock surface damaged from the previous pass of the cutters. A pass is defined as a group of cuts at the preset spacing and penetration across the width of the sample. This situation is simulated in the laboratory by cutting several passes with a disc cutter before data recording, which is called “surface conditioning”. After conditioning, one or two passes (layers) of unrelieved cuts, which means no interaction between the cutting grooves, are performed by cutting over the every other cut lines. After unrelieved cuts completed, at least two passes of conditioning cuts are performed and then relieved cuts, there is interaction between cutting grooves, are performed by cutting over the each cut lines. A schematic drawing explaining the nomenclature is presented in The independent linear cutting test variables in this study consist of three major variables: rock type (one block of limestone and one block of shale samples), cutting mode (unrelieved and relieved) and depth of cut (3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 mm for both relieved and unrelieved cutting modes). The dependent variables are cutter forces (rolling and normal force), specific energy values and size distribution of rock cuttings. The constant variables through the testing program are line spacing (80 The size distribution of the muck obtained from rock cutting tests and from TBM applications are used in determining the efficiency of the cutting or in determining the geological characteristics of the rock formation excavated. Summary of laboratory rock cutting tests with CCS type disc in unrelieved and relieved modes in two different formations (limestone and shale) are presented in The typical steps taken in the modeling of TBM cutterhead parameters are illustrated in Cutter spacing/cutter depth of cut ratio (s/d) is a fundamental parameter in efficient cutting process. There is always a minimum specific energy value for this ratio for a specific rock formation. However, for specific reasons machine manufacturers prefer usually taking cutter spacing between 8 and 9 Number of cutters ( TBM rotational speed (rpm) may be calculated from the maximum rotational speed of disc using (at the gauge position) Eq.      If Eq.     Optimum depth of cut per revolution of cutterhead is calculated as 8 From For maximum TBM thrust force for design purposes, peak thrust forces should be taken into account and multiplied by peak thrust divided by mean thrust force ratio found to be 2.3 in this study. The peak thrust forces for limestone and shale are determined to be 13,261 and 6,642 The following Eqs.         From Hence, However, peak values of rolling forces are 2.2 times higher than the mean values as found from each test; therefore, expected peak torque values for limestone and shale would be 1965 and 1318 The calculated power values should be increased taking total efficiency of 60% (561.3/0.6 and 376.5/0.6) and multiplied by safety factor of 1.4 since some high strength dykes have compressive strength values 40% higher than that of the rock samples tested in the laboratory. Hence, the design value of machine cutter head power values for limestone and shale may be taken as 1309 and 878 kW, respectively. Two methods are used to calculate net cutting rate in this study and the difference between two methods is explained. Eq.      The predicted net cutting rate by using Eq. Eq.      Estimation of net cutting rate using Eq. The results of the laboratory rock cutting tests are sent to the manufacturer company ( The machine parameters calculated after the full-scale rock cutting tests and manufacturer design values are compared in The TBM performance data is recorded continuously by the contractor, Anadoluray joint venture using a data acquisition system equipped within the TBM. The entire field data analyzed in this study is collected while the TBM is operated in open mode. The operational parameters of the TBM such as penetration per revolution, rotational speed, torque, advance rate, and thrust are recorded by the machine data logger and analyzed as ring by ring. Analyzed data includes totally 574 rings (861  The results show that the specific rock mass boreability index is higher for field data in a highly fractured rock mass than in the laboratory rock cutting data in competent rock. This means that SRMBI is a good indicator of rock mass boreability since it results in different values on different rock mass conditions. It proves that using normalized parameters such as SRMBI make easier to compare the effects of geological parameters. In order to use SRMBI as a performance predictor parameter, a large database should be accumulated and different rock masses should be classified in terms of boreability.  The other problem occurs when cutting the contact zone between dykes and the main rock formation; in these cases, big blocks up to 0.5 The relationships between field penetration per revolution and field net cutting rate and field specific energy are seen in The predicted performance based on laboratory rock cutting experiments and the field performance of TBM is compared by considering the optimum cutting conditions. The optimum cutting condition obtained from full-scale laboratory rock cutting tests indicates 8 For cutter penetration of 8 Since the average revolution of the TBM in the field is 2.7 Although the field and laboratory comparison are made at 8 The muck samples are also collected for sieve tests to determine coarseness index (CI). CI values for muck from the rock cutting tests and the field are determined as seen in The effect of the orientation and spacing of fractures in rock mass conditions are used as predictor factors in models developed by NTNU ( This paper is a typical example to direct application of laboratory full-scale rock cutting tests to one of the biggest metro tunnels project in Istanbul. Full-scale rock cutting tests are realized in the laboratory to calculate the basic design parameters of TBM. Before starting the project it is observed that the recommended and actual design parameters of a TBM are very close to some extend. Field data are collected carefully in order to compare predicted and actual values of TBM operational parameters. In order to have an idea about the geological discontinuities the muck samples are also collected carefully and sieved to calculate coarseness index which is good indicator of the rock discontinuities. Contrary to the basic rock cutting mechanics and rock cutting tests realized in the laboratory on intact rock, the field thrust and rolling force do not show any increase or relationships with penetration in the field. This is mainly due to the highly fractured characteristic of the rock formation excavated. Thrust force for a specific penetration is higher in the field than in the laboratory test results, probably due to high frictional forces between shield and highly fractured or almost loose rock formation accumulated in front of the cutterhead. This causes an increase in torque, power and specific energy requirements compared to the laboratory test results. In most cases, small size of the muck causes specific energy to increase. This is well explained by coarseness index values obtained by sieve analysis of the muck from the laboratory experiments and the field. It is shown in this paper that the boreability index at penetration 1 As a summary, it may be concluded that the full-scale cutting tests realized in the laboratory may be used as a guide in determining design parameters and performance prediction of a TBM for a specific job in competent rock; however, further field observations and research studies are needed to generalize the laboratory cutting test results in a highly fractured rock formations.
