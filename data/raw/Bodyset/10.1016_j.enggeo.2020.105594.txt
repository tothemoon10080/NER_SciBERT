The compressibility characteristics of ultra-soft soils are an important issue for the deformation analysis of reclaimed land. This research study investigated the compressibility characteristics of ultra-soft soil present in a slurry pond, which is composed of the sedimentation and consolidation phases. The ultra-soft soil under the sedimentation process is termed as a slurry while the ultra-soft soil after completion of sedimentation is termed as a sedimentation soil. The samples were obtained from a slurry pond in the Mae Moh mine, Lampang province, Thailand. A series of sedimentation tests were performed on slurry at various initial water contents, w
                     
                        i
                     , ranging from 116% to 437%. It was found that the sedimentation curve of the Mae Moh slurry was divided into two distinct different stages, being flocculation and settling. A novel parameter, being the critical water content (w
                     
                        cr
                     ) was proposed to separate the large sedimentation slurry and small sedimentation slurry. The w
                     
                        cr
                      for Mae Moh slurry was found to be 171%. The sedimentation water content, w
                     
                        s
                      was found to be equal to w
                     
                        cr
                      for the slurry undergoing large sedimentation and lower for the slurry undergoing low sedimentation. The consolidation curve of the large sedimentation soil was assumed to be unique for different w

                        i
                      and thus the consolidation curves are different for different w

                     . The consolidation curves of the ultra-soft soil at different w

The intrinsic state line for high sedimentation soil was proposed for examining the stress state and predicting the consolidation curve of the ultra-soft soil, which is significant for reclamation projects.The Mae Moh Mine is the largest open-pit lignite mine in Thailand, as well as in Southeast Asia, with a total mining area of approximately 37.5 km According to the mine planning and development of EGAT, this mine will be excavated to a depth of approximately 500 A suitable ground improvement method for the ultra-soft soil in the Mae Moh mine is the preloading with vertical drains technique. It is effective in term of economic and environmental perspectives as compared to other techniques, such as deep soil mixing and soil replacement. The preloading can be performed using a 1-m thickness of clean sand as a drainage layer and the usage of abandoned clayey stone as a backfill material. A sufficient understanding of the mechanical behavior, especially compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of the ultra-soft soil is therefore required for calculating the settlement and rate of consolidation settlement ( The sedimentation process is a special characteristic of slurry at high water content ( After the sedimentation process, the sedimentation soil has sufficient strength to carry an external load. The understanding of compression behavior of sedimentation soil in term of compressibility and hydraulic conductivity characteristics has played a key role in geological and geotechnical engineering practice for many decades ( Even though there are available research on sedimentation of slurries and consolidation behavior of sedimentation soils, they have been previously studied in isolation. As such, the role of water content on the overall compressibility characteristics of the ultra-soft soil is still uncertain. The compressibility characteristics of the ultra-soft soil are thus a challenge for geological and geotechnical designers in land reclamation projects. The aim of this paper is to assess the compressibility characteristics, which include sedimentation and consolidation at different initial water contents, The soil samples were taken from a slurry pond in a low lying area of the Mae Moh mine, Lampang province in Thailand. Disturbed samples were collected at a depth of approximately 1 m below soil surface of the pond with a backhoe and placed in a plastic tank. The studied site is shown in The grain size distribution curve of the soil sample is shown in To study the sedimentation behavior of slurry under various water contents, the water content of the samples was adjusted to be greater than that of the liquid limit. The slurry sample at the target According to the theory of soil mechanics ( The calculated water contents were validated by comparing with the measured water content at the end of the test ( The consolidation behavior of the sedimentation soil upon application of the additional load due to the effect of the sedimentation water content,  Similar to Based on the sedimentation test result ( The The yield stress of the soil samples can be determined by the interception of two straight lines (pre-yield and post-yield state line) in bilogarithmic graph ln (1 + e) - log σ  With Eq. Based on the collected compression data of 24 reconstituted clays, with The applicability of the equation was illustrated by the excellent simulation of compression curves of various soils such as kaolin ( Since the liquid limit is the state parameter reflecting the soil structure ( The compression behavior of Mae Moh slurry soil was predicted using this generalized equation and presented in The compression behavior of remolded Kemen and Baimahu clay samples with different  Even with limited available test data, the development of the generalized equation is based on sound principles. The variable parameters can be refined by more test data, which can be performed in future research. Based on the sedimentation and consolidation test results, the It is long accepted that the compressibility of soil in both the slurry and sedimentation states is controlled by the stress state ( A suggested stepwise procedure for examining the stress state and compressibility of ultra-soft soil can be presented as follows: Determine liquid limit and specific gravity of ultra-soft soil samples Prepare the slurry at Perform the sedimentation test on the slurry to determine From the known Take the in-situ soil samples at various depths and determine Classify the stress state 6.1 If the stress state is on the ISL, the ultra-soft soil is high sedimentation soil. 6.2 If the stress state is below the ISL, the ultra-soft soil is low sedimentation soil. 6.3 If the stress state is above the ISL, the ultra-soft soil is slurry and under sedimentation process Approximate consolidation curves of either low or high sedimentation soil at various depths using Eq. The stress state assessment is important for predicting the settlement of ultra-soft soil. If the ultra-soft soil is in a slurry state, the settlement is due to both sedimentation of slurry and consolidation of the sedimentation soil. The sedimentation settlement is calculated from the difference between in-situ water content and This research studied the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity characteristics of ultra-soft soil at the Mae Moh mine, Thailand. The study is useful for designing the land reclamation of ultra-soft soil using preloading technique with vertical drains. The following conclusions can be made from this study. The sedimentation process of Mae Moh slurry was divided into two distinct stages: flocculation and settling. The flocculation occurred at the early stage of sedimentation process with very small change in soil-fluid interface. The settling stage then commenced, when the floc particles started to settle uniformly, causing the significant change in soil-fluid interface. A critical water content ( The consolidation curve of high sedimentation soil is unique and independent of The powerful S-shape equation proposed by The intrinsic state line (ISL) for high sedimentation soil was proposed to assess the stress state of ultra-soft soil. The soil is classified as high sedimentation soil when the stress state is on the ISL, as low sedimentation soil when the stress state is below the ISL and as slurry when the stress state is above the ISL. The stepwise procedure for assessing stress state and compressibility of ultra-soft soil is suggested. The stress state assessment is important to predict the settlement of the ultra-soft soil when subjected to ground improvement and land reclamation. For the ultra-soft soil in a slurry state, the settlement is due to both sedimentation of the slurry and consolidation of the sedimentation soil. The sedimentation settlement can be calculated from the difference between in-situ water content and None. This work was financially supported by
