The characterization and H2SO4 leaching behavior of a Nigerian ilmenite ore following mechanical activation and alkali roasting were investigated. The effects of NaOH/ore ratio, H2SO4 concentration, leaching and roasting temperature on the Ti recovery from the milled ore were examined. The results show that mechanical activation significantly enhances the dissolution of ilmenite ore. Under the leaching conditions of 90 °C, 60% (v/v) H2SO4 and 4 h, about 72% Ti extraction was obtained from a milled ore roasted at 850 °C with 60% NaOH. X-ray diffraction (XRD) phase analysis of the roasted mass, water treated residue and leach residue supports the reaction mechanism and experimental results.
