Within the scope of a European research project, a specific industrial target was to improve the physical and technological properties of ceramic pastes produced from two different types of raw materials, feldspathic ores and raw clays. To accomplish this objective, the chemical/mineralogical composition of the raw materials needs to satisfy some industrial specifications. Several laboratory bench scale tests were carried out in the C.V.R.M. in order to get a suitable flow sheet. The feldspathic ores were treated by differential grinding and screening, or HIMS, followed by froth flotation (without fluoride activation). The raw clays were processed through a combination of hydrocycloning and froth flotation. Bench scale tests show that the technical specifications can be achieved by using a simple flow sheet. A main final target of the project is the design and construction of a pilot plant prototype based on mechanical and column flotation, with a fuzzy-based supervisory control.
