Determining growth rates and kinetic mechanisms of microbial consortia often needs of combining several tests and techniques. The present work demonstrates that combining titrimetric and respirometric data obtained in a single batch test allows obtaining the stoichiometric coefficients, biomass–substrate yields and biological oxidation rates for sulfide-oxidizing nitrate-reducing consortia obtained from an anoxic biotrickling filter for biogas desulfurization. Thiosulfate oxidation using either nitrate or nitrite was quantified as well as the biological production of proton linked to the process to solve the stoichiometry of the two-step autotrophic denitrification associated to thiosulfate oxidation. To obtain accurate titrimetric data related to the biological activity, carbon dioxide stripping was modeled to improve the sensitivity of titrimetric measurements and also to ensure no carbon source limitation during respirometric tests.Development of kinetic models to describe the biological desulfurization that takes place in a biotrickling filter (BTF) is highly desirable in order to design, evaluate, and optimize the process. However, characterization of immobilized biomass is complex since biomass concentration as well as its growth yield are parameters hard to measure. In this sense, respirometry and titrimetry are on-line techniques extensively used for the characterization of heterotrophic and autotrophic suspended biomass under aerobic and anoxic conditions Respirometry is defined as the measure and interpretation of the biological oxygen or nitrogen uptake rates (OUR and NUR, respectively) associated with the biological reactions under well-defined operating conditions Particularly, when autotrophic biomass is studied through respirometry, the quantity of CO Therefore, the aim of this study was to show the potential of coupling respirometry and titrimetry as a tool to obtain information about the biological activity of a SO-NR mixed culture obtained from an anoxic BTF. The combination of both techniques in a single test allowed obtaining stoichiometric coefficients of simultaneous reactions (NO The respirometric test presented in this work was carried out in a batch-type, magnetically stirred respirometer with a capacity of 350 The SO-NR biomass used to perform the respirometric test, which was obtained from an anoxic desulfurizing BTF During the respirometric test, the liquid phase was frequently sampled to obtain the respirometric profiles from off-line analysis of some of the species involved in the process (thiosulfate, sulfate, nitrate and nitrite). Liquid samples were obtained through a syringe connected to a sampling tube inserted in the liquid phase of the respirometer. Samples were filtered previously to the analysis with a 0.22 It is worth mentioning that replicates of the respirometric and titrimetric test were not performed since a respirometer can be considered to be a sensor Titrimetric measurements calculated according to Eq. Therefore, to accurately define the stripping process and to determine the contribution of the HPR A mathematical, literature-based model proposed elsewhere Several abiotic tests using titrimetry were carried out to determine the Stoichiometric coefficients were estimated by using a combination of the data obtained both from respirometric and titrimetric measurements. According to Mora et al. Nitrite (NO Results obtained during the abiotic CO Experimental respirometric and titrimetric profiles are presented in During period I, the HPR In period II the stripping of CO In period IIIa, nitrate and nitrite were simultaneously used as electron acceptors. It was observed that NitUR was higher than NUR since nitrite was consumed during nitrate reduction. Many authors have reported that nitrite reduction is the slower step of the denitrification process, which causes the accumulation of nitrite As a result, the corresponding NUR/SUR The biomass–substrate yields ( A biomass–substrate yield ( It was also observed that the biomass growth from nitrite was about 20% lower compared with the biomass yield corresponding to the complete denitrification (Eq. This work allowed concluding that coupling titrimetry and respirometry permitted: To estimate the To calculate several stoichiometric ratios between the biological HPR and the substrate and electron acceptor uptake rates obtained from respirometric measurements To obtain not only the stoichiometry of the two-step autotrophic denitrification associated to thiosulfate oxidation, but also the biomass–substrate yields and the biological activities without using literature values. Finally, the application of respirometry and titrimetry not only reduces the degrees of freedom of a system but gives the possibility to obtain microbial kinetic parameters that can be incorporated in rigorous mathematical models used to design, evaluate and optimize the desulfurization process on BTFs under anoxic conditions.
