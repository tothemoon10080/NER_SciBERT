Kinetics of the cementation processes is usually expressed by However, results presented by Guerra and Dreisinger in Fig. 4 of their paper indicate that dependence of ln( The form of the suggested equation and its interpretation give rise to doubts. Discussion of this formula leads to the erroneous conclusion that the concentration of gold initially decreases, attains at Both metals, being precipitated and precipitating, are in contact with each other and with the electrolyte, forming a short-circuited cell. As a consequence, both metals have practically the same potential, imposed by the less noble participant. Therefore, reduction of the cemented metal ions may equally well occur at the surface of the depositing or of the already deposited metal. It has been even observed that sometimes, when the cemented metal deposits in the dendritic or spongy form, the reaction accelerates due to the increase in the reaction surface area At concentrations higher than those corresponding with the state of equilibrium, the cementation process may be interrupted in two cases: (a) when deposited metal hinders transport of the depositing metal ions into the bulk of the solution to such an extent, that the rate of their removal (by diffusion) becomes smaller than the rate of their formation. In effect, concentration of these ions, in the vicinity of the reaction surface, rises and finally a passivating salt layer precipitates there; (b) when the layer of the precipitated metal is so compact that it entirely isolates the depositing metal from the electrolyte. The observed deviation of the ln( In the typical industrial cementation processes, The situation may differ when the cementation is performed in complex salt solutions. Equilibrium concentration Comparison of the correlation coefficients leads to the conclusion that The expected This is another argument speaking for the “equilibrium” hypothesis.
