Complex mineral raw materials processing is an essential operation in modern industry. Innovative technologies help in constant improving of the efficiency and performance. The paper presents a design of electromagnetic mill, its technological structure and control system. In comparison to conventional solutions, the electromagnetic mill is a fully automated system. It operates in more effective way. The proper selection of the physical and process parameters of the system is crucial for efficiency of the process. The device stands out because of its low energy consumption. The air stream ratio model has been presented for the dry grinding and classification unit with the electromagnetic mill. The concept of the grinding system is described along with indirect measurement methodology. Supervisory control algorithm based on the model structure is derived.
