Bubble size distribution is an important feature in froth flotation processes and the B-spline estimation is a common way to approximate the bubble size distribution by using the least square algorithm. However, it is difficult to determine the number of basis functions of B-spline. In this study, the analysis based on the unbiased cross entropy is proposed to evaluate the estimated models. Experimental results have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.
