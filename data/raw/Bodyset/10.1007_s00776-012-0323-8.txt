Background
                  Neglected femoral neck fracture in young adults is an intriguing problem. This retrospective study tried to solve that challenge through open reduction, cannulated screw internal fixation, autogenous iliac bone and bone marrow grafting.
               
                  Methods
                  Thirty-six cases were studied; they were classified according to Sandhu et al.'s classification. Twenty cases were type I and 16 cases were type II fractures; the mean age was 26.8years; fracture neglect averaged 44.6days. Twenty cases had posterior comminution and 16 cases had anterior comminution. All cases had open reduction, cannulated screw internal fixation, autogenous iliac bone and bone marrow grafting. The Harris hip score and Matta et al. grading system were applied for functional and radiological evaluation, respectively.
               
                  Results
                  The average postoperative follow-up was 25.3months; 94.4% of the cases had solid union in a mean of 19.6weeks. Functionally, the Harris hip score averaged 87.8 points. Nonunion, avascular necrosis and coxa vara complicated two, two and four cases, respectively. Fair and poor radiological results were related to coxa vara and avascular necrosis, respectively. Nonunion was significantly related to posterior comminution, type II neglected fracture, and a neglect of more than 45days. Age groups more than 30years old and postoperative neck-shaft angles <140Â° were significantly associated with late-onset radiological healing and nonunion.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Cannulated screw osteosynthesis augmented by autogenous bone and bone marrow grafting is a simple, easy-to-perform surgical procedure with encouraging clinical outcomes for selected patients complaining of that difficult problem.
