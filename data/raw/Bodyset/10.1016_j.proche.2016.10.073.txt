A new hydrometallurgical grouped actinide extraction process has been developed to separate the transuranic actinide ions from dissolved spent fuel solution (after an initial uranium extraction cycle). This “EURO-GANEX” process is aimed towards the homogeneous recycling of plutonium and minor actinides in a future closed fuel cycle. The separation process is based on the co-extraction of actinides and lanthanides from aqueous nitric acid into an organic phase followed by selective co-stripping of actinides. A suitable organic phase has been formulated and distribution ratios determined for lanthanides, actinides and some problematic fission products under extraction and stripping conditions. The process flowsheet has been proven on surrogate feed solutions as well as with spent fast reactor fuel; excellent recoveries of the actinides and good decontamination factors from the lanthanides and other fission products were obtained. A variation on the EURO-GANEX flowsheet (the “TRU-SANEX” process) has now been designed to produce separate Pu+Np and Am+Cm products for heterogeneous recycling. Progress on underpinning process chemistry and safety studies as well as flowsheet tests are summarized.
