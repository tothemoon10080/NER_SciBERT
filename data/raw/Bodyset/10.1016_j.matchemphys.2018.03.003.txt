Titaniothermic reduction of nitrides in a self-propagating way is reported here to produce TiN-based ceramic powders. In the titaniothermic reaction, where solid nitrides instead of N2 gas are used as the nitrogen source, N atoms required for the nitridation of Ti do not rely on the infiltration of N2 gas, but are in-situ supplied by the decomposition of solid nitrides, thus resulting in a higher conversion degree, more homogeneous microstructure, and smaller grain size. In contrast to the well-known aluminothermic and magnesiothermic processes with the reduction of oxides, the titaniothermic reaction involves the reduction of nitrides, which applies to more other metals besides Ti and offers a new way to synthesize nitrides other than direct nitridation of metal powders in a N2 atmosphere.Metal reduction is widely used in pyrometallurgy. For example, Ti can be produced by reduction of TiCl The thermodynamic basis of metal reduction is the difference in Gibbs energy of formation (ΔG This paper deals with metal reduction of nitrides, with reduction of BN and Si Commercial powders of Ti (99.5%, 325 mesh), BN (98%, O < 1.5 wt%, D To evaluate the possibility of reduction of BN and Si   After the reduction of BN and Si The reduction of BN and Si The titaniothermic reaction provides an alternative way to synthesize TiN using solid nitrides instead of N At last, it should be pointed out that, metal reduction of nitrides is not limited to Ti, but applies to more other metals. The ΔG values for the formation of nitrides of Ti, Al, Si, B, and Mg are calculated and plotted in TiN-based ceramic powders have been prepared by titaniothermic reduction of solid nitrides in a self-propagating way. In the titaniothermic reaction, where solid nitrides instead of N This work is supported by
