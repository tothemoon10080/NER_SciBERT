The interaction of sodium-di-isobutyl dithiophosphinate (DTPINa) with galena and pyrite in alkaline media (pH 9) was examined using cyclic voltammetry, open circuit potential and contact angle techniques. Analysis of results suggests that the collector interacts with the minerals by chemical and electrochemical mechanisms according to the following steps: a chemisorption process (without electron transfer) that takes place when the collector interacts with metal species (e.g., of lead) that shows chemical affinity towards the collector; an electrochemical–chemical process developed by the galena that involves two steps: the oxidation of the mineral (electrochemical step) and the formation of a metal–collector precipitate (chemical step); and an electrochemical process (adsorption of collector and dimer formation) that occurs when pyrite is held at a redox potential sufficiently anodic to produce oxidation of the collector.Non-conventional collectors (i.e., collectors different to xanthates) are more frequently used in the Mexican sulphide flotation practice ( Research works on froth flotation of sulfides in the presence of non-conventional collectors (e.g., dithiophosphinates, thionocarbamates, etc.) have demonstrated that the selective activation of the mineral species, is substantially affected by the electrochemical conditions (pulp potential) of the flotation slurry ( It is known that the interaction mechanism of thiol collectors and sulfides is essentially the same. Nevertheless, examinations of non-conventional collectors such as thionocarbamates ( Pyrite (FeS This communication is focused on both the study of the interaction mechanism of DTPINa with galena and pyrite, and the role of redox potential on the hydrophobic properties that the mineral surface develops in the presence of the collector at pH 9; techniques of cyclic voltammetry, open circuit potential and contact angle were used. The results may contribute to the fundamental knowledge of the interaction mechanism that governs the mineral–collector contact, thus contributing to the understanding of the sulfide flotation chemistry. Reagents were of analytical grade from Aldrich. The commercial form of the collector DTPINa was used (product name: Aerophine 3418A promoter, AEROPHINE Deionized water with a specific conductivity of 10 The experiments were conducted using a conventional three-electrode circuit The cell used in the experiments was a 0.5 A copper wire was firmly bonded to one face of the sulfide crystal with silver epoxy cement (Epotek E4110). The joint and the face of the mineral crystal (galena and pyrite) were sealed with non-conducting epoxy sealant. The uncovered face of the mineral electrode was prepared (and refreshed before each experiment) by consecutively polishing on 600, 800 and 1200 The effect of redox potential on the contact angle between a bubble and the mineral surface, in the absence and presence of DTPINa (10 The open circuit potentials of galena and pyrite are reported after a conditioning period of 10 The voltammetry tests were performed at pH 9 under nitrogen atmosphere. Voltammograms were obtained at a potential sweep of 20 It is accepted that the open circuit potential (also known as rest potential) of a sulfide mineral electrode immersed in an aqueous solution is a “mixed potential”. This is the generic term for a complex system consisting of the cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen and the anodic oxidation of the mineral surface. The OCP values of galena and pyrite in the absence of collector are presented in The analysis of the behavior of the OCP of sulfides when di-isobutyl dithiophosphinate is added to the system may provide useful information on the nature of the mineral–collector interaction. In regard to pyrite, the presence of DTPINa has a minor effect on the rest potential of this mineral ( The electrochemical study was performed using three working electrodes: galena and pyrite. Galena voltammograms in the presence and absence of DTPINa are presented in In the absence of collector, the electrochemical behavior of galena has been fully analyzed and documented. According to the available information ( The cathodic peak (C2), may be assigned to the reverse of processes described in Eqs. In the cathodic scan, the peak C2, associated to the reduction of the oxidation products vanishes, thus supporting the mineral–collector interaction proposed for the anodic range (see Pyrite voltammograms in absence and presence of DTPINa are presented in The cathodic processes C2 could be associated to the reduction of ferric to ferrous species (Eq. The behavior of the contact angle of galena as a function of redox potential in the presence and absence of DTPINa is presented in It is important to notice that in the presence of DTPINa, at the potential values where peak A1 is observed, i.e., 30 The contact angle of pyrite in presence of DTPINa as a function of the applied potential is presented in The analysis of the results obtained by OCP, cyclic voltammetry and contact angle, leads to the following proposed mechanisms to explain the mineral–collector interaction in alkaline media (pH 9). The galena results suggest the DTPINa interacts with the mineral through chemical and electrochemical mechanisms as follows: (i) A chemisorption mechanism (without transfer of electrons), that takes place at cathodic potentials (e.g., below 30 (ii) At potentials above 30 (iii) Lastly, it is worth mentioning that in the presence of collector and at potentials more anodic than 650 The results obtained with pyrite in alkaline suspensions (pH 9) suggest that the collector interacts with the mineral through electrochemical mechanisms: (i) Electrochemical processes such as adsorption of collector and dimer formation occurring at a potential over −40 Electrochemical adsorption: Collector oxidation: The analysis of the results presented in this paper suggests that sodium di-isobutyl dithiophosphinate interacts with galena in alkaline media (pH 9) by chemical and electrochemical mechanisms through the following processes: chemisorption without electron transfer occurring at cathodic potentials (below 30 The results for pyrite at pH 9 suggest that sodium-di-isobutyl dithiophosphinate interacts with this mineral according to an electrochemical mechanism (adsorption of collector, dimer formation) that occurs at potentials above −40 The results indicate that selective flotation of galena in the presence of pyrite will be enhanced by using an electrochemical potential below −40 E.T.
