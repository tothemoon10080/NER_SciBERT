Computational fluid dynamics coupled with a population balance model (CFD-PBM) combines the use of CFD to calculate the flow field and phase holdup and that of PBM to calculate the local bubble size distribution. However, the generality of the CFD-PBM coupled model for different operating conditions and liquid properties has not been systematically studied. The CFD-PBM coupled model where the PBM used our bubble breakup and coalescence models was shown to give accurate results in wide operating conditions (P = 0.1–3.5 MPa, Ug
                      = 0.02–0.16 m/s), liquid properties (0.02–0.07 N/m, 1–185 mPa·s) with the same set of model parameters. Overall, the coupled model showed good generality when the superficial gas velocity, operating pressure, liquid viscosity and surface tension are the factors in bubble coalescence and breakup and the appropriate mechanism models are used to account for them, and forces at the gas-liquid interface are calculated using the local gas holdup and bubble size distribution.interfacial area, m bubble breakup rate, s bubble coalescence rate, m factor of surface energy increase, factor of surface energy increase per unit volume, single bubble drag coefficient, dimensionless drag correction factor of bubble swarms, dimensionless coefficient of lift force, dimensionless coefficient of turbulent dispersion force, dimensionless coefficient of virtual mass force, dimensionless coefficient of wall lubrication force, dimensionless bubble column diameter, m molecular diffusivity, m mother bubble size, m bubble neck size, m critical bubble neck diameter, m critical bubble size for differentiating small and large bubbles, m local bubble Sauter diameter, m Eötvös number, corrected Eötvös number, energy of turbulent eddy, J drag force, N·m transverse lift force, N·m turbulent dispersion force, N·m virtual mass force, N·m wall lubrication force, N·m local liquid-side mass transfer coefficient, m·s volumetric mass transfer coefficient, s model factor for wake accelerating effect of large bubbles, dimensionless model factor for hindering effect of small bubbles, dimensionless number density of bubbles, m number density of eddies, pressure, MPa breakup probability, dimensionless breakup probability considering internal flow, dimensionless bubble coalescence efficiency, dimensionless Reynold number, R temperature, K internal flow time, s neck contraction time, s superficial gas velocity, m·s turbulent eddy velocity, m·s internal gas flow velocity, m·s additional shrinking velocity, m·s bubble slip velocity, m·s local gas velocity, m·s local liquid velocity, m·s mean turbulent velocity, mean turbulent velocity at distance of mean relative turbulent velocity between bubbles of size volume of smaller part of the deformed bubble, m Weber numer, pivot bubble size of the bubble interval ( gas holdup, dimensionless gas holdup of small bubbles, dimensionless gas holdup of large bubbles, dimensionless turbulent energy dissipation rate, m gas density, kg·m liquid density, kg·m surface tension, N·m liquid viscosity, mPa·s eddy size, m Kolmogorov size, the life span of a turbulent eddy, minimum effective eddy size, breakup probability function, dimensionless collision frequency density, m daughter size distribution, dimensionless transport coefficient resulted form bubble breakup, dimensionless transport coefficient resulted form bubble coalescence, Dimensionless Dirac delta function, Dimensionless model parameter, Dimensionless model parameter, Dimensionless relative size, The bubble column reactor is attractive for its characteristic simple geometry, low operating and maintenance costs, and good mass and heat transport ( Computational fluid dynamics coupled with a population balance model (CFD-PBM) can be used to effectively simulate a bubble column ( Extensive studies have shown that the liquid viscosity The pressure plays a strong role in the hydrodynamics and mass transport in a bubble column ( In previous works, it was shown that the CFD-PBM coupled model is a strong tool for the simulation of a bubble column with different liquids ( Experimental data from bubble columns in the literature with different liquid properties, reactor structure and operating conditions were collected. These are listed in The framework of the CFD-PBM model was previously developed and improved ( The total bubble coalescence rate in Eq. The coupling algorithm between the CFD two-fluid model and the PBM is illustrated in Extensive experiments showed that the time-averaged hydrodynamic behaviors were stationary and axisymmetric in a cylindrical bubble column ( To reduce the computational cost, the bubble breakup and coalescence rates under different turbulent dissipation rates were calculated in advance for different liquid properties, and the results were stored in a file. During the CFD simulations, the bubble breakup and coalescence rates were determined using this file to avoid repeated calculations and effectively reduce the computation cost.

Its direct effects on bubble coalescence and drag force are usually negligible. In the present work, the CFD-PBM model uses our most recent bubble breakup model, which uses the effect on the internal flow to describe the influence of pressure or gas density ( The drag force is crucial in the simulation of gas holdup. Although reliable correlations are available for the drag force on a single bubble, the correct description of bubble swarms is still challenging because of the very complex interaction among bubbles. In a previous work (  The liquid viscosity  The dependence of In fully developed turbulent flow, bubble breakup is mainly from turbulent eddy collisions ( A CFD-PBM coupled model with detailed bubble breakup and coalescence models and gas-liquid interphase force models was used to simulate a bubble column.
