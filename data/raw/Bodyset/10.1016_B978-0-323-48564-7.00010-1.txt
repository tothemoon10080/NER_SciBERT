The displacement in scaphoid fractures is understudied and frequently underestimated. Displacement and it's severity can influence outcome. This is typically done by imaging. Although plain radiographs provide adequate screening for scaphoid fracture displacement, a more detailed imaging modality is required to define its magnitude. Large studies favor using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess scaphoid fractures. However, although MRIs are excellent at identifying the occult fracture, the edema from a displaced fracture makes this modality a suboptimal choice to assess displacement. The recommended diagnostic test is therefore high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans with an ability to perform multiplanar reconstruction, with bone-specific windows, in the scaphoid plane.
               Following acquisition of a CT scan, displacement can be described as gapping, translation or step, angulation, and rotation. There are no evidence-based figures outlining how far or angulated the fragments are required to have moved before they can be called displaced. Most studies use a figure of 1mm gapping or translation as identifying displacement. Angulation can be measured indirectly via assessing the height to length of the scaphoid.
               In conclusion, the imaging modality of choice to define displacement is a high-resolution CT scan, and if fragments gap or are translated by more than 1mm, the scaphoid fracture should be considered displaced.
