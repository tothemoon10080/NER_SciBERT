To study the electronic transport in highly n-doped microcrystalline silicon (n+-μc-Si:H) thin films, grain-boundary trapping model is implemented in AMPS (analysis of microelectronic and photonic structure)-1D. This approach is based on the traditional thermionic-emission model and considering the electronic transport parallel to the substrate. In spite of its simplicity, the model leads to the simulated values of activation energy, free carrier concentration, interface trap charge density and mobility which are in good agreement with the referred Hall effect measurement results for electron cyclotron resonance-chemical vapor deposited (ECR-CVD) highly n-doped μc-Si:H thin films.In the past few decades many studies In poly/μc-Si:H thin films the potential barriers built up at grain boundaries (GBs) due to charge carrier trapping into interface states In our previous work we have used AMPS-1D AMPS can simulate an extremely general semiconductor device structure for μc-Si:H thin films that can consists of crystalline regions (crystallites) which are bounded by disordered regions (GBs) (  AMPS-1D simulation studies were carried for a linear chain of identical crystallites ( The grain-boundary trapping model, which we have implemented in AMPS-1D, is based on the growth models of μc-Si:H thin films In our present model we have disregarded many effects whose consideration may quantitatively change our results. In our one-dimensional model we have considered chains of identical grains only. Non-uniform grain size, thin a-Si:H tissues, voids, non-planarity and inhomogeneity in GBs which we did not include in the present simulation may have some effects on the transport properties of μc-Si:H thin films. In the present work it was shown that at temperature 300 The authors gratefully acknowledge Pennsylvania State University, USA for providing the AMPS-1D simulation package.
