The first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) were employed to investigate the effect of rare earth (RE) elements (La, Ce, Pr and Nd) doping on diopside CaMgSi2O6. The formation energy of the investigated structures reveals that theses RE atoms preferentially replaces Ca atom in diopside. RE dopants contribute more valence electrons to the bonding, and the directionality and locality of the charge accumulation around the RE atoms are continuously enhanced with the increasing of a number of RE-f electrons. The mechanical properties of the compounds were discussed based on the calculations of the elastic constants, and the results indicate that La doping decreases the bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus of diopside, while the rest three RE elements exhibit the reverse effect. The anisotropy factor results indicate that RE doping reduce the degree of anisotropy of diopside and consequently suppresses the generation of micro-cracks.With the development of the mining industry, a large amount of tailings has been produced and this process continues, which results in serious environmental and health issues. Therefore, the utilization of these solid wastes has attracted considerable attention due to its ecologic and economic importance [ Bayan Obo mine in China is a multi-metal ore containing more than 70 elements, including iron, niobium and rare earth (La, Ce, Pr and Nd), in form of over 100 different minerals. With mineral processing, a large number of tailings have been produced. The tailing is rich in SiO The first-principles methods consider nuclei and electrons as the basic particles, which can be expressed only by quantum mechanics and do not depend on any external or empirical parameters, and allows us to investigate the materials in an atomic-scale level. The advent of Kohnâ€“Sham density functional theory (DFT) In the present paper, we perform a systematic study of the RE (La, Ce, Pr and Nd) doping in diopside (CaMgSi We performed pseudopotential-based density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) The crystal structure of diopside CaMgSi To understand the stability and the preferred substitutional site for the RE dopants, the formation energies of RE (La, Ce, Pr and Nd) doped diopside were calculated by the following equation: The calculated formation energies are presented in Full relaxations were performed for diopside and its RE-doped structures, and the obtained lattice parameters are summarized in In order to further elaborate the doping effects of RE on diopside, we calculated the total density of states (TDOS) of bulk diopside and its RE-doped systems, as well as the corresponding partial density of states (PDOS) of the substituted Ca atom, RE doping atoms and their nearest Si and O atoms, the results are shown in  To thoroughly understand the bonding mechanism, the charges on the atoms of pure and doped diopside were calculated using Bader analysis The elastic constants are of great importance to understanding the RE-doping induced mechanical properties of diopside. The independent elastic constants of the compounds were calculated using the stress-strain method As indicated in According to the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) average scheme Based on the above Comparison of the results in The Poisson's ratio reflects the stability of a crystal against shear deformation and has a great correlation with ductility, i.e. the smaller the Poisson's ratio, the worse ductility, and vice versa. The critical value of Poisson's ratio for distinguishing ductile and brittle is around 0.26 The microhardness  The elastic anisotropy is awfully correlated with the possibility to induce micro-cracks in materials and the durability of the service materials The calculated results ( To further investigate the degrees of anisotropy of our structures, the shear anisotropic factors ( For an isotropic crystal, these three factors are equal to 1, and the degree to which the factors deviate from 1 implies the degree of shear anisotropy.
