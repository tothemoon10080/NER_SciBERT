This study compares the electrochemical response of austenitic stainless steel (316L) and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG)-reinforced 316L composites microwave-sintered in solid-state (1200°C) and supersolidus (1400°C) condition. Compared with conventional sintering (through radiative heating), microwave sintering results in better corrosion resistance. This has been correlated with higher densification and microstructural attributes in the latter. The 316L–5YAG composites consolidated in microwave furnace at 1400°C yields the highest corrosion resistance. Stainless steel powders are typically fabricated through atomization, which results in a single-phase prealloyed structure. Such prealloyed powders are amenable to consolidation at relatively higher temperatures through supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) One of the limitations SLPS is microstructural coarsening Besides faster heating, grain coarsening inhibition during sintering has also been achieved through addition of second-phase dispersoids The as-received (prealloyed) stainless steel (grade: 316L; composition (wt.%): Fe–16.5Cr–12.97Ni–2.48Mo–0.93Si–0.21Mn–0.025C–0.008S) and YAG powders (>97% purity) used in the present study were supplied by Ametek Specialty Metals Products, USA and Treibacher, Austria, respectively. The as-received 316L powders were mixed with 5 and 10 The electrochemical experiments were performed using a potentiostat (PC4, Gamry Instruments, Inc., Warminster, PA) on a CMS100 Framework. The surfaces of the samples were polished with 600 grit SiC papers before corrosion testing to produce a smooth surface finish. This was followed by ultrasonic cleaning with acetone to obtain a cleaner surface. Prior to polarization, samples were allowed to stabilize for about 3600 Sintered densities values of pure 316L and 316L–YAG stainless steel composites sintered in both conventional and microwave furnaces at 1200 and 1400 The effect of YAG content, sintering temperature and sintering techniques on OCP stabilization curves of microwave and conventional sintered samples at 1200 and 1400 In summary, compared with conventional sintering, microwave sintering results in higher densification and a relatively refined microstructure in both pure 316L and 316L–YAG composites. For both sintering modes, compacts sintered in a supersolidus condition (1400
