Abstract
                  The paper deals with observers for dynamic data reconciliation in mineral and metallurgical processing plants. In these industrial domains, improvement of data quality could have a significant impact on benefits generated by advanced control and real-time optimization applications. A review of the most common approaches is presented and the different observers are evaluated using benchmark plants. The aim of the paper is to compare the performance of methods in a systematic way and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. For this purpose, a separation unit and a typical flotation circuit operating in stationary mode are used as benchmarks. Improvements to stationary observer that takes into account the autocovariance of accumulation rate is also proposed.
