We read the article by Hsu et al Removal of the plate was prompted by radiographic evidence of bony union and took place at 6.2 ± 1.1 months after fixation. What was the evidence base for removing the plate at this time? Evidence suggests that removal of the hook plate after a period of 3-4 months is sufficient and reduces implant-related osteolysis and impingement. Radiographs have poor accuracy determining fracture union after operative fixation. Removal of metalwork necessitates a further operation, with associated inconvenience, risks, and financial cost. Clavicular hook plates were designed to address both coracoclavicular ligament injury and significant comminution of the lateral clavicle and acromioclavicular joint.
