The biosorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions, both individually and in mixtures, by Rhizopus arrhizus was investigated in a batch system as a function of single- and dual-metal ion concentrations. The studied initial pH value for single Pb(II) and Cu(II) biosorptions was 5. It was observed that the co-ion effect on the equilibrium uptake became more noticeable as the co-ion concentration in solution increased. Adsorption isotherms were developed for both the single- and dual-metal ion systems at this pH value and expressed by the mono- and multi-component Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. Model parameters were estimated by non-linear regression using MATLAB and EXCEL softwares. It was observed that the mono-component adsorption equilibrium data fitted adequately to both the mono-component adsorption models, for both the components and the pH value studied, while the multi-component Freundlich adsorption model predicted the multi-component adsorption equilibrium data for the ranges of initial mixture concentrations studied, and for the pH value used.Solving water pollution problems caused by heavy toxic metal contamination resulting from industrial activities has long attracted the attention of scientists. The methods which have been used to remove heavy metal ions, such as chemical precipitation, adsorption, ion-exchange and solvent extraction have been found to be limited, since they often have high capital and operational costs and may also generate secondary wastes which are difficult to treat ( The use of microorganisms as biological adsorbents for removing heavy toxic metals is an alternative and cost effective technology (biosorption) which has emerged recently, based on the interactions between active sites of biomaterial (carboxylic, phosphate, sulphate, amino, amidic and hydroxyl groups) and metallic ions in the system ( Simple sorption isotherm curves are usually constructed by studying the equilibrium batch sorption behavior of different biosorbent materials. These curves allow quantitative evaluation of biosorption performance of these materials for only one metal. However, when more than one metal is present in a sorption system, evaluation, interpretation, and representation of biosorption results becomes much more complicated ( The present paper investigates the binary sorption of copper and lead ions onto microorganism ( Equilibrium sorption studies determine the capacity of the sorbent, which can be described by a sorption isotherm characterized by certain constants whose values express the surface properties and affinity of the sorbent. Sorption equilibrium is established when the concentration of sorbate in the bulk solution is in dynamic balance with that of the interface ( The data were determined and analyzed by some of the most frequently used isotherms. The Langmuir sorption isotherm ( The extended predictive Langmuir model can be written as There are several examples in the literature of empirical models, which provide parameters derived from single system data, but also adjustable correction parameters that take into account the interaction between the two metals in solution and that are fitted to binary data ( The addition of further correction coefficients into the classical competitive Langmuir isotherm An empirical extension of the Freundlich model ( One of the other frequently used multi-component adsorption models is the Combination Langmuir and Freundlich model developed by After the growth period, Pb(II) and Cu(II) solutions were prepared by diluting 1.0 For the determination of biosorption characteristics of Pb(II), and Cu(II) ions in binary metal mixtures, the initial concentration of the dominant metal was varied between 50 and 500 Analysis of the experimental data shows that the influence of antagonistic metals in solution becomes less as the pH decreases for the buffering effect of high H+ concentrations. For equilibrium pH values ranging from 3 to 5, only part of the most acidic group on the cell wall is deprotonated and available for metal interactions. For the lowest tested pH, it is reasonable to suppose that most of the sites are protonated and metallic ions cannot effectively compete with protons for the binding sites ( It was observed from various experiments that the optimum pH value for gaining the most efficiency in biosorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions was 5. The first and simplest step in simulating the binary system data is by using the predictive models such as the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms In order to compare the adsorptive capacity of the sorbent for different components, adsorption model constants can be used to express its surface properties and affinity. The magnitudes of While the Freundlich model does not describe the saturation behavior of the biosorbent, To determine the effects of initial Pb(II) and Cu(II) ion concentrations on the equilibrium uptake of Pb(II), the initial Pb(II) concentrations were varied between 100 and 500 In the second part of the biosorption studies, the uptake of Cu(II) in the presence of increasing concentrations of Pb(II) was investigated at the initial pH value of 5. While the initial Cu(II) concentration was changed from 100 to 500 Although none of these predictive models confirms the non-ideal interactions occurring in the biosorption phenomenon, they are able to simulate adequately the binary system behavior starting from the single-metal system characteristic parameters. Good results were obtained using the simple Langmuir competitive model and the multi-component Freundlich model. The relative model parameters are listed in In comparison with the multi-component Langmuir model, the multi-component Freundlich model fitted the binary uptake data of Pb(II) and Cu(II) in the studied concentration range and pH value reasonably well, although slight deviations were observed between the experimental and calculated results from the model. These results can be attributed to the insensitivity of both models to competitive and interactive effects existing in multi-component systems and the characteristics of the Langmuir model which is not valid for high concentrations assuming limited number of identical sites for sorption. The average percentage errors between the experimental and predicted values ( The average percentage errors between the experimental and predicted The presence of other metal species in wastewater during single-metal biosorption can have significant impact. Since real wastewaters contain many pollutants, adsorption system design must be based on multi-component effluents. For this reason, it is necessary to make multi-component equilibrium data instead of just single ones. The biosorption of Pb(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II)â€“Cu(II) binary mixtures on the The results showed that the Application of the mono-component Langmuir and Freundlich models at the studied pH value indicated that the individual biosorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions is suitable and can be characterized as a monolayer, single-site-type phenomenon with no interaction between sorbed components and the microbial surface. The individual Langmuir and multi-component Freundlich constants evaluated from the mono-component isotherms were used to compare the biosorptive capacity of the
