This retrospective analysis sought to identify patient- and injury-related factors that affect nonunion of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures to help determine if operative management is warranted. Patients included in the study were at least 18 years old, had a fracture in the middle three-fifths of the clavicle, complete displacement of the main fragments with no cortical contact, initial nonoperative treatment until confirmed fracture healing or nonunion developed, and adequate demographic information and follow-up until fracture healing or development of nonunion. A fracture was considered united when the patient had minimal or no pain, no limited range of motion, and presence of bridging callus on imaging. Nonunion was diagnosed if two of these three criteria were not met by 24 weeks after fracture. There were 941 patients from 1994 to 2007 who met inclusion criteria, and 13.3% developed nonunion. Multivariate analysis revealed that smoking (odds ratio [OR] 3.76), comminution (OR 1.75), and overall fracture displacement (OR 1.17) are independently predictive variables for nonunion. A decision tool was created to predict probability of nonunion using these variables. If all fractures were managed operatively, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one nonunion was 7.5, but if only those fractures with a predicted probability of nonunion â‰¥ 40% (using their decision tool) were managed operatively, the NNT decreased to 1.7.
