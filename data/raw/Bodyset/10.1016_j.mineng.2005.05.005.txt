Euro price: 220 or US: $242. This volume is the latest addition (volume 20) in the series The book starts with a short chapter giving a general description of interfacial separation. This is followed by three chapters discussing the scientific bases of these phenomena, in particular the behavior of fine particles in aqueous solutions (236 pages). Chapter 5 describes the physical, physicochemical and other characteristics of particle suspensions (44 pages). Chapters 6 to 11 describe the typical interfacial separation processes in details (355 pages). Chapter 12, the last chapter, deals with equipment for interfacial separation (42 pages). Each chapter is well documented by an extensive list of references from English, Chinese, Russian, and Japanese literature. The book is well illustrated with good diagrams and mathematical derivations. Among the topics discussed are: coagulation, flocculation, magnetic co-aggregation and combined aggregation, dispersion of particles in liquids, and gasâ€“liquid interfacial separation. The book is a scholarly work, a combined effort of a Chinese professor and two Swedish scientists. Anyone dealing with slurries, suspensions, froth, sedimentation, etc., will find the book of great help.
