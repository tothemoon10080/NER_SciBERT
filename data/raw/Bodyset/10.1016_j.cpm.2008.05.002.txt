Percutaneous reduction with external fixation is an advanced technique for surgical management in foot and ankle trauma. In the high-risk patient, closed or percutaneous reduction followed by external fixation for reduction and stabilization is a unique alternative to achieve anatomic stabilization without increased physical strain to the patient. The significant advantages of this approach include minimizing damage to the vascular supply, maintaining and preserving a stable soft tissue envelope, and allowing for correction to be performed acutely or adjusted gradually over time. This article provides an overview of closed or percutaneous reduction with limited soft tissue dissection and external fixation stabilization techniques, and their role in foot and ankle trauma for the high-risk patient.
