Clavicle fractures are a very common injury in the pediatric and adult populations. Lately, the literature has seen a growing number of reviews, meta-analysis, and randomized control trials that provide a more thorough input on the treatment of clavicle fractures. This chapter first reviews the clavicle anatomy, epidemiology, and risk factors of clavicle fractures. The chapter then describes the mechanism of injury and clinical presentation of those fractures before presenting different classifications of clavicle fractures, their treatment, and complications. Finally, future trends in the treatment of clavicle fractures will briefly be discussed.Type I: minimally displaced/nondisplaced, distal to intact coracoclavicular ligaments Type II: medial to coracoclavicular ligaments Type III: fractures extends into acromioclavicular joint, intact coracoclavicular ligaments Type IV: periosteal sleeve fracture (ligaments attached to periosteum) Type V: comminuted fracture with ligaments attached to inferior fragment Clavicle: from the Latin words Clavicle fractures are very common (20–55/100,000/year; Clavicle fractures are generally classified based on the location of the fracture (central third, medial, or lateral thirds). The clavicle is treated differently depending on the location and the nature of the fracture. Clinical presentation can be dramatic and prompt recognition followed by appropriate treatment is important. This chapter is meant to assist the reader in the recognition and management of clavicular fractures and is divided into many sections. This chapter first reviews the clavicle anatomy and specifically describes the bony anatomy of the clavicle, its stabilizers (muscles and ligaments), and the neurovascular structures around the clavicle. The chapter then describes the epidemiology, risk factors, and mechanisms of injury before reviewing the clinical presentation and diagnostic imaging. The following sections discuss different classifications of clavicle fractures, the conservative and surgical treatments of those fractures, associated complications, and treatment outcomes. Pediatric clavicle fractures, future trends, and sources of further information and advice are presented in the last section of this chapter. The clavicle is the first bone to ossify—around the fifth to seventh weeks in utero ( The dynamic stabilizers of the clavicle include the muscles originating from and inserting on this bone ( Static stabilizers of the clavicle include medially, the anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments, the costoclavicular ligament, and the interclavicular ligament ( Important neurovascular structures (subclavian artery and vein, brachial plexus, and branches of the supraclavicular nerves) are located around the clavicle, and recognition of those structures is important to avoid potential major complications when fixing clavicle fractures ( Clavicle fractures are common injuries and account for 2.6–5% of all fractures. It is the most common fracture in the pediatric population ( The main risk factors for clavicle fractures are younger age (with a peak at 10–19 years) and male gender (three times more likely than women) ( Clavicle fractures primarily occur secondary to a fall on the lateral side of the shoulder or on an outstretched hand, road traffic accidents, sports/extreme sports, or with a direct blow to the clavicle ( A thorough anamnesis will reveal the past medical history (underlying condition such as osteopenia), presenting symptoms, mechanism of injury/activity at time of injury, and position of the arm at the time of the injury. Patients may report symptoms related to associated neurovascular complications (e.g., dyspnea, numbness). Patients with a broken clavicle will typically complain of pain and swelling localized at the fracture site, crepitus, local deformity, a shortened or drooping shoulder, bruising, and difficulty mobilizing the arm ( Acute complications and associated injuries are usually encountered with high-energy traumas and pronounced displacement at the fracture site ( According to the literature, open fractures are rare, accounting for a maximum of 1.4% of all clavicular fractures ( The differential diagnosis of clavicle fractures includes acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular dislocations. To confirm acute injuries and assist in characterizing the type and seriousness of the injury, the diagnosis of clavicle fracture is usually done with the combination of physical examination and diagnostic imaging ( Associated injuries discussed in the previous section will be diagnosed with a high index suspicion and with chest or ribs radiographs, computed tomography scans, angiograms, or magnetic resonance imaging ( In the presence of high-risk factors for neurovascular intraoperative iatrogenic injuries (small clavicle, osteoporosis, comminution, medial fracture, nonunion, malunion, previous surgery, previous infection), and in order to better understand the neurovascular anatomy of those patients, a three-dimensional computed tomographic angiogram can be performed preoperatively ( Several classification schemes have been suggested in the literature. Clavicle fractures are generally classified based on the location of the fracture ( Nondisplaced or minimally displaced isolated shaft fractures should be treated conservatively in a sling ( Displaced shaft fractures have traditionally been treated conservatively and generally heal ( To lower the nonunion rate, surgical treatment of central third clavicle fractures is preferable under certain circumstances: skin tenting or open fractures, displaced fractures (100% displacement or > Most lateral third fractures are nondisplaced or minimally displaced ( With fractures medial to the coracoclavicular ligaments or involving the rupture of those ligaments (Craig Group II, Type II, or Edinburg Type 3B), nonunion rates can be as high as 28% with conservative treatment ( Surgical fixation of those fractures is performed by either fixing the fracture or fixing the coracoclavicular ligaments. Surgical reduction, fixation, and reconstruction are achieved by a number of different techniques: conventional plating (locking or nonlocking), hook plate, coracoclavicular fixation—arthroscopically assisted or not (screw, suture/suspension sling with or without graft), Kirschner wires, modified Weaver–Dunn, and excision of distal clavicle fragment ( Coracoclavicular fixation with a screw was initially used for acromioclavicular subluxations. It is a technically challenging technique with a high failure rate secondary to loosening or screw cut-out ( There is no consensus in the literature regarding the best treatment of medial clavicular fractures. Conservative treatment with a sling and early range of motion exercises are usually recommended for those rare and usual minimally displaced fractures ( If any neurovascular or respiratory/mediastinal compromise is present, emergent closed surgical reduction and possible open reduction are advised ( Prompt recognition of any complication and associated injury is essential and will influence the treatment, the potential need for urgent surgical exploration and fixation, and, ultimately, the patient outcomes and satisfaction ( Based on the latest meta-analysis focusing on the displaced central third fractures, complications are seen in 29% of operated patients and 42% of patients treated nonoperatively ( When treated conservatively, the nonunion rate of nondisplaced central third fractures is 5–6% and 15–20% if the fracture is displaced ( Malunions are commonly seen in patients treated conservatively: 23% nonoperative treatment versus 1% operative treatment ( Vascular complications can present early (laceration, contusion, compression, spasm) or late (thrombosis, compression, aneurysm) and can be arterial, venous, or both (arteriovenous fistulas) ( Neurovascular and pulmonary injuries can have devastating implications that warrant early identification and speedy treatment. Neurologic compromise can present with severe associated injuries (lungs, ribs, scapulothoracic dissociation), especially in high-energy traumas ( Delayed fixation of a shortened clavicular fracture may also put the brachial plexus under undue tension if there is scarring at the fracture site, especially in a shortened comminuted fracture ( Refracture after implant removal is observed in 7% of cases and generally happens during the first 2 months after the hardware is removed ( A recent systematic review ( Complication rates are high (22%) with surgical treatment (especially with hook plates—up to 40%) compared to conservative treatment (6.7%). Rotator cuff tear, impingement, acromial fracture, migration of implant in the acromion, and acromial osteolysis are all related to the use of the hook plate ( Osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint is most commonly seen with intra-articular distal third clavicular fractures ( Posterior displacement of the medial clavicle can be seen in patients younger than 25 with physeal injuries or if the sternoclavicular ligaments have been ruptured. Acute posterior displacement can compromise the trachea, subclavian vessels, and carotid arteries. Patients may present with breathing difficulties, motor and sensory abnormalities, cyanosis, syncope, and asymmetrical pulse ( Other than mediastinal and neurovascular injuries, limited data is available on medial fractures and their complications due to the rarity of this injury. Nonunions may be seen in 8% of these fractures even though the real prevalence of this complication is unknown for this fracture ( Surgery-related complications include infections, painful/prominent hardware, hardware failure, and nonunion ( As previously mentioned, larger and better quality randomized clinical trials are required to draw any formal conclusion regarding the treatment of those injuries. The available evidence is limited and of moderate quality ( It is impossible to provide any formal outcome data because limited evidence is available in the literature. Even though the nonunion rate is high in this group of fractures when treated conservatively, functional outcomes are acceptable for most patients with nonunions ( There is limited data in the literature to provide any generalizable outcomes for the treatment of these injuries. Most patients seem to do well with conservative and operative treatment of those fractures ( Approximately 10–15% of all fractures in children involve the clavicle ( The mechanism of injury is usually a fall on an outstretched arm or a direct blow to the lateral aspect of the shoulder ( Because pediatric bones are more flexible than adult bones, radiographs can show green stick fractures (or incomplete fractures) ( Most fractures, including physeal separations with intact periosteal sleeve, can be treated conservatively and will heal uneventfully ( Growth disturbances, nonunion, malunion, and neurovascular injuries are rare complications (3.7%) with conservative treatment of pediatric clavicle fractures ( Currently, the literature suggests that surgical treatment of any acute and displaced central clavicle fracture might be an excellent option to reduce the risk of nonunions and to obtain better clinical and functional outcomes ( In this era of minimally invasive procedures, intramedullary nails (locked or not) are being used more frequently for the treatment of those fractures with similar outcomes to plating ( Distal third clavicular fractures are being treated more commonly like an acromioclavicular dislocation ( With increasing patient expectations and a patient population that is generally more active later in life, an early return to sports and general activities is more frequently sought after ( For further information about the epidemiology of clavicle fractures, nonoperative and operative treatments of those injuries refer to Part II, Final treatment of central third clavicular fractures is still a debate. Since 2011, a few review papers and randomized-control trials have been recently published and may be of interest, including Kulshrestha, Mirzatolooei, Ban, Virtanen, Wijdicks, Liu, Formaini, and Xu (
