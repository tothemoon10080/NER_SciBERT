The roof collapse accident happens frequently in the mining affected roadway reinforced by anchors, which makes the roadway unsafe. Based on the damage analysis of roof strata, composite material mechanic rationale is adopted to deduce the calculating formulas of anchor reinforcing potential coefficient which is represented by the ratio of the limit roof collapse span between after anchor reinforcement and before anchor reinforcement. By using anchor reinforcing potential coefficient, this paper puts forward a new anchor support calculating method for the roadway affected by mining. It has been tested in Yanzhou mining area and Xinwen mining area. The results show that the new method is safe and reliable, and valuable for generalization
