                  This article has been retracted at the request of the Editors in Chief as it is a duplicate of a paper that has already been published in Int. J. Cast Metals Res., 16 (2003) 215â€“220, doi:10.1179/136404603225006918. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.
