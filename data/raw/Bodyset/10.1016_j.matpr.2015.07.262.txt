In this study, the wear behavior of hybrid composite with an Al6061 matrix reinforced with copper coated silicon carbide (SiC) particles and copper coated Graphite (Gr) powder using Taguchi method was investigated. Wear tests of Al6061/Cu-10%SiC/Cu-1%Gr was carried out for a dry sliding condition in a so-called a pin-on-disc arrangement. The wear tests were conducted under the loads of 10, 20, and 40N and sliding speeds of 0.42, 0.84 and 1.68 m/s and also sliding distance of 750, 1500 and 3000m. The obtained experimental results are transformed into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of using Taguchi method. An L27 orthogonal array was employed for the experimental design. Applied load, sliding speed and sliding distance exert a great effect on the specific wear rate at 42.86%, 36.50%, and 6.42% and also on the coefficient of friction at 60.67%, 9.65% and 14.46 respectively. Regression equations were developed for both specific wear rate and coefficient of friction. Finally confirmation tests were carried out to verify the experimental results.
