Modeling breakage by a rate kernel that is power-law in particle size and with self-similar daughters yields similarity solutions of the population balance equations. For rate exponents that are inverses of integers, the moments of the similarity solution are easily found. Using a generalized power-law product daughter distribution that is self-similar and obeys the Hill–Ng exchangeability principle provides a very flexible description of the daughters. This paper explores how to interpret milling data to extract the parameters of the model, including the power-law exponent and either the sharpness parameter of the daughter distribution or the number of daughters in a breakup event.The use of similarity solutions and transforms in population balance modeling has a long history going back at least as far as Schumann's work of 1940 (cited by Diemer and Olson So, the use of similarity solutions, and the modified gamma function in particular, have long-standing precedent for these types of problems. The recent development of statistically well-founded daughter distributions by Hill and Ng In this paper, moment models are the foundation of the attack on the problem of breakage with power-law rate kernel and self-similar daughters. By requiring time invariance of the moments at a similarity solution (following the approach of Ziff Relations for the evolution of size are developed when the distribution is of similarity form, and these suggest a means to extract an estimate of The point of departure for these developments is the population balance for particle breakup under a power-law rate kernel and producing self-similar daughters: The equation is shown for a batch process in which the size reduction equipment is charged initially with powder and the balance equation describes the evolution of the particle size distribution with time. The terms on the RHS of the equation describe breakage in terms of a source and sink term. The source term describes breakage of parent particles of size The following equations give definitions of the moment operator for both the product size distribution (in There are several useful scalings that simplify the moment equations in a way that strips away the problem specifics and clarifies the underlying structure of the problem. The first of these scalings is by the initial conditions. The product of the initial particle number concentration ( The equation for It can readily be shown that the moments of the daughter distribution The moments may also be scaled by the instantaneous number concentration and number mean particle volume: The initially scaled and instantaneously scaled moments are interrelated through the zeroth initially scaled moment The time derivatives for the This is not the only similarity transformation possible. Ziff The fact that this problem has a similarity solution leads to a convenient analytical solution for Defining ℓ Diemer and Olson The daughter distribution for which Peterson Another special case is when Yet a third special case occurs when The above expression for the moments   Under the assumption of the generalized power-law product daughter distribution, one can generate similarity solution moment spectra from the recursion formula for any values of the daughter distribution parameters A correlation was developed for the erosion regime results (small  The application of this data interpretation methodology is illustrated by looking at data from a stirred ball mill published by Gao and Forssberg Diemer and Olson The functional form allows analytical evaluation of the second moment The work as described to this point was presented at the 2003 Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and submitted as such for publication in this special issue serving as a proceedings of that meeting. Since that time, additional work has gone forward, and the authors feel it is necessary to add some caveats and point toward future results. Taking the model parameters above, a dynamic simulation was done by the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) described elsewhere in this volume A two-term weighted sum of power-law product terms was tried, again assuming that Note that the contribution of the uniform term is small (small To summarize, moment models have been developed for particle breakage such that the rate kernel is power-law in particle volume and the daughter distribution is self-similar. Using the similarity transform of Friedlander and Wang, it is shown that these systems have similarity solutions and a recursion formula for their moments is obtained. Analysis of the moment models leads to a relationship between the slope of a ln–ln plot of particle length dimension versus milling time and the breakage rate order in particle volume Employing a generalized power-law product daughter distribution, flexible enough to describe a wide range of breakage processes and consistent with Hill–Ng exchangeability, a mapping is created of the second moment of the similarity solutions as a function of the rate kernel order in particle volume Application of this data interpretation methodology to experimental data from a stirred ball mill illustrates the method and leads to the conclusion that for this data, the breakage rate is reasonably approximated as 1/3-order in particle volume, and that breakage is occurring by an erosion/chipping mechanism for which it is reasonable to assume binary breakage ( It is hoped that being able to extract model parameters from milling data will lead to a better understanding of breakage processes including the ability to class materials and equipment by breakage mechanism. Further, it is hoped that these types of analyses will eventually lead to new and improved rules for scaling up size reduction processes. parameters of reconstructed distribution breakage daughter distribution jth moment of daughter distribution the beta function parameters of reconstructed distribution proportionality constant particle diameter particle diameter at particle diameter at mass median particle diameter normalized number distribution initial distribution in parameter of reconstructed distribution  ℓ particle length dimension characteristic of initial value of zeroth moment scaled by its initial value initially scaled moments initial value of parameters of reconstructed distribution jth moment of initial value of distribution in number concentration units number of daughters produced in breakage sharpness parameter of daughter distribution q( time particle volume number mean particle volume initial value of V mass mean particle volume weight of second term in two-term daughter distribution cumulative mass distribution scaled particle volume similarity variable daughter-to-parent particle volume ratio parameter in Peterson daughter distribution self-similar daughter distribution Dirac delta function moments of parent particle volume in breakage  initial value of  the gamma function breakage rate constant order of breakage rate kernel in size geometric proportionality constant dimensionless time
