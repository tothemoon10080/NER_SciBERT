The effect of inner diameter to outer diameter ratio, di/do and the outer diameter to the flow channel diameter ratio, do/D on terminal velocity is reported for the specified range of angle of inclination, θ for several hollow frustums in a series of high viscous Newtonian fluids. The terminal velocity shows an increasing trend with increasing and decreasing do/D and di/do ratios, respectively. The terminal velocity also increases with increasing the angle of inclination, θ of the flow channel. Predictive equations are developed for the estimation of C

The experimental drag coefficients are then predicted excellently through numerical approximation using Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) available in Ansys-15.In process industries like fluidized bed reactor, processing of food particle, conveying solid particle in fluid channel, chemical blending, mineral processing and other solid handling processes, several kinds of solid and hollow objects are involved. The resistance or drag offered by a fluid medium, due to relative motion, on the particle is a critical parameter for process design. The flow over regular shaped particles i.e. sphere, cylinder and the circular disk had received the maximum attention. Clift et al. Many researchers, Clift et al. The previous studies as discussed above were limited to vertical flow channel. Only few studies were carried out to estimate the drag coefficient for the inclined flow channel. Carty In preceding paragraphs, the literatures included the drag coefficient data of solid regular shaped body in the vertical and inclined flow channels. To the best of the author's knowledge, no attempt was reported for the drag coefficient due to flow of Newtonian fluid over any hollow particle. Looking at the usefulness of the hollow particles in process industries, to fill the void and to enrich the existing literature, the present work is undertaken to estimate the drag coefficient of hollow tapered cylindrical body called hollow frustum ( Based on the literature gaps, the following objectives are adopted for the present work. To estimate the effect of the angle of inclination, To estimate the effect of the inner diameter to outer diameter ratio ( To develop the correlation for the drag coefficient, To predict the experimental drag coefficients using Ansys Fluent software. The schematic representation of the hollow frustum is given in The expression of drag force is For smooth plane with For vertical channel consideration, Eq. The diameter ratios ( Hollow frustums (SS 304 The inclination angles (90°–40°) are varied by rotating the moveable end of the tube around the fixed end. The schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in Measured terminal velocity is one of the vital parameters for the estimation of drag coefficient and Reynolds number, and it depends on the ratio of the particle and channel diameters The effect of angle of inclination (90°–40°) on the terminal velocity is illustrated in The drag coefficient and Reynolds number are calculated using the fundamental properties of the hollow frustum and process fluid and the terminal velocity of the hollow frustum for different angle of inclination, According to Eq. For 40° to 80° inclinations, projected areas are same, but as mentioned above the terminal velocity decreases with decreasing the angle of inclination. According to Eqs. Empirical expressions of He did not explore any effect of the angle of inclination on the drag coefficient expression. The present work has developed expression of Root Mean Square of Logarithmic Deviation (RMSLD) Sum of Squared of Logarithmic Deviations (SSLD) Average Relative Error (ARE) Sum of Relative Error (SRE) Sum of Squared Relative Errors (SSRE) Where In case of Eq. According to Eq. The variation of the drag coefficient with 1/ The empirical model equations (Eqs. The statistical analysis of the first empirical model (Eq. In the similar fashion the statistical sensitivity analysis of the predictive empirical second model (Eq. Overall, it can therefore be concluded that the change of Reynolds number on the drag coefficient has large effect as compared to negligible effect due to change of the Experimental drag coefficients are predicted numerically, by employing the three dimensional –pressure based –steady state CFD simulation using the commercial Fluent module of Ansys-15. The following steady state model equations are solved under consideration in the present study. Hollow frustum is placed vertically at the center of the flow domain in the vertical channel. However, for the inclined channel, the horizontal frustum is placed off-centered in the mid height of channel. The exact off-centered location of the hollow frustum is determined by adjusting its position to match the experimental data. In the present study, for all the channel inclinations (< According to the range of the experimental Reynolds number flow domain falls in laminar zone, hence, the laminar model is tried first, however, it is observed that after Meshing is very important part for the solution purpose and the sensitivity on the mesh quality and quantity affect largely the results. The triangular meshes with fine relevance center and high smoothing are chosen. After 85-relevance center, no further improvements in the results are noticed. The number of nodes and elements are varied along with the diameter ratio. The mesh independency tests are carried. In It is always beneficial to validate the accuracy of the model approximation with the experimental results. The obtained drag coefficient values in each simulation are compared with the experimental data in In this work, the experimental drag coefficient of the hollow frustum particles of different dimensions settling in both the vertical and inclined plane of constant diameter was reported to show the effect of the channel inclination, ratio of the physical dimensions and Reynolds number on the variation of the drag coefficient of the particle in Newtonian fluids. The experimental drag coefficient of the hollow frustum are valid for 0.13  Projected area (m Drag coefficient Computed drag coefficient using empirical equations Diameter of flow channel (mm) Outer diameter of hollow frustum (mm) Inner diameter of hollow frustum (mm) Drag force (N) Solid –Solid resistance (N) Body force (N) Percentage of Glycerin in aqueous solution Acceleration due to gravity (m/s Radius of sphere (mm) Measured terminal velocity (m/s)  Angle of inclination (degree) Density of solid (kg/m Density of fluid (kg/m Kinetic viscosity (Pa·s)  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
