A sulfidogenic fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) process was developed for treating acidic metal- and sulfate-containing wastewater. The process operating parameters were determined and the bacterial diversity of the FBR was described. The process was based on sulfate reduction by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), precipitation of metals as sulfides with the biogenic H2S and neutralization of the water with biologically produced bicarbonate alkalinity. The lactate- and ethanol-utilizing FBRs precipitated over 600 mg Zn l−1 day−1 and 300 mg Fe l−1 day−1 at a hydraulic retention time of 6.5 h. Metal precipitation was over 99.8% and effluent soluble Zn and Fe concentrations were below 0.1 mg l−1. Zinc and iron precipitated predominantly as ZnS, FeS2 and FeS. The wastewater pH was increased from 2.5–3 to 7.5–8.5 during the treatment. Acetate oxidation was the rate-limiting step in ethanol oxidation. Ethanol oxidation was more affected by sulfide toxicity than was acetate oxidation. The FBR microbial communities contained SRB related to members of the genera Desulfovibrio, Desulfobulbus, Desulfotomaculum, Desulfobacca and Desulforhabdus, and also many species that do not reduce sulfate. The FBR communities contained many previously undescribed bacteria. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the sulfidogenic FBR for the concomitant removal of acidity, metals and sulfate from wastewaters.The exploitation of sulfide minerals in mining and metallurgy usually involves the chemical and/or biological oxidation of iron and sulfur, and results in the formation of acidic metal- and sulfate-containing wastewaters, often called acid mine drainage (AMD) The most widely used active treatment process for AMD is based on chemical neutralization and hydroxide precipitation of metals Efforts have been made to develop biological alternatives for AMD treatment. Recently, interest in the application of sulfate reduction as the dominant step of wastewater treatment has been growing (for reviews, see Anaerobic FBRs have become a well-established technology to treat concentrated industrial effluents containing organic contaminants (for a review, see In the present work, a one-stage sulfidogenic fluidized-bed treatment process for removing soluble metals, sulfate and acidity from wastewater was studied and developed. The FBR process performance was evaluated under various operational conditions with continuous flow experiments. Substrate utilization and sulfide inhibition kinetics were determined with batch FBR experiments. The bacterial communities of the FBRs were characterized using culture-independent molecular methods and cultivation of bacterial strains. Fluidized-bed treatment of acidic wastewater was studied in laboratory scale FBRs (volume 0.5 l) ( The reactors were fed with synthetic Zn- and Fe-containing wastewater supplemented with lactate or ethanol as the electron donor for sulfate reduction Batch kinetic experiments were conducted in the ethanol-utilizing FBR to determine the maximum velocity ( Additionally, the inhibition constants ( The ethanol and acetate oxidation rates obtained in the batch kinetic experiments were standardized to the total amount of biomass in the FBR determined as volatile solids (VS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) The physico-chemical analyses carried out in this work have been previously described The potential of sulfate-reducing FBRs for the simultaneous removal of acidity, metals and sulfate from wastewater was studied with continuous flow experiments The robustness of the FBR was studied by increasing stepwise the Zn, sulfate and electron donor feed concentrations and decreasing the feed pH Maximum metal precipitation rates were obtained with the ethanol-fed FBR at a HRT of 6.5 h: over 600 mg Zn l The rates of metal precipitation and neutralization of acidity compared favourably with the rates obtained in previous studies with one-stage FBR-reactor systems ( Zinc has been reported to completely inhibit sulfate-reduction in the concentration range of 25–60 mg l The effect of HRT on the performance of the fluidized-bed treatment of acidic Zn- and Fe-containing wastewater was studied by gradually decreasing the HRT from 20.7 to 6.1 h, while keeping the feed concentrations constant The metal precipitates formed in the FBR process were predominantly pyrite (FeS Ethanol and acetate oxidation kinetics were studied in batch FBR experiments The Ethanol oxidation kinetics in sulfate-reducing systems has been previously reported by Nagpal et al. Sulfide inhibition of ethanol and acetate oxidation was studied in the sulfate-reducing FBR with batch kinetic experiments Sulfate-reducing bioreactor communities used for AMD treatment have not been extensively described. In this study, bacterial communities in FBRs maintained over the long-term (500–980 days) were characterized using culture-independent molecular methods and cultivation of bacterial strains Clone libraries constructed using the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes of the FBR communities resulted in 170 and 130 clones for the lactate- and ethanol-utilizing FBRs, respectively Within the phylum DGGE analysis was applied to reveal successive changes in the microbial communities of the FBRs A total of 128 strains were screened microscopically following isolation using anaerobic plates and roll tubes Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (1017–1606 bp sequenced) of the isolates revealed that four mesophilic strains belonged to the δ- The traditional anaerobic microbiological techniques did not result in pure cultures of the dominant genotypes in the clone library and DGGE analysis, which were related to members of the genera This study demonstrated the feasibility of laboratory-scale sulfidogenic FBR for the simultaneous removal of acidity, metals and sulfate from wastewaters. At a HRT of 6.5 h, over 600 mg Zn l
