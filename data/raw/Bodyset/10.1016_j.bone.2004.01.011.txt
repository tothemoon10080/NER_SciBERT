Introduction. Although the first polyphosphonates were already introduced in the early 1970s, mechanisms involved in uptake still remain speculative. The present work aimed to establish a new method to rate the influence of various factors on the uptake and to evaluate new bone-seekers on these bone compartments. Methods. Radioactive-labelled diphosphonates and [18F]-fluoride were added to a vial containing hydroxyapatite (HA), collagen, or amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) in 3 ml of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). After incubation, these suspensions were filtered, the radioactivity was measured in the gamma-counter, and the percentage of irreversibly bound radioactivity was calculated. Results. Kinetic experiments revealed uptake increase over time for [99mTc]-MDP and [18F]-fluoride on various amounts of matrix. After 120 min, static studies on HA yielded: [99mTc]-EDTMP < [188Re]-/Re-EDTMP < [99mTc]-/11 μl Re-EDTMP < [99mTc]-/In-EDTMP < [99mTc]-/15 μl Re-EDTMP < nca [188Re]-EDTMP < [111In]-/Re-EDTMP < [111In]-EDTMP < [111In]-/In-EDTMP < [99mTc]-DPD < [99mTc]-/80 μl Re-EDTMP < [99mTc]-EDTMP “boiled” < [99mTc]-/150 μl Re-EDTMP < [153Sm]-EDTMP < [99mTc]-/11 μl Re-EDTMP “boiled” < [18F]-ions < [99mTc]-MDP. Collagen showed very low uptake. Reincubation experiments suggest that bone tracers are irreversibly bound. Conclusion. The presented method is rapid and feasible to examine the adsorption of radioactive-labelled substances on bone components. Correlations between our findings and published in vivo data support the application as a simple model.Many primary tumors, such as those of breast, lung, and prostate, have the tendency of metastasizing into osseous tissue, and the detection of bone metastases thus plays an important role. Bone scanning with radioactive labelled polyphosphonates (PP) had been described in the early 1970s To a vial containing 0.25–15 mg of HA or ACP, 3 ml of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was added and swayed at 37°C for 24 h. 0.3 μmol (13–60 μl) of a radioactive-labelled PP or 25 MBq [ An aliquot of 50 μl of this suspension was added to 2 ml of physiological saline. Out of this dilution three aliquots of 50 μl (V1–3) were taken and placed in tubes for the gamma-counter. The rest of the dilution was filtered through a Millex-FG® single use filter unit and three aliquots of 50 μl were taken from the filtrate and placed in tubes (N1–3). The radioactivity of the six tubes was measured in the gamma-counter and the percentage of irreversibly bound radioactive-labelled diphosphonate was calculated as percent binding = 100/AM (V) × {AM (V) − AM (N)} (AM = arithmetic mean). The procedure was similar to the chapters To a vial containing 3 mg of collagen, 3 ml of HBSS was added.
