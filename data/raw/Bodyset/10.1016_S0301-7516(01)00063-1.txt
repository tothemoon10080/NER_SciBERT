It all started more than 15 years ago when Jan Leja's retirement prompted the idea of editing a special volume that would combine in a single book various interrelated contributions that all pertain to the area of frothing in flotation. The first The first volume served to demonstrate the effect of frothers and froth properties on flotation, and the lack of understanding of the underlying phenomena. The second volume demonstrated that the principles can be applied to real systems, focusing on the froth behavior, visual froth images and froth image analysis in flotation control systems. It demonstrated that the gap existing between theory and practice is narrowing. This volume comprises the papers that study the effect of frothers on bubble generation and foam stability, and the dynamic methods of characterizing flotation frothers. These are followed by papers on the fundamental properties of flotation froth, the collection of hydrophobic particles in the froth phase, and entrainment in the flotation froth. Quantifying the froth performance follows which allows for the prediction of the froth zone performance of large commercial cells based on batch flotation tests. The papers on froth surface characterization and on the on-line froth image analysis directly from a video camera conclude the issue. Judging from the lecture room, which was overcrowded up to the very last presentation in the Mineral Processing Fundamentals session on Frothing in Flotation, this is a very important topic in today's flotation-related research. We hope that this compendium will fulfill its goals by generating new ideas in researching this important but complex topic of flotation froth.
