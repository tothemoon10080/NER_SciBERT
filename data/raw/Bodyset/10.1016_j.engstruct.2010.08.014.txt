Asymmetric DCB specimens (ADCB), in which the crack plane is out of the laminate midplane, are simple and useful test configurations to produce a mixed mode load state at the crack tip of the samples. This test configuration is as simple as pure mode I tests. However, the analytical procedures developed in the ASTM D5528-01 standard to calculate

                  These formulations have been validated by means of FE modelling for different crack plane positions.

A good agreement was found among the different analytical, empirical, and numerical methods studied in this paper.Delamination is the most common failure found in composite laminates. The onset and growth of delamination is usually characterized by means of the energy release rate Mixed mode fracture is another field of increasing interest. In this case, more than one load mode is present in the sample, usually modes I and II. In 1988, Reeder and Crews developed a method in order to test mixed modes I and II. This test fixture was called Mixed Mode Bending (MMB). These authors first published their work in a NASA technical report in 1988 In this work, a simple test configuration is used as an alternative to the MMB test. This configuration consists of an ADCB specimen where the crack plane is out of the midplane ( Mangalgiri et al. In the present work, the ADCB specimen was studied in order to develop an empirical equation to determine Multiple sample configurations with different crack plane positions ( From these results, an empirical equation was derived that allows the calculation of In the Two-Step Method, the crack path is modelled using pairs of coincident nodes. The forces at the crack tip are calculated in the first step when the load reaches a critical value. The imposed displacement in the sample is then held and the coupled DOFs of the nodes at the crack tip are released in the second step (       The ASTM D5528-01 standard       Eq. A calibration parameter For a DCB test specimen, For the ADCB specimen where the crack is out of the midplane, the calculation cannot be performed as a perfect built-in beam. One possible approach to determine The compliance can be written as And finally, In the MBT theory,  The ADCB specimen was modelled by means of an ANSYS The dimensions of the samples: thickness length initial crack length ( Numerical models with different crack plane positions  Under these conditions, we can write: Different combinations of  This plot is similar to an ellipse, so we can write: The ellipse semi-axes:   If we set, for example, As we can see in this table, the adjustment is very good near the midplane (  Now, as we can see in this table, there is a better agreement when the crack plane moves away from the midplane ( This comparison is based on the experimental and theoretical results obtained in the study of a 16-ply unidirectional E-glass/epoxy laminate, developed by Ducept et al. In this table, the relation between  As we can see in This difference can be possibly attributed to the compliance of the testing devices as found in a previous work The ADCB test configuration constitutes an alternative test to evaluate mixed mode fracture toughness. This test configuration is simpler than the classical MMB method. Nevertheless, it is necessary to prepare samples with different crack plane positions in order to study different percentages of mode I and mode II loads at the crack tip. The empirical formulation has been validated in this work by means of mechanical tests performed on glass fibre and carbon fibre epoxy laminates. Nevertheless, this formulation is valid for other materials and other initial crack lengths or sample dimensions. An empirical formulation was developed to determine
