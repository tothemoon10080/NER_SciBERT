Poly(ethylene brassylate) (PEB) is a biodegradable polyester that nowadays is of particular interest owing to its poly(ε-caprolactone)-like properties (with a T

                     m at 70°C) and the low-cost of its monomer. However, it is not simple to achieve high molar masses with conventional catalysts. In this work, high molar mass PEBs, characterized by SEC-MALS, were successfully synthesized using triphenyl bismuth (Ph3Bi) as catalyst. Then, with the aim of evaluating the impact of the molecular weight on the physical properties, several PEBs ranging from 27 to 247kgmol−1 were prepared. It was demonstrated that above a M
                     w of 90Kgmol−1, PEB behaved in a constant manner. PEBs with lower molecular weight (<46Kgmol−1) showed lower values of T
                     g (~(−35°C)) and presented a melting peak that was split into three or four different peaks while their crystallites started to melt earlier (at ~30°C). In addition, these PEBs were more sensitive to thermal degradation (two additional stages of degradation were observed) and, what is more important, were found to be prone to brittle fracture. As the M
                     w rose, the PEB samples became more ductile and those PEBs with a molecular weight above 90Kgmol−1 possessed deformation at break values higher than 800%, secant modulus in the 296–324 range and ultimate tensile strength of >20MPa.Ethylene brassylate, also known as ethylene tridecanedioate, is a 17 member ring lactone with two ester groups. It is a colorless to very pale yellow viscous liquid with a sweet musk-like odor ( The ring-opening polymerization of ethylene brassylate was first reported by Kobayashi in 1999 ( If you look for information of commercial polymers, you will find that they are graded according to molecular weight. However, all synthetic polymers are polydisperse in that they contain polymer chains of unequal length, so that there is no single value for the molecular weight – the polymer exists as a distribution of chain lengths and molecular weights. Since changes in the molecular weight distribution are responsible for the differing behavior of the polymers, understanding their properties requires knowledge of their chain length. The average molecular masses should be taken into consideration when designing a polymer because it affects its physical properties ( The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of the molecular weight on the physical properties of poly(ethylene brassylate) homopolymers. To this end, several PEBs were synthesized using triphenyl bismuth as catalyst. The number average molecular weight ( Ethylene brassylate monomer (assay >95%) was provided by Sigma Aldrich (W354309). The triphenyl bismuth (Ph A series of poly(ethylene brassylate)s of different molecular weight were synthesized in bulk by one-pot one-step ring-opening polymerizations (ROP) (see After the corresponding reaction time the products were dissolved in chloroform and precipitated, pouring the polymer solution into an excess of methanol in order to remove the catalyst impurities and those monomers that had not reacted. Finally, the product was dried at room temperature and then subjected to a heat treatment at 140 The catalyst could affect, to a certain extent, the properties of the polymers (such as the chain microstructure or the thermal properties). Hence, a poly(ethylene brassylate) with a weight average molecular weight of 32 The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography–Size Exclusion Chromatography (GPC–SEC) with a Waters 1515 GPC device equipped with two Styragel columns (10 The refractive index increment (dn/dc) was measured by means of an Optilal Rex differential refractometer (RI, Wyatt Technology) at 35 For the SEC-MALS analysis, the dried polymers were dissolved in THF at 5.0 The crystallization behavior and the thermal properties of the polymers were studied on a DSC 2920 (TA Instruments). Samples of 6–9 Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) data were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer operating at 30 Thermal degradation of PEBs was studied under nitrogen by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) into a TGA model Q50-0545 (TA Instruments). Samples of 10–15 200–300 The mechanical properties were determined by tensile tests with an Instron 5565 testing machine at a crosshead displacement rate of 20 Dynamic mechanical measurements were carried out in duplicate using a DMA/SDTA861  As can be seen in In this section the crystallization and melting behavior of the PEBs from The DSC heating curves obtained after the cooling treatments were virtually identical for each polymer, all of them having practically the same melting temperatures and enthalpies ( The diffraction data of the samples were fitted using the FULLPROF program ( Two different kinds of curves were found after evaluating the DSC scans in With regard to the melting temperatures of the PEBs, these vary from 68.1 Due to the elevated crystalline fraction of these semi-crystalline polymers, the glass transition temperatures became more difficult to distinguish in the DSC curves. According to literature (  DSC analysis was carried out on the PEB films before performing mechanical tests at 21  The mechanical behavior of these polymers at 37 In conclusion, according to this study it can be said that above a DMA measurements were carried out in duplicate with the PEB films, at the same time the values of storage modulus, loss modulus and tangent of phase angle (tan  Higher values of loss modulus, such as those of PEB 27 or PEB 32TBD, suggests the presence of a more rigid amorphous phase ( Poly(ethylene brassylate) (PEB) is a little-known polyester that is of particular interest in the medical field and for green applications owing to the low cost of its monomer in comparison to other lactones and macrolactones. The crystal structure of ethylene brassylate is orthorhombic with parameters In this work several PEBs were synthesized using triphenyl bismuth (as catalyst) and different contents of 1-hexanol were added, this allows the creation of homopolymers with molecular weights between 27 and 247 According to this study, it can be concluded that above a Beside these Ph The authors are thankful for funds from the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
