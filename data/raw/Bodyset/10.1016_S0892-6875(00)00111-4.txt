The present work deals with new developments in calculating the performance of closed crushing circuits (regular and reverse). In previous works, some simple equations describing these circuits were derived. Here, these equations are interrelated to newly derived ones. The relationships are suitable for the construction of nomographs. The use of these nomographs facilitates calculations of circulating load and screen efficiency (undersize recovery). They can be used for the selection of crushing and sizing equipment. The procedure gives accurate and simple prediction of the circulating load without knowing any of the initially proposed equations. Test cases illustrate the above findings.
