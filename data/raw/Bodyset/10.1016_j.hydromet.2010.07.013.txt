In acidic ferric chloride solutions, Fe3+ is oxidant and Cl− is complexant, which would accelerate the dissolution of metallic copper. Based on the thermodynamic analysis, the dissolution of metallic copper in acidic solutions containing ferric chloride was investigated in detail. The related parameters such as pH, ferric chloride concentration, excess Cl− concentration, stirring speed, solid/liquid ratio and temperature were systematically studied. The dissolution rate of copper increased significantly as the pH value decreased from 2 to 0. The presence of FeCl3 accelerates significantly the dissolution of copper. Increasing stirring speed from 150 to 400rpm and increasing temperature from 1 to 50°C enhanced the dissolution rate of copper remarkably. Increasing solid/liquid ratio from 0.001 to 0.004g/mL decreased the dissolution rate. Excess Cl− concentration, which comes from the addition of NaCl, had a slight effect on the dissolution of metallic copper. The copper dissolution rate in acidic solutions of FeCl3 fits the following conversion-time expression:

The activation energy was found to be 24.9kJ/mol and inward diffusion was considered to the rate-controlling step.Metallic copper is known as one of the most widely used metals in the world in various areas of industry and technology due to its special properties such as high thermal and electrical conductivity, excellent ductility and resistance to corrosion. Considerable researches had been conducted on the dissolution of metallic copper over the past decades of years ( Ferric ion, which is one of the most important oxidative agents in leaching process, is mostly provided by ferric chloride or ferric sulfate. Compared with ferric sulfate, ferric chloride is not only easily available, but it also is the source of Cl In this investigation, the dissolution behaviors of copper in acidic solutions with and without the addition of ferric chloride were studied using metallic copper powder. The effects of pH, temperature, stirring speed and solid/liquid ratio as well as the concentration of ferric chloride and excess Cl All the chemicals in the experiments were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co, Ltd and were used without further purification. The solutions used in each experiment were prepared using sodium chloride and anhydrous ferric chloride. Finally the pH of the solution was adjusted with 1 The dissolution experiments were carried out in a 1000 In order to investigate the role of FeCl The Cu Cu Hence, in the whole dissolution process of metallic copper in FeCl The effect of pH on dissolution kinetics of the copper powder was investigated in the pH range of 0–2 under the following conditions: 0.1 The metallic copper could be solubilized in acidic solutions of NaCl due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in solutions. However, the dissolution kinetics is limited because of the relatively low solubility of molecular oxygen in acidic solutions of NaCl. Addition of FeCl According to the thermodynamic analysis, Cl Usually, agitation of the sample solution could improve the mass transfers and accelerate the dissolution of copper powder. In order to investigate the effect of stirring speed on the copper dissolution, experiments were carried out at different stirring rates (namely 150, 300, 400 and 500 The effect of solid/liquid ratio (S/L) on the dissolution of copper was investigated in the range of 0.001–0.004 The effect of temperature on the dissolution rate of copper was also investigated in the range of 1–50 The dissolution of metallic copper in acidic solutions of FeCl Eq. In this work, the dissolution behaviors of copper in acidic ferric chloride solutions have been investigated. Ferric chloride plays a very important role in accelerating the dissolution of metallic copper, which tends to function both as an oxidant and a complexant. Increasing ferric chloride concentration, temperature and decreasing solid/liquid ratio and low pH would enhance the dissolution of metallic copper.
