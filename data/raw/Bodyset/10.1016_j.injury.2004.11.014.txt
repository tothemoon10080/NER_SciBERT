Kennedy et al. An alternative explanation is the study, design and size, which is inadequate to detect clinically important differences in outcome. Table 1 shows that plain X-ray classification was matched approximately, but comminution was not. All operatively treated fractures were Sanders Type III, but 29% of those managed conservatively were not. The data presented in Table 2 allow a power calculation in the arbitrary but conventional two-sided significance test at 80% power. A study designed to detect a clinically significant change from 20 to 25 points in the AFASS score would require 32 patients per group. Similarly, to detect a true difference in the function domain between 25 and 30 of the 50 available points would require 22 patients per group. The most relevant domain of the SF-36 may be the physical functioning. To detect a true difference between 8% in one group and 10% in another (of the maximum 25% available) would require 50 in each group. With the outcome measures used, a considerably large study would have been required to detect clinically important differences between treatment methods. The conclusion that there is no significant outcome difference between conservative and surgical treatment of calcaneal fractures cannot be supported from the data presented.
