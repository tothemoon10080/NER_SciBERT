Due to a poor communication between two of the authors, the results reported and discussed in the paper are not based on the size measurements (as stated in the Results section) but on the roundness of the particles. This of course produced a number of inaccuracies in the manuscript. The authors wish to correct the following errors in the published paper mentioned above. Page 835, Abstract, lines 11 and 12 should read: Quantitative analysis of the wear particles showed that particles generated in serum with sodium azide were not morphologically different from those produced in serum with ProClin 300. Page 835, Abstract, the last sentence should be deleted. Page 837, 2.5. SEM and morphologies analysis, the last sentence should read: Then the micrograph was converted to a binary picture; afterwards, the binary picture was processed by an image analysis program (Image ProPlus vers. 4.5, Media Cybernetics, USA) that counted the particles and provided a list of some descriptors of each particles as area (A), elongation, length, and so on. Page 838, Results, the last sentence should read: Page 838, Discussion, line 10, 1996 should be deleted. Page 840, Page 841, Discussion, lines 1–8 should read: these large particles could be the result of the comminution of the fibrils forming agglomerates as combinations of various particle types, in agreement with the observation of other authors (Calonius O, Saikko V. Analysis of polyethylene particles produced in different wear conditions in vitro. Clin Orthop Rel Res 2002;399:219–230). Page 841, Discussion, lines 23 and 24 should read: from 0.2 Page 841, Conclusions, lines 2 and 3: (lubricant LSA) should be deleted. Finally, we want to thank our esteemed colleague Vesa Saikko who was the first to report to us some in congruencies with the paper. We apologise to the readers of
