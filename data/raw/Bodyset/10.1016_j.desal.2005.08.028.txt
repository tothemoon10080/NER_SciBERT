Usually, the recovery of metals from ore follows a flow sheet which includes the leaching operation, the filtration and the purification concentration. However, in this work a new processing method is described. It is an electromembrane process where the ore is inserted between two membranes. It is shown that an application of a current density gives rise to an efficiency recovery of copper using ion exchange membranes.
