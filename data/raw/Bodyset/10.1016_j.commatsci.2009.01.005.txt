This work compares the numerical determination of the strain energy release rate in mode I for the interlaminar fracture of composite laminates by means of two different models: the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) and the two-step extension method. Results were compared with empirical data obtained from double cantilever beam (DCB) tests carried out on unidirectional AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminates. The study showed that, in a pure mode I state, results obtained via the two-step method were in agreement with a straightforward calculation of the elastic energy variation in the system. Results from VCCT calculations were slightly lower than those obtained through the two-step method using four node elements in plane strain. As expected, results from both models converge as element length decreases.Due to their great potential in weight saving, high stiffness and strength, many composite structures in the aerospace industry are made of composite laminates. Crack propagation between plies is the most commonly observed damage in this kind of materials due to their laminated structure. Over the last years, an extensive work has been developed in order to predict the delamination onset and crack growth by means of experimental tests and computational fracture mechanics. Some authors have extended this laboratory approach to predict failure in composite structures and components Finite Element Modelling has arisen as a useful technique for studying fracture problems from a theoretical point of view. Several methods are documented in the literature for computing the strain energy release rate ( Regarding the experimental point of view, double cantilever beam specimens (DCB) have been widely used to measure the mode I critical energy release rate ( In these tests, linear elastic behaviour is assumed in the calculation of In the DCB test, as the delamination grows from the insert, Therefore, fibre bridging is considered as a characteristic feature of unidirectional DCB specimens as far as this mechanism is not observed in multi-angle ply laminates. Propagation values of This paper deals with both numerical and experimental determination of This analytical method is the most widely used approach for predicting failure in composite structures based on fracture mechanics. The method has been successfully used to predict delamination onset and growth in flat laminates with an embedded delamination This method assumes the following hypotheses: When a crack is extended by a length, the energy released is identical to the energy required to close the crack. When the crack extends a length, being small enough compared to the crack length, the stress state at the crack tip does not change significantly during crack propagation.  The energy release rate is then calculated in the same step by means of the force at the crack tip and the displacement of the released nodes. This process is shown in Assuming the above hypotheses, when a crack of initial length       The suffix As modes Iâ€“III energy release rate components can be computed in a generalized load state, different global failure criteria can be established Based on experimental results, Mikulik et al. The crack path is modelled using pairs of coincident nodes, as in the VCCT method. Now, however, the model is loaded and the forces at the crack tip are calculated in the first step. The imposed displacement in the sample is then held and the coupled DOFs of the nodes at the crack tip are released in the second step (see The energy release rate is then calculated using the following expressions: As in the VCCT method, the suffix The material used in this study was a Hexcel AS4/8552 6 The mechanical properties of the laminate are reported in Double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens were prepared to carry out mode I fracture tests following ASTM standard D 5528-01. The DCB specimen, shown in Opening forces are applied to the specimen by means of a pair of hinges bonded to one end of the specimen. The applied force ( A travelling optical microscope was used to measure the crack length during the test. The delamination process was characterized by means of the energy release rate ( Linear elastic behaviour is assumed in the calculation of Three data reduction methods were used to calculate The modified beam theory (MBT) method: The compliance calibration (CC) method: The modified compliance calibration (MCC) method:        Five samples were tested on an MTS testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 A commercial FEM package (Ansys 8.0) was used to simulate mode I facture tests. A number of FEM models were built to evaluate model sensitivity to certain variables: Element type. Element size. Geometry type (2D/3D). The following elements were tested in different runs: Plane42: 4-node 2D solid element with two degrees of freedom at each node (translations in the nodal Plane82: 8-node 2D solid element with two degrees of freedom at each node (translations in the nodal Solid95: 20-node 3D solid element with three degrees of freedom at each node (translations in the nodal Solid191: 20-node 3 D layered solid element with three degrees of freedom at each node (translations in the nodal Following the experimental procedure, a load per unit width of 137.9  As can be seen from these results, all the elements used to model the loading step gave similar results. The numerical models gave results that were 25% stiffer than the experimental tests. Certain factors, in both the experimental and numerical models, could explain this mismatch. From the numerical point of view, a linear elastic model was chosen, whereas some degree of non-linearity is present in the real material. On the other hand, the measurement of the displacement could be influenced to some extent by the compliance of the testing machine.  As can be seen in these figures, the highest stress level area is wider in the middle of the crack front. Thus, the crack tends to be deeper in the middle part inside the sample. This observation is in agreement with experimental results, where the onset of non-linearity (NL) in the load versus opening displacement plot usually gives results of As the 2D and 3D models gave similar results in the preliminary runs, it was decided to use 2D models (Plane42 elements in plane strain) to study the crack opening process due to computational time-saving considerations. A number of models were accordingly built with increasing element length to model the test. The critical load obtained in the experimental tests was applied to the model. In a second step, as discussed above, the crack was allowed to grow while maintaining the displacement at the ends of the sample. The energy release rate was then calculated through VCCT and two-step methods. The obtained results are shown in Where     As can be seen in this table, FEM results were 30% lower than experimental results. This difference is similar to the difference observed between numerical and experimental displacement in the preliminary calibration runs ( Furthermore, it can be seen that the two-step results are coincident with those derived from the elastic energy decrease in the system, which can be easily calculated using the Ansys code.  As can be seen, VCCT gives lower results than the two-step method. This is because the node where the force is calculated in the VCCT method is placed one element length further (due to the crack opening) than in the two-step method, thus giving rise to a slightly more flexible model. It can also be observed in the above figure that the VCCT method is more sensitive to element size than the two-step method. Furthermore, as expected, both models converge as the element length decreases. Finite Element Modelling has arisen as a useful technique for studying fracture problems from a theoretical point of view. As discussed above, FEM models can help to validate experimental results. In a pure mode I state, the two-step method gives results that are in agreement with the calculation of the elastic energy change in the system. The VCCT method furnishes slightly lower results than the two-step method for the selected four node element in plane strain. On the other hand, the two-step method is less sensitive to element size. Furthermore, as expected, both models tend to converge as element length decreases.
