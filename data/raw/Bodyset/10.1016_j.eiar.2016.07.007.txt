In recent years, several tools have been used to define and quantify the environmental impacts associated with an event; however, a lack of uniform approaches for conducting environmental evaluations has been revealed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the Life Cycle Assessment methodology, which is rarely applied to an event, can be an appropriate tool for calculating the environmental impacts associated with the assembly, disassembly, and use phase of an event analysing in particular the components and the displays used to establish the exhibits. The aim is also to include the issues reported by ISO 20121:2012 involving the interested parties that can be monitored but also affected by the event owner, namely the event organiser, the workforce and the supply chain.
                  A small event held in Northern Italy was selected as the subject of the research. The results obtained show that the main contributors are energy consumption for lighting and heating and the use of aluminium materials, such as bars for supporting the spotlights, carpet and the electronic equipment. A sensitivity analysis for estimating the effects of the impact assessment method chosen has also been conducted and an uncertainty analysis has been performed using the Monte Carlo technique. This study highlighted the importance of the energy consumed by heating and lighting on the environmental implications, and indicated that the preparation and assembly should always be considered when quantifying the environmental profile of an event.In 2014, 2321 exhibitions were organised in Europe, involving 735 organisers, 659,335 exhibitors, 64.6 million visitors, and 24.7 In addition, the event sector, which is known to have negative environmental influences ( The environmental burdens of events have also been investigated using the ecological footprint: In parallel, other studies have explored the participation of key stakeholders ( The recognition of the importance of sustainability in the event industry is also confirmed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which published a specific standard in 2012: ISO 20121:2012 “Event Sustainability Management Systems - Requirements with guidance for use” ( In the event sector, the LCA methodology have been used in several studies: However, there remains a lack of uniform and shared approaches to analyse the environmental impacts of an event, in spite of the concern already expressed by In this context, this study evaluates whether the LCA methodology, which has been developed for products, processes and services ( Thus, this study aims to evaluate the contributions of several components that are often used to set up an event including the environmental issues reported by ISO 20121 ( The subject of this research was a trade fair, given the importance of this kind of event in the market as highlighted by The methodology applied to quantify the environmental impact associated with the selected event is LCA, in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 Standards ( A dimension that is not included in this analysis is the environmental burdens associated with visitors when travelling to the event and the related waste produced. This contribution, which is estimated to cover 54% of the total ecological footprint of an event, as quantified in a previous study by The main goal of this LCA is to analyse the entire event (i.e. 120 exhibits over 3 The realisation of the selected event occurs in four stages. During the organisation stage, the space is distributed; this distribution is accomplished by defining the volume and area of the stands using scotch tape and some plastic panels to arrange the exhibited content. In the assembly stage, different pieces are fitted together by assemblers to obtain the structures of the stands. The lighting equipment is assembled; the carpet is set down using scotch tape; the stands are assembled with display panels, chairs, and tables; the electrical system is prearranged; and the area is cleaned. During the utilisation stage, the stands are heated, and the exhibitors are helped via logistics activities. In the dismantling stage, the stands are disassembled, and the area is cleaned again. The functional unit used, in line with the aim of the research, is preparing and holding an event, lasting three days, with 120 exhibitors and with 11,600 The system boundaries ( The impacts of on-site facilities construction are omitted, due to a lack of data and the relatively small impact on the result, in line with For the analysis of the event under study, the main data are primary and referred to the selected case; they were mainly collected during the four steps of life cycle considered: organisation, assembly, public opening, and dismantling. During the organisation stage, the space is distributed; this distribution is accomplished by defining the volume and area of the stands using scotch tape and some plastic panels to arrange the exhibited content. The main energy consumption is due to the activation of the electronic equipment and to lighting. Some scraps are produced which end-of-life scenario is obtained by the analysis of the waste reports of the event owner. With reference to the end-of-life scenario of the scraps from the packages of scotch tape and plastic panel, the treatment scenario has been hypothesized based on national statistics ( In this phase the lighting equipment is assembled and this entails energy consumption for lighting and the activation of the machines used (about 604 The amount of bars, carpet, scotch tape, electrical panels, wires, spotlights, chairs, tables, display panels and adhesive vinyl are primary data collected directly during the operations and are summarized in columns 2 and 3 of During the public opening, the event organizer makes several forklifts available to the exhibitors for the internal transports of chairs, tables, panels and other materials useful during the event. Diesel and electric forklifts are used, which consume 104 In this phase, the stands are disassembled and successively, the area is cleaned using sweeper machines. The lighting consumption, measured through specific counters is equal to 7360 The impact assessment method chosen is the ReCiPe 2008 methodology ( A sensitivity analysis for estimating the effects of the impact assessment method chosen on the outcomes of this study is conducted by applying an alternative one, as performed by The nomenclature used to report the outcomes of this study is presented in As shown in The results of the sensitivity analysis with a different impact assessment method, namely Impact 2002 The most important contributors on the main impact categories calculated using the ReCiPe 2008 method are shown in These main contributions, revealed through the application of ReCiPe 2008, emerge also through the application of the Impact 2002 However, in the study developed by In the study conducted by On the contrary, the results of our study highlight different contributions, which in other applications were considered negligible because covered by the impacts caused by visitors or participants. The results of our study indeed allow exploring the possible improvement that can be implemented by the event owner or by the event organizers, moving the attention from the participants to the event responsible, which should firstly have the task to reduce the impact of the event. Indeed, in this case, the results obtained led the event owner setting two objectives of improvement. The first objective was the reduction of the energy consumption for lighting, through the designing of a new energy-efficient lighting and through the activation of a consumption monitoring system. The second objective was the reduction of the consumption of carpet and thus the related landfill disposal designing new stands with lower amount of carpet and activating a specific consumption monitoring system. The literature usually refers to the term event as any type of organised action ( By investigating the impacts associated with a small event, this study highlighted the effectiveness of LCA application, in line with The sensitivity analysis confirmed the results of the life cycle impact assessment phase and revealed no significant influence associated with applying the impact assessment method selected. However, an important dimension that was not included in the assessment is the participants' behaviour. Further studies will be conducted to include visitors' travel within the system boundaries and verify whether the application of LCA methodology can lead to results comparable with the literature results. Further research should be performed to quantify whether similar results can be obtained by analysing different types of events, such as concerts or sport events, and whether significant inconsistencies can arise due to the event size, the geographical location, and the season during which an exhibition is held.
