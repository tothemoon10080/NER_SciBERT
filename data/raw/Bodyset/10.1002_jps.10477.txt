This work reports on the crystal structures of two dioxane solvates of paracetamol that are true polymorphs. The high temperature phase is an orthorhombic form, space group Pbca, Z = 8, a = 12.6078(3) Å, b = 12.1129(2) Å, c = 13.4138(3) Å, V = 2048.52(7) Å3, (at 295K) and the low temperature form is monoclinic, space group P21/c, Z = 4, a = 12.325(6) Å, b = 11.965(4) Å, c = 13.384(6) Å, β = 92.01°, V = 1972.6(14)Å3 (at 123K). The structures of these polymorphs are described as is the interrelationship between the two structures. In addition to the structural interrelationship, it is shown that the two forms undergo a reversible phase transformation. Desolvation of either form generates the stable monoclinic phase of paracetamol. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 92:2069–2073, 2003
