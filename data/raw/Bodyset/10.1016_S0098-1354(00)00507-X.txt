The Internet is changing the way we think and act in the world of manufacturing. Gone are the days when plants operated in a vacuum with a set number of local suppliers and distributors. The Internet is making the manufacturing world truly global, connecting buyers and sellers from around the world in all aspects of their business. With business to business e-commerce expecting to top $1.3 trillion by 2003, the Internet is a key driving force in the new millennium as manufacturers strive to optimize their supply chain. An example of this evolutionary change in the world of manufacturing is the web community MyPlant.com (www.myplant.com). Unique to the Internet, MyPlant.com focuses on knowledge-based solutions for the process industries, which include oil refining, oil and gas, petrochemical, chemical, pulp and paper, pharmaceutical, minerals processing, power generation, and food processing industries. MyPlant.com provides value to the plant-centric industries by offering innovative tools and interactivity to access a wide range of knowledge and solutions to overcome industry problems. This paper discusses how the Internet is changing the business paradigm in the process industries. Key industry trends are discussed and examples given on expected changes in the coming years ahead. And how if manufacturers today don't consider their Internet strategy as a top priority they will soon lose any competitive edge.
