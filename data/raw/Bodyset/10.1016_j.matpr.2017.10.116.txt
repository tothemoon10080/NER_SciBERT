The aim of this project is to study and evaluate the effect of reheat treatment conditions on microstructural refurbishment in cast nickel base superalloy, MGA 1400. This cast nickel base superalloy is used as a turbine blade material in Japanese gas turbine engines. The evaluated reheat treatment process consists of a solution treatment at 1125°C, 1150°C and 1175°C for 4 hours and followed by 1) final precipitation aging at 845°C for 25 hours or 2) primary aging at 925°C for 2 hours and secondary aging at 845°C for 25 hours. All reheat treated microstructures were investigated and analyzed by SEM and image analysis program. From all obtained results, it was found that at temperature of 1125°C for 4 hours followed by single precipitation aging at 845°C for 25 hours (without 2-steps aging) provides the best microstructural characteristics, which consists of the most uniform distribution of very dense gamma prime particles precipitating with its proper size and shape in the gamma matrix.
