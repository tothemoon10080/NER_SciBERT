I read with interest the article by Ahuja and Chatterji Firstly the Johansson classification system Secondly in the treatment of type III, are those in where the fracture is entirely distal to the tip of the prosthesis, Johansson et al. In conclusion, the importance of prosthesis stability should not be underestimated. Careful evaluation of the prosthesis stability and revision to a long stem prosthesis (bypassing the most distal fracture line by at least two femoral diameters) when the original stem is unstable should therefore be considered
