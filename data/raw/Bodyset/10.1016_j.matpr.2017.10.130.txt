Melt quality control of cast iron is normally conducted by the Optical Emission Spectrometry (OES). This technique determines the chemical composition of iron melt allowing the chemical adjustment before pouring. In this study, the thermal analysis system has been developed to predict the chemical composition in the iron melt. The principle of the technique is the implementation of the characteristics of the cooling curves of sampled iron to correlate with the compositions. Furthermore, the technique can provide additional information such as cooling rate and undercooling in which can be correlated to percent carbon, percent silicon and percent magnesium. In this paper, the correlations between characteristics of the cooling curves and carbon (3.0-3.8%), silicon (1.5-2.5%), carbon equivalent, magnesium (0-0.060%) and nodularity were discussed. Empirical equations were proposed and used for encoding the prototype software.
