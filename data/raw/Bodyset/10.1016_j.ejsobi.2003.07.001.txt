Different explanations have been proposed for why terrestrial isopods prefer, and gain from, feeding on microbially inoculated food materials. In the present study, no-choice feeding experiments are used to test three contrasting, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses. (1) The digestion and nutritional utilization of microbial cells enhance the nutritive value of leaf litter; (2) extracellular digestive enzymes of microbial origin promote digestion of leaf litter; (3) leaf litter-colonizing microbiota serve as indicators for easily digestible leaf litter of high nutritive value. Predictions derived from these hypotheses are compared with the results of a study with experimentally manipulated leaf litter, serving as food sources for the common woodlouse Porcellio scaber. Leaf litter-colonizing microbiota increased consumption of leaf litter by isopods and contributed somewhat to biomass gain of isopods, but not to the assimilation of ingested food. Thus, the present results coincide with predictions derived from hypothesis (3) suggesting that leaf litter-colonizing microbiota stimulate consumption by indicating high food quality. Their positive effects on assimilation and growth, however, are context-specific, being stronger in case of high-quality food than in case of low-quality food.Isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea) enhance the decomposition rate of leaf litter directly and indirectly On the other hand, isopods gain from feeding on microbially inoculated leaf litter Based on this, two hypotheses explaining the preference of isopods for microbially inoculated leaf litter arise: (1) the digestion and nutritional utilization of microbial cells enhance the nutritive value of leaf litter; (2) extracellular digestive enzymes of microbial origin promote digestion of leaf litter during the gut passage. Digestion and nutritional utilization of microbiota ( The present study was performed to test the above contrasting, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses that explain why terrestrial isopods gain from feeding on microbially inoculated food materials. Predictions derived from these hypotheses are compared with the results of a study using experimentally manipulated leaf litter as food sources for Isopods ( During the experiments, isopods ( Only pre-adult individuals with a live mass of 10–20 mg (3–6 mg dry mass) were used for feeding trials, to obtain high consumption and growth rates Leaf litter of oak ( Besides using air-dried and re-wetted (henceforth: “air-dried”) vs. inoculated leaf litter, we further experimentally manipulated microbial and physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter (cf. Food sources were characterized in terms of pH value (3 M KCl), water content (gravimetrically), phenol content (Folin-Ciocalteu assay, as described in A total of 12 different litter materials were offered as food in no-choice feeding experiments. Each food source was offered in amounts that were expected to be consumed by about 80% by the end of the feeding experiment From the data on mass change in isopods, the data for dry mass loss of the food, and the dry mass of daily collected feces, In order to test isopods for direct response to chemical differences between freshly fallen and microbially processed leaf litter, preferences tests based on contact-chemoreception of water-soluble leaf litter compounds were performed using “arched globes” (after Most of the present data were not normally distributed. Consequently, data are presented as median, quartiles and range (minimum–maximum), and predominantly non-parametric statistics were used for comparison of data sets. Multivariate comparison was performed with Kruskal–Wallis For further statistical analysis, an ANCOVA approach was chosen, because the litter pH, serving as covariate here, is known to directly affect isopod nutrition (e.g. Preference tests were analyzed using resampling statistics (poptools: http://www.csiro.au/vbc/poptools) with 9999 iterations, according to As illustrated in Assimilation of oak litter (  ANCOVA ( In preference tests, isopods distinguished between extracts of oak and alder litter by contact chemoreception, preferring the latter one if the leaf litter had been microbially processed ( Isopods exhibit a strong preference for microbially colonized leaf litter Microbial processing of leaf litter prior to ingestion by isopods enhances leaf litter palatability When This study is the first to directly compare predictions derived from different hypotheses on why isopods gain from feeding on microbially inoculated leaf litter with experimental data. From the present results, it is obvious that there is no simple answer to the question of whether leaf litter-colonizing microbiota mainly provide nutrients or enzymes to litter-feeding isopods. Previous findings The tree species from which the leaf litter derived, was the only factor to affect all the tested parameters of nutrition in
