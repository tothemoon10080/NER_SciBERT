Extensive research has been performed previously on assessing the out-of-plane (OOP) seismic performance of unreinforced fired clay brick masonry (URM) walls and the retrofitting of URM load-bearing and infill walls having a solid wall thickness. However, comparatively little research has been performed pertaining to URM walls with cavities (i.e., continuous air gaps separating wythes of brick from one another), despite the prominence of cavity masonry construction in various parts of the world. Hence, research was pursued with an emphasis on efficiently retrofitting URM cavity walls to enable the formation of semi-composite to composite behaviour when such walls were subjected to simulated seismic OOP loading. The research reported herein was based on an experimental testing approach wherein walls were loaded OOP using inflatable airbags. A total of ten tests were performed on nine separate URM cavity walls located in two separate buildings.
                  The outcomes of the research program included determining the behaviour of URM cavity walls in one-way vertical flexure when bordered and when not bordered by rigid moment-resisting reinforced concrete frames; quantifying the improvement in drift levels of cavity walls prior to loss in strength and prior to collapse using a variety of cavity wall ties at different spacing; and establishing an equivalent solid wall thickness for cavity walls with various retrofit tie conditions for use in existing analytical models used to predict the OOP capacity of URM walls.The earthquake vulnerability of buildings constructed using conventional British architecture with unreinforced fired clay brick masonry (URM) prior to the introduction of modern earthquake loading standards is well-known in New Zealand Few earthquake reconnaissance reports have remarked on the performance of URM cavity walls specifically. Following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, it was observed that many URM cavity walls collapsed primarily due to OOP mechanisms resulting from inadequate or absent cavity ties between the inner and outer wythes of masonry Various methods for predicting the OOP behaviour of solid URM walls have been considered previously based on applications of energy dissipation, finite elements, yield lines, failure lines, compressive struts, spring-struts, and rigid bodies Buildings in Australasia with load-bearing URM walls typically have timber diaphragms Note that utilising the full static displacement capacity, Δ URM walls which are confined or bounded by relatively rigid elements, such as steel or reinforced concrete (RC) frames with URM infills, may form an arching mechanism while deforming OOP. Note, however, that RC bond beams or RC slabs in buildings with URM load-bearing cavity walls The specimens tested in this experimental program consisted of nine wall panels in two separate New Zealand buildings located in Auckland [designated as “Auc”, see The test walls were isolated into vertically spanning panels that were restrained at the top and bottom only. Each test wall had a base length of 1200 In the Hastings building, test wall Has-W5 was tested with only in situ ties, while all other test walls were retrofitted using 12 All test walls rested on a reinforced concrete slab or grade beam. Test walls having the top row of bricks removed and replaced with a lateral restraint consisting of timber framing (referred to as a “propped” restraint herein) were assumed to have no arching action and be representative of upper-storey walls in buildings with timber roof framing providing little to no overburden load. Test walls wherein the masonry abutted a top edge restraint consisting of a RC beam (referred to as a “rigid” restraint herein) were assumed to form arching mechanisms during loading and be representative of walls in a typical infill configuration within a RC frame. Note that the number of existing Warrington tie legs as listed in Properties pertaining to the retrofit cavity tie types shown in The cavity tie types were tested in direct tension following installation into URM walls at the Auckland building. These pull-out tests involved the use of a steel V-shaped reaction brace (with a clear span between supports so as to allow conical break-out of the masonry), hand-actuated pump, and digital load measuring cell. The results from these pull-out tests are summarised in All test walls were loaded by gradually inflating one vinyl airbag located near the centre of each wall, creating a loaded area that had dimensions of approximately 1150 The instrumentation used to measure the OOP displacement of each test wall was generally placed on an isolated frame located on the opposite side of the wall to where loading was applied (see Undamaged brick and mortar samples were extracted from the test walls in the two buildings and tested in accordance with ASTM standards All test walls were laterally loaded semi-cyclically at a quasi-static loading rate. The maximum lateral-force value (expressed as an acceleration with respect to gravity, g) for each wall was generally determined by dividing the maximum total test lateral force, The idealised trilinear force-displacement curves as shown in The idealised trilinear curves from Per Per Per For walls with propped top edge restraints and without arching action, both the lateral force and displacement capacities increased when retrofitted using cavity ties of increasingly larger diameter at the same spacing [see Walls with propped top edge restraints and without arching action consistently reached their maximum force capacity at a drift of approximately 1.2% [see both charts in Maximum measured lateral deformations at the top and bottom boundaries of any test wall were 11.0% and 1.9% as large, respectively, as the corresponding wall mid-height lateral deformation (both measurements being associated with Has-W3). Lateral deformations at the top of retrofitted test walls with rigid top edge restraints ranged between 6.4%–7.4% of the corresponding wall mid-height lateral deformations (Has-W1, W2, and W6). Differential lateral deformation between the two URM wythes in the walls tested with only in situ cavity ties ranged between 6.2%–7.2% of the corresponding wall mid-height deformation (Auc-W1A and Has-W5). In comparison, differential lateral deformation between the two URM wythes was lower in test walls retrofitted with cavity ties, ranging between 1.3%–3.9% of the corresponding wall mid-height deformation (Auc-W1B, W2, and W3). During testing, cavity tie shear deformation was visually apparent in the 4 For each test wall having the test condition shown in The loaded wall area was always shorter than the full wall height (see The loaded wall area was not always centred on the wall height; and The test wall heights, The results of this conversion from the test scenario to the assessment scenario for all of the walls tested are summarised in An understanding of how the measured wall capacities compare to design earthquake demands in regions of varying seismicities is useful to structural engineering practitioners. Short-period ( Auckland: Hastings: The estimated capacity/demand (C/D) ratios for four different assessment scenarios are summarised in In accordance with the values shown in Note that the C/D ratios listed in The experimentally measured force and displacement capacities for the six cavity walls tested in vertical flexure with propped top supports are summarised in The experimentally measured force capacities for the four cavity walls tested with rigid top supports are summarised in The results in URM cavity walls with arching action are more sensitive to the assumed equivalent wall thickness based on the parameters in the considered models. Walls with arching action have an expected OOP force capacity per the Angel et al. The study reported herein sought to address the paucity of information available on the out-of-plane (OOP) response of URM cavity wall construction, addressing both as-built and retrofitted wall conditions. Significant results that can be drawn from this research program are as follows: URM walls which are confined or bounded by relatively rigid elements, such as steel or reinforced concrete (RC) frames with URM infills, may form an arching mechanism while deforming OOP which will likely increase the OOP capacity of vertically-spanning infill walls as compared to URM walls without OOP arching mechanisms (see Displacement-based performance criteria (with appropriate capacity-reduction factors as proposed by Derakhshan et al. URM cavity walls without arching action at all storey levels and walls with arching action at higher storey levels are susceptible to OOP strength exceedance when subjected to DBE demands in regions of either moderate seismicity (e.g., Auckland) or high seismicity (e.g., Hastings) (see Existing OOP assessment methods may be viable for assessing cavity walls in vertical flexure provided that the equivalent solid wall thickness is determined firstly. However, the determined equivalent solid wall thickness is only directly applicable to the analytical model being considered (see Cavity tie retrofits with adequate spacing, as well as adequate compressive and shear stiffness, can greatly improve the OOP capacity of URM cavity walls, especially for infill walls experiencing OOP arching action (see A large portion of the experimental testing was funded by the
