Numerous light rare earth elements (LREE) minerals containing Fe and P were processed by sulfuric acid roasting method, and the leaching solution mainly comprises LREE sulfate, Fe2(SO4)3, H3PO4, and H2SO4, however, the solubility data of LREE sulfates in this system is few. This work studies the solubility of LREE sulfates in independent LREE sulfate system RE2(SO4)3-Fe2(SO4)3-H3PO4-H2SO4 (RE = La, Ce, Pr or Nd) and mixed LREE sulfates system (La,Ce,Pr,Nd)2(SO4)3-Fe2(SO4)3-H3PO4-H2SO4 at different temperature (25–65 °C) and concentrations of Fe2(SO4)3 (Fe2O3, 0–50.13 g/L), H2SO4 (0.5 mol/L), and H3PO4 (P2O5, 20.34 g/L) based on the industrial operating condition at low liquid and solid ratio 2:1. The solubility of each LREE sulfate in the independent system (La2O3, 12.25–20.88 g/L; CeO2, 41.93–62.35 g/L; Pr6O11, 37.34–56.69 g/L; Nd2O3, 26.60–37.63 g/L) is much higher than that of the mixed system (La2O3, 6.95–11.03 g/L; CeO2, 10.63–21.51 g/L; Pr6O11, 11.56–20.36 g/L; Nd2O3, 12.36–19.79 g/L) under the same other conditions. The results also indicate that, in the two systems, both Fe and the temperature have negative effects on the solubility of LREE sulfates. That may occur due to the complication reactions between the complexes of RESO4
                     + and Fe(SO4)2
                     –. However, the influence degree of temperature and iron concentration on the LREE sulfates solubility varies in the two systems and among different LREE species. This research is of theoretical significance for optimizing the conditions of the sulfuric acid process for recovering the LREE from the mixed LREE bearing minerals as well as the single LREE containing secondary rare earth scraps.Rare earth (RE) elements are a group of metals comprising the lanthanide series, scandium and yttrium. At present, one of the most important RE mineral resources with industrial commercial value is the phosphorous bearing rare earth ore: monazite, mixed type of RE ore (bastnaesite and monazite), the composition of which mainly is LREE. Actually, in the sulfuric acid process phosphorus is one of the main impurity elements in the leaching solution. And iron is commonly used as a phosphorus removal agent in RE hydrometallurgy industry, because the affinity of iron with phosphorus is stronger than that of rare earths.Then additional iron is added in the form of iron concentrate and iron powder in the roasting process or the form of ferric chloride in the water leaching process, to ensure concentration ratio of Fe/P ( Previously, many researchers have made detailed studies on the solubility of RE sulfates in different solution systems as listed in This investigation was undertaken for determining the solubility of LREE sulfates in two solution system: (1) the independent LREE sulfate system RE The individual LREE sulfates La In the industry sulfate roasting method, the conventional leaching liquid-solid ratio ranges from 7:1 to 10:1, but in order to investigate LREE sulfates solubility in the supersaturated solution, we selected the leaching liquid-solid ratio 2:1, under which condition the maincomponents of water leaching solution are Fe Saturated individual or mixed LREE sulfate solutions were prepared by dissolving an excess of individual or mixed LREE sulfates in the nine groups of Fe The concentration of LREE, Fe, and P was determined by ICP-AES, and the concentration of H The calculation of LREE sulfate solubility decrement with improving the temperature or the Fe     The obtained experimental data are shown in And also, Firstly, from the reaction equilibrium point of view, the possible equations of the compositions in this system were written as For H For the Fe However, for LREE sulfates, many researchers had studied the existence form of rare earth complexes in different solutions and conditions With the foundations above, while increasing the concentration of Fe and adding LREE sulfates into the solution, according to the fact that the radius of Fe Also in another point of view, it may be explained by regarding the salting-out effect. Furthermore, based on the data in Such behavior illustrates that, for ferric and individual LREEs sulfate containing solution, the purpose of selective crystallization separation may be achieved by controlling the temperature and Fe content. Especially, it may give guiding significance for sulfuric acid recovery process containing single rare earth secondary resources, such as the NdFeB permanent magnet material. Similar to Section 3.1, As seen from  Using Eqs. These results about the solubility of single LREE sulfate in the mixed rare earth sulfate solution system are of great significance for a deeper understanding of the leaching behavior of rare earth in the industry leaching process of sulfate roasted RE concentrate. Additionally, this study in the mixed LREE sulfates system indicates the possibility to selectively separate individual LREE according to their sensitivity to temperature and iron concentration. The solubilities of LREE sulfates were measured in two different systems at different temperatures (25–65 °C) and concentrations of Fe The results of this study indicate that for the single LREE sulfate systems, preferential crystallization of RE sulfate may be achieved by controlling temperature and iron content. And that shows the significance for RE recovery by the sulfuric acid process from single RE secondary resources such as NdFeB permanent magnet or other rare earth bearing alloy scraps. Moreover, for mixed LREE systems, such as roasted rare earth ore or mixed LREE sulfates containing solutions, it may be possible to selectively separate the individual LREE sulfate according to the different sensitivity of each rare earth sulfate to the temperature and iron concentration.
