The coordination numbers in the Molecular Interaction Volume Model (MIVM) can be calculated from the common physical quantities of pure matters. A significant advantage of the model lies in its ability to predict the thermodynamic properties of quinary liquid alloys using only the binary infinite dilute activity coefficients. The predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data of quinary liquid alloys, which show that the model is reliable, convenient and economic.The thermodynamic properties of multicomponent liquid alloys are important for understanding process metallurgy and the alloying of metals. A great deal of binary data have been so far compiled in monographs The MIVM was obtained from the physical sense of liquid molecular movements in that liquid molecules are not like gas molecules which are being in continuous irregular motion and not like solid ones which are vibrating constantly at one site but are migrating non-randomly from one cell to another. In fact, the magnitude of self-diffusion coefficient, According to the relation between Gibbs energy and partition function, i.e. Suppose that in the liquid mixture It is necessary to determine the coordination numbers of liquid metals for applying MIVM to liquid alloys. For the liquid metal For a binary mixture The activities of components of the quinary liquid alloys Zn–Bi–Cd–Pb–Sn at 877 When Letting the Zn–Bi–Cd–Pb–Sn liquid alloys be the 1–2–3–4–5 system, the activity coefficient of the component 1 of the system can be written from The average relative error The coordination numbers in the MIVM can be calculated from the common physical quantities of pure matters. A significant advantage of the model lies in its ability to predict the thermodynamic properties of quinary liquid alloys using only the binary infinite dilute activity coefficients, and the predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data of quinary liquid alloys. This shows that the model is reliable, convenient and economic.
