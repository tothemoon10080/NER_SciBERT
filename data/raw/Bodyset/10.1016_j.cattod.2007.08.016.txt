This special issue of Catalysis Today is devoted to the catalytic aspects of hydrogen (H H This special issue is based on papers presented at the “International Symposium on Hydrogen from Renewable Sources and Refinery Applications” as a part of the American Chemical Society (ACS) national meeting held in Atlanta, Georgia, USA from March 28–30, 2006. The symposium featured 53 presentations, including 11 keynote speeches by experts in this field from industry, academia and national laboratories in the U.S. and around the world. The papers presented in this symposium covered five major topics as follows: Hydrogen production from biomass, hydrogen production from petroleum refinery off-gas, hydrogen production from water, hydrogen production for clean transportation and topics related to hydrogen production. The symposium attracted a large number of attendees on all 3 days and active discussions were held during the presentations. This special issue consists of 22 papers, including 3 papers on H This special issue has been made possible by all the authors and a large number of reviewers. We wish to thank each one of them for their strong support and timely contributions. We wish to acknowledge the ACS Division of Petroleum Chemistry for sponsoring this symposium as a part of the ACS National Meeting. We are also grateful to the journal editors, Prof. J.J. Spivey and Prof. J.R.H. Ross for giving us the wonderful opportunity to publish this special issue, and to the editorial team at Elsevier for their support.
