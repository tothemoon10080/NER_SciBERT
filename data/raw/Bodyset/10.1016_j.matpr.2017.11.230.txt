The successful research and development of a new building material, or component using wastes as raw materials, is a very complex and multidisciplinary task, having technical, environmental, financial, marketing, legal and social aspects. The utilization of such materials in concrete not only makes it economical, but also helps in reducing disposal concerns. One such by-product is Quarry dust and the disposal problems laid by waste plastics (ldpe). In this study emphasis was made on the feasibility of usage of quarry dust as a replacement of natural sand along with waste plastic as filler in concrete. In this study Matrix densification has been studied qualitatively through petro graphical examination using digital optical microscopy. The materials were studied using XRD for natural sand, quarry dust and waste LDPE. This research has been motivated by the economic and environmental concerns over the disposal of wastes with the costs of traditional engineering materials.
