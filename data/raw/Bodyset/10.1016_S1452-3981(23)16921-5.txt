Corrosion resistance behaviour of S43903 ferritic stainless steel was evaluated in different hydrochloric acid and the acid chloride concentrations. The experiments were performed at ambient temperature using potentiodynamic polarization measurement. This paper reports the observed electrochemical response of the experimental tests. Different concentrations of the test media were used with sodium chloride addition. Tafel and polarization resistance techniques were used to estimate the corrosion rate and the polarisation resistance of the alloy samples tested. The results obtained showed some magnitude of corrosion susceptibility for the stainless steel at higher HCl concentrations and also in the acid chloride test media.
