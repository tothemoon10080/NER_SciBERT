Purpose
                  To present our results of the palmar plating system that we developed for the treatment of Colles’ fractures.
               
                  Methods
                  By using the palmar plating system that we developed a consecutive series of 40 acute Colles’ fractures were treated surgically. There were 12 men and 28 women with a mean age of 57 years at the time of the injury (range, 25–90 y). All patients had internal fixation using the trans-flexor carpi radialis tendon approach. The system has 3 main features. First, the plate is small in size, being 1.1 mm in thickness and 47 mm in length. Only a 3- to 4-cm skin incision is required for application of the plate. Second, the screw is cannulated and cancellous in type, with a low-profile head. Subchondral screw fixation is achieved both easily and safely by using a guidewire. Third, the plate has a window through which injectable bone cement can be placed.
               
                  Results
                  Union was achieved in all patients. The palmar tilt, radial inclination, radial length, and ulnar variance were maintained after surgery. According to the Gartland and Werley rating scale that was modified by Sarmiento there were 12 excellent and 28 good results. There were no extensor tendon injuries that could occur when the dorsal approach was used.
               
                  Conclusions
                  This palmar plating system can make fixation of the distal radius easy, safe, and effective in the treatment of unstable Colles’ fractures.
