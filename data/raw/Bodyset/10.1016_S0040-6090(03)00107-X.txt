In order to understand material properties in a better way, it is always desirable to come up with new variables that might be related to the film properties. The B-parameter is such a variable, which relates to the quality of a-SiC:H films both in terms of electronic and optical properties. B (scaling factor) is essentially the slope of the straight-line part of the (αE)1/2–E (Tauc plot). Due to dependence on a large number of parameters and no detailed research, many previous authors have surmised that B has an ambiguous correlation with carbon content. We have made an attempt to establish the relation between the B-parameter as a quality-indicating factor of a-SiC:H films in both carbon- and silicon-rich material. For this we studied a-SiC:H films deposited by the HWCVD method with broad deposition parameters of substrate temperature (T
                     s), filament temperature (T
                     F) and C2H2 fraction. Our results indicate that the B-parameter varies considerably with process conditions such as T
                     F, total gas pressure and carbon content. An attempt is made to correlate the B-parameter with an opto-electronic parameter, such as the mobility edge, which has relevance to the device-quality aspects of a-SiC:H films prepared by HWCVD.Since the first results on a-Si:H thin films prepared by hot-wire chemical vapour deposition (HWCVD), there have been various claims regarding the advantages of the HWCVD technique vis-à-vis the conventional RF glow discharge method. Issues such as hydrogen content, short- and medium-range order, Urbach energy, mobility edges and more importantly the stability of the films deposited by HWCVD are being critically analysed and the various claims are being hotly debated One parameter, which is closely related to the above issues, is the There have been many studies on the optical properties of a-Si:H and a-SiC:H prepared by the conventional glow-discharge method The a-SiC:H films were deposited using SiH  From  In the present work we make a further attempt to correlate We have reported the results of the first attempts to analyse the optical characteristics of HWCVD a-SiC:H thin films prepared using a SiH
