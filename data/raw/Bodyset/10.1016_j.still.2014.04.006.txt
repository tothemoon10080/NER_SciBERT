Methods for assessment of soil structure in the field are useful for determining the sensitivity of soil to different management systems. Soil and crop management have a fundamental role in the maintenance and improvement of soil quality, as they have a direct influence its structure and on microbiota habitats. The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify homogeneous morphological units (HMUs) in a dystroferric Red Latosol, in a 22-year experiment with treatments consisting of a no-tillage planting system (NT), no-tillage with chiseling every 3 years (NTC) and conventional tillage (CT), using crop rotation (CR) [with five different crop species in 3 years] and succession systems (CS) [only two crop species]. The NT and NTC treatments presented HMUs with a continuous and cohesive structure and increased visible porosity at the surface, and continuous and cohesive units with lower porosity below this layer. The surface layer of the NT treatment presented free units made up of small and medium sized clods, and below this layer, compact, continuous units with little porosity. The soil management systems with crop rotation presented less compact units and roots with fewer morphological deformities than in the treatments with succession systems. Significantly higher levels of carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass (CMB and NMB) were observed in the HMUs in NT and NTC systems under both crop rotation and succession systems, and these had higher visible porosity than the units found in the CT system. On average, HMUs in the NT and NTC treatments presented 20% more CMB and 51% more NMB than in the CT treatment. NMB was the parameter most highly affected by the soil management. At depths of 0–20cm, total organic carbon (TOC), was higher by an average of 21% than in the NT and NTC treatments. Total nitrogen (TN) was also affected by the soil management, increasing by an average of 50% in the NT and NTC treatments. This demonstrates how the tillage of the soil exposes the organic matter in the aggregates to oxidation and nitrogen mineralization.The biggest challenge within modern agriculture is to find soil management systems that contribute to the economic and environmental sustainability of production systems. The no-tillage planting system (NT), in which the soil is not disturbed through tillage, reduces impacts on soil structure and has been indicated as an alternative means of sustainable soil management. Since this method was introduced in Brazil in the 1970s, studies have demonstrated the advantages of NT compared to systems involving tillage of the soil. The benefits of NT include the control it provides over wind and rain erosion ( In addition, studies have indicated that NT has contributed to a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO Soil preparation is the activity with the most influence on the physical properties of the soil, as it has a direct impact on its structure ( Performing qualitative and quantitative evaluation on soil structure in the field in order to verify the effect of soil use and management on the morphology of the soil is challenging. The French cultural profile methodology ( Changes in soil structure directly affect the habitat of microorganisms, which are considered to be critical components of natural and anthropogenic ecosystems as they regulate the level of decomposition of organic material and the cycling of nutrients ( The hypothesis raised in this study is that morphological alterations observed in soil structure may be related to modifications in microbial biomass, validating the cultural profile method as a tool capable of providing an indication of the microorganisms present in the HMUs found in soil profiles. Soil samples to evaluate microbial biomass are generally collected up to depths of 30 The aim of this study was to quantify carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass in the Homogeneous Morphological Units (HMUs) in a dystroferric Red Latosol, in a 22-year experiment with treatments consisting of a no-tillage planting system (NT), no-tillage with chiseling every 3 years (NTC) and conventional tillage (CT), using crop rotation (CR) and succession (CS) systems, in order to determine the relationship between alterations in soil structure and modifications in the contents of microbial biomass. The experiment began in the summer of 1988/1989, in the experimental area of the Soybean Research Center at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Agency (EMBRAPA Soja) (23°11′ S, 51°11′ W), Londrina, in the state of Paraná in Brazil. The local climate is classified according to Köeppen as Humid Subtropical (Cfa) and has an average annual temperature of 21 Before the experiment, the area was cultivated for around 40 years with coffee ( The study compared the effects of three soil preparation systems: no-tillage planting (NT), where sowing is carried out on the residues of the previous crop and mechanical intervention is restricted to the digging of a narrow planting row (∼4 In addition, each soil preparation system was submitted to the effects of crop rotation and succession. Six management systems were evaluated in total: NT (rotation and succession), NTC (rotation and succession) and CT (rotation and succession). The crop rotation (CR) consisted of five different crop species: white lupine ( At the start of the experiment, the soil received two tons of limestone per hectare to achieve a base saturation of 60% and to adjust the pH to approximately 5.5, and maintenance was carried out every 3 years. Similar quantities of fertilizer were applied to all of the treatments. Along the 22 years of the experiment, an average of 47 The insects and diseases were controlled as necessary. The residues of previous cultures were desiccated using glyphosate. After planting, other herbicides were applied to the CT treatment as necessary. Two 1.0 To provide a more detailed description of the internal state of the clods, the following classification scale was used: For each soil profile, maps with a scale of 1:10 were prepared and imported using ArcView software (version 10.0). Another three maps were then prepared for each of the profiles, the first of the perimeter of the profile, which served as a template to ensure the other two maps were of the same size, the second detailing the HMUs and the third detailing the depths. A fourth map was obtained through the superposition of these three maps, producing a map of the areas of each HMU according to profile depth. Soil samples for the analysis of microbial biomass were collected from two midpoints in each volume affected by the soil management, forming a sample of around 1.2 The soil samples taken to determine pH and total organic carbon and nitrogen were collected from depths of 0–20 The soil samples were dried in an air circulating oven at 60 The modified version of the fumigation-extraction method described by All measurements were made on moist soil, previously adjusted to 40% Water Holding Capacity (WHC) and soil weights, and all results were expressed on an oven-dry basis (105 The CMB concentrations in the extracts were determined through oxidation with Mn NMB concentrations were determined through the addition of 0.5 The values obtained for microbial biomass were expressed in mg of CMB or NMB per kg For the analysis of the cultural profiles, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to verify the linearity of the data, and then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied. PCA was carried out with the purpose of determining the relationship between soil use and management systems, the structural characteristics of the profiles and the carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the microbial biomass. Multivariate analysis was carried out using the Canoco program for Windows 4.5 ( All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (Version 8.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) (  In general, the surface layer of the soil in all of the units was covered with residues of recently harvested maize in the crop rotation treatments and soybean in the succession treatments. In addition to these residues, all of the treatment areas contained weeds and some maize or soybean regrowth. Another revealing factor observed in the profiles was the abundant presence of macrofauna, mainly individuals from the Oligochaeta, Formicidae, Melolonthidae, Diplopoda and Chilopoda families. Biological activity was intense on the surface, with a huge number of holes (1.0–2.0 The profiles for the NT treatments under crop rotation ( One of the NT profiles with crop succession presented units at the surface corresponding to a C The NTC profile under crop rotation presented cracked units at the surface. This unit was characterized by the presence of small (5 For the NTC treatment with crop succession, the surface predominantly contained units corresponding to a C The CT treatment under crop rotation and succession presented a unit corresponding to free soil at the surface, made up of small (3 In the CT profiles under crop succession, below the LΔ It was observed that the NT profiles ( The NTC profiles ( The LΔ PCA was used to demonstrate the relationship between the different soil use and management systems and the structures observed in the cultural profiles. The first axis of the principal component explained 64.6% of the variability, while the second axis explained 14% ( Significantly higher levels of CMB and NMB were found in the NT and NTC treatments, where less compact HMUs were predominant, while lower values were found in the CT treatments, where more compact HMUs were observed ( PCA was used to demonstrate the relationship between HMUs and levels of CMB and NMB ( NMB levels were more sensitive than CMB levels in indicating changes to the structure of the soil. On average, the soil structures of the NT and NTC profiles presented NMB levels 50% higher than the CT profiles ( No differences were observed in pH (CaCl TOC and TN levels were higher in the NT and NTC treatments compared to the CT treatments ( A range of studies have demonstrated that intense tillage of the soil promotes changes in its physical properties, affecting its chemical and biological attributes ( After 22 years of cultivation, the characterization of different profiles showed that the soil at the superficial layer (∼0–12 The visible porosity of the aggregates was influenced by the type of crop management used, as the treatments with crop succession presented more compact units with roots that were visibly more morphologically deformed than those observed for the treatments under crop rotation. The C For the NT profile under succession ( While evaluating the effects of some crop rotation systems on the physical attributes of the soil, In the surface layer at 0–20 The NTC profile under crop succession presented a small area of CΔ structures in the surface layer (∼0–8  Crop rotation including grains (soybean, maize and wheat), cover crops and green manure (lupine, turnip and black oat) seems to have minimized the effects of compression in the NT treatment compared to the treatment with soybean/wheat succession. Crop rotation promotes crop diversification, with different root systems and a higher biomass production, providing increased aeration and infiltration of water in the soil, leading to the maintenance and improvement of its structural quality ( According to According to The C When evaluating the 0–20 The LΔ The CT profiles under rotation and succession presented CΔ, CΔ Despite being more evident in the NT and NTC areas, crop rotation had a small effect in the CT area, which presented roots that were less flattened and twisted, as was also observed by Various studies demonstrate that soil preparation involving aeration and harrowing reduces organic matter content, especially in the tropics ( Despite the fact that the macrofauna in the soil was not evaluated in this study, its activity in the profiles was intense and certainly had an important role in the aggregation and structuring of the soil. Its role is also recognized in the fragmentation of organic residues, in organic matter dynamics and in the transport and mixing of organic particles and minerals ( The observed changes in soil structure provoked significant modifications in CMB and NMB levels, as higher levels were obtained for HMUs in the NT and NTC systems under crop rotation and succession ( Changes in soil structure caused by intense tillage affect water percolation, temperature and aeration and increase soil erosion, significantly reducing microbial communities ( However, management systems involving less tillage encourage the formation and stabilization of macroaggregates ( According to NMB was more sensitive than CMB in the indication of changes provoked by soil management. According to TOC was higher in the NT and NTC systems, independent of the type of crop management, which can be attributed to the reduced tillage of the soil preserving its structure and contributing via aggregation to the protection and stabilization of organic material in these management systems ( One factor that contributes to the reduction in organic matter is the acceleration of the mineralization process caused by soil preparation activities, which break up macroaggregates and expose organic matter to attack by microorganisms, resulting in a higher turnover ( In tropical and temperate soils, there is an increase in TOC levels in NT systems compared to CT systems of approximately 0.325 In a recent study conducted by  It is clear that NT planting systems are important in hotter regions to encourage the retention of carbon in the soil, as the presence of soil coverage affects the formation and stability of aggregates and reduces the effects of excessive temperatures, decreasing the decomposition of organic matter and emissions of CO Similarly to TOC, TN levels were significantly higher in the NT and NTC systems under crop rotation and succession for all of the depths analyzed, presenting values that were 50% higher than those obtained for the CT system ( Data obtained by When evaluating the same experimental area, In an experiment conducted over 22 years, the hypothesis of this study that morphological changes in soil structure effect levels of microbial biomass has been confirmed. The superior soil quality found in NT and NTC planting systems, which contain HMUs that are predominantly less compact and present a higher porosity than those observed in CT systems, produces higher levels of carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass. The cultural profile methodology, which has already been used as a soil sampling technique, provides results on soil structure that can be interpreted immediately and has proven to be capable of indicating changes in levels of microbial biomass caused by agricultural practices. Crop rotation contributed to the conservation of the structure of the soil by reducing the effects of soil management. The profiles under crop rotation systems presented less compact soil volumes than those under crop succession systems and with less morphologically deformed roots. TOC and TN were higher for the NT and NTC systems, as TN and NMB were the parameters most affected by soil management, indicating that increased disturbance of the soil reduces nitrogen levels. These results show that in tropical conditions, low tillage systems are fundamental in the maintenance and improvement of soil structure and promote increased carbon accumulation, contributing to a reduction in CO The project was partially financed by PROBIO II-Embrapa and CNPq-Universal (470515/2012-0).
