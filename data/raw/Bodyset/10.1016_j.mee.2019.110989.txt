Recently, there has been renewed interest in tungsten oxide based electrochromic (EC) materials. A variety of studies related to these materials have been reported, however, no serious studies so far have been reported on the electrochromic effect of tungsten oxide that is synthesized by solution combustion method. The major advantage of this process is the ease and simplicity with preparing nanosize oxides. Herein, the principal objective of this project was to produce uniform and adhesive tungsten oxide thin films from as-synthesized powder by solution combustion route for EC device. Although extensive research has been carried out on EC properties of tungsten oxide, limited study exists in e-beam evaporated tungsten oxide thin film studies for smart window application. Therefore, tungsten oxide thin films were deposited from our own produced powder by e-beam evaporation. To present the effect of new powder on the properties of the thin films, their physical and morphological properties were compared with thin film deposited by commercial tungsten oxide powder. Finally, electrochemical and optical characteristics of an all-solid-state EC device with a structure of glass/ITO/SCS-WO3/Nafion/ITO/glass with high optical transmittance modulation (63% at 550 nm) was fabricated. This study has been one of the first attempts to thoroughly examine in detail of tungsten oxide powder synthesized by solution combustion method for EC active layer. These findings contribute in several ways to our understanding of solution combustion synthesized powder to be used for production of EC active layer of thin film and provide a basis for developing and designing energy-efficient EC active materials and devices.In the last few decades, there has been even more growing interest in electrochromic (EC) materials due to huge applications such as energy-saving smart windows, displays and anti-glare rear-view mirrors [ Among the several EC materials, tungsten trioxide (WO Another important finding was that deposition technique and condition has an important role on the structure, composition and morphological properties of the prepared thin films [ To date, there has been no detailed research directly investigating electrochromic device (ECD) performance of e-beam deposited tungsten oxide thin film whose powder synthesized by solution combustion method (SCS-WO Ammonium tungsten oxide hydrate ((NH For comparison, the following steps were performed to both commercial tungsten oxide powder (99.8% purity, Alfa Aesar) and as-synthesized WO SCS-WO SEM image of the as-synthesized powder at O/F of 1 was given in Surface SEM images of the films are evaluated as a further analysis in Further experimental investigations are needed to estimate the electrochemical properties. It is known that when the applied current is negative tungsten oxide film is colored by lithium ion intercalation but when the applied current is positive, lithium ion is deintercalated during the bleaching process of the film [ The electrochromic properties of both e-beam evaporated SCS-WO The corresponding transmittance spectra at the colored (T At this stage, it is significant to study the durability of the films. Optical contrast and coloration efficiency (CE) are significant parameters for comparing and characterizing the electrochromic device performance [ For comparing the electrochromic properties of the samples, the calculated values of T Further studies were performed to understand the behavior of SCS-WO Chronoamperometry measurements were obtained switching the potential between +2.6 V (60 s) and − 2.6 V (60 s) ( The optical transmittance was monitored by in-situ measurements with the corresponding photographs of bleached (transparent) and colored states (dark blue) of ECD under applied potentials of +2.6 V and − 2.6 V, are presented in The ΔOD and CE of the all-solid-state ECD is 0.57 and 97 cm In this study, tungsten oxide powder was prepared by SCS method and deposited on ITO glass by e-beam evaporation. Every step was applied on commercial tungsten oxide powder under the same conditions for benchmarking. In reviewing the literature, no systematic investigation was found on SCS-WO
