Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaves) was tested as a green inhibitor for zinc-plate in 2M hydrochloride solution by means of weight loss, gasometric principle and potentiostatic polarization at 313-343K. Increasing rate of hydrogen gas during the chemical reaction was examined in gasometric studies. Inhibition feasibility was explained by formation of insoluble complex adhesion on the surface of metal. However, results obtained indicated that, percentage of extract concentration increased due to the volume of H2 
                     gas generated. Extract in acid medium retard corrosion degradation of the deposited zinc- plate and forcefully reduce corrosion rate. Micro-structural examination through AFM revealed the morphology and evaluation performance of vernonia amygdalina. Polarization results obtained showed that performance efficiency of vernonia amygdalina was outstanding and the inhibitory effectiveness was as a result of increase in vernonia amygdalina concentration.
