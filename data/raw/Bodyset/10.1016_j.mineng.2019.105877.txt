Dear Editor Recently published article ( Paper ( We will show that taking into account the charge of nanobubbles and the corresponding decrease in the effective surface tension of water Consider formation of charged air nanobubbles during the passage of a water flow under high pressure ( negative (tensile) electrostatic pressure ( An effective surface tension coefficient depending on the bubble radius is introduced as ( For the minimal work of formation of nanobubble If rewrite the third negative term on the right side of the expression Critical is called bubbles for which the function As you can see, Experiments ( The calculation of the minimum work of formation of nanobubble and with the growth of oversaturation It should be noted that in the derivation of the relations The chemical potential of the air molecule inside the bubble must coincide with the its value in supersaturated by air at pressure and finally it turns out In the derivation of the expression The number of bubbles generated during hydrodynamic cavitation is so small that the air molecules concentration in the water practically does not change after bubbles formation. Only in this case the relations Due to the low bubble concentration Let us check both assumptions for the experiment ( The total number of moles of air Check condition (2). Upper rough estimate of the electrostatic energy of the Coulomb interaction of nanobubbles gives: The real value During the experiment ( The reason for this paradox is still unclear. In our view, there may be two different situations: Due to the additional transfer of potential-forming ions from the water to the bubble surface, the air pressure will drop to the atmospheric value Before disappearing, the resulting bulk nanobubbles manage to attach on the hydrophobic surface of the particles present in water. The resulting surface nanobubbles are known to be quite stable, due to the effect of pinning (fixing the boundaries of the contact bubble-hydrophobic surface ( Supplementary data to this article can be found online at The following are the Supplementary data to this article:
