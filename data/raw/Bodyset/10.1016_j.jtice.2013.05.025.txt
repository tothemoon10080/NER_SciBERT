Circulating fluidized bed combustion boiler bottom ashes (BA) are hydrated in a 15rpm rotary kiln using 200°C steam. After different hydration time, BA particles are characterized by the particle size distribution, the BET specific surface area, the pore size distribution and the thermogravimetry analysis. Calcium oxide in the BA core reacts with steam and produces calcium hydroxide. The molar volume expansion of this reaction breaks the calcium sulfate shell, causing the reduction of the particle size, the increasing of the specific surface area and the total pore volume. The reaction conversion increases with the increasing of the steam hydration time and reaches ca. 90% after 5min hydration time. The pore size distribution of BA after the hydration reaction affects its desulfation reactivity. After 5min steam treatment, the hydrated BA shows the greatest desulfation reactivity, which is comparable to that of the fresh limestone particles.Circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) show large heat and mass transfer areas between gas and solids and thus the CFB technologies are often applied to combustion or petrochemical cracking processes The structure of the typical BA particles shows a core–shell structure with calcium sulfate in the shell and calcium oxide in the core Water reacts with calcium oxide in BA core and produces calcium hydroxide: Since the molar volume of calcium oxide is 16.9 The reaction kinetics of the calcium oxide hydration reaction is affected by the size distribution of the BA particles Although the water hydration method is effective to expose the unsulfated calcium in the core to the particle surface, it is usually studied in a lab-scale batch reactor. In this work, BA particles produced from a CFBC boiler firing petroleum cokes are hydrated using 200 The partially sulfated BA particles are produced from a 125 The composition of BA analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF, XGT-1700WR) coupling thermogravimetry analysis (STA 409 PC/PG Luxx) is shown in The saturated steam with a pressure of 167 The desulfation reactivity of the steam treated BA particles and the fresh limestone powders (size range between 149 The cumulative particle size distributions and the volumetric mean diameter of NSBA and SBA as a function of the steam hydration time are shown in The scanning electron microscope images of BA as received, after 2   The molar volume expansion due to the formation of gypsum dihydrate decreases the mean pore size. Nevertheless, gypsum dihydrate decomposes at around 70  The conversion of the reaction is determined by, The purpose of carrying out the BA hydration reaction is to expose unsulfated calcium in the ash core for further desulfation applications. It is also interesting to note that the desulfation reactivity of the samples decreases for the samples with the steam hydration time increasing from 5 The CFBC boiler bottom ashes were hydrated in a 15 The particle size decreases with the increasing of the steam hydration from in the first 5 The maximum conversion of the BA steam hydration reaction is
