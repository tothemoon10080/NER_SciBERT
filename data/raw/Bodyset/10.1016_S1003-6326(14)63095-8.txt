High-purity titanium powder was prepared by molten salt electrorefining from sponge titanium in NaCl–KCl–TiCl
                        x
                      salts. The titanium valence, purity and electrocrystallization during electrolysis process were studied. The XPS analysis showed that the titanium valences are mainly +4, +3 and +2 at the earlier, medium and later stages of electrolysis, respectively. During the electrolysis process, the contents of impurities Si, Cr, Mn, Al vary little, and the contents of impurities Fe, Cu, Ni decrease markedly, while the contents of impurities O, N, H increase obviously. The residual impurities are usually distributed in small tunnel of dendritic crystals. Enhancing the electrolysis temperature and prolonging the electrolysis time can increase the titanium particle size. The TEM analysis showed that the electrodeposited titanium is not a single crystal, but contains many nanostructured grains and subgrains, with grain size of 100–500 nm. The electrolysis mechanisms were also discussed.
