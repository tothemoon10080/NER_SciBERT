Qianjiaying coke coal slime is extremely difficult to float. Conventional flotation process leads to a massive waste of high quality coal. In this paper, raw coal slime and rough separation concentrate are grinded to improve separation effect. Coal slime grinded directly through rough-cleaning process can get concentrate rate of 52.87% and concentrate ash of 11.27%. In the rough concentrate grinding process, concentrate ash drops to 10.74%, when the concentrate accumulation rate reaches up to 55.53%. Compared with the coal slime direct floatation, the concentrate rate was enhanced by 4.66%, and the ash was decreased by 1.02%. Besides, in the regrinding of middlings flotation, the concentrate rate reaches as high as 68.35% and ash rate is only 11.51%, the production efficiency is greatly improved.
