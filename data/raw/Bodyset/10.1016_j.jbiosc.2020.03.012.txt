It has been reported that the concentrations of minerals in wines can be used to discriminate their geographical origin. However, some winemaking techniques may also affect the mineral concentration of the final product. In this study, we examined the effects of various winemaking techniques, including (i) fining, (ii) aging with oak tips, (iii) maceration with grape skins, (iv) chaptalization and acidification, and (v) yeast nutrient addition for alcohol fermentation, on the concentration of 18 minerals (Li, B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb) in a total of 154 wine samples using grapes from different production areas. Among the various winemaking techniques, maceration with grape skin had the largest effect on mineral content, significantly changing the concentrations of 17 or 18 elements (B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb). Fining treatment using bentonites had the second largest effect, altering the concentrations of 14 elements (Li, B, Na, Si, P, S, Ca, Co, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb). However, in principal component analysis using all data (n = 154), the wine samples were clearly clustered according to grapes used in the experiments rather than the winemaking technique. In conclusion, some winemaking techniques significantly altered the concentration of some minerals in wine; however, the principal factor influencing wine mineral composition seems to be its geographical origin.The mineral composition of a wine is often used to discriminate its geographical origin because the mineral composition potentially reflects the soil of the vineyard from which the wine is derived. Some minerals in soil are taken up through the vine roots and into the grapes, and subsequently transferred to the wine during the winemaking process ( Winemaking involves many kinds of technique. For example, fining treatment is used to remove proteins and reduce the risk of protein haze. Fining treatment involves the addition of clay materials such as bentonite, which mainly comprises montmorillonite containing Na and Ca ( In addition, some wine-makers age their wine in oak barrels from several months to several years to improve the quality, especially for premium wines. During the aging process, flavor substances are extracted from the oak wood and phenolic components are gradually modified (i.e., tannins are softened). The concentrations of Al, Fe and V in wine have been shown to increase during aging in oak barrels ( In the maceration process for red wine, phenolic compounds (anthocyanins and tannins) are extracted from the skins, seeds, and sometimes the stems of the grape. The length and intensity of maceration are adjusted according to the desired characteristics of the final product. Prolonged maceration with grape skins often increases the concentration of Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn in wine ( To our knowledge, there is little information about the effects of additional sugar, acidulant and nutrients on wine mineral concentrations. During the fermentation process, chaptalization is often used to enhance ethanol levels when there is a low sugar content in the must; acidification is performed to lower the pH to avoid bacterial contamination; and lastly, yeast nutrients are added to ensure a smooth fermentation and to prevent the production of hydrogen sulfide ( While the effects of these winemaking techniques on some minerals have been reported, their effects on the overall mineral content (i.e., the 18 elements mentioned above) are not well understood. Furthermore, it is not currently clear whether the effects of winemaking technique on mineral composition are larger than those of geographical origin. In this study, therefore, we have examined the effects of the following winemaking techniques, (i) fining products (bentonites, PVPP and egg albumin), (ii) aging with oak tips, (iii) maceration with grape skins, (iv) chaptalization and acidification, and (v) yeast nutrient addition on the concentrations of 18 minerals through small-scale vinification tests of 154 samples using grapes from different origins, and compared wine mineral concentrations under the effects of winemaking techniques. To examine the effects of fining materials on the 18 mineral concentrations in wine (experiment 1; We conducted the fining treatments using four concentrations of each fining product, bentonite Vitiben (0, 200, 400, and 1000 mg/L), bentonite Microcol CL G (0, 200, 400, and 1000 mg/L), PVPP (0, 400, 1000, and 2000 mg/L) and albumin (0, 200, 400, and 1000 mg/L), which were added to 10 mL of wine in a 15-ml conical tube (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). All experiments were conducted in triplicate ( To test the effect of oak aging on mineral concentrations ( To examine the effects of maceration on mineral concentrations ( To examine the effects of chaptalization and acidification on mineral concentrations ( In addition, we diluted imported concentrated juices of CS and Chardonnay (California Concentrate Company, Acampo, CA, USA) grapes 4-fold with water (final sugar concentration 16.6% and 17.2%, respectively) and subjected them to four treatments: (i) chaptalization, in which sucrose was added to a 6% (w/v) sugar concentration; (ii) acidification, in which tartaric acid was added to reduce the pH from 3.6 to 3.3 for CS and from 3.5 to 3.2 for Chardonnay; (iii) chaptalization and acidification, in which both sucrose and tartaric acid were added; and (iv) a control treatment with no additions. We fermented 40-ml aliquots of each must sample in a 50-ml conical tube (Corning) ( To determine the effects of yeast nutrients on mineral concentrations ( To determine mineral concentrations, 2-ml aliquots of wine or must sample were mixed with 5 ml of 61% nitric acid (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) in a digestion vessel (SCP Science, Montreal, Canada). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 60 min, except for the must sample with grape skins used for maceration, which was treated at 95°C for 120 min (Digi PREP MS, SCP Science). Samples were then diluted with ultra-pure water (>18.1 MΩ) obtained via a MilliQ system (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) to a total volume of 50 mL (final concentration of nitric acid, 6%). The mineral concentrations of all wine samples were analyzed by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (7770x, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and inductively coupled-plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (ICPE-9000; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) as previously described ( All statistical tests were performed by using JMP 12.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The differences in elemental concentrations among each group were independently tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The means were separated by Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test. In all tests, a After standardization, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using all mineral concentration data ( We detected significant effects of the fining treatments using bentonites Vitiben, bentonites Microcol CL G, PVPP and albumin on 14 (Li, B, Na, Si, P, S, Ca, Co, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba, and Pb), 14 (Li, B, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Ba, and Pb), 8 (Li, Na, Si, P, S, Co, Rb, and Sr) and 13 (B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Rb, Sr, and Mo) mineral concentrations in wine, respectively ( We detected significant effects of the oak tip treatment on 15 (B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Mo, Ba and Pb) mineral concentrations in wine ( We detected significant effects of the maceration with grape skin on 18 (Li, B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb), 18 (Li, B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb) and 17 (B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba and Pb) mineral concentrations in MBA, CS and Syrah wine, respectively ( For Co, Li, Ba and Ga, the concentrations gradually decreased to 0.3–0.7-, 0.4–0.8-, 0.5–0.6- and 0.5–0.7-fold that of the control on the 6th day of maceration for MBA, CS and Syrah, respectively. The decrease in Li concentration after maceration with grape skin is consistent with a previous study ( We detected significant effects of chaptalization treatment on 13 (B, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, K, Ca, Ga, Rb, Sr, Mo, and Ba) mineral concentrations in Koshu ( By contrast, in the chaptalization and acidification experiments using Ch and CS wines, we detected significant effects on 10 (Si, P, K, Co, Ga, Rb, Sr, Ba, Mo and Pb) and 12 (B, Na, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Co, Ga, Rb, Sr and Ba) mineral concentrations, respectively ( The addition of yeast nutrients Fermaid K, DAP and Opti Red had significant effects on 4 (Mg, Si, P, and S), 5 (B, Si, P, S, and Ca) and 4 (Na, Si, P, and K) mineral concentrations in wines, respectively ( The different winemaking techniques altered the mineral concentrations in wine as shown above and reported in previous studies ( In the score plot, the cluster of wine made from Koshu cultivated in Yamanashi with different chaptalization levels was clearly separated from other wines made from different grapes. PC2 scores for the chaptalization experiment using Koshu decreased as the additional amounts of sugar increased ( In conclusion, various winemaking techniques (fining, aging with oak tips, maceration with grape skins, chaptalization and acidification, and yeast nutrient addition for alcohol fermentation) were shown to have an effect on the mineral concentration of wine. However, these winemaking techniques did not largely change the mineral composition of wine arising from grapes, indicating that the principal factor that affects wine mineral composition is likely to be the geographical origin of wine.
