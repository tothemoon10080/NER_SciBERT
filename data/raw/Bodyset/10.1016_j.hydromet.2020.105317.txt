In the present work, a feasible approach was developed for the recovery of cerium and lanthanum from rare earth polishing powder wastes to synthesize shape-controlled CeO2 and perovskite-type La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 powders. The process proposed here includes six steps: (i) Pre-roasting treatment, (ii) H2SO4 digestion and water leaching, (iii) double salt (NaRE(SO4)2·xH2O) precipitation, (iv) conversion of NaRE(SO4)2·xH2O into RE‑carbonate, (v) oxidation and separation of cerium and lanthanum, and (vi) oxalic salt precipitation conversion and calcinations to synthesize CeO2 and glycine-nitrate combustion process to get La0.6Ca0.4CoO3.The recovery yield for the total process was 91.73% for cerium and 90.45% for lanthanum. In the preparation process of CeO2 and La0.6Ca0.4CoO3, CeO2 powders with controlled shapes were obtained by modifying the final pH value in the precipitate transformation from Ce(OH)4 to cerium oxalate and subsequent calcinations. On the other hand, based on the polarization curves, the prepared La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 exhibited a good catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction, showing potential applications in zinc-air batteries.Rare earth (RE) polishing powders, mainly consisting of cerium oxide (CeO Currently, the main process employed in the reuse or recycling RE from REPPWs involves physicochemical separation ( In this regard, cerium and lanthanum were successfully recovered from REPPWs through a hydrometallurgical process, during which, specific variables such as the amount of precipitation agent, the pH value of the reaction system, and the reaction temperature and time, were investigated in detail to obtain optimized processing parameters. The further application of the lanthanum and cerium obtained from the REPPWs were expanded to the preparation of shape-controlled CeO REPPWs were collected from Lens Technology Co., Ltd. The presence of aluminum in the REPPWs could be attributed to the hydrolysis of flocculants like aluminum chlorides in order to settle the solids from the slurry (  Phase structures of the as-obtained samples were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D8, Rigaku 2500, Japan) at 40 kV with a scan rate of 8° min  The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the cerium and lanthanum in the raw and roasted REPPWs forms was shown in Based on a certain mass ratio, the roasted REPPWs and concentrated sulfuric acid (AR) were weighed accurately and mixed well. A box-type resistance furnace was used in the digestion process. After the digestion, the digested materials were cooled down and leached out with adequate water to dissolve lanthanum and cerium sulfates. The leachate was filtered out and the leaching residue was washed with hot water several times before being discarded. According to a previous report ( From thermodynamic calculation results, specific relationships between Gibbs free energy change (△G) and temperature (T) for the aforementioned reactions from (1) to (6) were presented in  Lanthanum and cerium were effectively separated together from the non-rare metals in the form of sodium sulfate double salt (NaRE (SO As such, specific parameters were investigated, including the addition amount of precipitation agent (Na As the RE-Na double sulphate was only slightly soluble in acid solutions, in order to achieve its dissolution aiming at the separation of the rare earths into individual elements, the double sulphate was usually converted into a high soluble compound. Thus, the conversion of RE-Na double sulfate into RE‑carbonate was carried out, as illustrated in the following reactions: Then, the RE‑carbonate was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 120 °C. Specific effect factors on the RE carbonate conversion rate, such as the amount of Na According to the ionic equilibrium theory, lanthanum cerium hydroxides of La(OH) Moreover, a detailed relationship between the pH-value and the ion concentration of La Accordingly, lanthanum and cerium were separated by accurately controlling the pH value of the reaction system between 5.5 and 6.0, under an uninterrupted manual addition of the H Therefore, after the above-mentioned RE‑carbonate was dissolved using nitric acid, the oxidation of Ce (III) to Ce (IV) and separation of Ce (IV) was accomplished by adding a mixture of H The expanding test was carried out under the obtained optimum process condition, when 1000 g REPPWs was used. The adaptability of the process is excellent and the recovery yield for the total process was 91.73% for cerium and 90.45% for lanthanum in the pilot scale experiment. The optimum composition of elements from the solutions and the precipitates at each stage of the process was addressed in Using a similar approach described in our previous work ( The lanthanum-ion-rich filtrate obtained from cerium separation process was supplemented with cobalt nitrate, calcium nitrate, and glycine, at a certain stoichiometric ratio. After a glycine-nitrate combustion process (stirring and drying the solution to get a colloid; subjecting to heat-treatment at 350 °C for 2 h to get the precursor of La The present work proposed a feasible procedure for recovering La and Ce from REPPWs to prepare shape-controlled CeO The obtained Ce(OH) For La This work is new and not considered elsewhere.
