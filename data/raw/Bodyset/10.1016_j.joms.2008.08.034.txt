Purpose
                  The aim of this study was to determine the rate of postoperative infection and the efficacy of removing teeth in the line of mandibular angle fractures treated with 2.0-mm 8-hole titanium curved strut plates. Our understanding is that this method of repair is currently being used only in a few centers in the United States.
               
                  Materials and Methods
                  A retrospective review of mandibular angle fractures treated with a 2.0-mm 8-hole strut plate during a 4-year period. Postoperative antibiotics were given for 1 week. Follow-up appointments were 4 weeks or longer. A nonchewing diet was instructed for 6 weeks. Data for all selected patients include the information such as age, gender, etiology of injuries, medical history, concurrent injuries, nerve deficits, pre- and postoperative antibiotic administration, postop infection, a presence or absence of teeth in the line of fractures, and whether these teeth were removed.
               
                  Results
                  Four patients (4 of 49 or 8.2%) developed infections. Two of those patients had a tooth in the line of a fracture that was retained (2 of 14 or 14%). The third had a tooth in the line of a fracture that was extracted (1 of 18 or 5.6%). The fourth patient was 1 of the 17 patients who did not have teeth in the line of fracture and developed infection (1 of 17 or 5.9%). None of the patients developed failed hardware, malunion, nonunion, malocclusion, or iatrogenic nerve injury.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The use of a 2.0-mm 8-hole strut plate is associated with a low infection rate (8.2%). The infection rate for those mandibular angle fractures with teeth in the line of fracture retained was 14% compared with 5.6% for those fractures with the teeth in the line of fracture extracted.
