Several industrial wastewater streams may contain heavy metal ions, which must be effectively removed, before the discharge or reuse of treated waters could take place. Different bonding materials, presenting selectivity and fast reaction kinetics for the removal of metals, have been examined for this purpose. The objective of the present paper was to investigate the application of dispersed-air flotation for the separation of metal-loaded sorbents. Two similar zeolite samples were applied as effective bonding agents for the removal of zinc, a toxic metal commonly found in many industrial wastewaters. This combined process, termed sorptive flotation, involves the preliminary scavenging of metal ions, by using the appropriate sorbent particles (usually present as ultrafine particulates), followed by flotation for the effective separation of them. The obtained results were very promising, as both metal and sorbent were effectively removed/separated from the dispersion.Several industrial wastewater streams may contain heavy metals, including the waste liquids generated by metal finishing or the mineral processing industries ( Therefore, a cost-effective treatment method must be applied in these cases. Among the evaluated processes, sorption has been proved to play an important role and several materials were examined as bonding materials for the treatment of hazardous liquids (as those containing toxic metals). Between them, zeolites are considered of particular significance, assisting the elimination of excess cost, caused by the direct disposal of hazardous wastes in specific landfills ( The scientific basis of sorption was recently reviewed and the respective technological trends were highlighted ( Apart from the application of zeolites as heterogeneous catalysts, natural amorphous alumino-silicates (and zeolites as well) have been used in modern detergent formulations, replacing phosphates and in order to remove calcium and magnesium hardness from water, as well as in the area of environmental protection; for example, as amendments for the disposal of municipal sewage sludge ( Certainly, other mineral sorbents have been also applied for the removal of heavy metals, such as the ferric oxides, examined in a combined method, termed sorptive flotation ( The combined treatment method involved the preliminary abstraction of metals from contaminated aqueous streams, by using appropriate bonding agents, followed by a subsequent separation of metal-loaded sorbents, applying flotation ( The experimental study was initially conducted, by using the synthetic zeolite ZEOCROS Both synthetic zeolites were of MAP (maximum aluminium P) type with chemical structure Na Depending on the specific experimental conditions, which directly influence the surface charge of sorbents, several flotation surface-active agents (acting as flotation collectors) may be used to increase the hydrophobicity and therefore, the floatability of metal-loaded sorbents. In this paper, a common cationic (cetyl trimethyl-ammonium bromide, denoted hereafter as CTMA) or a common anionic one (sodium dodecyl-sulphate, denoted as SDS) were selected and applied, usually at 50 mg Zinc was selected merely as a typical example of heavy metal cations, due to its relative abundance and rather high concentrations in most industrial wastewaters, containing heavy metals; the initial concentration of zinc was 50 mg The preliminary stage of zinc removal by ion exchange, using the zeolite samples was performed using a stirring vessel (magnetic stirring at 700 rpm). The contact time was 20 min. It was shown during preliminary experiments by the application of this retention time that the capture of metal by zeolite particles was in the order of 80% (for 2 g The electrokinetic study of zeolite particles in the presence or not of zinc, was carried out by microelectrophoresis, utilizing a Rank Brothers Mark II apparatus (UK); the measurements were used for the calculation of respective zeta-potential values. After the preliminary sorption stage, the appropriate quantities of collector and frother were added, the dispersion was conditioned for 5 min and then, it was transferred to the flotation column. The flotation cell was constructed from a Perspex column with diameter 4 cm and 400 ml (total) content (while the liquid volume for flotation experiments was 300 ml) and the appropriate sampling points. In the bottom of the column a glass-fritted air diffuser (Schott In the following experiments the zeolite sample ZEOCROS CG180 was used for the optimisation of basic flotation parameters, such as flotation time, airflow rate and necessary zeolite addition (concentration), resulting to effective zinc removal. Dissolved zinc cations are known to precipitate out from the aqueous solution over the pH of about 7, depending on the specific experimental conditions ( Flotation is a rapid solid/liquid separation process, taken place within few minutes, as compared with other commonly applied solid/liquid separation processes (e.g. sedimentation), which is certainly among its main advantages. It was observed that around 5 min for flotation was satisfactory for efficient recoveries of metal-loaded zeolite particles (surpassing 80%), as shown in The airflow rate used for flotation has been also examined ( Keeping constant the applied concentration of collector, the influence of zeolites addition (as zinc bonding agent) on the combined process (sorptive flotation) is represented in Comparing the aforementioned results with those presented in a previous publication, dealing with NaY zeolite ( In the following experiments the similar zeolite sample type-P was used. The electrokinetic measurements against the pH of aqueous solutions showed that this zeolite presents a point-of-zero charge at the pH value of 6 (approximately). The zeta-potential was negative for pH values greater than 6 ( The effect of pH on zeolite particles recovery using two different collectors, one anionic (SDS) and one cationic (CTMA), is shown in Two different batches of the same zeolite material (type-P) were examined, as far as the initial concentration of zeolite was concerned. Flotation, following metal abstraction, was found to be successful at natural pH values (∼9.5–10), applying 50 mg In The zeolites of different P type have been examined in a previous publication, which emphasizes the issues of synthesis, characterisation and structure of highly crystalline, low-silica NaP zeolites ( Due to the primary importance for several technological applications, wetting and the role of zeolites interaction with water was also examined, by adsorption calorimetry ( An interesting effect was observed when the zeolite was pre-conditioned under water for relatively long periods (up to 165 h) at pH values 6 or 9 respectively, and then the samples were subjected to flotation, using 100 mg In Dissolved-air flotation (abbreviated as DAF) was previously tested ( Flotation has been considered as an important alternative to sedimentation, as well as an efficient clarification method, improving simultaneously the application of common sand filtration ( The optimum experimental conditions, derived from the aforementioned results, are presented shortly in the following: the optimum pH regarding the flotation of zeolite particles, when either cationic or anionic surfactant was used, is 6, helping to avoid zeolite dissolution problems (provoked on more acidic pH values), as well as the precipitation of zinc as insoluble hydroxide, disturbing the ion exchange of this metal with the zeolite solids. The optimum cationic surfactant dosage at pH 6 was found to be 50 mg Concluding, flotation was successfully applied for the separation of metal-loaded zeolites; as a result, low residual metal concentrations in the treated effluent were accomplished, as well as high concentrations of solids (bonding agent) in the foamed concentrates. An effective (preliminary) flotation step can be also of specific advantage to the subsequent application of microfiltration–ultrafiltration, limiting apparently the fouling of membranes, due to substantial decrease of suspended solids concentration. Several techniques are available today to limit the fouling of membranes, such as air sparging and flotation; the latter can be considered as a valid, effective and alternative treatment technique.
