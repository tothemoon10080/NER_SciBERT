Glass-ceramics based on blast-furnace slag (56.78wt%) were prepared by mixing quartz sand, dolomite, limestone, clay as other batch constituents.
                  The nucleating agents Cr2O3, LiF, CaF2 and TiO2 were added to the batches to study their effects on the crystallization, phase assemblages, and microstructure. Glass-ceramics were obtained by single and double heat-treatment schedules and examined by DTA, XRD and polarizing microscope. The presence of Cr2O3, TiO2, CaF2 and LiF was found to enhance the crystallizability of the glass. Cr2O3 and TiO2 are much better than LiF and CaF2 in promoting homogeneous nucleation and the formation of extremely fine-grained microstructure of aluminous pyroxene and magnetite.Glass-ceramics has been developed since the early 1960s, in Russia using waste materials, by employing slag of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, ashes and wastes from mining and chemical industries Blast-furnace slag is formed in the processes of pig iron manufactured from iron ore, coke, fluxes of limestone and other materials. If the molten slag was cooled quickly by high-pressure water, fine grains glass of vitreous Ca–Al–Mg silicate can be formed Research and development investigations pertaining to glass-ceramic materials have been underway for more than three decades The composition of such glass-ceramics can mainly be located in the SiO In previous paper The compositions of the base glass and the added nucleating agents are listed in Scans were carried out using a Shimadzu DTG60 micro differential thermo analyzer using 60 In single-stage heat-treatment schedule glass samples were heated in a muffle furnace from room temperature to the required temperature and kept at the intended temperature for 2 Crystalline phase identification for the powdered glass-ceramic samples was conducted by the X-ray diffraction analysis using a Bruker D8 Advance, Germany adopting Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. The mineralogical constitution and microstructure of the heat treated specimens were examined optically in thin sections using a polarizing Carl Zeiss research microscope.  The effect of Cr The addition of 0.5% Cr The presence of Cr Mineralogically, the presence of Cr From the microstructures point of view, the results ( Lithium fluoride was used in amount of 2 The presence of LiF in the glass greatly facilitates diopside solid solution phase and magnetite when heat-treated at 850  Microscopic examination of the double-stage heat–treatment showed that glass with LiF addition is mostly effective on the nucleation process. As indicated by the high crystallizability of the glass and the relatively coarser texture ( Calcium fluoride was used in amount of 2 The effect of CaF The presence of CaF  Microscopic examination of the double-stage heat–treatment glass showed that the CaF From DTA studies ( The effect of titanium dioxide additions may be summarized as follows: The addition of 2% TiO The presence of TiO The presence of TiO The beneficial effect of Cr Sawai The preferential formation of aluminous pyroxene over plagioclase in the Cr The results have shown that the introduction of fluoride produced a marked lowering of the temperature at which crystallization begins and, consequently, a widening of the crystallization range. The observed decrease in the melting temperatures and the temperatures at which crystallization occurs indicate a decrease in the viscosities of the glasses. This decrease in viscosity can be attributed to the weakening of the glass network structure brought about by fluorides Fluorides may act as network breakers in the glassy anionic structure Fluorides are also known to be immiscible in silicate melts, especially at lower temperatures, leading to two-phase glass separation comprising numerous droplets of one glass dispersed in another, the formation of such phase separation decreases the energy barriers necessary for crystallization. In this respect, it has been found by Nikandrov The presence of fluorides helps in the formation of diopside solid solution and magnetite at low temperature and transformation of diopside solid solution into diopside and favored formation of anorthite and fayalite at high temperature. This variability of mineral formation can be ascribed to the strong effect of fluorine ions on reducing the viscosity of the crystallizing glass. As a result it facilitates migration and diffusion of the ions and ionic complexes present to such an extent that crystallization of the structurally more complex silicates which can take place, e.g. the anorthite and fayalite formation. According to the results obtained from TiO In glasses containing TiO For glass in which the ratio of oxygen ions/network forming cations is greater than 2, there must be non-bridging oxygen ions, a lowering of the free energy will follow, if chemical differentiation occurs to give domains in which the silica network is continuous and which are separated from each other by the non-bridging oxygen The presence of TiO These results are in good agreement with the literature concerning the nature of crystallization of calcium magnesium aluminosilicates Diopside ss (aluminum pyroxene) (CaAl
