The effects of additive agents and growth behavior of perovskite phase as well as temperature change of slag at semi industry scale test were studied. The results show that the increase of steel slag does good to titania enrichment, however, it isn't useful for the growth and coarsening of the perovskite phase. The additive Si-Fe powder can promote titania enrichment and make perovskite phase grow up easily. While air is blown into the molten slag, the reduced components in slag are oxidized and the released heat raises the temperature of slag.
