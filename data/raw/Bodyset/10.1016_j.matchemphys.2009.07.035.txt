The effects of newly synthesized three alkylimidazolium ionic liquids—1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (BMIC), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (HMIC) and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (OMIC)—on the corrosion of aluminum in 1.0M HCl were investigated using potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and weight loss methods. All measurements showed that the inhibition efficiency increased with increase in the concentration of inhibitor and the effectiveness of these inhibitors was in the order of OMIC>HMIC>BMIC. Polarization curves revealed that the studied inhibitors were mixed type inhibitors. The adsorption of the inhibitors on the aluminum surface obeyed Langmuir adsorption isotherm and had a physical mechanism.

The corrosion inhibition of aluminum in acid medium has been reported recently by using hydrazone Imidazolium compounds are reported to show corrosion resistant behavior on copper The present study is undertaken to investigate the inhibition effect of three imidazolium ionic liquids, namely 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (BMIC), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (HMIC) and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides (OMIC) on the corrosion inhibition of aluminum in 1.0 The used corrosion inhibitors 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides were laboratory synthesis and the specific synthetic methods were similar to those described previously The H NMR spectrum for BMIC (300 The H NMR spectrum for HMIC (300 The H NMR spectrum for OMIC (300 Prior to all measurements, the purity aluminum samples of the following chemical composition (wt.%): Al (99.95%), Cu (0.01%), Mg (0.02%), Si (0.02%), Mn (0.002%) and Zn (0.005%) were polished successively with a sequence of emery papers of different grades (600, 800 and 1200) and 0.5 Gravimetric measurements were performed on aluminum samples with a rectangular form (1 Electrochemical impedance (EIS) measurements and potentiodynamic polarization studies were carried out using a GAMRY PCl4/300 electrochemical work station. All electrochemical experiments were performed in a conventional three electrodes electrochemical cell at 303 The potentiodynamic polarization curves for aluminum in 1.0 The electrochemical parameters such as corrosion potential ( As can be seen in The effects of the inhibitor concentration on the impedance behavior of aluminum in 1.0 The depressed form of the higher frequency loop reflects the surface inhomogeneity of structural or interfacial origin, such as those found in adsorption processes All the impedance parameters are derived from Nyquist plots and the IE of all examined inhibitors are given in The weight loss results of aluminum in 1.0 The effect of temperature on the inhibition efficiency for aluminum in 1.0 The inhibition efficiencies are found to decrease with increasing the solution temperature from 303 to 333 A plot of the natural logarithm of the corrosion rate (mg As known that organic inhibitors establish their inhibition via the adsorption of the inhibitor molecules onto the metal surface. The adsorption process is influenced by the chemical structures of organic compounds, the distribution of charge in molecule, the nature and surface charge of metal and the type of aggressive media The surface coverage values were calculated from Eq. The free energy of adsorption (Δ Corrosion of aluminum in aqueous solution has been reported The controlling step in the metal dissolution is the complexation reaction between the hydrated cation and the anion present Eq.  The three alkylimidazolium ionic liquids studied show a good inhibition property for the corrosion of aluminum in 1.0 All the inhibitors act as mixed type inhibitors in 1.0 The corrosion inhibition action of the studied compounds is mainly due to their adsorption on the aluminum surface. The adsorption of the inhibitors molecules from acid solution obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The value of free energy of the adsorption indicates that the inhibitors adsorb on aluminum by a physisorption-based mechanism.
