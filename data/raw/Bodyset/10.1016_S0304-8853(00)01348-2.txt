From the investigation of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy at 4.2K, the disappearance of the spin reorientation for compositions x≳0.85 is expected.Nd In this paper, we report the effect of Dy-substitution on the spin reorientation and magnetocrytalline anisotropy in (Nd The alloys of (Nd  The SRA of (Nd Here,  The magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants Here, In the case of the experiments performed above
