The negative slope of yield stress versus d
                     âˆ’1/2 in ECAPed AZ61 alloys can be explained by the gradual transition of the texture during repetitive equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) to control the grain size. Electron backscatter diffraction results of the present study show that texture modification occurs during ECAP.Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) provides a technique for producing microstructures with ultra-fine grain sizes in the submicrometer or nanometer range in bulk materials by introducing extremely large plastic straining during deformation processing The AZ61 alloy was extruded to the rod with a diameter of 17 mm and then cut to pieces with a length of 100 mm. ECA pressing was carried out through a die made of SKD 61 with an internal angle (   In It is well known that the restricted number of slip systems, and therefore the limited ductility in HCP metals requires that ECAP is conducted at an elevated temperature EBSD grain images of the as-extruded (unECAPed) (a), one-passed (b) and eight-passed (c) alloys are shown in The pole figures of the unECAPed and ECAPed alloys determined by the EBSD method are shown in One interesting observation in the present study (AZ61) and that by Mukai et al. (AZ31) The orientation distribution of each subgrain measured with EBSD is shown in The negative slope of yield stress versus This work was supported by Grant no. 2000-1-30100-013-3 from the Basic Research Program of the Korea Science & Engineering Foundation.
