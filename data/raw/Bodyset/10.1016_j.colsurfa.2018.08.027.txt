A series of sodium polyacrylate copolymers (i.e., poly acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid-co-2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid or PSIA with different molecular weights and monomer molar ratios) were synthesized based on acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid (PAI) as water-based dispersants for ultrafine grinding of praseodymium-doped zirconium silicate (Pr-ZrSiO4). The particle size/size distribution, suspension rheology and dispersant adsorption were analyzed by laser particle size analysis, rheometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry (TG) and electrokinetic potential measurement, respectively. Compared to the dispersant PAI, the use of the dispersant PSIA1 with a greater molecular weight in the Pr-ZrSiO4 suspension ground for 45 min at pH values 7.0–8.0 can give a finer product with the narrower particle size distribution. The dispersant PSIA1 used in ultrafine grinding has a suitable viscosity of the suspension and generates more hydrogen bonds on the particle surface, and sulfonic acid group in the dispersant PSIA1 can provide a greater charge density than carboxylic acid groups in the dispersant PAI. In addition, the total potential energies between the particles in suspension with different copolymer dispersants at different pH values were also calculated. It is indicated that the effective ultrafine grinding of the particles is related to the total interparticle potential energy provided by the dispersant PSIA1 at pH 7.0–8.0.Polymeric dispersants for the preparation of water-based industrial suspensions like paints, pigments, paper coatings, printing inks, and cosmetics are essential due to the environmental protection issues [ In wet ultrafine grinding, the particle size and physical/chemical properties of the particle surface (van der Waals forces, electrostatic forces, and chemical groups) are closely related to the rheological properties of the suspension. Meanwhile, the fluidity of the suspension is also important for the dispersion. Moreover, it is important for wet ultrafine grinding to handle the proper slurry fluidity in a mill effectively. Polymer dispersants play a significant role in ultrafine grinding process. Adding a small amount of dispersant can reduce the particle size in grinding process under a short time, control the viscosity of ground suspension, and improve the dispersion performance of the particles in suspension. Bilgili et al [ Although polycarboxylates is widely used as a dispersant for dense suspensions with ultrafine particles, it has some disadvantages, namely, the charge density of carboxylic acid groups is relatively low, and it is difficult to provide an effective electrostatic repulsive force between particles, especially for inorganic particles. Also, the wet ability is ineffective when using polycarboxylates as a dispersant due to the poor adsorption on particle surface, leading to a decreased grinding efficiency in wet ultrafine grinding [ Praseodymium-doped zirconium silicate (PZS/Pr-ZrSiO Hence, we synthesized a series of sodium polyacrylate copolymers (i.e., poly acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid-co-2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (PSIA Solvents and reagents were purchased and used without any purification unless noted otherwise. They are acrylic acid (AA, purity: 99%), itaconic acid (IA, purity: 99%), 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS, purify: 99%), ammonium persulphate (APS, purity：99%), and sodium hypophosphite (NaH For the copolymerization of poly acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid (PAI) as a reference sample for the comparison purpose, a typical procedure was used [ For the copolymerization of poly acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid-co-2-acrylamide- 2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (PSIA) [ A suspension with micron-sized Pr-ZrSiO The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of various samples were determined from KBr disks on a model Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Co., Germany) in the wave number range of 100–4000 cm The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of polymeric dispersant samples was measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) (Waters Co., Ltd., USA) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min using 0.02 mol/L KH The Zeta potentials on the particle surface were determined by a model SZ-100 nanoparticle analyzer (Horiba Co., Ltd., Japan). The pH value of the prepared samples in the presence and absence of different polymeric dispersants was adjusted. The average value of the Zeta potentials, which were measured for three times, was used. The particle size distribution and the median particle size (d The polymeric dispersant adsorption on particle surface was characterized by a model Q500 thermogravimeter (TG) (TA Instruments Co., USA) in air at a heating rate of 10 ℃ min The amount of adsorption ( The rheologic properties of the Pr-ZrSiO    These results reveal that the copolymer dispersants, especially PSIA In order to clarify why the grinding performance of the Pr-ZrSiO As is well known, the effective motions of suspension-bead mixture are related to its flow behavior in the grinding chamber. The optimization of the rheological behavior of a ground suspension can enhance energy efficiency and throughput in wet ultrafine grinding operation [ In In     It was suggested that the adsorption density in sodium polycarboxylate polymer could be greater than that in other polymers, and the charge density mainly controlled the adsorption process [ Besides the steric hindrance effect of polymer dispersant on the particles due to the adsorption, electrokinetic potential on the Pr-ZrSiO To further clarify whether the effective ultrafine grinding with copolymer dispersant occurs, we also calculate the interparticle energies. It is the synergy result of van der Waals energy ( The electrostatic double-layer repulsion energy ( And the polymer dispersant adsorbed onto the surface of the particle also has a steric hindrance energy. The ( As is well known, the effective grinding of particles in the suspension can be related to the electrostatic and steric hindrance energies provided by a copolymer dispersant at a certain pH value against the van der Waals interaction energy. That is, an attainment of stable suspension with a reduced interparticle attachment/cohesion and accordingly an alleviation of particle settling during grinding process are considered to favor the effective ultrafine grinding performance. A finer ground product with the narrower size distribution should be obtained when the particles ground in the presence of polymer dispersant are prohibited from re-condensation to aggregation with a substantially increased size [  Besides, the total potential energy of interaction between the particles at different polymer dispersants and pH values was obtained by the summation of the electrostatic double-layer, the van der Waals and the steric hindrance energies. This total energy was calculated at various pH values. A series of acrylic copolymers (i.e., poly acrylic acid-co-itaconic acid-co-2- acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid or PSIA) were synthesized and used as water-based dispersants for ultrafine grinding of the Pr-ZrSiO It was indicated that the polymer dispersant PSIA The theoretical interpretation in terms of the total interparticle potential energy indicated that the electrostatic double-layer and steric hindrance repulsion energies against the van der Waals attractive energy played an important role in the effective ultrafine grinding of Pr-ZrSiO This work was supported by the
