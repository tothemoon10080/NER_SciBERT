Due to the environmental impact of construction and demolition waste (CDW), recycling is mandatory. It is also important that recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) are used in concrete to meet market demands. In the literature, the influence of RCAs on concrete has been investigated, but very limited studies have been conducted on how the origin of concrete waste and comminution processes influence RCA characteristics. This paper aims to investigate the influence of three different comminution and sizing processes (simple screening, crushing and grinding) on the composition, shape and porosity characteristics of RCA obtained from concrete block waste. Crushing and grinding implies a reduction of RCA porosity. However, due to the presence of coarse quartz rounded river pebbles in the original concrete block mixtures, the shape characteristics deteriorated. A large amount of powder (<0.15mm) without detectable anhydrous cement was also generated.Construction and demolition waste (CDW), which is usually composed of different types of concretes and mortars, ceramic blocks and tiles, and other secondary materials (paper, wood, plastics and metals), represents more than 50% of the total municipal solid waste in Brazil and Europe as well as other countries ( The use of coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) in concrete has been investigated since the end of World War II. Since then, it has been proven to be technically feasible ( The amount of porous residual cement paste attached to the surface of natural aggregates explains the water absorption of RCA ( Other techniques, such as heat treatment before comminution (milling in this case), were also used in processing to remove the cement paste ( Choices regarding the comminution process are crucial to establish the most technically and economically feasible conditions for recycling. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of three different comminution and sizing processes on the RCA characteristics obtained from concrete block waste, the fourth most commonly used building component in the Brazilian pre-cast industry. The experimental procedure involved the following three steps ( Structural masonry concrete blocks with a 28-day characteristic compressive strength ( To meet the technical aspects of commonly used aggregates for concrete block production, three different recycling processing strategies were followed:    Screening (Route 1) is a low-cost process; however, it produces a high porosity coarse fraction (>9.52 The three investigated comminution processes allow for the production of recycled aggregates with grain size distributions similar to those commonly used in concrete block production ( The objective of the characterization of the recycled concrete aggregates (RCA-1, RCA-2 and RCA-3) was to evaluate the particle size and shape distribution as well as the presence of porous hardened cement paste, according to the procedures detailed below:        A rough energy consumption estimation for each processing route was completed according to the methodology proposed by Eq. (1) calculates the energy consumption per metric tonne of processed material of electrical equipment. The energy consumption of each route (    Although the results do not indicate a significant difference, they indicate that comminution processes, in this specific case, generate elongated particles, contrary to what is expected of such processes; this will be further explored in the micrograph results. The average chemical composition of the recycled concrete aggregates is presented in The content of CaO With respect to the powders (grain size Comparing the recycled aggregates RCA-1, RCA-2 and RCA-3, there is an increase in the distribution of CaO The relative reduction in CaO Comparative diffractograms of the sample powders (grain size In the 28-day-old concrete block waste used in this study, the presence of anhydrous phases, such as belite (C Comminution led to a successive increase in the quartz contents in powders (grain size Likewise, the concentration reduction of Ca(OH) Comminution processes reduced the hardened cement paste attached to the recycled concrete aggregates. Therefore, the content of CaO Despite the powder content increase in RCA-3 resulting in a higher amount of cement paste, the occurrence of anhydrous (not hydrated) phases was not detected. These results may be related to the low amount of cement commonly used in concrete block production (approximately 150 The average density, water absorption, and insoluble residue of the fractions above 0.15 As expected, crushing caused a slight reduction (5% relative) of RCA-2 water absorption in relation to the value of RCA-1 obtained by sieving. This result corroborates the findings of the decreasing CaO The results from the acid attack demonstrated that RCA-1 is composed of 91.8% insoluble residues (natural aggregates), i.e., 8.2% of the soluble material in the HCl solution (mainly cement paste). The proportion of insoluble material in the HCl solution increases to 97.4% in RCA-3, confirming the reduction of the hardened cement paste in the grinding product with a grain size above 0.15 Illustrative images of the representative aliquots of the products generated by routes 1 and 3 before (RCA-1 and RCA-3) and after leaching in the HCl solution (insoluble residue – IR) (RCA-1 IR and RCA-3 IR) are shown in The studied recycled concrete aggregates have porous cement paste adhered to the surface of the natural grains, most notably for the RCA-1 product, because it is not possible to visualize the shape of the natural aggregates used in the original concrete. The presence of a large amount of natural aggregate particles (with none or little adhered hardened cement) is clearly apparent in RCA-3 because of the better phase detachments promoted by comminution. Images of the insoluble residues (the recycled aggregates after dissolution of the cement paste) show that the natural aggregates used in concrete block waste are composed of fine sand and gravel, e.g. river rounded pebbles (predominant mineral: quartz), with a more spherical and regular (not elongated) shape. The RCA-3 IR is notable similarity to RCA-3 due to the small content of adhered cement paste on its surface; it is primarily composed of more irregular (elongated) quartz grains (light colour minerals), feldspars and mafic minerals (dark minerals derived from the crushing of rocks). The size and shape distribution of the particles of the recycled aggregates (RCA-1 and RCA-3) and of the insoluble residue after chemical attack (RCA-1 IR and RCA-3 IR) are shown in The aggregates after leaching (RCA-1_IR and RCA-3_IR) have a slightly finer particle size distribution and less spherical and more elongated particle distribution due to the removal of the cement paste adhered to the surface of the particles. These differences are more noticeable in RCA-1, which contains a higher proportion of cement paste adhered to the surface. Compared to the screening process, crushing and grinding worsened the shape (the aspect ratio) of RCA due to the presence of quartz rounded river pebbles, which were only assessed by a microscope after the removal of the attached hardened cement paste by the acid attack. After grinding, the presence of regular pebble particles in the RCA-3 sample is essentially negligible. The comminution process results in more elongated particles of minerals (quartz, feldspar and mica). The quartz pebble shape, acquired by weathering, is the main factor that contributes to a more regular shape (higher b/l – aspect ratio) of the recycled concrete aggregates obtained solely by sieving. Comminution of weathered regular quartz was responsible for the elongation of the RCA obtained by grinding.  According to the Brazilian standard, “Aggregates for Concrete – Specification” (ABNT NBR 7211: 2009), the powder content (grain size  As expected, Route 3 (crushing, grinding and screening) is the method that requires the most energy: 1.8 times more energy than Route 2 (crushing and screening) and 7 times more energy than Route 1 (screening). Considering the estimated energy consumption of Route 1 as the baseline, The comminution and sizing routes of concrete block waste generated RCAs with different chemical and mineralogical compositions, particle size distributions, particle shapes and porosity. Preferable comminution of low hardness cement paste of RCAs occurs rather than of quartz and feldspar from natural aggregates. Crushing followed by grinding was effective in reducing the hardened paste attached to RCA. However, a low porosity fine aggregate (water absorption of 3.5%) was produced, and a high mass of powders (<0.15 In this study, the acid attack of RCA allowed natural aggregates to be recovered and their shape changes to be analysed. Crushing and grinding produced irregular and elongated fine RCA due to the comminution of coarse quartz rounded river pebbles. This change of shape should be considered because this natural aggregate is used worldwide in concrete block mixtures. The relative increase of energy consumption and processing costs by crushing and grinding was approximately 7 times higher than the more simple recycling process (pre-fragmentation and screening) and roughly 1.8 times higher than ordinary recycling (pre-fragmentation, crushing and screening). Despite the RCA porosity reduction from concrete block waste, no other benefits in terms of shape and anhydrous cement content were observed.
