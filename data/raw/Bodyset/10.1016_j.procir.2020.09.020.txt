Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) â€“ polycarbonate (PC) multi-materials with a PBT mass content of 25% to 75% were produced for the powder bed fusion process by the means of co-grinding and spray agglomeration. The influence of the PC content and the process parameters on the thermal properties of the obtained powders are discussed in detail. Compared to pure PBT powder, the PBT/PC multi-materials crystallize at lower temperatures, which improves the handling during the additive manufacturing process.
