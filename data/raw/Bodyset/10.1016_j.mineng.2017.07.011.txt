The present work considers the neutralisation of bauxite residue (red mud) with CO2 as a potential technology for reducing the acid consumption in the acidic leaching step for metal recovery. The pH of bauxite residue was reduced during neutralisation by the transformation of hydroxide ions to (hydrogen) carbonate ions. Neutralisation at high CO2 partial pressures and high temperatures reduces the alkalinity of the bauxite residue, but it leads to the stabilisation of silicate compounds such as cancrinite and grossular. After acidic leaching of the neutralised product with sulfuric acid, a decrease by 20% in the dissolution yield of Al, Fe, and Ti was observed, due to an insufficient amount of acid devoted to leaching as the transformation of calcite into bassanite and the high concentration of silicate compounds consumed part of the acid. Sc recovery by leaching of the highly neutralised bauxite residue was about 35wt%, which depends on Fe and Ti recovery. A positive correlation between La/Nd with Sc indicates that the recovery of La/Nd indirectly depends on the extraction of Fe/Ti, as Sc is chemically associated to these major metals.Bauxite residue (red mud) is the waste product generated during alumina production by the Bayer process, and it is composed essentially of non-soluble elements such as iron and titanium minerals, un-digested alumina minerals, sodium aluminium hydrosilicates, calcium minerals and significant amounts of minor and trace elements such as scandium, yttrium and lanthanides, i.e. the so-called rare earth elements (REEs) ( Several methods for recovering valuable elements from bauxite residue have been reported ( The alkalinity of bauxite residue is an important issue for metal recovery by acidic leaching, because part of the acid must be used for the neutralisation of the alkaline products left behind after the Bayer process. This leads to a large acid consumption and makes the recovery of metals from bauxite residue often not economical. In order to reduce the amount of acid needed for neutralisation of bauxite residue and, consequently, to develop a more sustainable process for metal recovery, alternative neutralisation routes must be considered. The use of carbonic acid (H The objective of this paper is to evaluate the recovery of valuable metals after the reduction of bauxite residueâ€™s alkalinity by transformation of hydroxides into soluble carbonate compounds during the neutralisation by CO The bauxite residue studied in this paper was kindly provided by Aluminium of Greece (Agios Nikolaos, Greece). It originates from a mixture of karst and lateritic bauxites. It was received from the alumina refinery after dewatering by filter presses and room temperature drying. Upon arrival in the lab, the sample was further dried at 105 Neutralisation at ambient conditions of bauxite residue with CO High-pressure neutralisation experiments were carried out in a titanium autoclave (Parr Company, series 4560) varying the partial pressure of CO Neutralisation of bauxite residue with HCl (37%, Fisher Scientific) and H All the experiments, i.e. neutralisation and leaching, were carried out in triplicate to ensure reproducibility of the results. The errors were determined as the standard deviations on the results.

Perovskite (CaTiO Neutralisation of bauxite residue by the early removal of hydroxide compounds may help to decrease the amount of acid during the further recovery of metals via acidic leaching.
