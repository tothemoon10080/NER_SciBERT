Certain plant species have the ability to grow in trace element-polluted soils without showing any negative symptoms. These species could be considered for phytoremediation techniques and their presence might influence the abundance, activity and composition of soil microbial communities. In this work we investigated the root-induced changes in chemical (pH, soluble trace element concentrations, total organic C, water-soluble C, and nitrogen concentrations) and biochemical (microbial biomass C, β-glucosidase activity and protease activity) properties caused by Populus alba on two contaminated soils (one with neutral pH (AZ) and other with acid pH (DO)) for a period of over 36 months. The results were compared to those obtained with a non-contaminated soil. The experiment was carried out in containers. At the end of the experiment, samples of the soil directly adhered to the root and that located more than 5cm from the root were also studied. The results showed that, in neutral soils, poplar did not influence soil pH; the greatest effect on pH due to plant growth was found in acid soil. Poplar presence increased C sources, through root exudates, in all soils. In AZ soil, poplar maintained chemical and biochemical properties, whereas an important decrease in soil quality was observed in the same bare soils. The effect of poplar development on soil quality was even more appreciable in acid contaminated soil (DO), in which the tree also produced a strong increment of soil pH, a decrease in trace element concentrations and an improvement of chemical and biochemical properties. We concluded that P. alba is a suitable plant for the phytoremediation of trace element contaminated soils. Moreover, root exudates of this species may be responsible for the improvement of soil quality in trace element contaminated soils.Trace elements can to be toxic to living organisms when present at excessive concentrations ( Plants influence the biomass, activity and composition of the soil microbial communities through their rhizodepositions containing a large variety of labile C compounds ( For the restoration of heavy metal contaminated soils, different strategies can be adopted. Green plants have been employed in recent years as a means of stabilizing and/or removing metals from contaminated soils. The re-vegetation activity aims to stabilize the site, to establish a cover crop that will prevent the dispersal of metal-contaminated particles by water or wind erosion and to reduce metal mobility by rhizosphere-induced adsorption and precipitation processes ( Fast growing trees with high transpiration rates, such as poplar, have been of particular interest for phytoremediation of trace element-polluted soils ( We hypothesized that The experiment was carried out in semi field conditions using three different soils: a non-polluted soils, (CO pH 7.5), and two trace-element contaminated soils, (AZ pH 7.4 and DO pH 3.0). Soil CO was collected in an experimental farm of the Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiología de Sevilla (IRNAS-CSIC) located in Coria del Rio, Seville (37°17′08″ N, 6°04′1.5″ W). The trace-element polluted soils, AZ and DO, were collected in the area affected by a mine spill (South West of Spain, Containers filled with these soils were planted with white poplar saplings (6 The main characteristics of the soils are shown in Containers were irrigated daily during the growth phase (April to November), though a drip irrigation hose with two emitter of 4 Soil samples were taken with an auger at 0–20 At the end of the experiment after the removal of the tree from the container the soil adhered to the root (RS) and soil located at more than 5 Soil pH was measured in a 1/2.5 sample/1 Kjeldahl N (N-Kjel) of soil was determined after digesting the soil samples by the method described by Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content was determined by the chloroform fumigation–extraction method modified by The soil β-glucosidase activity was measured as reported by Protease activity was measured using casein as substrate and colorimetric determination of the released tyrosine, according to All statistical analyses were carried out with the program SPSS 15.0 for Windows. A Student's Sun ray plots were constructed to compare graphically the mean values of different studied parameters in each soil and treatment. The star shape and integrated area for each treatment allow a comparison of visual and statistical presentations of multivariate data. Soil chemical and biochemical properties for the three soils and soil contamination in the case of DO soil, were designed; the integrated area of the plot for each treatment was measured using the measuring tools of Adobe Acrobat 9 The pH values of CO and AZ soils were close to neutral or slightly alkaline, whereas DO soil presented an acid pH ( Trace element concentrations extracted with 0.01 Values of pH in root soil (RS) and bulk soils in the last sampling (October 2011) are shown in In this last sampling, available trace element concentrations extracted with 0.01 Total organic carbon (TOC) contents at different times of the experiment (0, 18 and 36 months) are shown in The presence of Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was positively affected by plant growth and the highest concentrations were found in soils with poplars, except in DO soils where this effect was only observed at some sampling times ( Values of β-glucosidase activity are shown in For each soil, values of WSC and MBC were similar in RS to those found in the rest of the soil (bulk soil) ( Contents of Kjeldahl N in the soils at the beginning of the experiment were higher in contaminated soils (AZ and DO) than in control soils. These values (with and without poplars) were similar throughout the studied period and, in general, were slightly lower in bare soils ( In neutral soils (CO and AZ), values of NH Contents of NO Poplar presence also stimulated the soil protease activity, although differences with unplanted soils were not significant due to the variability of the data ( Protease values in the rhizosphere soils are shown in For a general interpretation of all studied parameters referred in our samples, the data were represented in sunray plots and the values of each parameter were transformed to their corresponding standard scores in order to fit them into the graphs ( In general, in non-contaminated soil (CO) ( The effect of poplar development on the improvement of parameters related to soil quality was even larger in acid contaminated soil (DO), in which the tree also produced a strong increment of pH values ( In our study, at the end of the experiment, TOC increased in soils planted with poplar compared to bare soil ( Water soluble C originates mainly from release of organic substances from fresh material during decomposition and significantly contributes to soil nutrient cycling ( Microbial biomass plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling ( Values of β-glucosidase activity in soils with poplar were significantly higher than in bare soils, and the stimulation of various enzyme activities during the mineralization of root exudates has been reported ( Poplar growth also influenced the measured parameters related to N turnover in soil, thus confirming that N turnover is faster in planted than in bare soils ( Protease activity is involved in N turnover in soil through the hydrolysis of proteins and peptides ( The general presentation of the data in the sun-ray plots ( The fact that there were no relevant differences between the soil directly adhered to the roots and that located close to the roots could be due to the semi-field conditions of the experiment. Although several authors using Poplar plantation increased MBC, β-glucosidase and protease activities of trace element contaminated soils likely through rhizodeposition, and aided in improving the quality of the contaminated soils. The presence of a root system might prove important for readily soluble C and N sources that influence the biochemical properties related to C and N cycles. Indeed, the fresh input of nutrients, by litter decomposition and root exudation, should stimulate microbial activity and accelerate the recovery process. Moreover, biochemical properties seemed to be the appropriate indicators of the available heavy metal fraction after Considering the complex role of the rhizosphere no relevant differences were observed between the soils directly adhered to the roots and bulk soil.
