Multipass friction stir processing of brittle as-cast hypereutectic Al–Si alloy resulted in bimodal distribution of ultrafine silicon particles in nano-size aluminum matrix. As compared to the as-cast material, the stress–strain curves revealed simultaneous increase in strength by four times and in ductility by 14 times after three overlap multipass FSP. The transformation from brittle cleavage fracture to completely ductile fracture is confirmed by the fractographs of tensile samples taken before and after the friction stir processing.Contemporary high performance structural materials are being established by their superior mechanical properties, particularly, the strength, ductility and toughness The method for casting of hypereutectic Al–30Si alloy plate and the parameters along with tool details for multipass FSP are presented elsewhere Microstructure of as-cast alloy mainly consists of long Si platelets dispersed in aluminum matrix, The engineering stress–strain curves of Al–30Si alloy in as-cast and after FSP are shown in The properties of Al–Si alloy is determined by the distinct physical properties of phases present, viz. the face centered cubic ductile α-aluminum solid solution and A4 diamond cubic hard and brittle silicon crystals, and their sizes, volume fractions and morphology The significant changes in microstructural features by FSP resulted in simultaneous enhancement of strength and ductility. A considerable strain hardening from the slope of stress–strain curve can be clearly seen after the first pass itself (  By friction stir processing technique, the massive primary silicon particles were significantly refined. The size, shape, morphology and volume fraction of primary silicon particles act as the governing factors for the transition from brittle to ductile behavior of hypereutectic Al–Si alloy. This simultaneous strengthening and ductilizing of the hypereutectic Al–30Si alloy, elucidating interesting processing–structure–property correlation, could be utilized for the purpose of fabrication of packaging components.
