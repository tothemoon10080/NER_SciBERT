The hydrophobic flocculation technology applied to fine minerals and coals beneficiation is described in this paper on the basis of the investigations in laboratory. Initially, a brief description to this process is made. Then, the three important factors of hydrophobic flocculation, namely particle hydrophobicity, kinetic energy input and non-polar oil, are theoretically discussed. Finally, the examples of this process applied to the beneficiation of hematite, sulfide minerals and coal in fine size range are presented. The experimental results suggest that hydrophobic flocculation technology is a promising mean to efficiently recover valuable minerals in the form of fine dissemination.
