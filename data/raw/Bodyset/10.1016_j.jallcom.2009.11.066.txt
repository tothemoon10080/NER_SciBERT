Crystallographic calculation based on the edge-to-edge matching model predicted that both TiB2 and Al3Ti intermetallic compounds have strong potential to be effective grain refiners for β phase in the Mg–14Li–1Al alloy due to the small atomic matching misfit across the interface between the compounds and β phase. Experimental results showed that addition of 1.25wt%Al–5Ti–1B master alloy reduced grain size of β phase in the alloy from 1750 to 500μm. The possible grain refining mechanisms were also discussed.As the lightest engineering alloy, Mg–Li alloy has attracted increasing interests in transportation industries as these sectors seek increasing fuel efficiency through weight reduction. The most common and typical Mg–Li based alloy is LA141 (Mg–14Li–1Al) that contains full β-Li phase at room temperature and is the most common wrought alloy due to its superior plasticity and ductility. However, this alloy also suffers from low strength Commercial LA141 alloy with chemical composition of Mg–13.5 Optical micrographs of the as-cast LA141 alloys with different addition levels of Al–5Ti–1B master alloy are shown in One may argue that the grain refinement of LA141 alloy may be resulted from solute effect due to the change of solute concentration after addition of the master alloy. Because the concentration of Ti and B in the Al–5Ti–1B master alloy is very low and most of Ti and B is in the form of stable TiB Grain refining efficiency of inoculated particles, to the utmost extent, depends on crystallographic atomic matching between the particles and the metal matrix TiB Following the matching rules that straight rows match with straight rows and zigzag rows with zigzag rows Commercially available Al–5Ti–1B master alloy can be used to refine the grains of cast LA141 alloy.
