In this research, mechanical activation (MA) was employed for leaching rate improvement of molybdenite concentrate in nitric acid media. These experiments were performed in two groups: with and without aluminum oxide (alumina). A full factorial design was used for each group of experiments. Leaching rate increment up to 5 times was observed only in 2hours activation procedure. XRD analysis demonstrated structural disordering in activated MoS2. TEM images showed that particle size has been reduced to nanoscale. The initial powder size was 80% between 2-44Î¼m and dropped to about 10nm and 140nm in MA experiments with and without alumina, respectively. This size reduction would be the main reason of leaching rate enhancement which is more achievable in MA in presence of alumina. The results demonstrate that alumina has a motivating effect in activation procedure to achieve a nanostructure molybdenite. Analysis of variance revealed milling speed is the main parameter in MA without alumina, while, ball to powder ratio is the most important factor in MA procedure in presence of alumina on leaching rate.
