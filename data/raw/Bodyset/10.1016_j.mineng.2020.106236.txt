The basic principle of a Knelson Concentrator (KC) is the differential settling velocities of particles in a medium under a centrifugal field. Whether the ore particles remain in the KC bowl depends on the terminal settling velocity (
                        v
                     ) of the particles and the fluidization water flow velocity (
                        V
                     ). Both variables are functions of the material properties and the operating parameters. This study reports the relations between the retained mass of quartz in each ring of the KC bowl (obtained by measuring the quartz mass ring by ring) and the rotational speed, fluidization water flow rate, and particle size. The retained mass of quartz in each ring was then modeled by approximating the fluidization water velocity and defining a new ratio

                     . Based on the experimental data, the functional relation between the quartz mass in each ring of the KC bowl and the feed particle properties/operating conditions was fitted by a Weibull model. The model established by the ring-by-ring approach gives more accurate predictions than a previous model, and a model based on the quartz mass in the entire bowl.One of the most important mineral processing techniques is gravity separation. This eco-friendly technique with low installation requirements and operation cost is widely used in the gold ore processing industry ( The KC has become the preferred gravity device in gold recovery ( The efficiency of a KC is affected by the particle size, feed rate, gangue density, pulp density, fluidizing water pressure, and rotation speed. In general, the particle size (  A significant body of literature has focused on the free gold-recovery performance of KCs at different mine sites, or the influence of various factors on the separation performance. However, a fundamental understanding of the mineral particle behavior inside KCs under different operating conditions and a mechanistic model of the process are incomplete.    Both To improve the predictive accuracy of the model, the present study replaces the ratio of radial forces acting on a particle by a new ratio between the settling velocity and the flow velocity of the fluidization water. The mass of the minerals remaining in the enrichment bowl is then analyzed ring by ring. The behavior characteristics of the mineral particles in each ring of the KC bowl are evaluated on quartz (the main gangue of gold ore), and the retained quartz mass in each ring is computed by an empirical model. The results of this model are compared with those of a previous model, and with those of another model that computes the retained mass of quartz in the entire bowl of a given radius. The study material was quartz (2.65 g/cm Experiments were performed in a laboratory Knelson Concentrator (MD3). For convenience, the five rings of the bowl were marked as R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 from bottom to top. The main dimensions of each ring are listed in To remove the concentrates from the individual rings, the rings were blocked by a set of rubber stoppers of different diameters and suitable thickness. Heavy and light mineral particles in a KC are separated by the differential settling velocity in the centrifugal field. We denote the terminal settling velocity of a particle and the fluidization water flow velocity in ring A solid particle in the KC blow experiences three main forces, namely, the centripetal force ( The motion of spherical particles in the centrifugal field is governed by Newton’s second law: The terminal settling velocity of the particles differs in each ring, because the rings have different radii. According to Eq. The fluidization water flow velocity in The density and viscosity of water at room temperature are 998.2 kg·m    Quartz particles of various size fractions (−650 + 550 μm, −380 + 270 μm, −250 + 212 μm and −180 + 150 μm) were processed in the KC at various rotational speeds and fluidization water flow rates. At the end of each run, the mass of quartz collected in each ring was determined. The left panels of As shown in For a given particle size and rotational speed, the amount of retained quartz decreased with increasing fluidization water flow rate, because increasing the flow rate increases the flow velocity of the fluidization water The right panels of The retained masses of quartz in each ring were fitted by the Weibull model. The results are shown in The fitting results of the Weibull function in each ring are listed in The quartz mass As shown in The model was validated on particles with two size fractions (−550 + 425 μm and −212 + 180 μm) that were not used in the previous test. The −212 + 180 μm particles were fed along with fluidization water at flow rates of 5.0 and 9.0 L/min and rotational speeds of 1465 and 2072 rpm. The −550 + 425 μm particles were fed along with fluidization water at flow rates of 8.0 and 11.0 L/min and rotational speeds of 1465 and 2072 rpm. The validation for each set of conditions was repeated three times, and the The validation results confirm consistency between the predicted and measured quartz masses retained in each ring. Therefore, the prediction model is practical and effective. Based on the earlier experiments, another model of the retained mass of quartz was established in the entire enrichment bowl. The terminal settling velocity of the particles was calculated by Eq. As confirmed in Unlike other models, the ring-by-ring model will provide a foundation and theoretical support for the future research of two-component and multi-component feed separation. According to This study presented an approximate method for calculating the flow velocity of the fluidization water in each ring of a KC, and defined a new ratio of the particle-to-fluid velocities The fluidization water velocity decreases from the bottom to the top ring, specifically The mass of quartz retained in each ring decreases with increasing flow rate of the fluidization water. This occurs because increasing the flow rate increases the water velocity. When the water velocity exceeds the particle settling velocity, the particles will be moved out of the bowl. Increasing the particle size and rotational speed increases the mass of the quartz retained in each ring. This occurs because the settlement velocity exceeds the fluidization water velocity, so the particles accumulate in the bowl. By plotting the quartz mass retained in each ring against the The ring-by-ring model given by Eq.
