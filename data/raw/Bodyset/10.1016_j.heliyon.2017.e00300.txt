Databases catalogue the corpus of research literature into scientific categories and report classes of bibliometric data such as the number of citations to articles, the number of authors, journals, funding agencies, institutes, references, etc. The number of articles and citations in a category are gauges of productivity and scientific impact but a quantitative basis to compare researchers between categories is limited. Here, we compile a list of bibliometric indicators for 236 science categories and citation rates of the 500 most cited articles of each category. The number of citations per paper vary by several orders of magnitude and are highest in multidisciplinary sciences, general internal medicine, and biochemistry and lowest in literature, poetry, and dance. A regression model demonstrates that citation rates to the top articles in each category increase with the square root of the number of articles in a category and decrease proportionately with the age of the references: articles in categories that cite recent research are also cited more frequently. The citation rate correlates positively with the number of funding agencies that finance the research. The category h-index correlates with the average number of cites to the top 500 ranked articles of each category (

Following We restricted the work to the Each category file contains more than 40 columns of data including: article category, author's full name, title, journal, abstract, date, scientific field, affiliations, funding agencies, etc. Some errors remain in the database particularly related to the formatting of the references. We checked all references that were older than 500 years and corrected erroneous entries. The WoS citation index compiles data from 12 000 journals. It assigns many of these articles to more than one category such that the sum of the total number of articles is 11.3 million (although the overall total number of articles is only 6.5 million): 304 journals have articles that are duplicated in two categories, 68 are assigned to 3 categories, 16 to 4 categories and 4 journals to 5 categories. Articles from WoS assigns 337 000 articles to multidisciplinary materials and only 800 to poetry and African, Australian, and Canadian literature. Because of this large disparity in the number of articles per category, we combined similar categories to ensure that each had at least 4000 papers. For example, we added medical ethics to the ethics category and put folklore, and 6 literature categories to literary theory criticism. The mean number of papers in each category of the truncated dataset (236 categories) was The following list describes the bibliometric field indicators. We correlated the number of times papers are cited with bibliometric indicators. For each indicator, we developed a power law expression and calculated the We rank the categories from 1 to 236 based on the number of articles that WoS assigns to each. Multidisciplinary materials science, multidisciplinary chemistry, applied physics and chemical physics have the most articles (>240000) while demography, industrial labor relations and logic have the least (<4500). The first several dozen articles in as many as 20 categories have uncharacteristically high citations. The paper with 18103 citations inflates the mean category average of biochemistry molecular biology, genetics heredity, and evolutionary biology by 36. To reduce the variability introduced by these highly cited articles, we set The category The mean weighted average of the Total number of articles that WoS assigns to each category. Mean number of agencies that funded the research as reported in WoS funding agencies listed in the WoS. The total number of references in the bibliography of all 500 articles in a category. The Weibull distribution characterizes the relationship between the cumulative number of references, Astronomy astrophysics averages 116 co-authors per article, while particles fields physics averages 169 and nuclear physics average 290. The number of co-authors per article exceeds 15 in 15 categories. To avoid these anomalously high values, in our model, we fit the number of authors per article (in each category) to a Weibull function then assign the number of authors per paper, The fraction of 500 articles that the top 4 journals publish. In agricultural engineering, The The average of the number of citations to the top 500 papers per categories, Eq.

However, a power law model including the prime factors accounts for 86% of the variance: The number of papers in a category and the age of the references in these papers account for most of the variance in The second term variable, Most categories lie within 33% of the regression line but the regression model consistently underestimates the citations to the psychology categories and it overestimates many of the fine arts categories and some of the chemistry categories ( Publishing a highly cited paper is gratifying and confirms that the work has an impact on the scientific community. However, the number of citations the top articles accrue depends on factors other than quality and originality. We tabulate bibliometric indicators for the top 500 cited articles of 236 scientific categories and include the average impact factors of the journals that publish the articles, the category Citation rates, Most categories are within 33% of the Gregory S.
