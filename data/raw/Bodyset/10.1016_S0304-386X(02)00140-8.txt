The rate of forward extraction of La(III) from nitrate-acetato medium by bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272, H2A2) dissolved in toluene has been measured by the single drop technique. The rate of mass transfer per unit area is found to be proportional to [La(III)], [H2A2](o) and [H+]−1 at the interface. The forward extraction rate constant, k
                     F, has been measured to be 10−7.0 m/s. From the temperature dependence of rate measurement, the values of E

                  Analysis of the rate expression suggests that the formation of [La(HA2)]2+at interface from La3+and HA2
                     − is the rate-determining step for the forward extraction of La(III). Negative entropy of activation suggests that the above rate-determining step occurs via the SN2 mechanism.An equilibrium study of La(III) extraction from nitrate-acetato media with Cyanex 272 dissolved in toluene has been reported The simple and reliable single drop technique has been used in this investigation. Previously, the single drop technique has been used to study the kinetics of the extraction of Ti Di-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272, H Stock solution of lanthanum was prepared by dissolving the lanthanum oxide (Sigma, 99.9% purity) in HNO The lanthanum content in aqueous solution was estimated by the Arsenazo III colorimetric method The design of the single drop apparatus and procedure for kinetic work are given elsewhere The amount of lanthanum transfer per unit area per second or flux At a constant temperature, the flux of La(III) extraction by Cyanex 272 may also be expressed by In logarithmic form, At constant concentrations of La The kinetic measurements were made to find the effects of: the height of the column (0.30–0.93 m), lanthanum concentration (0.147–7.35 mM), aqueous acidity (pH 1.51–5.47), Cyanex 272 concentration (0.005–0.20 M), nitrate ion concentration (0.01–1.0 M), acetate ion concentration (0.05–1.0 M) and temperature (279–320 K) on La In order to determine the end effect for correction, the Farbu plot was done The dependence of flux on lanthanum ion concentration is given in The dependence of flux on aqueous acidity is given in It is observed that the experimental points are very close to the theoretical lines when pH is less than 3. However, above pH 3 deviation from the straight lines is due to the fact that the interfacial pH has changed from the bulk pH.  The dependence of flux on nitrate and acetate ion concentration in the aqueous phase were investigated (not shown in figure) and it was found that flux is independent of nitrate and acetate ion concentration in the aqueous phase. It was reported that only at higher acetate ion concentration, acetate ion associates with lanthanum ion in aqueous phase but there was no association of nitrate ion with lanthanum ion Using the values of intercepts in The temperature dependence of rate is given in From the results obtained in the present investigations, the rate of flux of mass transfer of La(III) from aqueous phase to the toluene phase containing Cyanex 272 at a constant temperature can be represented by the following empirical equation: The extractant, Cyanex 272 (H On putting the value of [H The step represented by Experimental results can be tested for fit by the monomeric model of Cyanex 272 (HA) represented by On putting the value of [H  The activation energy value obtained (71 kJ/mol) suggests that the extraction process is chemically controlled, since for a chemically controlled process, the activation energy of >50 kJ/mol is usually observed The negative Δ The following conclusions may be drawn: The rate of mass transfer per unit area at a constant temperature is proportional to [La The forward extraction rate constant, The value of the apparent activation energy, At a constant temperature, the rate or flux expression can be written as: The dimeric model of Cyanex 272 fits the experimental results well.
