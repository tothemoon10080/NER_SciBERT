Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed to reveal effects of interactions among Cl, S, P and other minerals on Cu migration. Our results showed that HCl(g), SO2(g) and (P2O5)2(g) were released from the sewage sludge co-incineration. Cl was found to weaken adsorption of Cu by Al2O3, CaO and Fe2O3, while S delayed reactions of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 with Cu, with P having no effect on reactions between the minerals and Cu. Among the coupled systems of Cl, S and P, the co-existences of Cl and S, and Cl, S and P were determined to inhibit Cu volatilization, and the co-existence of Cl and P had an enhancing effect. Cu migration was affected only by S in the S and P system. With the SiO2, CaO and Al2O3 system, both Cl alone and Cl and P led to failed reactions between the minerals and Cu. In the systems of S, S and Cl, S and P, and S, Cl and P, the migration behavior of Cu was mainly affected by S at low temperatures and by Cl at high temperatures, whereas P had no effect on Cu migration during the entire process.In response to increasingly growing human population, there has been a paralleling increase in the standards applied for wastewater discharge, the wide spread development of wastewater treatment plants and technologies, and the quantity of sewage sludge as a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants. Properties of sewage sludge such as high moisture content, huge volume, bad odor, toxic and harmful substances, and ease of degradation pose significant public health risks Copper (Cu) concentration of sewage sludge may vary greatly with sources, locations, and time. For example, the mean Cu concentration was estimated at (63.7 The multiple migration pathways of HMs during sludge co-incineration are a function of incinerator types, their operation variables ( Currently, the simulated grate, and fluidized bed incinerators are usually employed to track the migration and transformation behaviors of HMs in the laboratory In so doing, the present study predicts the thermal conversion behavior of Cu in interaction with Cl, S, and P using the thermodynamic equilibrium software (FACT sage 6.3). Also, this study quantifies effects of the coupling of Cl, S, and P with the minerals of SiO Sewage sludge used in the experiments were sampled from four large sewage treatment plants in Guangzhou named KFQ, DTS, LJ, and LD whose specific properties were listed in Elemental C, N, H, O and S contents of sludge samples were detected using an elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario EL III, Germany). While Cl content was determined using the methods of water leaching and nitrate titration, mineral contents (SiO To accurately reflect the HM contents of the municipal sludge samples in China, this study used their time-series data from 2006 to 2013 and estimated the geometric average value of Cu content as the initial value during the simulation, as can be seen in The equilibrium constant method and the Gibbs minimum free energy method are usually employed to deal with the chemical equilibrium of complex systems. The FACT sage 6.3 software applied in this study is based on the Gibbs minimum free energy method. The composition and concentration of each component were obtained under isothermal and isobaric conditions, taking the Gibbs free energy minimization as the equilibrium criterion, and using the Lagrange undetermined coefficient method. In this study, it is assumed that air, sludge and other original reaction substances are added into the sludge co-incineration system at a certain temperature and pressure for complex chemical reactions to occur. When the system reaches equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy of the entire system reaches the minimum. In this way, the composition and concentration of various gaseous substances and solid materials within the system can be estimated ( The equilibrium system used in predicting the speciation and concentration of Cu in the sludge co-incineration system is a simple system in which the sludge samples were assumed to only contain the major elements (C, H, O, N, S, and Cl) and the minerals, while the flue gas is an ideal model consisting of only the gaseous and pure condensation phases. When the chemical thermodynamic equilibrium model is applied, model predictions are significantly affected by interactions between the trace metals, all possible reactions among the trace metals, and combinations between the melting trace metals and compounds. Therefore, the chemical thermodynamic method leads to large deviations from experimental results under some conditions. The FACT sage calculation system has been gradually developed into a more robust system so as to contain multiple trace metals, all the major elements, minor elements, and minerals in sludge as well as so as to consider interactions between the trace metals, and all possible reactions, in making predictions of the ideal system The system was established to represent sludge (co-)incineration in an atmosphere the composition of which is similar to that of the burner tube. The sludge used in the model simulation was assumed to consist of C, H, N, O, Cl and S ( During the simulations, the initial parameters included the four elements (C, H, O and N) of sludge and air, the four minerals (CaO, SiO It should be emphasized that although the chemical thermodynamics calculation can simulate the thermal conversion and distribution of Cu under various conditions, the calculation based on the Gibbs free energy minimum principle has the following limitations  S mainly existed in the forms of H During the incineration temperature between 400 and 1800 Changes in the concentration of Cl, S, and P are shown in The migration and conversion characteristics of Cu are presented in With Al   Previous simulations showed that the addition of CaO had little influence on the chemical sorption of Cu, and the sorption of CaO resulted from physical sorption With Cl, Cu was mainly found as CuCl Comparing Cl weakened the adsorption of Al With S, Cu was found in the forms of CuSO With P, the single minerals had no effect on Cu migration and conversion ( The coupling of Cl, S, and P during the sludge co-incineration complicates the migration and conversion behaviors of Cu. The simulations carried out in the present study ( As far as the couplings of Cl and S or Cl, S, and P are concerned, the reactions between the single minerals and Cu were affected by the coupling of Cl and S but by the minerals ( The coupled minerals during the sludge incineration change the migration and conversion pathways of Cu. Our simulations in this study assumed the thermal dynamic equilibrium concentration of Cu ( The coupling of Cl and S exerted a great effect on Cu concentration in the same incineration system [ The couplings of P In conclusion, the coupled Cl The thermodynamic analysis can be reasonably used to predict volatilization tendency and thermal–chemical behaviors of Cu at high temperatures and to qualitatively and quantitatively explain its general behavior in the presence of single or coupled Cl, S, P, and minerals during the sludge co-incineration. Thermodynamic analysis can help to devise pollution controls strategies in the sludge co-incineration. Previous simulation results indicated that the use of solid sorbents appears to be promising for reducing the emissions of metal vapors in the high-temperature flue gases  From the complex sludge co-incineration system, Cl, S, and P were emitted mainly in the forms of HCl(g), SO With the single minerals, Cl wreaked the reaction of Cu with Al With the coupled Cl With the coupled minerals (SiO We are grateful to Jun Lü for his enthusiastic help with the numerical simulations.
