The mineral celestine (SrSO4) was converted to strontium sulphide (SrS) using charcoal in a commercial microwave oven. The effects of microwave exposure times (2, 4, 7, 10min) and percentage of excess charcoal (stoichiometric, 50%, 100%) with respect to the stoichiometric amount on the SrS conversion were investigated by the use of X-ray diffractometry, sulphur/carbon analyses and dissolution tests. The experimental results showed that celestine in the mixture starts to react immediately with charcoal by the initiation of microwave heating, and after 10min of heating SrSO4 converted to SrS at ratios over 97%.Celestine (SrSO Microwaves are non-ionising electromagnetic waves of a particular wavelength (1 Considering the strong interaction between carbon and microwaves ( In the conversion experiments, hand-picked/ground celestine (>98% SrSO The effects of heating time (2, 4, 7, 10 The properties of microwave-heated celestine–charcoal mixtures having stoichiometric, 50% and 100% excess charcoal after various heating times are given in Because the total weight of initial mixture was set constant (10 By considering sulphur and carbon analyses, it is concluded that SrSO XRD patterns obtained after microwave heating for the mixtures having stoichiometric, 50% and 100% excess charcoal are given in  The conversion of celestine to SrS is also followed by a qualitative test and by visual inspection. By dropping HCl onto microwave-heated mixtures, H In this study, celestine is converted to SrS with microwave heating (2450 The author acknowledge Murat Erdemoğlu (İnönü University, Turkey) for supplying celestine samples.
