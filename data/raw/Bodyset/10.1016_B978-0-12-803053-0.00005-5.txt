Selecting a filtration technology requires a systems approach that must be incorporated with other solids processing such as reactors, dryers, solids handling, and others. This chapter brings to mind considerations regarding specifications, upstream and downstream equipment, integration and controls, and applications. This chapter also addresses when to consider the centrifugal alternative before addressing the myriad of factors that must be weighed in determining the actual cost of a selected system.Design Filter type Piping Steel structure or skid package Controls Valves Instruments Shipping Specifications Codes and standards Documentation Customer specific requirements  For example, in a typical bioseparation process, downstream of the bioreactor, there are filtration choices to be made depending upon the type of product (intracellular or extracellular) and how to remove the biomass. The selection process includes vacuum filtration, centrifugation, pressure (press) filtration, candle filtration, or a simple flotation process ( In this respect, Coulson and Richardson’s familiar The process has three components that must be considered: material properties, mechanical properties, and separation performance. These are combined and the ranked choices must then be evaluated weighing operational, economic, and plant (internal and external) objectives. The material properties examine the solids and the liquids. For solids, the engineer will need to know the total suspended solids (TSS) and solids concentration, particle size distribution (PSD), and particle shape. The PSD should be based upon particle counts at different sizes rather than by weight or volume as this will provide the equipment vendor the most accurate information. Particle shapes can be spheres, rounded, angular, flaky, or thinly flaked, among others. These shapes will influence the filtration rates To further illustrate this point in practical terms, consider the variations in testing results for three different types of particles: garnet (irregularly shaped silicate minerals), wollastonite (smooth calcium inosilicate minerals), and glass spheres (perfect spheres). Garnet crystals approximate cubic shapes. Since the diagonal of a cube is approximately 30% longer than a sphere of the same volume, larger particle size is reported by methods that take orientation into account (laser light scattering and dynamic image analysis) ( On the other hand, wollastonite particles are rod shaped. Since the apparent dimensions of a rod-shaped particle can vary drastically Glass spheres, as expected, produced the most consistent results for the different techniques. Since the particles are spherical, their orientation has no effect on their measurement. Microscopy of the sample indicated that the glass spheres contained air bubbles in variable sizes, reducing somewhat the density of some of the spheres. Because of this, the device detects some of the particles as being undersized and, therefore, widens the distribution and shifts it to a slightly finer size ( For the liquids, the typical parameters include viscosity, temperature, and the relationship of the two, vapor pressures, pH, ionic strength, and any other unique conditions. In terms of mechanical components, the engineer will need to provide information about materials of construction, temperature, pressures, seal information, compatibilities of the solids, liquids, cleaning solutions, and other characteristics. While this may appear simple, consider the example of the selection of o-rings. This is just component, yet an o-ring can be EPDM (rubber) and there are many different types of EPDM such as natural rubber, peroxide-cured, etc. Careful selection of each component is necessary. Other questions can include, Finally, there is the separation performance, which includes capacities or throughputs of solids, liquids or dry solids, filtrate quality, dryness, washing liquids, conductivity, wash ratios, and more. Is the product the liquid or the solid or both? The more information the engineer can provide about the process and the requirements, the better the accuracy of the vendor’s information. The following section discusses mechanical and process questions that lead to the required specifications for the equipment vendor. Each equipment vendor as well as engineering companies will have different and unique process questionnaires or specification checklists to employ. In determining the process specifications, the engineer must also consider the upstream and downstream equipment as discussed later. Always remember the solid-liquid filtration system requires a systems approach that must be incorporated with other solids processing such as reactors, dryers, and solids handling. The scope of this guide is not to discuss the actual upstream and downstream equipment but rather to remind engineers that these other components must be part of the filtration equipment discussion. The following is a typical example of a chemical process that includes all of the associated processing steps: Chemical synthesis and crystallization Types of catalysts Solvents Continuous or batch Temperature Flashing Inerting Slurry handling Filtration Drying Dissolution Hydrogenation Secondary crystallization Filtration Final drying Solids handling From the above list, slurry handling and solids handling are critical parameters as they impact the operation of the filtration system. In terms of slurry handling, each equipment vendor will have a recommendation about the type of pump required, feed pressures at the filter, and more. The piping to the filter feed, for example, can also impact the filtration operation if there is settling, increased solids velocity, dynamic versus static pressures, or other factors. Finally, the solids discharge from the filtration system and solids handling to the downstream equipment can result in a bottleneck if not carefully watched. Each type of powder behaves differently and sometimes counterintuitively. It is for this reason that a comprehensive understanding of the properties of each powder is necessary including the impacts of moisture, angle of repose for flow, bulk density and bulk permeability, shear stress, dynamic flow, and other properties ( Having given consideration to equipment, the engineer must also then examine integration and controls. Continuing with the project, now that the process filtration selection has been made and the mechanical specification (user requirements) has been written taking into account the upstream and downstream equipment, the next step is to look at the process integration and process controls. This can be very difficult for the process engineer as control requirements involve other groups and, in reality, electrical/controls engineers speak an entirely different language compared with chemical engineers. The first discussions will need to be with the process filtration supplier to obtain their recommendations for how to control the system. There are normally three choices: manual operation to be controlled by the operators, local programmable logic controller (PLC), or a distributed control system (DCS). The complexity of the unit as well as Normally, there are two documents required for the integration. Remember that once these documents are completed, the controls integration portion of the project runs parallel to the mechanical portion of the project with drawing approvals, etc. The first document will be from the operating company and it will define the overall controls philosophy and standards. The typical sections include:        The second document required for integration will be from the supplier. This will match their specific designs to the operating company document above. The typical supplier functional description specification (FDS) should include: General Scope Discrepancies Failure modes Applicable standards and specifications Field panels Main control panel Junction box Operator interface design conventions Operator actions Equipment and system status indications Control system interfaces PLC to DCS communication Data historian interface Equipment interlocks Emergency stop switch Alarms System alarms Power loss Operating mode selection Manual mode Semiautomatic mode Automatic mode Filter equipment status Position sensors Level instruments Measuring instruments Automated valves Control loops Process sequences Main operation sequence and fast purge Ground Hold Setup Filling Filtration Washing Drying Discharge Operator prompts CIP operation or other machine/installation specifics PLC to DCS information/communication With these two documents completed, the integration portion of the project can begin. The objective will be to have the mechanical and integration portions completed on time so that acceptance testing, commissioning, and installation work can be also completed on time and within budget. Readers of this guide by now know that making the preliminary solid-liquid filtration selection should be followed with testing. Although there are four driving forces for filtration—gravity, vacuum, pressure, and centrifugal—this guide focuses on the first three. However, for some applications centrifugal separation is a better approach. This section provides an overview of filtering centrifuges in terms of classification and types, when to use a centrifuge, basic process steps, and selection lab testing. Centrifuges can be categorized by batch or continuous operation, orientation of the basket, and finally the type of cake discharge. A continuous centrifuge accepts a continuous slurry feed and filters the solids that accumulate on the screen. A batch centrifuge accepts a fixed volume of slurry and then steps through the process cycles. For batch operations, the basket orientation can be vertical or horizontal while for continuous operation, the basket shaper can be drum or conical. Finally, in terms of cake discharge, there are several possibilities: As in all cases of filtration, testing is critical to centrifuge selection. A test program will check pressure filtration, vacuum filtration, and centrifugal filtration along with washing and drying to determine the optimum solution. Centrifuge testing is briefly described at the end of this section. Generally, a centrifuge is applicable for larger and coarse solids up to 2 The slurry characteristics are also important to selection. A higher percent solids in the feed stream is always better and more economical; the normal range would be between 10% and up to 50% solids. If filter aid is required, then a centrifuge is not the correct piece of equipment. Finally, the washing and drying requirements must be examined. If there are exacting wash requirements such as low conductivity or long washing times (up to several minutes), then a centrifuge is not applicable. A centrifuge will, however, most often provide a drier cake than most other filtration technologies. Obviously, there will be trade-offs between washing and drying for the process. There are generally seven process steps in a centrifugal batch cycle: Accelerate to feed speed Feeding of the suspension Main filtration or spin speed Washing and wash filtration Dry spinning at high g-forces Deceleration or slowing the basket to discharge speed Cake discharge In continuous centrifuges, the cycles are different: Suspension inlet and distribution First stage basket for up to 80% removal of mother liquor Second stage basket Product washing Filtrate separation Flushing There are three basic laboratory tests that centrifuge manufacturers should conduct for determining the optimum design. The static settling, filtration rate, and spin settling rate tests each merit attention. The static settling test quickly determines if a centrifuge is possible for the process. A representative slurry sample is placed in a flask or beaker and allowed to stand for 30 Filtration rate tests were described in The spin settling rate test determines the impact of the g-forces on the separation. This test is normally conducted in a bench-top test tube spinner that can produce up to 1000 Gs. The critical time is a 90-s spin for separation. If there is good separation (and this is subjective) at 90 In summary, the centrifugal testing, along with pressure and vacuum testing, will narrow down the technology choices. Other process and project parameters, as previously discussed, will further dial down the process separation decision. In the early 1980s, Edward Deming stated “organizations should end the practice of awarding business on the basis of the price tag along and, instead, minimize the total cost” (as cited in Capital Installation Operating Utilities Environmental/sustainability Maintenance Downtime Decommissioning Continuing support The capital costs will reflect the equipment design and must be discussed at length with the technology supplier. There are basic designs as well as standard optional designs and then there are “new designs” developed for the specific process. Basic options can be reviewed in terms of the cost benefits. For instance, is an automated clean-in-place cycle required or can the cleaning be conducted manually? Remember, manual cleaning requires not only the cleaning solutions (acids, solvents, water) but how to pipe the solutions, operating costs, safety, procedural (will the procedure be followed exactly each time, e.g., day shift versus night shift). Discuss these procedures with the supplier. For example, let’s say the filtration system is designed for dry cake discharge but needs cleaning periodically. How will the liquid cleaning solution be discharged, as all of the downstream piping and equipment are designed to handle dry cake but not liquids or liquids containing solids? The “new designs” are important, as this is how machines are improved, yet they require time and money. As experience shows, every chemical engineer would like the newest and most improved filtration system, controls system, or process design. While this can be fun and exciting, it can also be a serious distraction to the project team and the supplier’s team. This should be taken as a word of caution such that the project manager keeps everyone focused on the task at hand; the operating company is tasked to produce chemicals, pharmaceuticals, clean flue gas, etc., and not to design machines. The last part of the capital cost equation is the extent of the scope of supply from the supplier. There are several alternatives: (i) filter only, (ii) filter including piping, valves, instruments, controls, and a full skid, and (iii) filter only plus engineering package from the supplier that the project team can use to engineer and fabricate the filter installation. Each alternative’s pros and cons must be evaluated. In some cases installation costs, depending upon the size and complexity of the filtration unit, may exceed the capital cost. During the building design, allowance should be included for preventive maintenance access, removal of the machine parts, overhead cranes, supports, piping/valves/instruments, etc. It is also important to determine how to get the unit into its location. Are there interferences of ceilings, doors, staircases, or platforms? Another word of caution: never dismantle a filtration system to get it into the location—it is always easier to remove the interference at the plant! The operating, utilities, and environmental/sustainability components can be grouped together. Operating costs include material costs (such as raw materials—can the slurry be thickened to save costs?) as well as personnel labor costs. For instance, is it more efficient to design in more containment to save time and costs to have operators “suit-up” with PPEs (personal protective equipment)? Utilities, such as energy, water, or compressed air/gas, are also an important consideration. Finally, there are the environmental costs such as waste disposal and designing for sustainability (can a less hazardous solvent be used or can gas and liquid streams be recycled?). In terms of maintenance, there is preventive (PM) and repair (normal and catastrophic). These two areas must be discussed with the technology supplier. For example, for spare parts, topics include: start-up, 2-year and capital, spare parts location and stocking, and manufactured parts versus purchased parts by the supplier. Are the service contracts available for PM training (on-site and at the factory)? Lastly, what are the risk mitigation plans for a catastrophic event? These should be all part of the overall discussions for the technology decision. The next component is process downtime. For example, what will the supplier guarantee in terms of equipment up-time? If there is a failure, how long will it take to repair and put the unit back into service? The concept of decommissioning is not one that is generally considered on a new process and new project. Every engineer believes that the current process will be in place for a while. Of course, markets change, customer requirements change, and internal and external forces change. The process engineer should be asking questions of the upper management to determine if decommissioning should be included as part of the analysis. Whatever the answer, flexibility should always be included in the evaluation of a process. The engineer might consider, for instance, the ease of adapting the filtration technology to a new process or whether the filtration design can be modified to accept different feed slurries to produce different quality filter cakes and filtrates. Finally, there are the ongoing support questions that are very subjective in nature, for example, reliability of the parts supply; technical, mechanical, and process support; application assistance; training; and new developments. Capital purchasing similar to all purchasing, business or personal, comes down to interpersonal relationships. Visit the supplier and gauge your level of trust of supplier management. Unfortunately, there are no “consumer reports” for capital equipment; so trust the marketplace and listen to your process friends and colleagues. Having addressed the components in filtration selection, this guide turns next to commission and operation.
