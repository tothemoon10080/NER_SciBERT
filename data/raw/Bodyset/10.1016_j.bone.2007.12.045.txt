Biomineralization occurs during the fetal and early postnatal formation and development of skeletal tissues, e.g. bone and teeth. It continues throughout the life during the remodeling and repair of bones [1]. In osseous tissues, mineralization is tightly regulated by osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes which release matrix vesicles (MVs) and regulate the extracellular ionic conditions and the matrix composition [2]. Those MVs are the initial sites of hydroxyapatite (HA) mineral formation by concentrating Ca [1] Balcerzak M, et al. The roles of annexins and alkaline phosphatase in mineralization process.
