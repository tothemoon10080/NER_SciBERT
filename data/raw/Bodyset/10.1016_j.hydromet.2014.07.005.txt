Jordanian phosphate ore contains 70–150parts per million (ppm) uranium. The uranium in the ore tends to dissolve during the leaching of phosphate ore with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid (PA). Solvent extraction (SX) using various extracting agents is widely used to extract uranium from PA. Meanwhile, much research work has been carried out to develop suitable solid phase extractants in order to reduce cost and enhance efficiency. In this study, a new solid phase extractant has been synthesized by anchoring 2-hydroxy-4-aminotriazine onto activated carbon (ACH). The extraction of uranium from Jordanian PA using ACH and the synergistic mixture of di-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid and trioctyl phosphine oxide (DEPA–TOPO) diluted in kerosene were investigated and the performance of each extractant was evaluated and compared. The results showed that 91% extraction and 559.9ppm loading capacity were achieved after 2 to 3min mixing time using 0.5M DEPA–0.125M TOPO at 20°C, 410mV and 1/1 phase ratio. The activation energy (E

The mined ore is exported worldwide and also used locally for PA production by Jordan Phosphate Mines Company at Fertilizer Complex (JPMC) and Indo Jordan Chemicals Company (IJC). JPMC Fertilizer complex, located in Aqaba, produced 271,700 During the leaching process of PA, most of the uranium content of the phosphate ore is preferentially transferred to the PA, while only 10 to 25% reports to phosphogypsum ( Phosphate mining and fertilizers produced from PA contribute significantly to Jordan's economy. Meanwhile, growing concerns and regulations imposed on heavy metals content in fertilizers, specifically uranium and cadmium, lead to the loss of some of the important markets worldwide. Thus, methods to upgrade the quality of PA by reducing the heavy metals content while utilizing these metals are necessary for the sustainability of the industry. Various methods have been developed to recover uranium from PA. These include SX, ion exchange, precipitation and liquid membranes. However, only SX processes are widely implemented. The most common extracting agent used in SX is the synergistic mixture of di-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid and trioctyl phosphine oxide (DEPA–TOPO) ( Although SX is widely used in industry, this process is being applied with limitations due to the heavy use of organic solvents. Meanwhile, ion exchange resins to extract uranium from PA are being developed and studied by Dow chemical company, but these extractants are neither efficient nor selective ( Several solid phase extractants of impregnated AC for uranium separation were reported. For example, uranium was extracted from sulfuric acid medium using trioctylamine impregnated AC. AC was also impregnated with diarylazobisphenol and oxalic/succinic acids ( In this paper, AC was treated with nitric acid and then anchored with the alkaloid chelating ligand 2-hydroxy-4-aminotriazine (C In order to investigate the efficiency of the new solid extractant, the conventional process using DEPA–TOPO was firstly carried out, and then each extractant performance was evaluated and compared. The current work focuses on the study of the main factors that affect uranium extraction from Jordanian PA using DEPA–TOPO including contact time, temperature, hydrogen peroxide, organic concentration and organic/acid phase ratio. In addition, the loading capacity and stability of ACH and the effects of contact time and temperature on the uranium adsorption onto it were investigated. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were also calculated. Eq. The equilibrium constant ( As solvent extraction is based on the distribution of a solute between two immiscible phases, Nernst's distribution law is employed to describe the solute distribution ( According to Eqs. The distribution ratio can be related to the equilibrium constant by substituting Eq. In this study, the extraction of uranium ( The analysis of PA was conducted at Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) using inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS): ELAN DRCe PerkinElmer SCIEX (USA). Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR): a PerkinElmer IR-843 spectrometer (USA) was used to evaluate the change in the structure after each treatment stage of the AC functionalization, while CARLO 1106 elemental analyzer (Italy) was used to perform CHN analysis. The PA was obtained in two concentrations (28% and 54% P The uranium concentration in 28% P Ordinary separation funnels and magnetic stirrer plates were used in the experiments. All of the glassware used were previously soaked and cleaned with nitric acid to remove impurities that might be present and to prevent further adsorption of metal ions on the walls of the glasswares. Different concentrations of DEPA–TOPO, i.e. 0.5 Initially, the uranium extraction from 54% P In order to study the effect of H As shown in Batch adsorption experiments were carried out in a mechanically agitated beaker containing 200 The extraction ( In the preliminary study, the concentrations of U, Cd, Fe, Mo and V were measured in PA. The concentrations of the above elements were also measured in PA obtained after mixing with 0.375 The results show that among the above elements, only uranium has been transferred into DEPA–TOPO. However, it was found that PA contains high concentrations of V, which may attract much attention and add value to the Jordanian PA. Six samples of 54% P In the initial experiments, the equilibrium time of uranium distribution between the organic and aqueous phases was determined. The results showed that 2 to 3 The effect of temperature on the extraction of uranium from PA is illustrated in The effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant can be calculated using Arrhenius equation, which is given by the following reaction: Taking the natural logarithm of Arrhenius equation yields: This has the same form as an equation for a straight line. Eq. The experimental data follows Arrhenius equation, as shown in Uranium can be found naturally in two principal forms, tetravalent uranium (U The ICP–MS analyses showed that the hydrogen peroxide has little positive effect on the uranium recovery. It was observed that the measured electromotive force (EMF) of PA solution increases with the increase of the amount of added hydrogen peroxide. The measured redox potential or EMF of the original PA was 390 The effect of DEPA–TOPO concentration on the extraction and uranium loading at both 1/1 and 1/2 phase ratios was studied. Primarily, the maximum saturation at each concentration of DEPA–TOPO with uranium at 1/1 phase ratio was determined. The 1st stage extraction by 0.5 The loading capacity of DEPA–TOPA at 1/2 phase ratio was also studied. The analyses showed that the uranium extractions were less than those in previous experiment (see  The variation of the activated carbon functionalization during the preparation of ACH was characterized by FT-IR. FT-IR spectra of AC, AC–OH, AC–NH All spectra show strong band in the range of 3385–3416 Elemental analysis of AC, AC–OH, AC–NH The adsorption experiments were carried out at contact times ranging from 1 to 45 The experimental results showed that the extraction using ACH was the highest at 1st mix stage and it became less with mix progression. The extraction after the 6th mix stage was found inefficient (see Two different kinetic models, namely Lagergren pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order models, were employed to describe the uranium adsorption onto ACH. The linear form of the Lagergren pseudo-first order model can be expressed as follows: The values of The values of The thermodynamic parameters obtained for the sorption process were calculated using the equation: The experiments were carried out at 283.3, 292.4, 303.0, 314.4, 322.6 and 333.3 The standard Gibbs free energy ∆ The values of ∆ In fact, the positive value of enthalpy change ∆ The main parameters affect the extraction by DEPA–TOPO and the new synthesized solid phase extractant (ACH) has been presented. About 92% extraction of uranium was obtained from Jordanian 28% P The authors would like to acknowledge the many people who contributed to this research.
