In our study we investigated a refractory copper-nickel sulfide ore separation by using a cyclonic-static micro-bubble flotation column (FCSMC). The process mineralogy of the main products was studied. Using a scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive system (SEM-EDS) and an X-ray spectrometer the mineral category and content of samples were analyzed. By using a mineral liberation analyzer (MLA) the mineral liberation characteristics were revealed. It is shown that in roughing feed the monomers liberation degree of nickel pyrite and chalcopyrite take up 84.11% and 88.82%, respectively. In tailings, the lost nickel pyrite and chalcopyrite are mainly monomers. Therefore, strengthening the micro-fine particle recovery capacity is the key to increase recovery.
