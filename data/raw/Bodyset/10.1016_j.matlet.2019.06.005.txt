Herein, we report a new castable nanostructured alloy (CNA), which was first melted in a vacuum induction furnace to introduce micron- and submicron-sized inclusions, strengthened by the multiscale secondary phases for fusion reactors. The large micron-scale inclusions are removed, whereas submicron-scale inclusions were retained during an electroslag remelting process. The ingot was subjected to heat treatment at 1050 °C for 0.5 h followed by heating at 650 °C for 1.5 h to obtain tempered martensite along with the nanosized (Ti, W) carbides. The improvement in the mechanical properties of the sample treated at 750 °C was attributed to the removal of blocky Y-rich inclusions along with the strengthening of the submicron-sized Y2O3 oxides. The performance of the sample treated at 650 °C was explained by the precipitation of the fine (Ti, W) carbides.In China low-activation martensitic (CLAM) steel, MX (M = Ta, V; X  = C, N) precipitates with average sizes of 20–30 nm could significantly affect the high-temperature creep strength The alloy was melted via vacuum induction melting (VIM), and the composition (wt%) of the alloy was Fe–0.11C–9.1Cr–1.71 W–0.2 V–0.1Si–0.45Mn–0.18Ta–0.118Y–0.019Ti–0.005 N (VIM alloy). Half of the VIM alloy was remelted via ESR, removing the large inclusions; the composition (wt%) was Fe–0.10C–9.0Cr–1.54 W–0.19 V–0.09Si–0.44Mn–0.13Ta–0.021Y–0.013Ti–0.006 N. The two alloys were hot-rolled into 12-mm thick plates. The normalizing temperature was 1050 °C. The VIM alloy was tempered at 750 °C for 1.5 h followed by air cooling (VIM-750). For the ESR alloy, tempering was conducted for 1.5 h at 750 °C (ESR-750) and 650 °C (ESR-650), followed by air cooling. 750 °C is the typically tempered temperature and 650 °C is the precipitation temperature of fine (Ti, W) C particles. The inclusions in the alloys were observed by scanning electron microscopy. TEM samples were mechanically polished and then twin-jet electropolished with a solution of 5% perchloric acid and 95% acetic acid at 20 °C.    Significant dimples and tearing edges were observed in the alloys [ Microstructural factors such as M In this paper, A new CNA strengthened by multiscale secondary phases was developed for advanced fusion reactors based on VIM + ESR. This process could be an alternative method for CNA fabrication. The submicron-sized Y The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.
