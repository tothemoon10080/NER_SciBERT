A new device, MAGCLA™, which is capable to separate and classify particles according to their magnetic susceptibility, is being developed by the authors. In a previous article the equations of movement for magnetic particles in this new device were analyzed and in this paper the limiting conditions for the different variables and equations of movement are presented for the magnetic particles case. The knowledge of these limiting conditions is important as they set the boundaries within which we may manipulate the MAGCLA™’s operating and design variables.angle between the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier and the horizontal angle between the total velocity and the radial velocity (third part of the movement) angle between the total velocity and the rotational axis angle between the total velocity and the rotational velocity (first part of the movement) angular velocity of the body of the MAGCLA™ friction coefficient for the surface of the separator–classifier on the tangential direction magnetic susceptibility of the particle rotational displacement friction coefficient in the vacuum permeability density of the fluid density of the particle acceleration of the particle cross-sectional area of the particle acceleration on the acceleration in the tangential acceleration of the particle total acceleration total acceleration of the particles acceleration in the magnetic induction drag coefficient force acting on the particle friction force friction force in the friction force acting on the direction tangential to the surface centrifugal force drag force drag force in the drag force in the magnetic force total net force acting on the total force acting on the direction tangential to the surface total net force acting on the gravity acceleration magnetic field intensity height of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier overall current intensity flowing in the superconducting cable mass of the particle magnetization of the particle force exerted by the surface on the particle weight of the particle radial distance between the particle and the geometrical center radius of the cylindrical part of the body of the separator–classifier external radius of the central collector internal radius of the conical part of the body of the separator–classifier initial radius of the fed particles radius at which magnetic particles depart towards the center radius of the particle fictitious radius to account for the deviations to ideality radius of the superconducting magnet plus cryostat system space covered by the particle time theoretical adimensional parameters that measure the disparities between theory and practice time at which magnetic particles depart towards the central collector velocity of the particle in the volume of the particle velocity of the particle in the direction of the movement velocity of the particle in the tangential direction of the circular movement velocity in the velocity of particle in the total velocity of the particle velocity in the velocity of particle in the initial height of the fed particles height at which magnetic particles depart towards the central collector A new magnetic separator and classifier (MAGCLA™) is being developed by Augusto and coworkers In Refs. By setting the movement to the conditions we are interested in, we obtain some restrictions, the limiting conditions, on the operating and design variables. This means that as was done for non-magnetic particles (Ref. A detailed description of the apparatus working principles may be found in literature As in Ref. Movement of the particles while upon the surface of the MAGCLA Moment when the particles lift off towards the central collector ( Movement of the particles in flight towards the central collector ( For the separation of the magnetic particles to be possible Dividing Eq. Substituting Solving inequality We may verify that the sign of the left-hand side of the inequality is dependent on the expression that multiplies Thus two cases are possible For this case In this case it is not possible to conclude anything from the calculus of ∂ For inequality Based on Solving It may be verified that INEQ1 depends on In this subsubcase, and in order to verify inequality In order to reach the limiting condition for Consider the less limited value for Consider a value for In this case, inequality To obtain the limiting conditions for In order to obtain the limiting conditions for For this case As in Case A, ∂ It may be verified that inequality Inequality Analysing inequality Solving inequality We may then have two cases For this case In order for inequality Solving We realize that depending on the sign of the expression (INEQ3) we have two different subcases. In this case For inequality In order to reach the limiting condition for Consider the less limited value for Consider a value for In this case Inequality From For this situation Therefore, all the analysis already performed from Eq. The friction force in the rotational direction has to neutralize the drag forces acting on this direction. This means that, From expression (2.10) of Ref. We are then able to determine the minimum friction coefficient required for the surface in the As seen in Ref. Next, we determine the conditions in As As Analysing the influence of Analysing now the influence of Then, depending of the spectrum of classes of particles we intend to classify, or of the value of the electrical current intensity available, we may choose to control It is important to stand out that the radius at which a particle lifts off is The determination of the limiting conditions in this stage of the movement is not important, as they are less limitative and included in the ones deducted in the first stage of the movement (i.e., in their downwards movement upon the surface of the device) – assuming that the approximations considered in Refs. The theoretical background of a new magnetic separator and classifier (MAGCLA The Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia is acknowledged for its Post-Doc grant – SFRH/BPD/6964/2001 (P.A. Augusto). In what follows is presented a sum-up of the set of limiting conditions we may chose regarding the control of the process in the new device. The idea is that inside the same general condition we must chose one set of limiting conditions which limits more certain variables while limiting less the remaining ones.   As said previously, the determination of the limiting conditions in this stage of the movement is not important, as they are less limitative and included in the ones deducted in the first stage of the movement (during their downwards movement upon the surface of the device) – assuming that the approximations considered in Refs.
