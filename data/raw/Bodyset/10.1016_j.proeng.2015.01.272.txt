The objective of this study is to introduce a generalized population balance model for simulating spray fluidized bed agglomeration of non-porous particles by extending the recent works of Hussain et al. [9,10]. In this context, the focus of this work is to model the average wet surface coverage fraction per wet particle and average success fraction concerning the dissipation of kinetic energy on a macroscopic scale. Average wet surface coverage fraction per wet particle is modeled by assuming the steric hindrance to be constant and discretizing the surface area of primary particles into smaller areas. Moreover, an algorithm is presented which takes into account Stokes criterion to predict an average success fraction concerning the dissipation of kinetic energy on a macroscopic scale.
                  The proposed model with these variables is capable of predicting the particle size distribution, the total number of agglomerates, the total number of droplets and the total number of wet particles present in the system. The population balance model is validated by comparing its results with the experimental data. All comparisons show, at least qualitatively, good agreement, and the ability and generality of the proposed model to predict system dynamics with adequate accuracy.
