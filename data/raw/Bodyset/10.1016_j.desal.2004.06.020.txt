Explochem Water Treatment has successfully installed many industrial clarifiers in South Africa, Africa and the Middle East. The custom designed packaged plants, have been installed to treat a variety of flows and effluent types, from extremely high COD, oils and fats, dairy, and cosmetic type effluents and eutrophic waters. Summary of treatment process is that the water or effluent is collected in the sump where it is pumped to the Dissolved Air Flotation plant. Dosing takes places together with mixing. Floccs are formed and the flocculated solids are carried to the surface of the flotation tank and removed by a sludge scraper. The clarified liquid is pumped through the saturator using the recycle pump. Compressed air is introduced into the saturator. The clarified effluent is discharged under gravity from the DAF unit. This particular process is custom designed, manufactured mostly in stainless steel. The advantages is that it is a skid mounted unit, easy to transport, simple to operate, cost effective to maintain, fairly quick to manufacture and deliver, robust and reliable in its performance. Large-scale plants treat eutrophic dam water to drinking water quality. The process is particularly suited for the treatment of eutrophic, algae laden waters. Contamination of nitrates and phosphates cause algae growth. The dams in Morocco and Algeria are particularly prone to such contamination. With this type of treatment, we are able improve the discharge quality of the effluent, suitable to municipal standards and better. The removal of oils and fats can be between 85â€“95% depending on the incoming loading. The paper gives examples of plants built and of various types of effluents treated.
