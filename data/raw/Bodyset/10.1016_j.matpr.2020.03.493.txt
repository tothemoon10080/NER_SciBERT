In the present study, a mathematical model is proposed for the prediction of wear rate of Al-12.6Si alloy-based composites reinforced with in situ TiB2 (2, 3, 5 wt%) particles by halide salt reaction route. For deducing an empirical relationship for wear rate (pin-on-disc type wear), a multiple regression analysis has been performed to show its dependency on the TiB2 content of composite and various wear test parameters. From the regression statistics, it is inferred that the wear rate is strongly dependent on the rotating speed of the disc but moderately on the TiB2 content and applied normal load.Composites with Al-Si alloy as the matrix phase have achieved wide scale applications both in aerospace and automotive industries where excellent combination of strength/weight ratio, wear resistance and corrosion resistance is given paramount importance. In this respect TiB Wear test results from earlier investigations The present investigation, therefore, aims at analyzing the impact of TiB The composites used in the present investigation were synthesized by Cylindrical wear specimens (pins) of 10 mm diameter and 30 mm height were fabricated from the as cast composite samples following ASTM G99 standard Both optical as well as SEM micrographs of all the three investigated composite samples showed a fully eutectic microstructure, represented by the needle like eutectic structure (depicted in In order to study the combined effect of TiB By performing multiple regression analysis, it was obtained that wear rate can be best described in terms of the TiB    So far as the regression statistics is concerned, the coefficients of the three independent variables as mentioned in With the help of the regression model (Eq.  The wear resistance of Al −12.6Si/TiB From multiple regression statistics, it can be suggested that at lower TiB The empirical equation deduced in the present work gives a good estimation of wear rate of an Al −12.6Si/TiB  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
