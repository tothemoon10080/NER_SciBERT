We report a group of 14 patients with fracture dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint with fracture fragments of adequate size to allow reduction of the proximal interphalangeal joint and internal mini screw fixation of the bone fragment attached to the palmar plate to the base of the middle phalanx. Three years after surgery, (range 25–52 months) the average total active range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint was 100° (range 65–115°) for the acute group (operation within 14 days of injury,

                     . Further subluxation occurred in three chronic group patients, one required further surgery. The key to successful treatment of this injury is the re-establishment of joint congruity and early mobilization. With appropriate patient selection, pain free, satisfactory range of motion can be achieved. There is a risk of persistent subluxation or dislocation, particularly if treatment is delayed.Unstable fracture dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint have an estimated incidence of 9 per 100,000 per year ( Various treatments have been described for complex intraarticular fractures or fracture dislocations of the proximal interphalangeal joint which employ transarticular skeletal traction ( This study presents the results of a subgroup of these injuries, both acute and chronic, treated between September 1997 and December 1999 by internal fixation of the palmar fragment using a 1.2 Seventeen patients underwent surgical treatment for fracture dislocation of a single proximal interphalangeal joint each over a 2 year period from September 1997 to December 1999 ( In acute injuries, closed reduction was attempted initially and fracture reduction and stability assessed using intraoperative radiography. Generally, fractures involving more than 30% of the articular surface were unstable ( Surgery was performed through a volar zigzag incision. The A3 pulley was incised and reflected radial-wards, the flexor tendons were retracted and two longitudinal incisions were made in the volar plate ( In acute injuries, joint reduction was achieved by traction and holding the joint flexed, usually at 15–30° flexion. A 1.l Trial reduction of the volar plate fracture was then performed and checked radiologically. The fracture was held with a single Leibinger In this series, the K-wire was removed, on average, at 12 days (range 4–21 days) after surgery. Our current practise is to remove the wires within 1 week in acute injuries and 2 weeks in chronic injuries. Following removal of the K-wire, the finger was placed in a hand-based dorsal extension block splint at 20° proximal interphalangeal joint flexion. Hand therapy was started with passive and active assisted flexion exercises and finger oedema control. If progress was slow after 2 weeks of therapy, intermittent use of a dynamic finger flexion device with rubber band traction to the distal palmar crease was introduced. At 4 weeks, the extension block splint was discarded and the joint allowed to extend. At 6 weeks, a dynamic extension splint, or safety pin splint, was used to correct any residual flexion contracture. The number of days between injury and surgery and the pre-operative mobility were assessed by (retrospective) reference to the clinical notes by one of the two senior authors and recorded. At review, patients were issued with a questionnaire in which they recorded return to work and sport, pain and overall satisfaction. They also underwent clinical examination by an orthopaedic registrar. Assessment of proximal interphalangeal joint range of motion was done before surgery and proximal and distal interphalangeal joint range of motion at review using a goniometer. Finger overlap on flexion, indicating angulation or rotation deformities, was also recorded at review. AP and lateral radiographs of the proximal interphalangeal joint were taken and joint incongruity assessed. In this study, a good result was defined as total active range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint of greater than 80° ( Using total active range of motion as an outcome measure, the relationship between a delay of more than 14 days between injury and surgery and outcome was analysed using a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test (with a Fourteen patients with 14 single finger injuries were reviewed, on average, 39 months after surgery (range 25–52 months, S.D. 8.7 months, The average interval from injury to surgery was 21 (range 3–46) days. Seven patients were operated on within 14 days of the injury (mean 7, range 3–14 days). Seven patients underwent surgery more than 2 weeks after the injury (mean 46, range 21–46 days). The fractures involved between 25 and 60% of the palmar articular surface of the base of middle phalanx. The dorsal articular surface remained in continuity with the shaft of the middle phalanx in all of the cases. The average proximal interphalangeal joint flexion deformity was 6° (range 0–30°) and the mean flexion arc was 100° (range 65–115°). The mean total active range of motion was 94° (range 60–110°). This compares with an overall pre-operative median active total range of motion of 23° (range 10–34°) for the acute group and 37° (range 21–44°) for the chronic group. Seven patients could fully extend their proximal interphalangeal joints and five patients achieved full flexion (115°). Only one patient had a flexion deformity of greater than 20°. There were no significant coronal angulation or rotation deformities. However, a distal interphalangeal joint extension lag was observed in two chronic patients, both of 15°, and in one acute patient, of 10°. In the other 12 fingers, distal interphalangeal joint range of motion was normal. A good result was achieved in 11 patients (79%). A poor result was observed in 3 patients, two with chronic injuries and one with an acute injury. Longer delay from the time of injury to the time of surgery was associated with a decreased total range of motion Three patients were observed to have loss of reduction (two subluxations and one dislocation) on assessment of X-rays at the initial postoperative review at 7 to 14 days. All were from the chronic group, with an interval to surgery of 33, 40 and 49 days compared to a range of 3 to 14 days in the acute group. The patient with the dislocation (patient 9) required further surgery, with repeat open reduction and internal fixation and bone graft initially, then soft tissue release 9 months later. In addition, one acute patient was found to have subluxation at initial postoperative review but he was not available for long-term review and is not included in this study. There were no deep or superficial infections or neurovascular complications. None of the patients went on to have a joint fusion or replacement. There were no difficulties with instrumentation and only one patient had a screw removed during a revision, for reasons unrelated to the hardware (patient 9). Follow-up radiographs demonstrated minor residual dorsal subluxation and joint incongruity (<0.5 The most common complaint was occasional stiffness associated with weather changes in seven patients. Five of these patients also reported mild pain. In three patients, this was only occasional with some sporting activities and, in two patients, it was more frequently, including at work. The latter two patients (patients 12 and 13) worked as a courier and a sales/repairman but were able to continue heavy lifting. None of the patients reported using analgesic medication for pain. Two patients (patients 9 and 13), responding to the questionnaire, reported that the pain and loss of finger range of motion as a result of their injury impacted on their work, or recreational, activities. For these patients, work was sometimes made difficult due to the inability to hold carpentry tools, or due to loss of index finger dexterity affecting ability to pick up screws and hold a screwdriver. However, both continued in their chosen professions without any major job modifications. No patients had given up or changed employment at final review because of their finger injury. The remaining 13 patients had no long-term limitations on recreational activities. Subjectively, 12 patients were pleased with the end result while two patients were dissatisfied with the surgery. These were the same two patients discussed immediately above and were two of the seven chronic patients whose surgery was delayed. The mechanism of fracture dislocation of the proximal interphalangeal joint is initiated by a combination of axial loading and tension on the volar plate, usually from a ball impacting on the tip of the finger ( The variable nature of the force of the injury gives rise to the variance in fracture presentation such that no single treatment modality is suitable for all proximal interphalangeal joint fractures. Regardless, the key to treatment is the same: establishment of joint congruity ( The use of screw fixation for proximal interphalangeal joint fractures was first reported in 1966 ( A single dorsal K-wire provides immediate postoperative stability, but close monitoring for any subluxation is important. Where possible, the surgeon should abut the K-wire on the middle phalanx dorsally and enter the proximal phalanx at the joint margin, to minimize articular injury. Occasionally, a transarticular K-wire was necessary. Ongoing controversy surrounds the optimal time for K-wire removal. In our experience, early removal allows commencement of hand therapy but increases the risk of dorsal subluxation, particularly with chronic cases, where there remains a tendency for dorsal subluxation. In this series, there were three subluxations, all in the chronic group. Therefore, we recommend shifting the balance towards stabilization by leaving K-wires in longer in chronic cases, to maintain joint congruity in the expectation that scar tissue will reduce the risk of subluxation. Because of the delay of early mobilization, there is a risk of greater stiffness which may require tenolysis and capsulotomy later. Currently, we remove the wires within 1 week in acute injuries and 2 weeks in chronic injuries. Once the K-wire is removed, early mobilization is started. The benefits of early passive motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint are, perhaps, best illustrated by Stern in his series of pilon fractures, which showed significant cartilage remodelling ( Our results show that this technique of internal fixation may be used in a selected group of patients with unstable proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations. The technique is indicated in proximal interphalangeal joint fracture dislocations where closed, and subsequently stable, reduction cannot be achieved in fingers in which the bone fragment attached to the volar plate ligament is large enough to be internally fixed and is not comminuted. Pain free, satisfactory range of motion can be achieved, particularly when surgery is carried out within 14 days of injury. After a delay of over 14 days, internal fixation still has an advantage because the treatment options are limited in these patients. However, this treatment carries a risk of persistent subluxation or recurrent dislocation in this group of patients.
