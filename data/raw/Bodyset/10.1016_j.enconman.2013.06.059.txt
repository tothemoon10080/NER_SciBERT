The erosive wear of boiler tubes caused by fly ash in coal combustion flue gases has been studied for a long time. However, there are practically no data concerning the intensity of the erosion of the heating surfaces of boilers fired with both coal and biomass, and thus it is difficult to design these particular areas appropriately.
                  The essential problem is the tendency of the fly ash from biomass combustion to produce ash deposits on the boiler convection surfaces and to cause slagging on the radiant surfaces. In such cases, both an increase in the deposits and a shortening of the time over which the ash fouling accumulates to the maximum level are observed. Consequently, if the boiler is fitted with steam or air blowers, they are started more frequently; if not, they have to be installed. The research conducted here proves that the situation leads to serious damage to the tubes, which results from the erosion caused by ash particles carried by the blowing agent jet.
                  The authors of this paper attempt to make a quantitative evaluation of the impact of co-firing two types of biomass (coniferous wood chips and willow wood chips) on both types of tube erosion.ash content in the fuel (as-received state), % outer tube diameter, m blower nozzle diameter, m particle diameter, μm indices characterising the ash composition mean fly ash concentration in the flue gases, g/m coniferous wood biomass erosion coefficient defining the erosive properties of the fly ash, μm/h economiser the external mineral matter of the biomass blower nozzle cross-section, m hard coal enthalpy, kJ/kg internal mineral matter of the biomass heat transfer coefficient, W/m steam mass per 1 blowing cycle, kg steam mass flow from the blower, kg/s number of blower starts per 24 lower calorific value, kJ/kg steam pressure at the blower inlet, bar steam pressure at the blower nozzle outlet, bar ambient pressure, bar blower effective radius regenerative air preheater content of fly ash grains larger than 30 entropy, kJ/kg superheater sulphur content in the fuel (as-received state), % mean flue gas temperature in the bank, K distance from the blower nozzle outlet, m erosion rate, μm/h blower operation-related erosion rate (calculated according to formula blower travel rate, mm/s, steam flow velocity in the blower lance, m/s blowing agent velocity outside the nozzle, m/s steam velocity at the blower nozzle outlet, m/s maximum velocity of the dust-laden flue gases in the duct section, m/s mean flue gas velocity in the empty duct at the bank inlet, m/s mean flue gas velocity in the free section of the tube bank, m/s moisture content in the fuel (as-received state), % willow wood chips mass content of co-fired biomass, % power share of co-fired biomass, % parameter defining the flue gas velocity distribution in the boiler duct parameter defining the fly ash concentration distribution in the flue gases parameter defining the impact of the operating temperature and the steel grade on the erosive wear parameter defining the impact of longitudinal pitch of the bank on the erosive wear of the tubes thickness loss of the tube, μm, mm steam density at the blower nozzle outlet, kg/m relative transverse pitch of the tube, m relative longitudinal pitch of the tube, m rise time of ash deposits (the time for the fouling to reach the maximum), h annual time with the blower shut down, h/a blowing cycle duration time, s annual boiler operating time, h/a annual duration time of the erosion process caused by ash blowing, h/a unit time of the coil exposure to erosion in one blower operation cycle, s mean probability of ash particle impingement on the tube thermal efficiency of a tube bank The main threat to the reliability of biomass co-firing boilers is a high-temperature corrosion Erosive damage to convection surfaces is mainly observed in pulverised fuel boilers, where most of the ash, together with flue gas streams, flows through heat exchange areas. In result of erosion the thickness of boiler tubes decreases leading eventually to their rupture. The standard method of tube thickness identification is the ultrasonic inspection. The gauges used have the resolution of ca. 0.1 The rate of erosion and the velocity of the particles (usually considered to be identical to the carrier gas velocity) are related by an exponential dependence At small values of the solid phase concentration in gas, the rate of metal erosion is proportional to the concentration. At high concentration values, the effect of this parameter may be imperceptible The rate of erosion-related loss increases as the particle size grows The formation of ash deposits and tube erosion are in opposition to each other. Whenever deposits are formed, erosion does not occur, and vice versa; with erosion, there are no deposits. The factors that determine which of the two phenomena occur are the size of the fly ash particles, their composition and the flue gas velocity. The mean velocity of ash particles in the boiler convection banks can reach up to 8–12 Research on the erosive wear of boiler tubes caused by fly ash began in the 1950s There are numerous works in the reference literature that are devoted to the problem of damage done to tubes by fly ash carried by flue gases. Only recently, however, was research conducted on erosion depending on the operation of ash blowers fed with steam or air Swirski’s dependence is typically used in the Polish literature The value of Dependence (1) describes the loss of material of the steel tubes at points with maximum erosion, which corresponds to an angle of approximately 40° to the axis of the dust-laden gas stream. The method of calculating the individual elements of the formula are given in The ash erosion coefficient However, the reference literature includes studies that prove that the erosion intensity is also a different function of the fly ash composition; Another problem is the tendency of the biomass combustion fly ash to produce ash deposits on the boiler convection surfaces and to cause slagging on the radiant surfaces The authors of this paper attempt to evaluate the impact of biomass co-firing on both types of tube erosion (fly ash erosion and erosion caused by steam jet ash blowers) quantitatively. To evaluate the impact of biomass co-firing on the erosion hazard to convection surfaces, calculations are performed for the OP 230 boiler by assuming the fuel characteristics listed in The 0-dimensional thermal calculations of the boiler were carried out according to procedures The biomass thermal fractions HC variant – CWB_10 variant – CWB_20 variant – CWB_50 variant – Based on these percentages, the mass fractions For the CWB fractions given above, the fly ash composition and the changes in the chemical composition and the corresponding values of the parameter For the purposes of this paper, CWB with a relatively high content of moisture and ash, which is typically used in one of the Polish power plants, is considered. The typical characteristics to be analysed are listed in The introduction of additional biomass fuel results in a change in the chemical composition and the stream of the flue gases, which, consequently, change their radiation properties (emissivity and absorptivity), their velocity and their viscosity, which affect the convective heat transfer intensity. The co-firing-related change in the amount and the properties of the particles carried by the flue gases leads to a change in the flue gas emissivity and, moreover, in the intensity of the ash fouling of the heating surfaces. The combustion of fuels with characteristics different than the design fuels may cause significant changes in the size and nature of the fouling of the heating surfaces, which in turn has a powerful impact on the amount of heat absorbed by individual areas. One of the measures of the impact of deposits on the heat transfer is the thermal efficiency Papers With the use of a regenerative air preheater (RAH), an increase in fouling results in an increase in the consumption of energy required to cause agents to flow and causes a decrease in the preheated air temperature. The higher consumption of energy required to pump agents is caused by an increase in the flow resistance in the preheater and greater leakage of air into the flue gases. The basic heat exchange mechanism in the RAH remains practically unaffected if the heating elements become covered with a layer of deposits with a low heat conductivity, which is proved by the fact that the efficiency of both uncoated and enamelled metal plates is practically the same Due to the difficulties mentioned above related to the evaluation of the changes in the heat flow resistance in the RAH and the lack of data concerning the impact of wood biomass co-firing on the fouling of the furnace and the SH II platens, only the changes in The calculation results are listed in To evaluate the impact of the co-fired biomass characteristics on the erosion hazard to the boiler convection surfaces, calculations are performed by replacing the CWB with willow wood chips (WWC). The fuel characteristics are listed in The calculation results are given in In summary, the following conclusions may be drawn from the calculations of the erosion caused by the fly ash carried by flue gases: The co-combustion of coal and very moist types of biomass with a relatively high content of ash containing significant proportions of strongly erosive components (SiO The co-combustion of relatively dry biofuels (for example, willow wood chips) with a relatively low content of ash results in a slightly reduced erosion rate compared to the erosion rate observed for coal combustion only. Thus, the co-combustion of very moist types of biomass should be avoided, especially if the ash contained in them features adverse characteristics from the point of view of the erosion hazard. Such biofuels should be pre-dried or subjected to torrefaction for example. It is also beneficial to gasify such types of biomass in a separate facility, especially because this technology also makes it possible to separate the biomass ash, which can later be disposed of as fertiliser, for example. In In this formula, there is no variable characterising the chemical composition of the fly ash, such as When neglecting the technical parameter of the tube pitch in the bank, it is the flue gas velocity that has the greatest impact on By converting formula It is very difficult to generalise the evaluation of the change in The structure and the particle size of the EMM ash depend on local technologies and the conditions of biomass preparation, and these characteristics may not be defined in general terms. However, the EMM mixed with biomass may be coarse-grained and erosive (e.g., quartz sand), and thus its presence will increase the erosion hazard rather than tube fouling. Whenever biomass is put through coal mills, extra thick EMM grains may be ground. Therefore, laboratory testing of the granulation of the EMM (which can be separated from biomass mechanically) gives results that differ significantly from the grain distribution of the EMM fly ash (which, in practice, however, cannot be tested in the biomass co-fired boiler). Consequently, the only way to obtain a reliable evaluation of the Yet, it is possible to apply the following type of reasoning to generalise the impact of co-firing on tube fouling; because the content of the IMM in the biomass plant matter is low and relatively constant and its ash also features very fine comminution, the smaller the biofuel value Additionally, the fouling tendency is stronger when the share of co-fired biomass is higher (a higher share of fine particles in the coal-biomass ash mixture). To perform a quantitative analysis of the impact of biomass co-firing on erosion resulting from the operation of ash blowers, appropriate calculations are performed for the OP 230 pulverised fuel boiler fired with hard coal. The PS-SL blowers manufactured by the Clyde Bergemann company are used in the OP 230 boiler in the area of the banks of steam superheaters and economisers The Clyde-Bergemann PS-SL blowers mounted on the OP 230 boiler are referred to as long retractable sootblowers with an effective travel of 4.8 The steam jet blower flow characteristics: steam mass flow lance section area superheated steam parameters at the blower inlet, steam flow velocity in the blower lance rest parameters of the superheated steam for isentropic change The equation of continuity implies that the maximum value, ( The superheated steam leaves the nozzle at a velocity close to The difference between the pressure forces in the smallest section and the ambient pressure forces results in an increase in the stream momentum and, consequently, in an increase in the jet velocity outside the nozzle to the value If the pressure at the nozzle inlet is approximately 20 The erosion rate Based on the data concerning the blower operation characteristics, it is possible to determine the total annual time of the impact of the blower on the coils of the steam superheater and the economiser banks approximately: the number of starts per 24    effective range of the blower2 the travel rate the unit time of the coil exposure to erosion during a single start of the blower making an extending and retracting movement τ CWB represents the coniferous wood biomass, and WWC is the willow wood chips. The characteristics of both of these types of biomass are given in Section If the blower is started three times per 24 If the blower is started only once, the time is It may be assumed that the boiler banks are exposed to a more intense erosion for 1.4 (4.2) The tables above show that, in each case, the tube material loss Δ The tube mass loss resulting from the blower operation is greater in the economiser (if the distance between the blower nozzles and the bank tubes is the same) than in the steam superheater despite the smaller mean velocities of the flue gases  The lower the ash content The operation of the jet blowers (using either air or steam) involves intense erosive wear of the cleared surfaces that suffer the erosion caused by fly ash, which is accelerated by the blowing jet. Despite the fact that the total time for which a cleared tube is exposed to the blower operation amounts to a few hours per year only, the loss of the tube thickness in that period is higher than the loss caused during the overall remaining annual operating time of the boiler. It could be advantageous to replace the jet blowers with devices operating on a different principle that does not lead to erosion (such as the application of acoustic waves or microblasting technology).
