Small Mediterranean islands are remote, off-grid communities characterized by carbon intensive electricity systems coupled with high energy consuming desalination technologies to produce potable water. The aim of this study is to propose a novel dynamic, multi-objective optimization approach for improving the sustainability of small islands through the introduction of renewable energy sources. The main contributions of our approach include: (i) dynamic modelling of desalination plant operations, (ii) joint optimization of system design and operations, (iii) multi-objective optimization to explore trade-offs between potentially conflicting objectives. We test our approach on the real case study of the Italian Ustica island by means of a comparative analysis with a traditional non-dynamic, least cost optimization approach. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our approach in identifying optimal system configurations, which outperform the traditional design with respect to different sustainability indicators, limiting the structural interventions, the investment costs and the environmental impacts. In particular, the optimal dynamic solutions able to satisfy the whole water demand allow high levels of penetration of renewable energy sources (up to more than 40%) to be reached, reducing the net present cost by about 2–3 M€ and the CO2 emissions by more than 200 tons/y.Water supply and energy generation are two essential services that any community has to securely provide to succeed in development and sustainability goals This nexus between water and energy In remote, off-grid communities, these issues are further intensified by the unique and specific challenges typical of closed and disconnected systems In recent years, several studies have provided guidelines and suggestions to improve the sustainability and efficiency of the water and energy supplies of these remote, off-grid communities. A common approach, widely adopted in the literature, is to optimally design a hybrid energy system, which combines renewable electricity generation (e.g., wind, solar) with conventional power sources (e.g., diesel generators) and storage technologies Other applications directly address the water-energy nexus by optimally designing both desalination and renewable energy units, exploring different simple and hybrid configurations The main limitations of current state-of-the-art optimal design approaches thus include the lack of an explicit representation of the water system (i.e., the reservoir dynamics are not modelled explicitly), the use of non-dynamic modelling of the desalination plant operation (i.e., fixed operating rule) and the adoption of a single pure economic objective (i.e., net present cost) to solve the optimization problem, which prevent the consideration of additional sustainability aspects (e.g., renewable energy sources (RES) penetration, CO Our novel approach is demonstrated for the real case study of the Italian Ustica island in the Mediterranean Sea. Ustica is completely off-grid and, despite the high RES potential, its electricity system relies on carbon-intensive diesel generators. Drinking water is instead obtained from an energy intensive reverse osmosis desalination plant able to cover the entire water demand. Although the water-electricity system of the island is able to provide the main essential services to the population, it is highly inefficient and unsustainable due to high operational costs and high greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, system operation is strongly affected by high touristic fluxes, which contribute to a significant increase in the resident population during the summer months, causing high seasonal variations in both electricity and water demand. Ustica is a small Italian island with an area of 8 km In order to improve the sustainability of this costly and inefficient system, the introduction of RES is planned ( Water production and distribution, as well as electricity generation, are represented by means of an integrated model (         The incident solar radiation  The wind speed at the anemometer  Minimum operating power.

At each time step, the diesel generators have to ensure an operating capacity defined as a function of the total electrical load The total diesel electricity output  We compare our dynamic, multi-objective MO approach ( The non-dynamic, single-objective optimization approach optimizes the electricity system configuration (i.e., PV capacity) with respect to the total net present cost only, considering a pre-defined static operating strategy for the desalination plant (i.e., a fixed observed electrical load The single-objective optimization problem is formulated as follow: We solve The dynamic, multi-objective optimization approach conjunctively optimizes both the planning (i.e., PV capacity) and the management (i.e., desalination plant operation) of the integrated water-electricity system. The desalination plant is controlled using a closed-loop control policy This dynamic, multi-objective approach considers multiple, potentially conflicting objectives beyond the total cost:   Since the electrical load has to be always covered according to the model constraints, the difference between the potential electricity output and the total load represents a RES surplus that is higher than or equal to zero at each time step. Minimizing this surplus through the control of the electrical load corresponds to maximizing the RES penetration exploiting the RES power potential.  The MO optimization problem is thus formulated as follow: We solve the optimization problem given in In this work, we adopt the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm Borg MOEA Within the dynamic MO approach, the operating policy Both the non-dynamic SO and the dynamic MO optimizations are performed considering an hourly simulation time step, a project horizon of 25 years and the following simulation parameters, set according to the EU reference scenario 2016     It is worth noting that due to the very short period (2001–2015) of the historical observations with respect to the project horizon, an average reference year of the main external drivers (e.g., solar radiation, wind speed, water/electricity demand) has been considered. This implies that system operation does not change from one year to the next over the project horizon. Even if this assumption prevents the inter-annual variability of these drivers to be captured fully, it allows to perform 1-year hourly simulations, reducing the computational costs considerably. Other technical parameters are summarized in The results of the comparison between the traditional and our approach are visualized in terms of optimization objectives (i.e., total net present cost, electricity surplus and water deficit) and system trajectories (e.g., RES power, water production, reservoir storage). Moreover, in order to evaluate the solutions with respect to other sustainability aspects not directly included in the optimization process, we also compute these additional indicators:    The main goal of this paper is to numerically quantify the advantages of using a dynamic MO approach (see Section To quantitatively assess the advantages of dynamically modelling the desalination plant operation, we compare our dynamic MO approach with the non-dynamic SO one for a pre-defined system design (i.e., 1200 kW of PV). In this case, we generate the dynamic solutions by solving the problem given in  The dynamic solutions explore the whole range of variability of the objectives as a consequence of changes in the desalination plant operation. The optimal policies outline a clear conflict between the objectives as high cost solutions present low electricity surplus and low water deficit. This trade-off can be explained by analyzing three different alternative solutions: the extreme solution that minimizes the cost (best cost solution) and two solutions that minimize the electricity surplus but present different values of water deficit (best surplus solution and best deficit solution). In order to better understand the advantages of dynamically controlling desalination, the best deficit solution is directly compared to the non-dynamic solution in terms of water system trajectories, as both are able to satisfy the entire water demand. It is worth noting that the best deficit solution modulates water production in order to fill up the reservoir at the beginning of the summer season (April/May), exploiting the storage to satisfy the high water demand during the summer months ( The non-dynamic solution highlights a completely different operating strategy. In this case, the water demand is the only driver of desalination plant operation. The storage peak is observed at the end of the summer season ( A quantitative comparison between the best deficit solution and the non-dynamic solution is finally performed in terms of different sustainability indicators ( In this section, our dynamic MO approach is compared to the non-dynamic SO one in order to assess the advantages of exploring the interdependency between system design and its operations to identify the optimal installable PV capacity. We generate the dynamic solutions by solving the problem given in  Our approach is in fact able to capture the interdependency between planning and management, automatically generating alternative closed-loop operating policies for each Pareto optimal PV capacity, which explore the trade-off between the optimization objectives, by modulating the desalination plant operation (see Section The dynamic solutions show that net present cost ( The ability of the dynamic MO approach to automatically identify the best operating policies associated with each system design leads to optimal solutions that allow structural interventions to be limited, consequently reducing investment costs and environmental impacts. This paper proposes a novel dynamic multi-objective approach to conjunctively optimize the capacity of renewable energy sources and desalination plant operation for the integrated water-electricity system of small off-grid islands. The advantages of using this novel approach are evaluated by means of a comparative analysis with a traditional non-dynamic single-objective approach, which determines the least cost optimal design (i.e., renewable sources capacity) of the hybrid electricity system investigated using a fixed observed load to model desalination plant operation. The comparative analysis is performed for the real case study of the Italian Ustica island. The benefits of dynamically modelling the operation of the desalination plant are first quantified focusing on a fixed system configuration. Results show that the optimal dynamic solutions associated with a pre-defined planning configuration demonstrate a clear conflict between the objectives considered (i.e., net present cost, electricity surplus, and water deficit), as high cost solutions present low electricity surplus and water deficit, and vice versa. The control optimization process identifies alternatives that outperform the non-dynamic solution obtained by simulating the system using a fixed observed desalination load with respect to almost all sustainability indicators considered. In particular, the dynamic solution that minimizes the water deficit operates the desalination plant as a non-conventional storage technology in order to exploit the renewable power potential. In this way, this operating policy, which entirely satisfies the water demand (in the same way as the non-dynamic solution) reduces the total net present cost by 1.2 M€ and the electricity surplus by about 257 MWh/year (more than 80% of the electricity surplus obtained by the traditional approach). Moreover, it attains a significant increase in renewable penetration, diminishing both CO Secondly, the advantages of exploring the interdependency between system design and operation in the identification of the optimal system configuration is assessed by comparing the dynamic solutions with the least cost non-dynamic one. All planning and management dynamic alternatives outperform the optimal least cost non-dynamic solution in terms of electricity surplus and more than 90% of them also show lower net present cost. Moreover, almost all dynamic solutions that satisfy the entire water demand improve the performance of the non-dynamic solution in terms of different sustainability indicators by reducing photovoltaic capacity significantly. For example,the dynamic solution characterized by 1800 kW of photovoltaic reduces the net present cost by 2 M€ and the CO Our approach can thus be used to generate a set of structural and management solutions, among which to choose the preferred system configuration with respect to the weight assigned to different sustainability indicators. For example, a more sustainable solution in terms of environmental impacts is one that, minimizing the water deficit, is also able to attain lower net present cost and lower CO Further research efforts will focus on testing our dynamic multi-objective approach on more complex systems considering additional power sources (e.g., wind turbines) and energy storage technologies (e.g., batteries) within the optimization process. In addition, a sensitivity analysis might be performed in order to consider the uncertainty in the main techno-economical simulation parameters. Moreover, synthetic generators of the main external drivers might be developed to enlarge the observed dataset in order to consider the inter-annual variability of the main natural and socio-economic variables within the optimization process. Besides, different climate (e.g., temperature, solar radiation, wind speed) and socio-economic (e.g., water/energy demand, fuel and electricity prices) scenarios might be explored in order to evaluate the robustness of the optimal planning and management solutions with respect to future changes in the main external drivers.
