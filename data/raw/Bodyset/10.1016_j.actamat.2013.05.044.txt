The mechanism underlying the grain refinement of cast aluminium by zirconium has been studied through examination of a range of Al alloys with increasing Zr contents. Pro-peritectic Al3Zr particles are reproducibly identified at or near the grain centres in grain-refined alloy samples based on the observations of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. From the crystallographic study using the edge-to-edge matching model, electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, it is substantiated that the Al3Zr particles are highly potent nucleants for Al. In addition, the effects of Al3Zr particle size and distribution on grain refinement has also been investigated. It has been found that the active Al3Zr particles are bigger than previously reported other types of active particles, such as TiB2 for heterogeneous nucleation in Al alloys. Considering the low growth restriction effect of Zr in Al (the maximum Q-value of Zr in Al is 1.0K), it is suggested that the significant grain refinement of Al resulting from the addition of Zr can be mainly attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation facilitated by the in situ formed Al3Zr particles.The mechanism of grain refinement through inoculation in aluminium alloys has been studied for over half a century It has been long realized that peritectic systems are often associated with effective grain refinement of the parent metal, such as Al–Ti, Mg–Zr and Mg–Y–Al alloys Recently, the grain refining effect on pure Al of a range of peritectic-forming solutes including Zr was re-examined by the authors and a In the past decade, it has been demonstrated that the E2EM model is a powerful tool in understanding grain refining efficiency through calculation of crystallographic matching between inoculants and metal matrix. This model was originally developed by Zhang and Kelly In addition to the crystallographic matching between the nucleant particles and matrix metal, the size of the nucleant particles also plays a crucial role in grain refinement, as can be well described using the free growth theory/model proposed by Greer and his co-workers A series of aluminium alloys with increased Zr addition levels (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5%) were cast by adding compacted Al–Zr pellets, which were made of pure Zr powders and Al chips, to a high-purity commercial aluminium melt. (All the contents throughout the paper are in weight percent unless otherwise specified.) All of the aluminium melts were prepared in clay-bonded graphite crucibles, which were placed in a resistance furnace and heated to 780 Metallographic samples were sectioned approximately 10 TEM foils were prepared using the focused ion beam (FIB) method. The intermetallic Al  In order to understand the mechanism underlying the grain refinement produced by the addition of Zr, the as-cast Al–Zr alloy samples were first examined by XRD to determine the exact phase constituents in the alloys. After indexing the diffraction spectra shown in The samples used to obtain the XRD spectra shown in Combining the XRD and SEM observations with the grain size measurements, it is noted that, in the alloy samples containing less than or equal to 0.1% Zr, no effective grain refinement can be observed, whereas pronounced grain refinement is achieved in the alloy samples containing more than 0.1% Zr, with the observation of Al In order to evaluate the nucleation potency of Al The Al Based on the identified cp rows and cp planes, the values of According to the E2EM model Combining the matching row pairs with the plane pairs containing the matching rows, six possible ORs are obtained. After refinement of these ORs using the To experimentally verify the predictions, the ORs between the Al To examine a large number of particle–grain pairs efficiently, a simple numerical approach developed based on Euler angles A comparison of the EBSD ORs with the predicted ORs in In order to increase the accuracy of the experimental results and to verify the EBSD results, the ORs between the Al Using the CBKLDP approach, the ORs between seven pairs of Al It can be seen that the OR obtained in the present study is very close to the cube–cube OR. Using Euler’s theorem, the present OR can be seen to be related to the cube–cube OR by a rotation of 0.98° about an axis that is very close to [1 From the E2EM model, EBSD and TEM investigations of the crystallographic relationship between Al In terms of the solute theory of grain refinement, the presence of only potent Al As mentioned above, the size of nucleant particles also plays a key role in grain refinement.
