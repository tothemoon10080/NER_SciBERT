The effect of varying ruthenium contents of 0.00, 0.14, 0.22, and 0.28% on the corrosion of 22%Cr–9%Ni–3%Mo duplex stainless steel (DSS) after different immersion intervals in 3.5% NaCl solutions has been investigated. The study was carried out using open-circuit potential, potentiodynamic cyclic polarization, chronoamperometry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and weight-loss measurements. Particular attention was paid to the effect of Ru on the pitting corrosion of DSS in the chloride solutions. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the presence of Ru passivates the DSS alloy by decreasing its corrosion parameters. Furthermore, it shifts the corrosion and pitting potentials to more positive values. This effect was found to increase with increasing Ru content and also with increased immersion time of the alloy in the chloride solution before measurements. Weight-loss time data after varied exposure periods (4–20days) showed that the weight-loss and corrosion rate of DSS significantly decrease with increasing Ru contents.Duplex stainless steels (DSSs) have basic properties which make them very attractive, such as: high strength, non-hardenable by heat treatment, generally similar or superior mechanical properties than austenitic and ferritic SS, which include weldability, strength and excellent corrosion resistance, especially in oxidizing media and conditions conducive to localised corrosion The present work studies the effect of Ru additions, 0.00, 0.14, 0.22, and 0.28%, on the passivation of 22%Cr–9%Ni–3%Mo duplex stainless steel (DSS) after varying immersion intervals in 3.5% NaCl solutions. The presence of Ru at these very low contents was expected to improve the corrosion resistance of the DSS alloy as a result of the high ability of Ru to increase the efficiency of the cathodic process and inhibit the anodic dissolution of the alloy. We also report some findings on the effect of Ru on the pitting corrosion of DSS in the sodium chloride solutions. The study has been carried out using open-circuit potential, potentiodynamic cyclic polarization, CA, EIS, and weight-loss measurements. The electrochemical measurements were recorded from the first moment and after 24 A stock solution of 7% sodium chloride (NaCl, Merck, 99%), was prepared by dissolving 70 An electrochemical cell with a three-electrode configuration was used; the DSS alloys, a platinum foil, and an Ag/AgCl electrode (in 3 Electrochemical experiments were performed by using a PARC Parstat-2273 Advanced Electrochemical System after varied immersion periods of 0 and 24 The weight loss experiments were carried out using cylindrical DSS coupons having the dimensions of 1.5 The OCP curves of the DSS alloy I (1), alloy II (2), alloy III (3), and alloy IV (4) in 3.5% NaCl solutions are shown in In order to study the effect of Ru additions on the general and pitting corrosions of the DSS in 3.5% NaCl solutions, potentiodynamic cyclic polarization experiments were carried out. The cyclic polarization curves for alloy I (a), alloy II (b), alloy III (c), and alloy IV (d) when the measurements were recorded from the first moment of the electrode immersion are shown in It is well known that the cathodic reaction for metals and alloys in aerated near neutral pH solutions is the oxygen reduction In order to study the influence of Ru additions after long-term immersion period, 24 The decreases in cathodic, In order to shed more light on the dissolution of DSS and whether pitting corrosion occurs as well as the effect of Ru additions on the alloy passivation at a more positive potential values, we carried out potentiostatic current-time experiments at 100  The EIS is a powerful technique for studying corrosion mechanisms Addition of 0.14% Ru, alloy II, raises the values of  It is seen from The effect of additions of 0.00, 0.14, 0.22, and 0.28% of ruthenium on the passivation of 22%Cr–9%Ni–3%Mo DSS in 3.5% NaCl solutions has been studied using electrochemical and gravimetric techniques. Open-circuit potential measurements showed large positive shifts in the corrosion potential of the alloy with the presence of Ru and the increase of its content. Cyclic polarization measurements indicated that the presence of Ru passivates the alloy against general and pitting corrosion through reducing the anodic, cathodic and corrosion currents and corrosion rate as well as shifting the corrosion and pitting potentials in the more positive direction. Chronoamperometric and EIS experiments revealed that the addition of Ru powerfully reduces the pitting and anodic dissolutions of the DSS at more active potential values (100 and 200 The work carried out was supported by the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence in Strong Materials, who also awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship to EMS.
