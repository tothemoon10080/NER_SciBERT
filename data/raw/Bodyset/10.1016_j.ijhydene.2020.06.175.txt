The authors regret an error in the article. Kindly refer to Figure 2 (on this page) of subject manuscript. The figure has been submitted erroneously. We would like to replace the figure with the GIXRD pattern (in the next page). The discussion and the conclusions drawn, however, remain the same as the new GIXRD plot does not provide any other information as both the data show the coating to be amorphous in nature. Fig. 2. XRD traces for bare and coated 316L SS. GIXRD of the coated specimen shows broad peak indicative of the presence of an amorphous phase. The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.
