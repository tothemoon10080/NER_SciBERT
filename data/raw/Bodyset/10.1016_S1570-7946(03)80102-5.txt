This study presents a procedure for the design or improvement of mineral flotation circuits, based on a mathematical programming model with disjunctive equations. The procedure is characterized by: 1. The development of hierarchized superstructures, such that the first level represents certain separation tasks. The second level represents circuits of equipment needed to carry out the tasks. 2. A MILP mathematical model is developed which includes the selection of equipment, first principles, and operational conditions. 3. The objective function is the maximization of profits. Examples are included to demonstrate the advantages of the procedure.
