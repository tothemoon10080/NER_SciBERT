The Patagonian kaolins offer a wide set of origin of deposits, composition, mineral processing and ceramic properties, giving a rare opportunity for investigating the interdependence of mineralogy, chemical composition, particle size distribution, texture, and surface activity with their technological behaviour in sanitaryware and porcelain stoneware production. Plasticity is strictly dependent on surface activity, <2 μm fraction and expandable clay minerals; slip rheology is affected by soluble salts and expandable clay minerals, but also by high specific surface or tubular halloysite. Kaolinite/halloysite play an opposite role versus smectite/interstratified I/S in slip casting and tile pressing: the former allow faster casting rates, while the latter improve powder flowability and mechanical strength. Kaolinite and quartz are beneficial for drying behaviour while high surface activity or expandable clay minerals increase significantly drying sensitivity. Firing behaviour is mainly affected by minor components supplying “fluxing” (i.e. iron, alkali and alkaline-earth) oxides. A great deal of technological parameters seem to be reasonably predicted by the surface activity of clays and especially the Methylene Blue index, which is the most reliable, simple and economic method to predict and control the ceramic response of kaolins and ball clays.The use of kaolin and ball clay has been growing in recent years as a consequence of the increasing ceramic output worldwide. Besides, the ceramic industry has undergone a considerable technological innovation in recent decades, fostering the development of new types of ceramic products and their further diversification ( These new applications are imposing technological requirements that are different with respect to the conventional use of kaolin and ball clay in slip cast, extruded or solid moulded products, such as tableware, sanitaryware and alumino-silicate refractories. Furthermore, the latest innovation in tilemaking (e.g. large-size tiles, double pressing, pressing without mould, cutting of green tiles) is particularly stressing properties like plasticity, powder flowability, and ability to densify during dry pressing and to toughen green tiles ( However, the desired set of technological properties appears to present difficulties for mineral processing, even by selective clay exploitation and blending, because of its complex dependence on mineralogy, particle size distribution and surface activity of clays. Frequently, these characteristics are not adequately monitored by routine analyses with conventional ceramic procedures ( Therefore, this paper is aimed at assessing how mineralogy, particle size distribution and surface activity affect the technological behaviour of kaolins and sedimentary clays in sanitaryware and porcelain stoneware production. Twenty-one samples were taken into consideration: – 7 primary deposits (6 kaolins and 1 bentonite), – 8 sedimentary deposits (so-called –6 beneficiated products (the primary kaolins after washing and settling). For sampling criteria and procedures as well as methodologies followed in mineralogical, geochemical and granulometric analyses, the reader is addressed to the first part of this study ( The technological characterisation dealt with plasticity, slip rheological properties, and behaviour in the shaping, drying and firing stages of ceramic processing. For this purpose, a laboratory simulation was perfomed of both:   A suitably plastic behaviour, though still appraised mostly by an empirical viewpoint, is a very important requirement for a great deal of ceramic applications of kaolin and ball clay, especially porcelain stoneware and sanitaryware bodies that contain low amounts of clay raw materials (currently 35–45 wt.%). Thus four different methods were followed, including the methylene blue index (MBI), Atterberg and Pfefferkorn plastic indices, and Linseis tensional strength (    The surface activity was evaluated by the The main ceramic applications of kaolin and ball clay require their dispersion in water and/or wet grinding, making a suitable rheological behaviour a critical requirement for clay raw materials ( Shaping behaviour was appraised by measuring:   Drying behaviour was investigated by measuring: –the   The Bigot curve was determined (Adamel barelattograph, ambient temperature and RH 40–60%) on two plastic moulded prisms (40 Firing behaviour was appraised by determining:    The plasticity of a clay material depends on its surface activity, particle size distribution and mineralogical composition ( The various plasticity indices gave on the whole comparable results, though with a clearly different data dispersion, that highlight the increasingly plastic behaviour of the series: primary kaolins There was a good correspondence between the Pfefferkorn index and the Atterberg plastic limit ( The Patagonian clays exhibit different rheological behaviours ( –low viscosity and low resistance to shear measured on most primary and beneficiated kaolins, due essentially to their relatively coarse-grained particle distribution, low concentration of electrolytes and lack of expandable clay minerals; – intermediate values of both viscosity and shear resistance, which are mutually correlated in most sedimentary clays, justified by different amounts of soluble salts and expandable clay minerals in fine-grained raw materials; –high viscosity linked to large amounts of smectite (samples BG and FP) or soluble salts and/or halloysite (samples CA, RP and RF) that do not seem to increase the resistance to shear; – low viscosity of samples PRL and SRL, which, however, exhibited a strong resistance to shear that might be explained by the occurrence of noteworthy amounts of halloysite fibers ( Overall, a time-dependence of both viscosity and resistance to shear can be seen for all the clay types. Brookfield measurements suggested there is a direct relationship between viscosity and thixotropy, though it is significant only for the sedimentary clays, being to a large extent dependent on the amount of colloidal fraction. In most cases, the rheological properties described above are clearly affected by the concentration of electrolytes in the slip, measured as electrical conductivity, which are mainly constituted by soluble sulphates ( A thorough assessment of slip viscosity and its time-dependence is in progress. The main technological parameters describing how clays and clay bodies (i.e. 50% clay and 50% filler) behave during forming are summarised in The behaviour of porcelain stoneware bodies is also related to the MBI, which appears to give a useful compromise of those mineralogical and particle size features able to improve the powder flowability during pressing, despite it being measured on the clay and being related here to the properties of a body where this clay is just 50 wt.%. In particular, the higher the MBI, the denser the green tiles and the lower the elastic response, i.e. the post-pressing expansion ( The behaviour during the drying stage was evaluated by the Bigot curve (plus corresponding drying sensitivity indices) and by measuring drying shrinkage and dry modulus of rupture of slip cast and pressed specimens ( All these parameters appear to be intercorrelated: for instance, the Barna index BI in an exponential way with the drying sensitivity ISE ( The drying sensitivity increases linearly with the MBI ( Hence, in the overall picture, the occurrence of expandable clay minerals – markedly increasing the drying sensitivity ( Slip cast products behave with a complex dependence on mineralogy and granulometry: the kaolin beneficiation process, for instance, did not induce any increment of drying shrinkage in respect of primary rocks, even if it involved a significant kaolinite enrichment and an increased surface activity. To account for the large shrinkage values found with sedimentary clays, the presence of expandable clay minerals is more likely to be responsible than the particle size distribution, as sedimentary clays and beneficiated kaolins show similar fineness. Again, the MBI is able to summarise in a single value the effects of several compositional parameters, so allowing a reasonable prediction of both drying shrinkage and dry modulus of rupture, given that the drying mechanisms are quite different in slip cast versus pressed bodies ( The Patagonian clays behave rather refractorily: their softening temperature is often over 1400 °C and the densification begins in most cases over 1100 °C ( The viscous flow – characterising the whiteware sintering mechanism – depends on physical properties of the liquid phase formed at high temperature and on kinetic factors connected with particle size and surface activity ( The effect of surface activity and particle size of clays on firing behaviour, exemplified by the MBI, is strongly affected by chemical factors, despite an influence which might be seen, for instance, in the MBI versus water absorption of both slip cast and pressed samples. Interestingly, the sintering rate of porcelain stoneware bodies is faster with the most fusible clay FP as well as with some beneficiated kaolins ( The study of the Patagonian kaolins and ball clays offers a unique chance to seek the interdependence of geological origin, clay mineralogy, microstructure and particle size distribution, beneficiation process, and ceramic behaviour. These raw materials can be grouped in six main “classes”, according to their genesis and compositional features ( The sedimentary clays of the The sedimentary clays of the The sedimentary clays of the The The The The technological properties of the Patagonian kaolins and sedimentary clays are to a large extent analogous to those of European ball clays, especially those utilised in porcelain stoneware production ( – sedimentary clays (e.g. classes B and C) correspond to widely used ball clays, such as those from Westerwald (Germany); –clays related to the Bajo Grande basement (i.e. class A) have a rather wide range of plastic properties, which are analogous to those of highly plastic ball clays and blends (e.g. Ukranian); – primary kaolins (class D) fall outside the field of suitable plastic behaviour; –beneficiated kaolins (classes E and F, not present in A multivariate statistical analysis, involving the extraction of principal components ( The Patagonian clay deposits exhibit a complicated picture of geological, compositional and technological characteristics, which are clearly interdependent, so affecting the entire industrial processing from clay prospecting to selective mining and beneficiation, up to ceramic applications. The clay behaviour during body preparation, shaping, drying and firing is mainly affected by the occurrence of expandable clay minerals, amount of kaolinite/halloysite, particle size distribution and surface activity. The rheological properties of clay slips are influenced by soluble salts and tubular halloysite, while sintering kinetics is accelerated by fluxing components (e.g. iron oxy-hydroxides, feldspars, illite). A great deal of technological parameters seem to be reasonably predictable by taking into consideration the surface activity of clay materials and especially the MBI, which appears to be the most reliable, simple and economic method to predict and control the ceramic response of kaolins and ball clays. The properties of ball clays are clearly influenced by the provenance of sediments and proximity to source areas, which govern kaolinite-to-quartz ratio, particle size distribution, and occurrence of expandable clay minerals or halloysite. In contrast, the characteristics of primary kaolins are mainly affected by the different texture and composition of parent rocks, which control kaolinite-to-halloysite ratio, structural order of kandite minerals, and illite or interstratified I/S formation. All these features define some broad classes of raw materials, with technological performances comparable to kaolins and ball clays currently used in high-quality ceramic applications: – Highly plastic ball clays, recovered from low energy sedimentary basins (particularly close to a smectite-bearing basement), are increasingly utilised to improve the properties of unfired tiles. –Intermediate to low plasticity ball clays, settled in higher energy sedimentary basins supplied essentially by kaolinized source areas, are suitable for both whitewares and tilemaking. – Primary kaolinization of porous and highly crystalline pyroclastics led to kaolinite – Weathering of mainly vitreous pyroclastic rocks produced predominantly halloysitic kaolins, which are utilisable in slip cast products, such as sanitaryware.
