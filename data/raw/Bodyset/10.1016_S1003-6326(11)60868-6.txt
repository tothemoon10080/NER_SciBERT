                     C were investigated by using the first-principles with a pseudopotential plane-waves method. The results show that the equilibrium lattice constants of Ti

                     C (0≤x≤1), indicating that Ti0.5V0.5C has higher hardness than pure TiC. However, Ti0.5V0.5C presents brittleness based on the analysis of ductile/brittle behavior. The Ti0.5V0.5C carbide has the lowest formation energy, indicating that Ti0.5V0.5C is more stable than all other alloys.
