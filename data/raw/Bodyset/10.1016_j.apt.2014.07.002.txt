Chemeca2013 Conference, which was held 29 Sep–2 Oct, in Brisbane, Australia. Chemeca 2013, hosted by the Institution of Chemical Engineers in Australia (IChemE), Engineers Australia (EA), Royal Australian Chemical Institute (RACI) and the Society of Chemical Engineers in New Zealand (SCENZ), brought together a broad spectrum of academic, government and industry representatives under the theme of ‘‘Challenging Tomorrow’’ to showcase the latest research and technology achievements and government thinking. The high quality of the keynotes, invited and regular oral and poster presentations has highlighted the focus vibrancy of thinking, especially in areas related to particle science and technology. Chemeca2013 included a number of sessions dedicated to fundamentals of single and multi-particle systems, and particle-focussed applications in mineral and food processing, water and wastewater treatment, chemical manufacture and energy fundamentals, mineral processing and new energy technologies. Many of the papers presented are directly relevant to the audience of Advanced Powder Technology, and a number of authors were invited to submit an expanded version of their work. Following rigorous review a total of 13 papers have been accepted for publication in this Special Edition. The papers include experimental, computational and theoretical analysis; and cover a diverse range of topics, including surface force analysis, hydrate formation, crystallization, meso-porous materials, bulk solid properties, and gel behaviour. We hope that you enjoy the selection of papers from Chemeca2013. Finally, we would like to thank the contributing authors and the numerous reviewers whose valuable comments have ensured the high quality of the publications appearing in this Special Edition.
