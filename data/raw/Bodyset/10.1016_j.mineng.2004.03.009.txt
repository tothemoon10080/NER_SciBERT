The pressure acid leach liquor of copper concentrate generated at Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), Jaduguda was processed by solvent extraction for the recovery of valuable metals such as copper, nickel and cobalt. Copper from the leach liquor was extracted with LIX 84 in kerosene. From the copper free raffinate cobalt and nickel were separated with sodium salt of Cyanex 272. A scheme was developed to simulate the counter-current extraction of copper and cobalt–nickel.The Jaduguda uranium ore contains significant amounts of valuable metals ( The aqueous solution obtained from the pressure sulphuric acid leaching of copper concentrate contained 2.8 g/L Cu, 6.16 g/L Ni, 0.156 g/L Co and 5.96 g/L Fe. After iron precipitation at pH 4.5 and aeration for 6 h at 40 °C, the composition of the purified leach solution was found to be 2.47 g/L Cu, 5.98 g/L Ni, 0.14 g/L Co and 0.035 g/L Fe. LIX 84 supplied by Henkel Corporation was used for the extraction of copper from the purified leach liquor. For the extraction of cobalt and nickel Cyanex 272, obtained from Cytec, was used in the form of sodium salt. Sodium salt of Cyanex 272 was prepared by reacting 1 M Cyanex 272 with the required amount of sodium hydroxide solution (Eq. Copper complex formed with LIX 84 (HA) was characterized by Job's method ( The effect of Na-Cyanex 272 concentration on the extraction of cobalt and nickel from the copper free raffinate was studied in the range 0.015–0.035 M for cobalt at pH 6.15, and 0.3–0.5 M for nickel at pH 6.5. Extraction of both the metal ions increased with increase in Cyanex 272 concentration. Plots ( Results on counter current extraction of copper at an aqueous phase pH of 2 with 0.1 M LIX 84 are given in For the extractive separation of copper, cobalt and nickel from the leach liquor of the copper concentrate, LIX 84 and Na-Cyanex 272 were effectively utilised as solvents. The species extracted into the organic phase were determined to be CuA
