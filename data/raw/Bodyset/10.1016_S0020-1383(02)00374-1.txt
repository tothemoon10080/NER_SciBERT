Fractures of the talus body are uncommon in children. A 15-year-old girl was admitted after she fell off a horse. She had an isolated, closed injury of the left talus with no neurovascular deficit. Radiographs of the foot showed a fracture of the talus body with evidence of subluxation of the subtalar joint. The patient was taken to the theatre within 4 The basic principle of managing a talus fracture is to achieve anatomical reduction and stable fixation with minimal disturbance to soft tissue. Skin necrosis, infection, osteonecrosis, malunion and post-traumatic arthritis are well-recognised complications of talus fractures and the mode of management should be designed to minimise these. Standard operative approaches are anteromedial, anterolateral, posterolateral and posteromedial. The anteromedial is the most favoured. Medial malleolar osteotomy is often done to improve the exposure, Cadaveric studies have shown that even 2 Arthroscopy is minimally invasive; it provides good visibility of the fracture in the frontal and sagittal planes. Anatomical reduction with interfragmentary compression can be visualised and satisfied. Moreover, less interruption of soft tissues minimises the danger of further devascularising the talus. Early fixation is known to give good results in talus fractures
