 The ranges of aluminum powder applications are of a great variety. They include aluminothermic reduction in metallurgy, chemical processes, explosives, rocket fuel, pyrotechnics, thermite welding, additives for gas generation in aerocrete production, pharmaceuticals, pigments for paints and inks. There are the following basic kinds of powder products from aluminum and its alloys: Powders: particles with a size from a few microns to 1.0 mm (usually not more than 0.5 mm) of spherical, oval, drop-like, irregular, fragmental or dendritic shape. Flakes: scaly (lamellar) particles with a thickness smaller than 1.0 μm and linear sizes 50–200 μm. Particles are usually coated with a thin layer of stearin, aluminum stearate, paraffin or other fats, the content of which is 0.2–4.0%. Pastes: compositions of flake particles (65–75%) and a liquid phase (water, hydrocarbons). Granules (grit): particles with a size larger then 0.5–1.0 mm of spherical, oval, droplike, disk-shaped, needle or irregular shape. Known methods of aluminum powder production can be divided into two basic groups. Physicochemical methods: electrolytic sedimentation from solutions or melts; reduction (or thermal decomposition) of aluminum compounds; evaporation and condensation of the metal from a vapor phase. Physicomechanical methods, i.e. without basic changes of chemical and phase Besides of the main commercial gas atomization technique, the following methods for aluminum powders manufacture are known:        The characteristics of aluminum powders produced by various methods are given in Atomization of melts by compressed gases or liquids provides for the manufacture of powders of aluminum and its alloys in a wide range of sizes from 1–2 μm to 1–2 mm with particle shape varying from spherical, drop-like to irregular. Uniformity of composition and fine microstructure of powder particles are achieved by atomization of aluminum alloys due to a high cooling rate of 10 The greatest development and industrial application for producing metal powders by melt atomization by compressed gases use the following basic types of plant: Vertically upward aspirating plants, such as operated by Alcoa [ Horizontal aspirating installations, where the melt jet and the atomizing torch are directed horizontally or obliquely to the horizon. Ejection feed of the melt for atomizaton of aluminum, magnesium and their alloys is used at the aluminum mills in Russia, a feed under pressure is utilized at the Kluchevskoy ferroalloy mill in Russia, and a siphon feed is used at the Ekkart-Werke, Germany [ Vertical installations, where a free flow stream of the liquid melt is atomized into droplets by impingement of high-pressure jets of gas or oil. They are used mainly to produce powders of heavy metals and alloys (iron, copper, complex alloys based on iron). In some cases, plants of such type are also used for producing light metals and alloys, including aluminum [ Numerous other variants of constructive design of the basic types of plant for atomization of molten metals and alloys listed above are known. A scheme of the Alcoa process based on the vertically upward aspirating principle is shown in However, this process requires careful adjustment and maintenance. An expected stopping or decreasing of the delivery of the cooling air in the chiller Plants of horizontal type have the following advantages: impossibility of melt ingress into the dust-precipitating system in the case of a bath fracture relative ease of monitoring of the atomization process increase of the safety due to the division of stages and devices of atomizing (melting bath, atomizer) and primary classification (atomizing chamber, cyclones). The disadvantage of such plants is the amount of area occupied, which is greater than for other types because a large part of the plant is in a horizontal plane. Plants of vertical type with top-down atomization are more compact and occupy a smaller production space, however in this case the danger connected with an opportunity of melt inrush into the atomizing chamber is increased, the atomization process is more difficult to control and a large height of the chiller is necessary for supply of solidification of the molten particle stream. The main characteristics of the explosion risks of the powders are shown in The properties of typical commercial aluminum powders are given in Plants of granulation type are more explosion-proof and have higher efficiency. However, they are not suitable for producing highly-dispersed powders. The hardware-technological circuit ( Water atomization is not used commercially for aluminum and its alloys for fear of the explosion risk In contrast to the traditional opinion, recent studies have shown that water atomization under optimized conditions could be used for production of high-quality Al alloy powders [ Typical chemicals analyses and physical properties of atomized aluminum powders are shown in According to the properties and application fields, granules are a transition link between powders and ingots; the precise border between powders and granules in the range of particle size from 0.1 to 1.0 mm is practically absent. In some cases, powders can be successfully replaced by granulated aluminum and its alloys, in particular in the chemical industry, in the production of steel and ferroalloys, chromium, etc. The advantages of granules in comparison with powders are their higher profitability and the lower explosion risk both of the production process and the product itself. It simplifies the organization of manufacture and use of such products. The largest consumers of granules from primary and secondary aluminum are ferroalloy and steel works. The consumption of granules has increased with a corresponding decrease in the consumption of pig aluminum or powders. In recent years, the technology for melted aluminum granulation has mainly developed in the direction of increase of granule uniformity in size, reduction of their oxide and gas content, and a possibility of regulation by coarseness, granule shape and microstructure of granulated alloys. Four basic hardware technological circuits of granulation allowing the manufacture of aluminum granules of various grain size, shape and hardening degree are used [ The scheme in Mechanized lines with productivity up to 10 000 t per year working under the circuit I (pouring into the water via a tundish with holes in the bottom, The technological circuit II (pouring to a cooled surface, Under industrial conditions, there are plants with units that generate electromagnetic oscillations acting on the melt stream, which has allowed a reduction of the size of granules up to 2–10 mm [ In centrifugal atomization, centrifugal force breaks up the molten metal as a spray of droplets which then solidify as powder particles. The circuits for centrifugal melt atomization ( The scheme in Granules manufactured by centrifugal atomization of the melt into water ( The cooling rate estimated by calculation and experiment for the above circuits, I, II, III and IV, is within 100–200, 100–500, 10 Granulated alloys of aluminum–silicon system have been developed based on cheaper electro-thermal silumin manufactured by direct reduction from ores, that essentially expand the raw-material base of the aluminum industry. Cooling of the melt at a high rate in the process of granulation has allowed an increase in the content of silicon in the alloy up to 35% and thereby provide its precision properties [ New designs of the spinning cup have allowed organization of the pouring of the metal from the cup channels as a torch that has ensured production of a finer product and has created an opportunity to carry out ‘dry’ atomization (circuit IV, By increasing the rotation speed of the spinning cup, the centrifugal technology is capable of ensuring production of granules of 0.1–0.8 mm in size. The physical properties of the granules so produced do not differ significantly from those of gas atomized powders but they are distinguished by greater uniformity of granulometric composition and by the absence of dust fractions. In aluminothermic processes, application of granules with a specific surface of 200–400 cm Nowadays, master alloys and modifiers are one of the most promising areas for using granules There are numerous application fields of aluminum granules, in the areas of powder metallurgy: the satisfactory properties of the products produced from low-grade aluminum and the unique properties of highly alloyed granulated alloys, explosion safety of the technology and the product distinguish granulation technology as an independent prospective direction of aluminum powder metallurgy. The basic kinds of aluminum granules, which are produced commercially in Russia, are given in In hardware-technological schemes for producing aluminum granules developed in Russia, a magnetohydrodynamical granulator that provides manufacture of granules of the preset volume, granulation in an inert (protective) gas and dry method of crystallization on a moving belt are used. Impulse atomization is capable of producing droplets of controlled size having a relatively narrow distribution and a predictable cooling rate [ Aluminum flakes, pastes or powders from fragile alloys, such as Al–Mg, Al–Ni, Al–Si and others are produced by this method. For producing flakes, The basis of the technology for producing aluminum fine is the process of plastic deformation that provides manufacture of particles in the form of thin flakes or leaflets. To prevent aluminum particles welding together and to reduce the friction between them and the milling balls, thus reducing the work required for deformation, stearin or another surfactant, in amounts from 0.3 to 4.0%, are added to the charge. Dry milling is carried out in a leak-tight mill working in a closed cycle in an atmosphere of nitrogen with the content of oxygen from 3 to 8%; the latter is necessary for the formation of a protective oxide film on the particle surface. At an oxygen content higher than 8%, an ignition inside the milling system is possible, and at an oxygen content lower than 2% self-ignition of the discharged powder is possible. The scheme for the production of pigment (ΠAΠ marks), pyrotechnic (Π Π marks) flakes and lumpy flakes for sintering (AΠC marks, in Russian classification) is shown in The process of AΠC lumpy flakes production consists of two stages. In the first stage, aluminum stock material is ground in the presence of 0.5–1.2 wt% of fats. The flakes produced have a lamellar particle shape no greater than 80 μn in size; its apparent density does not exceed 0.2 g/cm The charge of the fatty additive is increased with the increase of A1 Pastes are manufactured with petroleum-based or aqueous liquid phases. With the former, the aluminum flake content is of the order of 65% with 33% of volatile liquids such as white spirit, and 2% of fatty material (stearin acid). By the degree of fineness at grinding and the area of water coating (1.5–3.0 m The hardware-technological scheme that provides an opportunity of simultaneous or consecutive production of aluminum powders, flakes and pastes, includes the steps of initial material preparation, grinding, thickening, homogenizing and casing ( For the production of paste, aluminum powder manufactured by atomization, or scrap foil less than 50 μm in thickness, liquid hydrocarbons (white spirit, xylene, toluene, etc.) and fatty additives (stearin and oleic acids, etc.) are used. Mixed material is ground in ball mills in one or several stages depending on the size of the initial aluminum particles and the required degree of particle fineness in the manufactured paste. The slurry from the mills is separated in a filter-press, a drum-type filter, or in a centrifuge. Aluminum pastes are more convenient in use and in transportation because of the absence of dusting, Special application fields of aluminum paste are polygraphy, powder metallurgy, production of aerocrete. Firms produce 30–40 types of aluminum pastes different in floating, granulometric composition, solvent and special additives. Characteristics of the aluminum pastes produced in Russia are presented in There are two processes for aluminum paste. In the first process, aluminum flakes are mixed with an aqueous solution containing phosphate ions, glycols aryl alkyl sulfonates, carbohydrates, polyatomic spirits, etc. as an inhibitor. Such technology is mastered both at factories producing aluminum flake and at some factories producing aerocrete. In the second process, foil waste is ground in an aqueous solution containing fatty acids and inhibitors (salts of phosphoric and boric acids and colloid substances: albumin, casein, gelatin, glue or arabic gum). Grinding is carried out at the lowest possible temperature of 10–50°C. Water aluminum pastes containing 50–65% of aluminum particles are fire- and explosion-proof, convenient to use and the content of the active metal keeps the properties stable for a long time. They are used as a gas forming agent to produce aerocrete, in the production of paints, in structure of water-filled explosives and in powder metallurgy. The same technique is used for producing a water paste containing 20 wt% A1 Powders and flakes of aluminum are ingredients of many industrial explosives used in the mining industry (ammonal, rock ammonites, alum trinitrotoluene). As a high-energy carrier, aluminum essentially raises the heat of the explosive transformation and the efficiency of the blasting operations. Powders such as In ferrous metallurgy, aluminum powders (granules) are used as a reducing agent. Introduction of 0.1–1.5% of aluminum groats into the melt of iron completely releases it from the oxide (II) and thereby provides the production of a dense casting without sinks. Aluminum powders are also used for heating the riser part of the ingot in the casting of ferrous metals. A mixture of oxides and aluminum powders, tamped around the sprue opening and the riser, which ‘ignites’ from the melt, and during burning, provides cast metal in the liquid state for a long time so feeding the solidifying ingot and avoiding the formation of shrinkage cavities. Aluminothermic reduction of refractory metal oxides is used in the production of ferromolybdenum, ferroniobium, ferrotungsten, etc. The thermite mix containing 75% Fe In the chemical industry, aluminum powders and granules are active reducers as they quickly react in aqueous solutions of acids or alkaline media with emission of hydrogen: 1.0 kg of aluminum powders gives 1240 L of hydrogen. They are applied in the production of aluminum alkyls, polymerization of ethyls, for producing antidetonant, tetraethyl lead, etc.  Aluminum powders and pastes are used as a colorful and protective pigment in compositions of various paints, varnishes and enamels. The paints obtained have a beautiful silvery color, protect products from moisture, heat and light. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has enacted the specifications for aluminum flake pigments (ASTM D 962, Part 28) [ Aluminum-based sintered materials are distinguished by good pressing and sintering ability of powders, production profitability, high strength and good corrosion resistance. In Russia, a range of Al-based powders is produced such as lumpy powder AΠC, powders of high-purity aluminum (PA-VCh), of technical-purity aluminum such as Π A, aluminum groats AKΠ, powders of SAS alloys (Al–Si). These materials are destined for PM production in machine building, electrical engineering, nuclear, electronic and other industries. From the specified powders, strips, bars and profiles and cold-rolled sheets are manufactured. By hot extrusion of powders of aluminum alloys, materials with unique properties, high thermal resistance, such as SAS and SAP, low linear expansion such as SAS, high-strength alloys on the basis of the Al–Zn–Mg–Cu system, light fast alloys on the basis of the Al–Mg system, etc. are manufactured. In addition, aluminum powders, flake pigments, pastes, paints and granules are applied in: production of high-density refractory materials (to increase the density, the thermal resistance and mechanical strength of refractory material) production of porous adsorption materials for cryogenic equipment production of a welding wire and lubricating cooling fluids (SOZh). Aluminum powders are added to rubber to produce automobile tires with the purpose of increasing the heat conductivity of the protective rubber and to improve the operating conditions for the tire surface. An addition of powders to plastics improves their mechanical properties, increases their wear resistance, imparts special properties (electric conductivity, heat conductivity, etc.). Aluminum powder is applied as a filler material in plastics such as epoxy, polyester and phenolic resins. In particular, powder aluminum is used in the preparation of so-called ‘cold solders’ (fillers), which are used for filling of hollows, cracks and seams on the surface of a metal. More than 50% of the content of the cold solder is aluminum powder, which is mixed with the resin hardener. Aluminum powder is used as a lubricant in producing ceramic details by the method of dry pressing for the reduction of the wear in molds, the obtaining of high-density pressings and the reduction of the pressing force. A special class of aluminum powder materials is composite materials, which include powders of aluminum and its alloys or mixtures of such powders with powders of other compounds clad by nickel. The production technology of the specified composite materials developed by the Norilsk Nickel Concern consists of coating powder particles of aluminum and its alloys with metallic nickel by the carbonyl process, i.e. by the decomposition of nickel tetra carbonyl vapor on the surface of the powder in the vibro-fluidized bed: Depending on the chosen technological parameters of the process and the material-base, three main structural types of powder compositions are formed: clad powders, where particles of the base material are surrounded by a compact nickel coating conglomerated powders, where fine particles of the base material are conglomerated on the metallic nickel bundle capsulated powders, where particles of different composition, structure and properties are coated with a single nickel casing. It is possible to form compositions that are combinations of the three above types. Thus, it is obviously possible to create a wide range of complex multicomponent compositions possessing a complex of predetermined physico-technological properties. Composite powder materials metallized by nickel are subdivided into three main groups: metal–metal, metal–carbide compositions intended to increase the wear resistance and corrosion resistance of plasma coatings  metal–solid lubricant and metal–carbide–solid lubricant compositions used for antifrictional coatings. Nickel introduction into the makeup of clad, conglomerated and encapsulated compositions by the following thermal spraying provides: protection of the basic material of the coating against interaction with the plasma jet and oxidation more uniform distribution of components in the coating due to absence of the segragation interaction of separate components with the formation of solid solutions, intermetallics, etc. directed course of exothermic reactions that facilitate powder heating and improvement of coating quality creation of essentially new phases and structural components in the coating coarsening of fine powders that essentially expands the nomenclature of powders for spraying increase of fluidity, productivity of spraying and use factor of powder formation of essentially new multilayered powder compositions increase of durability, density and heat conductivity of coatings. The low temperature of the process, the precise dosing of the nickel, the complete absence of a liquid phase and the fact that no additional process such as drying, filtration, regeneration of solutions is required and the complete absence of waste are the main advantages of the chosen method for producing composite powder materials in comparison with many liquid-phase and gas-phase processes.  Powder composition, wt%: 4–23 A1; 96–77 Ni. Powder properties thickness of the nickel coating on a particle of aluminum: from one to tens of microns shape of particles: close to spherical flow rate: 10–40 s apparent density: 2.5–5.1 g/cm the size of particles: 50–100 μm. Properties of plasma coatings: microhardness: 4.0–8.0 GPa porosity: 3–10% strength of adhesion to the substrate: 30–38 MPa exothermal effect while spraying of coatings comes at 625°C due to the reaction heat of the synthesis of the nickel–aluminum inter-metallic in isothermal conditions thickness of the coating layer that excludes peeling from the substrate: on Steel–3: 1.0 mm; on Steel–45: 0.8 mm; on D16T alloy: 3.0 mm. (The steel brands given in Russian classification.) Purpose: spraying of an intermediate layer on steels, cast irons, aluminum and titanium alloys, etc. It is known that remelting of the waste products of foil rolling is inefficient because of the great waste of aluminum at high temperatures that reaches several tens percent depending on foil thinness. Almost 100% of the use of foil waste products is achieved by their processing to aluminum powders (grit), flakes or paste. The technology of foil processing is quite simple: crushing in cutting units such as the ones used for comminution of paper and plastic with subsequent use as the raw material for the production of aluminum flakes (dry crushing) or pastes (wet crushing). After rolling in mills (ball, jet-type, etc.), disintegrators and the like, the crushed flat particles of foil become rounded in shape, forming a special kind of powder product named ‘grit’. Grit has a wide application in the chemical industry as a reducing agent or gasifier, and in other industries as well. In recent years, increasing attention is being paid to the processing of aluminum scrap (mainly chips and Nowadays, all over the world, the main method of processing aluminum scrap is remelting in units of various types. The melt is usually cast into ingots. In some cases, the melt is granulated or gas-atomized to produce powder of recycled aluminum (for example, AIIB powders in Russia). These remelting–casting technologies are rather power-consuming. Processing of aluminum scrap to powders and granules is an alternative to remelting of scrap to produce ingots. The advantage of this technology is that it is a simpler and cheaper process of producing granules from recycled aluminum. The size of granules is easily regulated by adjustment of grinders and varies from 1 to 10 mm. Such granules are used more effectively than ingots in ferrous metallurgy for steel deoxidation.
