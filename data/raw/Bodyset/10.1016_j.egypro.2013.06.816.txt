Zinc oxide powders with different morphology have been successfully prepared by adopting zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2.6H2O) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the starting precursors in the mole ratio of Zn(NO3)2.6H2O: NaOH of 1:2 and 1:10, via the simple hydrothermal process (60Â°C for 6h) using Thai autoclave unit. The shape, size, and crystalline structures of the as-prepared ZnO powders were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). At the lower alkaline concentration, the prepared showed powder short prism-like shape with hexagonal phase. The average particle size was about 0.3-0.5 urn in width and 0.5-0.7 um in length. At the higher alkaline concentration, the microstructure of ZnO powders change in turn from short prism to flower-like shapes. The particle size was about 30-80nm in width and 0.5-1 urn in length. This preparation method provide a simple hydrothermal routes to fabricate ZnO powders using Thai autoclave Unit.
