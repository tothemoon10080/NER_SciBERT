MnO2 is successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal process. By varying reaction temperature and time, the shape control of MnO2 structures have been achieved, which produces flower-like, urchin-like and nanorod-like structures. The effects of the reaction temperature and time on the morphology and electrochemical performance are investigated. The morphology of MnO2 is shown to play a dominate role in the electrochemical performance. The flower-like MnO2 shows a high specific capacitance of 495Fg−1 at current density of 1Ag−1, and 91% retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, which is promising for application in supercapacitors.As an n-type semiconductor, MnO Shape controlled synthesis of MnO Herein, we report a simple one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize MnO Flower-like MnO The morphologies and structures of the composites were characterized by SEM (Hitachi S-4800) and XRD (SHIMADZU XRD-7000S). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and capacitance measurements were characterized using an Autolab PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation. The morphological analysis of the as prepared MnO The XRD patterns of the sample are shown in  Shape control of MnO This study was financially supported by the
