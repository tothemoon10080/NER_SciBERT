Indigo carmine and methylene blue dyes in aqueous solution were photodegraded using SiC–TiO2 catalysts prepared by sol–gel method. After thermal treatment at 450°C, SiC–TiO2 catalysts prepared in this work showed the presence of SiC and TiO2 anatase phase. Those compounds showed specific surface area values around 22–25m2
                     g−1, and energy band gap values close to 3.05eV. In comparison with TiO2 (P25), SiC–TiO2 catalysts showed the highest activity for indigo carmine and methylene blue degradation, but this activity cannot be attributed to the properties above mentioned. Therefore, photocatalytic performance is due to the synergy effect between SiC and TiO2 particles caused by the sol–gel method used to prepare the SiC–TiO2 catalysts. TiO2 nanoparticles are well dispersed onto SiC surface allowing the transfer of electronic charges between SiC and TiO2 semiconductors, which avoid the fast recombination of the electron–hole pair during the photocatalytic process.Photodegradation of organic pollutants by heterogeneous photocatalysis has attracted considerable attention in the last few decades because through this method it is possible to carry out the photocatalytic oxidation of an organic substance causing its partial or total mineralization SiC has been considered as support due to its properties such as high thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength, as well as its low chemical reactivity In this work, TiO SiC–TiO Structural characterization was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuKα radiation ( Photocatalytic tests were carried out in a quartz tube (500    On the other hand, surface area results indicated that independent of the amount of TiO In  On the other hand, the mineralization process from a photocatalytic degradation reaction could occur through the photo-Kolbe decarboxylation reaction, which involves the reaction of carboxyl radicals with a valence band hole. Commonly the carboxyl anion can be associated with the dye, colored intermediates, aromatic intermediates, or aliphatic organic compounds. Particularly, organic dyes degradation results in the formation of intermediates, which can undergo several reactions leading to mineralization In our case the conversion of the organic intermediates to CO In  According to our results, the photocatalytic activity cannot be attributed to the energy band gap or the specific surface area values. Mainly considering that TiO Final percentage of degradation of methylene blue using SiC–TiO Due to the weight of SiC particles, after the photocatalytic reaction is finished, catalysts are settled down and easily separated by simple decantation in one step. The kinetic parameters for the photocatalytic degradation of indigo carmine and methylene blue dyes were calculated assuming that the reaction follows a first order mechanism. The calculated values reported in According to our results, it is evident in this system that sample SG3 containing 80 Recently TiO For industrial applications like waste-water treatment, we consider that our results are very interesting because two situations can be solved: one is the possibility to have a TiO Results obtained here revealed the possibility to have a TiO Authors wish to thank to
