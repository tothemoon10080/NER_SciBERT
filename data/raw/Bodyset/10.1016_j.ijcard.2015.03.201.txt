It is widely recognized that biological processes leading to calcific aortic stenosis (AS) include chronic inflammation, lipoprotein deposition and activation of specific osteogenic and apoptotic signaling pathways Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) represents a visceral fat depot which plays several protective functions for the heart in physiologic conditions We enrolled 95 patients with severe, isolated, calcific AS, referred to cardiac surgery for aortic valve (AV) replacement. Exclusion criteria were: 1) pathologic conditions already known to be associated with increased echocardiographic EAT thickness and/or altered inflammatory EAT status (CAD, metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation) We measured EAT thickness by echocardiography in AS patients and in a control group of 44 healthy subjects matched for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Intra and inter-observer reproducibility for echocardiographic EAT thickness assessment was excellent (0.962 and 0.951, respectively). In patients referred to aortic valve replacement, plasma and EAT were collected and analyzed by human cytokine 27 multiplex immunoassay for the assessment of systemic and local inflammatory status. The relationship between EAT thickness and the presence and severity of atherosclerotic CAD has been well established The ‘atherogenicity’ of EAT is addressed to secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-1β, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and resistin None.
