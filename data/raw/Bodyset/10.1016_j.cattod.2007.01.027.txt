When comparing the models to experimental results for the photocatalytic oxidation of the herbicide “isoproturon” in a recirculation batch reactor, significant errors in predicting reactant conversion were found when neglecting the full effect of the radiation scattering phenomena. The experimental results were enclosed by the Beer–Lambert absorption model and the two-flux radiation model; however, the six-flux model provides the most accurate, yet simple, analysis of the radiation field in a photocatalytic reactor.model parameter SFM geometrical coefficient model parameter SFM photocatalyst concentration (kg substrate concentration (kg length of the reactor (m) radiation intensity (or radiative flux) (W radiation intensity divided by wavelength of radiation (W maximum value of radiation intensity at surface dimensionless radiation intensity or dimensionless LVRPA kinetic constant (kg lamp length (m) local volumetric rate of photon absorption (W dimensionless local volumetric rate of photon absorption order of the reaction with respect to the LVRPA order of the reaction with respect to substrate concentration Damköhler number Reynolds number probability of scattering in the backward direction probability of scattering in the forward direction probability of scattering in the side direction radial coordinate (m) dimensionless radial coordinate (= lamp radius (m) rate of the reaction with respect to substrate external radius of annulus (m) radiation emission of lamp per unit time per unit length (W fluid velocity (m reactor volume (m radiant power (W) axial coordinate (m) dimensionless axial coordinate (= geometrical parameter (= geometrical parameter (= thickness of the annulus (m) scattering phase function dimensionless parameter SFM scattering angle ratio of internal radius to external radius of annulus specific mass absorption coefficient averaged over the spectrum of the incident radiation (m radiation wavelength (m) kinematic viscosity (m specific mass scattering coefficient averaged over the spectrum of the incident radiation (m optical thickness apparent optical thickness scattering albedo (= corrected scattering albedo SFM film thickness coordinate (m) dimensionless film thickness coordinate (= dimensionless parameter in the TFM radiation transmission factor absorbed substrate lamp minimum maximum wavelength direction along the radial coordinate position at inner wall of annulus lamp wall direction along the axial coordinate direction along the film transversal coordinate dimensionless variable reactor outlet position position at inlet of the reactor maximum value position at outlet of the reactor Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a highly effective process for the degradation and mineralization of a wide variety of priority pollutants in lightly contaminated water and wastewater Among the different types of scalable photocatalytic reactors proposed in the literature using suspended solid photocatalysts, falling film or double-skin annular/slab reactors are the most common Reliable tools for the design and modeling of heterogeneous photoreactors are required in order to successfully bring photocatalytic processes to the stage where they can be adopted by industry. They are also required to determine accurate kinetic parameters from experimental laboratory reactors. Modeling of photocatalytic reactors is a highly complex task which requires an intricate analysis of the radiation field in the photoreactor This paper presents a dimensionless analysis of steady-state, continuous flow, photocatalytic reactors using suspended solid photocatalysts that still retains the essential elements of a rigorous modeling approach, whilst providing simple solutions. Three different levels of complexity for the models have been developed depending on whether radiation scattering is a relevant phenomena and whether the reactor is “thin-film” or “geometrically thick” type. To address these effects the radiation field in the photoreactor is modelled with either a “two-flux” absorption–scattering model It is worth noting that photocatalysis may well be employed for treating gas streams in solid–gas reactors. In this case photocatalyst particles are usually attached to solid walls, rather than being freely suspended in the fluid phase. This clearly requires different modelling tools than those adopted in the present paper, which is therefore mainly aimed at analysing the performance of solid–liquid (slurry) photoreactors. A schematic representation of the general methodology for the modeling of a photocatalytic reactor has been shown in the literature Due to their absorbance spectra and/or their low concentration, the absorption of photons by the species in solution is often negligible in comparison with that of the photocatalyst. In such cases direct photolysis of the species can be neglected and it can be safely assumed that the photons with energy higher than the band-gap of the semiconductor are absorbed by the solid photocatalytic particles only. This assumption removes the interdependence of the progress of the reaction and the attenuation of the radiation from the species in solution because the photocatalyst does not undergo changes in concentration. Consequently, the radiation field can be decoupled from the reactant concentration field and can therefore be computed in advance. Once the LVRPA has been calculated, it is normally substituted into the kinetic equation, and the material balance for the substrate Three approaches have been proposed in the literature for the calculation of the LVRPA: (1) the “rigorous approach” which involves the mathematical solution of the RTE, although its integro-differential nature makes this approach significantly complex The two- and six-flux models yield a sensible representation of the LVRPA in the reaction space and allow a considerable simplification of the mathematical model, as a result, these will be used in the present models. For the sake of brevity this paper will present models for the annular geometrical configuration only. The models, however, can be easily translated to the slab geometry with appropriate changes in variables and coordinates and taking into account that the photon flux does not decrease with the inverse of distance in the slab geometry. A complete dimensionless mathematical model, which is straightforward to apply to steady-state, continuous flow, annular photocatalytic reactors using suspended solid photocatalysts is presented in A schematic representation of the geometry of an annular photocatalytic reactor is shown in The reactor geometry of an annular photoreactor is described by the following dimensionless design parameters: The dimensionless axial and radial coordinates are: The dimensionless film thickness coordinate is: In thin-film photoreactors the thickness of the reaction space is of the order of one millimeter or less and The emission of radiation from the lamp is modeled using the Linear Source Spherical Emission (LSSE) model According to the LSSE model the intensity of the incident radiation entering the inner wall of the annulus can be written as follows: Eq. According to the LSSE model the dimensionless intensity of the incident radiation at the inner wall of the annulus can be represented by the equation shown in In The two most important dimensionless parameters for the modeling of a photocatalytic reactor are the scattering albedo, The scattering albedo is defined as the ratio of the scattering coefficient, divided by the extinction coefficient of the photocatalyst suspension ( The optical thickness of the photoreactor ( Model simulations have shown that when Although the case for As mentioned above, the applicability of a simplified radiation–scattering model would depend on the geometry of the reactor. A suitable radiation absorption–scattering model for TFS photocatalytic reactors is the two-flux model (TFM) The dimensionless LVRPA at a point ( “Geometrically thick” photoreactors are those reactors in which the thickness of the reaction space cannot be neglected in comparison with the other dimensions of the reactor. An example is the annular photoreactor used in many research laboratories for kinetic studies. To model these types of reactors we have recently introduced a novel six-flux absorption–scattering model (SFM) The derivation of the SFM from first principles and its experimental validation is reported in Li Puma et al. In The use of the diffusively reflecting large sphere phase function (Eq. The SFM, as shown in As shown with the TFM, the attenuation term of (LVRPA) The TFM and the SFM form the basis for a simplified, yet realistic, mathematical representation of the radiation field in annular photocatalytic reactors in the presence of absorbing–scattering particles. The liquid phase is considered to be a Newtonian fluid with constant physical properties. The catalyst particles are considered to be uniformly distributed within the liquid film; however, the concentration of solids is not so high as to cause substantial changes in the rheological properties of the fluid. The entrainment of gas bubbles is limited and the effect of the velocity gradients on the radial particle distribution is negligible. The dimensionless velocity is represented by: The flow regime for the fluid is determined by the value of Reynolds number, For thin-film photoreactors, three cases of steady-state, unidirectional, continuous flow have been considered in the model as shown in The kinetic equation for the photocatalytic degradation of a species The dimensionless material balance for a substrate The integration of the design equation with initial condition:  The effective radiant power absorbed within the reaction space The result of the integration is shown in The radiant power emitted by the radiation source, i.e., the UV lamp, The models in The expression of the model in dimensionless form allows the analysis of the effect of these dimensionless groups on reactant conversion. The model predictions of TFM and SFM are compared as a function of the dimensionless groups and dimensionless parameters. To allow a comprehensive analysis of the effect of each dimensionless group, the geometrical parameters were selected to be  The radiation transmission factor increases with the (apparent) optical thickness until an asymptotic plateau is reached which occurs at progressively lower values, as the scattering albedo increases. Note that when In The kinetic parameters If the inlet substrate concentration The first term in parenthesis is independent of scattering albedo, optical thickness and type of flow pattern and was assigned the value 1.2611 in the simulations such that the maximum conversion with the FFLF system in the absence of radiation scattering (   The model simulations show that for given values of the scattering albedo, apparent optical thicknesses and reaction kinetics, the conversions obtained with the three different idealized flow systems follow the sequence: FFLF The simulation results show that the SFM predicts higher conversion than the TFM because of the higher efficiency of photon utilization as result of the scattering of photons occurring in the lateral direction as well as in the forward and backward directions. As stated previously, the SFM is indeed a more realistic representation of the scattering phenomena in a photocatalytic reactor than the TFM and therefore should predict reaction conversions closer to reality, though with some degree of conversion overestimation due to the cylindrical geometry. It is worth noting, however, that the uncertainty interval between SFM and TFM predictions is practically negligible when the scattering albedo is 0.3 or less, and becomes significant only at very large values of the scattering albedo. Of particular interest is the determination of the optimum value of the apparent optical thickness, thus the optimal catalyst loading, at which a particular photocatalytic reactor should be operated In The models were applied to the recirculation system following the method reported in Li Puma et al. The derivation of reaction kinetic constants of photocatalytic reactions should always take into account, as a prerequisite, the mathematical modeling of the radiation field in the reactor. It is evident from this example that the most accurate radiation model is necessary to derive precise values of the kinetic constants. For design purposes, the TFM provides an underestimation of the degradation and therefore can be used as a modeling tool for safe design of photocatalytic reactors. Conversely, ignoring radiation scattering in a photocatalytic reactor can result in significant undersizing of photocatalytic reactors or miss determinations of reaction kinetics constants from experimental reactors. In this work, a dimensionless analysis of steady-state, continuous flow, photocatalytic reactors was performed, by suitably coupling mass and momentum balance results with simplified reaction kinetics and radiation absorption–scattering models. These latter ranged from a simple Beer–Lambert model (no photon scattering), to “two-flux” (scattered photons are purely back scattered) and “six-flux” (scattered photons follow the route of the six directions of the Cartesian coordinates) models. Although at the expense of some approximations, these simplified models retain the essential elements of a rigorous approach, whilst providing simple solutions. The effect of scattering albedo, Simulation results show that for each given flow and geometrical condition, optimum values of Finally, model results were compared to experimental data for the photocatalytic oxidation of the herbicide isoproturon in a recirculation batch reactor. As expected the experimental results were found to be enclosed by the Beer–Lambert absorption model and the two-flux radiation model, with the six-flux model providing the most accurate, yet simple, analysis of the photocatalytic reactor performance. This study has demonstrated the importance of performing accurate modeling of the radiation field in slurry photocatalytic reactors, which should be invaluable when analyzing reaction kinetics, for assessing photocatalyst activities and for selecting the optimal catalyst concentration for given reactor geometry and kinetics. In the view of the authors, accurate kinetics studies in photocatalytic slurries cannot be decoupled from the mathematical analysis of the reactor, and a simple tool to perform this analysis has been provided in this work. As a result, reaction kinetic parameters can be estimated with a higher degree of confidence making the corresponding reaction kinetic equations generally applicable to photoreactors of any geometry and size. The SFM model, as presented, can also be used for design and scale-up of photocatalytic reactors and for the prediction of reactant conversion expected in flow-through photocatalytic reactors. It may be worth underlining that, apart from the simplifications involved in the radiant field and kinetic models, mass transfer limitations as a result of radial substrate concentration gradients were also neglected. This has no effect on the predicted performance if the reaction is zero order with respect to reagent concentration (i.e., The authors are grateful to NATO (Grant SfP-977986) for financial support.
