South Africa's state-owned mineral and metallurgical innovation research firm Mintek is to remain focused on platinum-based catalysts for fuel cells. Chief executive Abiol Mngomezulu told MPs that the company remains committed to R&D to promote efficient mineral processing technologies to produce value-added products and services for the mining industry, reports Independent Online. The comment came after it was revealed the Japanese government and its multinational companies would be involved in future fuel cell technology beneficiation in South Africa. Meanwhile, ministers have announced their support for a major new fuel cell trial involving Anglo American Platinum and Ballard Power Systems. Trade and industry minister Rob Davies has previously indicated he wants platinum-based technologies to supply small-scale electricity generators.
