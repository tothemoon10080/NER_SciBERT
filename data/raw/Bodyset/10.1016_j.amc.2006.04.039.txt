In this paper, we present two methods which will exploit hybrid Legendre and block-pulse functions, and Legendre wavelets as bases for L
                     2 ([0,1]×[0,1]), to find an approximate solution for a system of linear Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with two variables. We will apply our methods for an applied example, linear Fredholm fuzzy integral equation of the second kind [M. Friedman, Ma Ming, A. Kandel, Numerical solutions of fuzzy differential and integral equations, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 106 (1999) 35–48].In recent years, many different basic functions have used to estimate the solution of system of integral equations, such as orthogonal bases and wavelets. In this paper we are going to use two kinds of these bases, a simple base, that is a combination of Block-Pulse functions on [0, Now, we introduce these two bases. Consider the Legendre polynomials Set { A set of block-pulse functions For Wavelets constitute a family of single functions constructed from dilation and translation of a single function called the mother wavelet. When the dilation parameter A fuzzy number    This definition is given by Kaleva For arbitrary fuzzy numbers Let If the fuzzy function The integral equations which are discussed in this section are the Fredholm equations of the second kind. The Fredholm integral equation of the second kind is (FFIE-2) A function Consider the following integral equation system: Now we apply these methods for two examples, we compare approximate solutions with exact solutions (see Consider the FFIE-2 with Consider the following FFIE-2 with: In this work, we used properties of the Legendre wavelets, and hybrid Legendre and block-pulse functions, as bases of the
