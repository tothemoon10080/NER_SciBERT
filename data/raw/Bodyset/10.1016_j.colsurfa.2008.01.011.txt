The effect of potassium and sodium cations on the adsorption of starch onto hematite and quartz was investigated. The role of these ions was analyzed in terms of their water structure-making or -breaking capabilities. In the presence of Na+, a structure maker, the polymer adsorption density did not change compared to the adsorption levels observed in distilled water. However, in the solutions of K+, a structure-breaking cation, the adsorption density of starch significantly increased. Assuming hydrogen bonding and chemical interaction to be the driving adsorption mechanism, it was proposed that the starch–oxide interactions can be envisioned as the competition between chemical interaction/hydrogen bonding and solvation energy:

                  K+ reduces solvation energy by disturbing interfacial water structure and thus increases the free energy of adsorption, allowing the polymer to more closely approach the oxide surfaces. In contrast, Na+ which is indifferent to solvation energy does not interfere with the free energy of adsorption.Starch is the most abundant natural polysaccharide found in various plants. It consists of two fractions, a linear polymer “amylase” which contains α- Starch is the universal depressant of hematite in iron oxide processing. The role of starch is to selectively adsorb on hematite and prevent an amine collector from adsorbing onto iron oxide in a reverse flotation process. Various adsorption mechanisms of starch onto minerals have been proposed. Hydrogen bonding between mineral surface hydroxyl groups and the polymer appears to be involved in starch adsorption on hematite and quartz The role of solvation energy in the adsorption behavior of polymers such as starch on solids has received limited attention. In aqueous solutions, hydrophilic solids are coated with interfacial water molecules. According to the model proposed by James and Healy Compared with a small inorganic ion, the adsorption of a polymer macromolecule on hydrophilic surfaces requires a much higher amount of interfacial water molecules to be removed. Thus the role of solvation energy in polymer adsorption could be a significant factor that has been neglected. In fact, adsorption behavior of polymers on hydrophilic surfaces is of great significance to a variety of industries, including mineral processing, water treatment, papermaking, biological and pharmaceutical applications, and synthesis of nanoparticles. In this work, the significance of solvation energy in controlling the adsorption of starch on oxides, i.e. quartz and hematite, was investigated, with the aim to improve the selectivity of starch adsorption onto the oxides by adjusting ionic strength. Quartz and hematite were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and Alfa-Aesar, respectively, with purity >99%. The BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) specific surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption and were found to be 9.3 Corn starch was provided by National Starch and Chemical Company, New Jersey, USA. Unmodified corn starch may be gelatinised (solubilised) either by heating or adding caustic soda. Starch gelatinisation currently utilized in mineral processing industry is stirring the suspension with a caustic soda solution and the same procedure was used in this work. Corn starch was gelatinised by mixing 1 Potassium chlorides and potassium hydroxides were ACS-certified chemicals from Fisher. In the adsorption tests, 1 Zeta potential measurements were performed with the use of a ZetaProbe (Colloidal Dynamics). The ZetaProbe is an electroacoustic instrument operating at 7 frequencies in the range of 0.3–3 In both adsorption tests and Zeta Potential measurements, the pH of the mineral suspensions was adjusted with the corresponding base to avoid introducing foreign cations. Zeta potential behavior of hematite and quartz is presented as a function of pH and background electrolyte concentrations in An isoelectric point is indicated at pH 8.8 for hematite and is not affected by the electrolyte concentration. As   In electrolyte solutions, as demonstrated in Starch is not soluble in cold water and must be put into solution in a process known as gelatinisation. However, the physicochemical fundamentals of starch gelatinization are still not fully understood and different theories have arisen. According to Yamamoto et al. Since starch molecules are anionic, either caused by dissociated –OH group or the presence of fatty acids, electrostatic repulsive force arises between the macromolecules and negatively charged oxides. In this work, the zeta potential of hematite and quartz was significantly reduced by Na Electrostatic repulsive force was reported to decrease the adsorption of starch because of the fact that starch adsorption on hematite and quartz decreases when pH increases from 7 to 11 Therefore, it appears that starch adsorption is not affected by the electrostatic repulsive force between starch molecules and negatively charged oxides. Electrostatic repulsive force was reported to play an important role in the adsorption of bacterial polymers on oxides The gyration diameter of starch molecules was reported to be 0.43 Hydrogen bonding has been generally accepted as the adsorption mechanism of starch-quartz interaction. Hydrogen bonding is always favorable for starch adsorption on oxide; and yet starch, as shown in James and Healy Recent studies provided evidences of different solvation energies on these two types of oxide surfaces. For insulating oxides with low dielectric constants, Gunko et al. For semi-conducting oxides with higher dielectric constants, direct measurements of surface forces (using AFM) between a rutile crystal and rutile sphere did not give any indication of repulsive hydration force in distilled water or dilute salt solutions (up to 0.01 Thus it appears that insulating oxides, such as quartz, possess strong interfacial water structure and hence significant solvation energy, while semi-conducting oxides such as hematite are only weakly hydrated which indicates lower solvation energy. Water molecules tend to adsorb on oxide surfaces through hydrogen bonding, producing a network of water molecules As mentioned above, starch characteristically did not adsorb on quartz until a certain equilibrium concentration of starch was obtained ( Alkali cations widely exist in almost every system involving starch adsorption and interfere with water structure of the solutions. Using The role of divalent metal cations in polymer adsorption has been demonstrated by Liu and Laskowski If the adsorption of starch on oxides is considered as the competition between chemical interaction/hydrogen bonding and solvation energy, i.e.: when K The dramatically increased starch adsorption on hematite in the presence of K It is noteworthy to point out that most polymers influence the mobility and structuring of water beyond the immediate interface to a thickness of several molecular diameters Interactions between starch and oxide minerals were not affected by Na Thus the starch–oxide interactions can be envisioned as the competition between chemical interaction/hydrogen bonding and solvation energy.
