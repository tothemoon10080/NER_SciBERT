Copper ferrite thin films have been prepared by RF sputtering on quartz substrates. By following successive heating and quenching, it was possible to obtain the films, which showed cubic phase in X-ray diffraction. The grain size was found to be ∼30nm. The magnetization was observed to be of the order of 3000G with a coercivity of 480Oe.Copper ferrite is known to exist in tetragonal and cubic structures. The tetragonal structure is stable at room temperature; and it transforms to cubic phase only at a temperature of 350°C and above due to Jahn–Teller distortion CuFe   As mentioned in the last section, the XRD spectra of the quenched samples are very different from the one observed for the SC sample. The spectra of quenched samples are found to be very similar to the cubic lithium zinc ferrite film If we compare the peaks observed in the present samples with the JCPDS data, we find that all the lines for SC sample and those of QA and QN samples can be fitted to the tetragonal and cubic copper ferrites, respectively. However, not all peaks mentioned in the JCPDS data are seen in the films. This is because our films are textured. A similar texture in sputter-deposited ferrite thin films has been found in many systems Lattice parameters were calculated for all the films and are listed in The increase in 4 The magnetization of the QN film obtained by us corresponds to a value of ∼15.2 We have found that the 4 In conclusion, the present study indicates that it is possible to deposit cubic copper ferrite, stable at room temperature, in a thin film form by quenching from the temperature as low as 800°C. The films are nano-crystalline with the grain size ∼30 The authors acknowledge the financial support of Motorola Applied Research Lab, Plantation FL-33322, USA.
