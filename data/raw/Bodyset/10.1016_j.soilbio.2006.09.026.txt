Indigenous soil macroinvertebrates (moth larvae, weevil larvae, earthworms) are cardinal agents of nutrient release from litter on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47°S, 38°′E). Their populations are threatened through predation by introduced house mice, which do not prey on an introduced slug Deroceras panormitanum. A microcosm study was carried out to explore whether slugs affect rates of carbon and inorganic nutrient mineralisation from plant litter differently to an indigenous caterpillar (larva of a flightless moth Pringelophaga marioni). Caterpillars stimulated N, Ca, Mg and K mineralisation from plant litter two to five times more than slugs did, whereas the two invertebrate types stimulated C and P mineralisation to the same degree. Consequently, ratios of C:N and N:P released from the litter were different for slugs and caterpillars. Such differences might affect peat nutrient quality and ultimately the peat accumulation-decomposition balance, an important driver of ecological succession. This suggests that slugs cannot simply replace caterpillars without consequences for ecosystem structure and functioning on the island.Three features have important consequences for ecosystem functioning on sub-Antarctic Marion Island (47°S, 38°′E): (1) the island's hyperoceanic climate means there are no bitterly cold or dry periods and hence a long growing season and high annual primary production ( The lack of herbivores and predators means that most of the energy and nutrients incorporated in the primary production goes through a detritus-, rather than a grazing-, chain. However, the oceanic climate also results in slow decomposition since the consistently cool weather, high cloud cover and very high rainfall result in soils with continuously low temperature and excessive moisture, both of which restrict microbial activity. Decomposition, with the concomitant release of nutrients, is the main bottleneck in nutrient cycling (and hence a major limitation to primary production) for most of the island's plant communities ( As is typical for oceanic islands, invasive alien organisms can substantially influence ecosystem structure and functioning at Marion Island. A particularly striking example is the introduced house mouse ( Such heavy predation, by removing the cardinal agents of nutrient mineralisation, might have serious implications for ecosystem structure and functioning on the island, e.g. decreased rates of nutrient release might result in decreased nutrient quality of plant litter, slower decomposition and hence changed rates of peat accumulation. Peat accumulation, through its effects on the hydrological regime, is one of the most important factors controlling vegetation succession on the island, ( The limacid European slug Potentially then, slugs can replace indigenous macroinvertebrates as nutrient recyclers in areas of high mouse density, according with suggestions based on modelling soil fauna–microorganism functional interactions that ecosystems could sustain the loss of some species or functional groups with little decline in functionality because of compensatory changes in the abundance of surviving species or functional groups ( A microcosm study was carried out to explore whether slugs affect rates of carbon and inorganic nutrient mineralisation from plant litter differently to an indigenous caterpillar (larva of a flightless moth The microcosms were kept in the incubator at 10 The amounts of inorganic nutrients released per gram oven-dry mass of litter were calculated from the leachate concentrations. On days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15, CO Carbon and nutrient mineralisation rates were estimated as the slopes of the linear regressions of the cumulative totals of C or nutrients released against time. The rates (nmol For control microcosms 88–92%, and for animal microcosms 93–97% (difference,  The direct contribution of soil fauna (respiration of ingested C, excretion of ingested nutrients) to decomposition/mineralisation is generally thought to be less important than the indirect effects of the fauna on microbially-mediated mineralisation ( The degrees to which the slugs or caterpillars directly or indirectly stimulated microbial carbon mineralisation in this study can be estimated on the assumption that at the start of the experiment (day 1) the difference in CO Considering the argument made at the start of this paper—that a decline of indigenous macroinvertebrate populations through mouse predation might be compensated for by an increase in the abundance of slugs so that nutrient cycling processes are minimally affected, the most significant finding of this study is that caterpillars stimulated N, Ca, Mg and K mineralisation 2–5 times more than did slugs, whereas C and P mineralisation was enhanced to the same extent by the two invertebrate types. Average C:N ratio released in control microcosms was 1580±296 (1580 It is qualitative and quantitative differences during decomposition such as these that can result in changes in peat nutrient quality, altered density and diversity of soil microbial populations, and a shifted balance between primary production and decomposition. Although this study considered only one of Marion Island's indigenous soil macroinvertebrate species, the results do suggest that the substitution, or partial substitution, of indigenous macroinvertebrates by slugs as facilitators of decomposition and nutrient cycling is unlikely to be inconsequential for ecosystem structure and functioning on the island.
