We study the physical controls on the scatter of exponents in the critical power law relation that describes an acceleration in precursory signals of deformation (displacements) or seismicity (damage) in the vicinity of failure time. Based on the time-dependent fiber bundle model and equal load share (ELS) rule, we find that the critical power law exponents range from −0.5 to −1.0. And values of the critical power law exponents depends on a parameter

                     , which defines the sensitivity of damage growth in a fiber to the local stress. Both the simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the critical power law precursor exponent

Thus, our results illustrate a physical mechanism of variation of the critical power law exponent that is determined by the degree of the local stress controlling the damage evolution of a fiber.Monitoring the critical acceleration of measurable quantities such as displacements or (micro-)seismicity is widely accepted as a proxy for a precursor for failure and for the prediction of time-to-failure [ Eq. However, the uncertainty resulting from the scatter of the critical exponent In materials science and engineering, the fiber bundle model has been widely used [ The local load-sharing (LLS) fiber bundle model was introduced by Harlow and Phoenix [ In the ELS model, the load is shared equally by all surviving elements in the system. Thus if In this paper, we perform an analytical derivation about the critical power law precursor based on the ELS rule. We illustrate that the critical power law exponents change from −0.5 to −1.0. The relationship between the critical exponent with the parameter that reflects the nonlinear relationship between damage rate of a fiber and the local stress, is derived. Then, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to explicitly show the magnitude and variation of the critical exponent. We consider a fiber bundle consisting of When a fiber is subjected to a load history Every fiber is assumed to have a specific lifetime In order to demonstrate the critical power law behavior of break rate and the variation of the critical exponents, we perform an analytical derivation based on a continuous case under ELS. Based on Eqs. To clearly demonstrate the critical power law behavior of break rate, we turn to the series expansion of In fact, accelerating failure could occur for all values of the exponent It has been noted [ We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the breaking process of the time-dependent fiber-bundle model under ELS to explicitly show the magnitude and variation of critical power law exponents. First, random lifetimes are generated according to the Weibull distribution of Eq. The break-rate of the bundle in the numerical simulations is defined as   Based on the ELS rule and the series expansion in the vicinity of failure time, we find that the critical power law exponent This work is supported by
