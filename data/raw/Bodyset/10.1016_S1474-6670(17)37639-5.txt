In this paper the current status of the modeling, simulation and control of the copper-leaching, solvent-extraction and electrowinning process (LX/SX/EW) is investigated. No implementations of advanced process control in the copper LX/SX/EW process have so far been reported. However, model-based control has been successfully applied to solvent extraction processes in the chemical industry, as well as to some other electrowinning processes. A prototype of a process monitoring application based on copper SX/EW steady-state mass balances was designed and implemented. In this paper the structure of the system is described and the test results presented and discussed.
