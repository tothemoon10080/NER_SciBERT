A grinding power model has been developed to predict the power draw of Outotec’s vertical fine grinding mill (HIGmill). The model is based on a combination of laboratory, pilot and full-scale measurements taken over a range of process conditions. The power draw of the mill is influenced by a variety of factors, ranging from simple geometric factors like the grinding disc diameter, spacing and speed to various process factors like the viscosity, density, grinding bead size, fill level and fluidisation velocity. The focus of the model is on scale up to full-scale from laboratory and pilot-scale data, and how to configure the mill for different process scenarios.area (m bead diameter (m) rotor tip diameter (m) mill inside diameter inside diameter of the mill (m) centrifugal force (N) centrifugal force (N) gravity (m/s height (m) mass (kg) number of submerged discs (–) height (depth) of the bead bed (m) mill power (kW) solids pressure due to centrifugal force (N/m solids pressure due to gravity force (N/m volumetric feed rate (m radius (m) Stoke’s setling rate (m/s) slip velocity between the phases (m/s) rise rate (m/s) velocity (m/s) rotor tip velocity (m/s) slurry viscosity (N slurry density (kg/m grinding bead density (kg/m solids volume fraction, taken to be 0.64 when the beads are not fluidised (–) rotation rate (rev Fine grinding in stirred bead mills is becoming increasingly common in the mineral processing industry. Typically they are used as regrind mills in concentrator circuits where the reduced volume of high-grade ore justifies the high energy input, however they are now also being considered for some duties previously performed by ball mills ( Flat discs – Used by VXPmill Deswik (FLSmidth), IsaMill™ (Xtrata/Glencore) and formerly HIGmill™ (Outotec). Radial posts – Used by Stirred Media Detriter (SMD) (Metso). Archimedes screw – Originally developed by Japan Tower Mill Company, became Kubota (KTM). Also by used by Vertimill® (Metso). Castellated rotor – HIGmill™ (Outotec), ( The mills may also be oriented horizontally (IsaMill) or vertically (the remainder). Vertical mills fed from the bottom (HIGmill) will tend retain the beads and coarser (oversized) feed particles, provided they settle faster than the rise rate up the mill. Horizontal mills like the IsaMill use a centrifugal separator ( Most of the fine grinding mills currently used in the mineral processing industry have evolved from the industrial minerals, paint and pigment industries and have increased in size and power considerably ( There is a reasonable body of research into fine grinding mills in the open literature, including mathematical modelling. There are a number of areas of interest. Firstly the actual grinding process, and what product size (P80) can be achieved based on various feed, process and mill conditions like specific grinding energy (SGE), bead size and mixer speed ( A number of models have been proposed for bead mill power draw, either from first principals, semi-empirical or as modified impeller power type equations. They are broadly similar in approach, being algebraic power law equations where the various process variables (mill speed, mixer diameter, etc.) are raised to some power, either derived from assumed physics, or fitted numerically to experimental data.         Despite this, Data has been collected from a number of campaigns with 3 different size mills: Lab scale mill, 30 Pilot scale mill, 75 Small full-scale mill, 700 The details of the methodology is reported elsewhere ( Bead size, density, and fill level were also carefully recorded. Where beads were not mono-sized they were measured to determine the size distribution. In some cases different size/density beads were used within a given campaign, or in some cases the data comes from different campaigns. For most tests the media used was either Keramos 32 series (alumina/silica blend 3200 The feed slurry rise rates were measured via calibrated flow meter. This affects the residence time in the grinding zone and also effects the fluidisation and power draw of the mill. With smaller mills there is a tendency to use a lower rise rate (Eq. Feed density and material density affects the power draw, predominantly via buoyancy of the grinding beads but also by changing the slurry rheology. This was not specifically altered during any of the campaigns, but did vary across the campaigns, as did the F80 and feed particle SG. Water tests were also performed as a baseline. In all 790 measurements were taken for this study, 663 for the model development and 127 for the model checking. 457 measurements were from the 30 Model development initially started with data from the superseded flat disc design.   Flow and speed (previous section) give the most complex response, and differ markedly from what we might expect based on a standard impeller power draw equation. However, there are a number of other factors that the model must respond to in order to be usefully predictive. Increasing the bead fill level increases the power draw, but multiple data sets show that the increase is almost linear. It was expected to be greater than linear (i.e. exponential with an exponential Bead size and density both increase the power draw, presumably due to decreased fluidisation and increased packing of the bed. Unfortunately there is not tidy data to plot, since beads from different suppliers come with both different densities and different sizes. However, Increasing the feed slurry density due to increased solids % w/w appears to have a couple of competing effects (see Having slurry particles between the grinding beads is also likely to change the coefficient of friction. The aim here was to develop a steady-state model in the form of an algebraic equation:           The expectation was that the equation would be a power law similar to Eq.       However, for a bead bed we need to also include the effects of hindrance due to the high particle volume fraction, and also the effect of operating above a particle Reynolds number of 1. There are many functions ( where  And the particle Reynolds number is given by: Since Shiller Neumann’s equation includes the particle Reynolds number, which is itself a function of the settling velocity, a numerical solution is required. Stoke’s law is written in relation to a fixed reference frame (often a graduated settling column), however fluidisation of the beads needs to be written in terms of the relative velocity if the fluid and beads, i.e. the slip velocity ( Eq.     When the rise rate is equal to the critical slip velocity the beads will be just fluidized, i.e. supported hydrodynamically instead of mechanically through the packed bed of beads. At lower rise rates a portion of the gravitational force on the beads will be born hydrodynamically, and the remainder mechanically. Here we assume that the mill power draw (ignoring for the moment the centrifugal forces due to the impeller) will be due to the ratio of the rise and slip velocities, i.e. falling to zero above the fluidisation velocity. For convenience (as will be seen later) we also convert to a solids pressure due to reduced gravity ( The 0.5 gives the average pressure, i.e., half way up the bead bed. Note also that if the rise rate is higher than the critical fluidisation velocity it doesn’t necessarily follow that beads will be swept out the top of the mill. Fluidisation will tend to smear the bed upwards, reducing the bead volume fraction and hence increasing the settling velocity via the Richarson & Zaki term in Eq. Solids pressure can also be imparted to the beads via centrifugal forces from the impeller. Starting with the textbook equation for centrifugal force:      The mass of material rotated by the rotor is not straightforward to calculate since only the central portion of the bead bed is rotated and not the zone near the mill shell. However, if we assume for the moment that the volume out to the tip of the rotor is rotated at the same rotational speed (i.e. rpm, not m/s) as the rotor, and we include a model fitting parameter (         The pressures on the bead bed from gravity and centrifugal force can then be combined and inserted into a power law: The fitted parameters, Various formulations of Eq. Viscosity was also allowed to float in the parameter estimation process, and gave values of 0.0011 and 0.0017 for water and slurry respectively. This comes into the equation via the fluidisation Eq. Bead size is included in the fluidisation Eq.  Since the development of the power model additional data has become available, and this was used to check the model predictions ( A model has been developed to describe the power draw of the new design rotors for Outotec’s fine grinding HIGmill. The equation is in the form of an algebraic equation (power law) and accounts for the effects of rotor diameter, rotor speed, bead depth, number of covered discs and fluidisation rate. Feed slurry density and to some extent viscosity and bead size are also included. The model does not describe grinding per se, and is not concerned with specific grinding power required to achieve a given P80. Rather, the model is developed for machine scale-up calculations from pilot-scale data, i.e. to determine what size machine, rotor configuration, speed, etc. are required to draw the required power. The authors wish to thank especially FQM Kevitsa mine of giving the opportunity to perform several test campaigns and studies parallel with industrial and pilot sized HIGmils. The authors also wish to thank staff from STM and KMF of participating and supporting several test campaigns over the last years.
