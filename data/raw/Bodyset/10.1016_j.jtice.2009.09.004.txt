The use of coconut shells as feedstock for the preparation of activated carbons is well adopted industrially, using conventionally two stage activation process, either using steam or CO2 as the activating agent. The present study attempts to utilize a one-step CO2 activation to prepare activated carbon from coconut shell, which has received far less scientific attention. Experimental results show that activation temperature, CO2 flow-rate, holding time and heating rates have significant effects on BET surface area, micropore volume and pore size distribution (PSD). The optimum conditions for activation have been found to be an activation temperature of 900°C, a CO2 flow-rate of 200cm3/min, a holding time of 140min, and a heating rate of 10°C/min. The optimum conditions yielded an activated carbon with a BET surface areas of 1667m2/g and micropore volume of 0.8949cm3/g, which are significantly higher than the activated carbon produced either using two stage activation process or one-step steam/CO2 activation for other precursors.Activated carbons with highly developed surface area are being widely used in numerous fields, for separation and purification of liquids and gases, removal of toxic substances, as catalyst support, etc. Activated carbons are noteworthy for their ability to selectively absorb molecules from both liquids and gases. Activated carbons have been traditionally produced by the partial gasification of the char either with steam or CO In general, there are two main steps for the preparation of activated carbon: (1) the carbonization of carbonaceous precursor below 800 The one-step activation process is desirable due to lower energy consumption, capital expenditure, processing time that can significantly improve the process economics ( Coconut shells are suitable for preparing microporous activated carbons due to their excellent natural structure and low ash content ( The precursor coconut shells as received from Vietnam is washed with distilled water and dried at 110 The experimental apparatus utilized in the present study for the preparation of activated carbon is shown in Pore structure of the sample is characterized by nitrogen adsorption at 77 It is desirable to produce an activated carbon that has relatively high yield, BET surface area and pore volume as the process economy and the market potential improves with the above characteristics. The effects of activation temperature on the yield, BET surface area, total pore volume and micropore volume of the activated carbons are shown in It could be observed from The effect of activation temperature on the textural properties of activated carbon is also shown in The effect of CO The effect of CO The effect of heating rate on BET surface area, total pore volume and micropore volume of the activated carbon is shown in  The effect of holding time on yield and textural characteristics of the activated carbon is studied in the ranges of 60–160  The effect of holding time on porosity development of activated carbon is shown in   The pore characteristics of activated carbon prepared in the present study, in comparison with the one-step steam or CO Experimental results testify that high surface area activated carbons could be prepared using one-step CO The authors would like to express their gratitude to the
