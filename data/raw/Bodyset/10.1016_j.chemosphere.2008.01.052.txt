In urban area, the accumulation of polluted stormwater sediments (SWS) in retention ponds may be a source of dissolved pollutants and nutrients for the aquatic ecosystems. Our objective was to quantify the influence of the thickness of SWS layer and the occurrence of tubificid worms on organic matter processing (O2 uptake and fluxes of

Releases of acenaphtene and naphthalene from sediments were significantly increased by the thickness of the SWS layer. In contrast, tubificid worms did not promote the mobilization of pollutants. In conclusion, biological activities and stormwater sediment characteristics need to be assessed to quantify the fate of pollutants and nutrients in stormwater retention ponds.The increase in urbanization poses several environmental concerns such as air pollution and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources. The growth of impermeable surfaces limits the natural infiltration of storm water and increases the risk of urban floods. Current management practices consist in collecting and discharging storm water into rivers, ponds or infiltration basins ( Moreover, invertebrates like tubificid worms can pullulate in organic matter-rich SWS ( Despite several studies dealing with the role of bioturbation in SWS ( SWS and tubificid worms ( Sediment columns were prepared by transferring the homogenised SWS (<0.5 For each SWS layer thickness (6 identical columns), two treatments were performed with three replicates per treatment: (1) without invertebrates (control) and (2) with 50 During the 14 For each day of measurement (days 6 and 12), each column was individually sealed during oxygen measurements by stopping the water renewal in the overlying water. An oxygen sensor (UNISENSE, Denmark) coupled with a peristaltic pump was adapted to the columns to measure the O On days 6 and 12, each column was isolated by stopping the water renewal in the overlying water. Water samples (20 Exchange rates of PAH and heavy metals were measured on day 13 of the experiment. All columns were isolated and water samples were collected 0 and 10 During column dismantling (day 14), SWS samples were collected in the top sediment layer (0–1 Particulate organic carbon (POC) was determined by high-temperature combustion of pre-acidified sediment samples and subsequent measurement of CO Analyses of One molecular probe was used on sediment samples to detect the Domains Bacteria (probe EUB 338, eubacteria). The use of this labelled rRNA-targeted nucleic acid probe allows an in situ identification of active microbial cells in their natural habitats ( Hydrolytic activity was measured using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) as substrate for hydrolases ( The living worms were recovered at the end of the experiment (day 14) to estimate mortality and vertical migration in each treatment. The top 10 The concentrations of heavy metals, PAHs, particulate organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus in SWS were compared between treatments (animal SWS had high concentrations of PAHs, heavy metals, and nutrients and were characterized by a high percentage of particles finer than 10 During the experiments, tubificid worms dug galleries in the SWS layer ( Uptake (influx from overlying water to SWS) rates of O The release (efflux) rates of From the 4 heavy metals (Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cu) and the 17 PAHs studied, quantifiable release rates from SWS to the overlying water were only measured for 1 heavy metal (Zn) and 2 PAHs (acenaphtene and naphtalene) in all experimental treatments ( The total numbers of bacteria in the SWS layer were not significantly influenced by the SWS layer thickness and the presence of tubificid worms ( According to our hypothesis, the mineralization of the organic matter (respiration rates) and the releases of solutes (ammonium, phosphorus, organic carbon, heavy metals, PAH) from SWS increased with the thickness of SWS layer: higher mean O According to a previous study performed with another SWS ( In relation with the variability in accumulation of SWS observed in retention ponds, we hypothesized that the stimulation of organic matter and pollutant fluxes by worms would be positively linked to the thickness of SWS layer. This hypothesis was validated by results concerning O The biological degradation of organic SWS represents a net loss in a gaseous form (CO The O Assuming a consumption of 1 The release rates The amounts of ammonium, phosphorus, and dissolved organic carbon released per year in the infiltration bed were estimated to 430 The oxidation of SWS organic matter and the release of nutrients in water were significantly increased by the quantity of accumulated SWS and the bioturbation process. The thickness of SWS layer also influenced the release of two PAHs (acenaphtene and naphthalene) from the sediment to the overlying water whereas the activities of tubificid worms did not appear to promote the mobilization of pollutants. The present study clearly suggests that the bed of stormwater retention systems should no longer be viewed only as physical systems retaining suspended solids transported by storm water but also as biological reactors. This also implies that management practices of retention basins can be oriented to regulate the quantity of accumulated SWS and the biological activities in sediment, thereby influencing the degradation of organic matter and export of nutrients and pollutants.
