The effect of Cd2+ on the electrodeposition of nickel from a sulphate bath in the absence and presence of boric acid has been investigated. The presence of Cd2+ ion suppresses the nickel electrodeposition and shifts the deposition potential to more negative values. The cathodic polarisation is found to depend on the composition of the electrolytic bath. For the various baths investigated, the cathodic polarization order is found to decrease in the order NiSO4

For the Ni2+ electroreduction reaction on stainless steel and nickel substrates the exchange current density decreases with increase in Cd2+ concentration in the electrolytic bath. However the Tafel slope and transfer coefficient are unaffected.The electrodeposition of nickel has been studied by several investigators with respect to current efficiency, polarisation behaviour and deposit structural characteristics The nickel electrodeposition from baths, especially the bright plating baths, are very sensitive to impurities such as Mg Gogia and Das Since Cd The following electrolytic bath compositions were investigated: Bath I (1.02 M Ni Bath II (1.02 M Ni Bath III (1.02 M Ni Bath IV (1.02 M Ni The chemicals used to prepare aqueous solutions for these electrolytic baths were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water (Millipore Milli Q system) was used for preparing the solutions. The pH of the electrolyte was maintained at 2.5. A stock solution of 10 gm dm All experiments to study the polarisation behaviour were carried out in a glass cell with 100 cm Potentiodynamic polarisation measurements were carried out using a PAR model, 273A potentiostat/galvanostat for scanning the potential within 0 to âˆ’1200 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV s The cathodic polarisation of the Ni The NOP values for nickel electrodeposition on stainless steel cathode from the four baths in the absence of Cd The presence of 0.19 M boric acid in the bath (Bath II) had a relatively higher (approximately 20 mV) polarizing effect on the nickel electrodeposition. Boric acid is well known to be strongly adsorbed on a stainless steel cathode surface which increases the cathode polarization and also influences the quality of the electrodeposited metal The co-presence of sodium sulphate together with boric acid (Bath IV) somewhat lowers the polarizing effect of boric acid. One possible explanation for this effect is that sodium ion competes with borate ion for adsorption on the cathode, which weakens the borate polarizing effect.
