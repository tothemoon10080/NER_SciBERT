The Salzach foreland glacier was the easternmost Pleistocene glacier forming significant lobes into the foreland of the European Alps. During or before the penultimate glacial cycle glacial over-deepening excavated a large basin in the foreland area. The basin was later overrun by the glacier of the Last Glacial maximum (LGM), which did not have the over-deepening capacity of previous glacial advances, nor reached the maximum extent of previous glacial stages. In 2009, the Bavarian Geological Survey drilled through 115 m of Quaternary sediments northwest of Freilassing (Neusillersdorf) in the foreland area. The site is located in a drumlin field formed during the last glaciation. The drilling core exposed a typical glacial till at its base. Above follow about 90 m of lacustrine silts and sands with significant amounts of dropstones, overlain by 25 m of coarser sediments with at least one further glacial till at the top of the core. Preliminary luminescence ages indicate that the final phase of basin filling occurred during late MIS 5. In order to support these preliminary chronological results, further luminescence dating together with pollen analyses will be undertaken. The determination of the comminution age of the basal till will also be attempted, this age representing the time elapsed since production of the till material rock flour by mechanical grinding. In case a secure chronology can be established, the results will greatly contribute to a better understanding of Quaternary ice dynamics and glacial over-deepening in the area of the northern Alpine foreland.
