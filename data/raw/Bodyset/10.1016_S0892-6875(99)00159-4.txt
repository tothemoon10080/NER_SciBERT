The current of batch flotation froth modelling is critically reviewed in order to identify its significance and usefulness, particularly in the scale-up of batch data to a continuous flotation process. This review suggests that the concept of the froth recovery factor, R
                     f, may provide the most useful way of establishing the performance of the froth phase in a batch flotation process. The froth recovery factor refers to the fraction of material reporting to the pulp-froth interface which is ultimately recovered in the concentrate. It is also proposed that a froth recovery model based on froth retention time can be used for relating batch froth performance to continuous flotation systems. However, a quantitative model which relates the froth recovery factor and froth sub-processes has yet to be developed.
