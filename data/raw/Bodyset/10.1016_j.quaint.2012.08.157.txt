The Magdalenian is the first Upper Palaeolithic period to show a widespread human occupation along the northeastern territories of Iberia. Several sites have been located across the plains and mountains extending from the Pyrenean valleys of the Segre River to the mouth of the Ebro River. The oldest dates (17th millennium BP) were obtained at the open-air site of Montlleó, in the Pyrenean valley of Cerdanya. Most of the Magdalenian sites have yielded information about short or seasonal occupations related with the exploitation of natural resources. Parco cave preserves a good stratigraphic sequence ranging from middle to upper and late Magdalenian (from 15th to 13th millennium BP). In this site, various human activities were organized around a significant number of hearths. They were related with animal and mineral processing. The data obtained at Parco and Montlleó sites have enabled the reconstruction of the Tardiglacial palaeoenvironment for the southeastern Pyrenees area. However, other sites from the southern part of the country are also providing very interesting information about climate, as well as faunal and floral elements. Some malacological remains found in Montlleó come from the Mediterranean coast, but others come from the Cantabrian area, thus opening a new route of connection between both seas during the Magdalenian. We have also a few artistic evidences comes from Taverna cave, Parellada IV, Fornols Haut and Molí del Salt sites. One of the most significant findings of our research is the archaeological confirmation of the existence of a mountain pass across the Pyrenees during the Magdalenian. Some raw materials found in Montlleó are from French origin, others come from the southern slopes of the Pyrenees, and other ones could come from either side. The site is near the most western path opened during the last glaciation for crossing the Pyrenees. Thus, people and materials may well have circulated across the Pyrenees through this corridor.
