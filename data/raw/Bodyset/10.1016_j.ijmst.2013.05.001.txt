This paper attempts to optimize optimal capacities, block routing and mine sequencing problems in a mining system. The solution approach is based on a heuristics and the mixed integer programming (MIP). Unlike previous sequential solution approaches, the problems are herein solved at the same time. Furthermore, the proposed approach guarantees practical solutions because it considers ore material distribution within orebody. The paper has two main contributions: (a) the proposed approach generates production rates in a manner that the capacities are satisfied; (b) the proposed approach does not use pre-defined marginal cut-off grades. Thus, idle capacity problem is eliminated and different scheduling combinations are allowed. To see the performance of the approach proposed, a case study is carried out using a gold data. The schedule generated shows that the approach can determine optimal production rates, block destination and sequencing effectively.
