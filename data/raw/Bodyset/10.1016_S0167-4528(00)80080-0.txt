The uneven dissemination of minerals, including emulsion-type inclusions, the high degree of sphalerite activation, and the presence of a wide range of copper minerals, as well as generations of sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and bornite, are the cause of low recoveries and performance values of ore beneficiation processes. An ore processing technology is proposed ensuring production of highgrade monoselective flotation concentrates containing copper, zinc, and pyrite concentrates, as well as copper-zinc sulfide product. Individual unit operations of the proposed process technology have been tested and proven. This technology makes it possible to improve copper, zinc and precious metals recoveries by 3รท5%, 15รท25% and 10%, respectively.
