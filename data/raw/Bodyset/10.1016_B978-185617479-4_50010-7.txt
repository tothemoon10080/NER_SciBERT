A variety of processes are in use today for the manufacture of metals and alloys in powder form. The late Professor Lenel, in his classic text, Powder Metallurgyâ€”Principles and Applications, categorized them into chemical, physical and mechanical processes. This chapter provides a technical overview on the process types, followed by a review of the processes in commercial use in present day for various metal powders. Apart from the gradually increasing scale of operations, there have been few changes in powder production processes over the past decade or so. In this chapter, production methods for all the major types of metal and alloy powders are reviewed. A variety of processes are in use today for the manufacture of metals and alloys in powder form. In practice, several of the more common metal powders are produced by combinations of these process types. Iron and copper powders, for example, are often made by comminution and reduction of an oxide, whichis a combination of both mechanical and chemical processes. The point of discussing the various processes is that they can result in powders having differing properties. Such differences may make the powders suitable for completely different applications. Most of the recent advances have been in alloy compositions and in the way powder metallurgy (PM) grade ferrous powders are treated in preparation for compaction, for example, with special binders and lubricants.
