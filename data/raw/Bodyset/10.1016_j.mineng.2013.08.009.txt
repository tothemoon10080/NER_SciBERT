This work reports the results of a combined accelerated carbonation and wet granulation treatment applied to Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steel slag with the aim of producing secondary aggregates for civil engineering applications and of storing CO2 in a solid and thermodynamically stable form. The tests were carried out in a laboratory scale granulation device equipped with a lid and CO2 feeding system. In each test, humidified slag (liquid/solid ratio of 0.12l/kg) was treated for reaction times varying between 30 and 120min under either atmospheric air or 100% CO2. Under both conditions, the particle size of the treatment product was observed to increase progressively with reaction time; specifically, the d50 values obtained for the products of the combined granulation and carbonation treatment increased from 0.4mm to 4mm after 30min and to 10mm after 120min. Significant CO2 uptake values (between 120 and 144g CO2/kg) were measured even after short reaction times for granules with diameters below 10mm and for the coarser particle size fractions after reaction times of 90min. The density, mineralogical composition and leaching behavior of the obtained granules were also investigated, showing that the combined granulation–carbonation process may be a promising option for BOF slag valorization, particularly in terms of decreasing the Ca hydroxide content of the slag. Another interesting finding was that the leaching behavior of the product of the combined treatment appeared to be significantly modified with respect to that of the untreated slag only for coarse uncrushed granules, an indication that the carbonation reaction occurs mainly on the outer layer of the formed granules.Steelmaking industries produce significant amounts of alkaline solid residues, ranging between 10% and 15% by weight of the produced steel, depending on the characteristics of the manufacturing process ( The reuse of BOF slag in civil engineering applications may be also constrained by the need of complying with environmental acceptance criteria set by national legislations, generally based on the results of leaching tests. Due to the alkaline nature of BOF slags, leachate pH may achieve values even above 12 ( Thus, summarizing, the valorization of BOF slag may be limited by both an inadequate technical performance especially for high-grade applications and by its environmental behavior. Several studies have indicated that the leaching behavior and mechanical properties of alkaline materials such as steelmaking slags may be affected by accelerated carbonation treatment, which also allows to store CO Recently, the combination of granulation with accelerated carbonation has been proposed in order to improve the leaching behavior of residues such as waste incineration ash and quarry fines, produce secondary aggregates and reduce CO The aim of this work is to evaluate the applicability of combined granulation and carbonation as a valorization technique for BOF slag and to compare the effects of this process with those exerted by granulation under atmospheric air, so to analyze the influence of carbonation on particle aggregation and on the properties of the products. Specifically, the paper reports and discusses the results of granulation and granulation–carbonation experiments carried out on BOF slags samples in a laboratory scale granulation device at different reaction times in terms of the effects exerted on the physical properties, CO The slag used in this study is a by-product of a steel making plant employing the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) process. The sample was collected from the open air storage site after crushing and magnetic separation for iron and steel recovery. The particle size of the untreated material was lower than 2 Both the granulation and granulation–carbonation experiments were performed using a 180 For both types of experiments, air-dried slag (approximately 500 Both granulation and granulation–carbonation processes exerted a relevant effect on the particle size distribution of the material. The average diameter of the obtained granules resulted in both cases between 4 In The apparent particle density of both the untreated slag ( The extent of carbonation of the slag, resulting from the reaction of the alkaline phases with either atmospheric CO On the basis of the IC content of each treated sample, its CO These data were also used to evaluate the calcium conversion yield, (Rx), defined as the ratio between the carbonated Ca, proportional to the measured CO The CO The weighted average CO XRD patterns of the untreated slag and of granules obtained after granulation and granulation–carbonation carried out for a reaction time of 90 and 120 The results of the In order to evaluate the effects of the agglomeration process on the release of major and trace components, leaching tests were also performed on each particle size fraction of the granules obtained after the treatments without crushing. The leaching behavior of the granulation products resulting for crushed and uncrushed samples, see The carbonation–granulation treatment appeared to significantly affect the leaching behavior of the uncrushed granules obtained after a reaction time of 120 The significant differences noticed in pH, Ca, Ba and V leaching of the products obtained from granulation–carbonation without crushing may be associated to a higher extent of carbonation achieved in the external layer of the granules with respect to the internal core that can be hardly reached by CO The aim of this work was to analyze the effects of a combined granulation–carbonation treatment applied to BOF steel slag as a CO In conclusion, granulation–carbonation seems to be a promising treatment for BOF steel slags valorization. The process may in fact help in addressing two technical issues currently hindering the reuse of BOF slags: inadequate particle size and low volumetric stability. Besides, also the environmental behavior of the product was shown to improve upon the combined treatment, in particular in terms of pH decrease and Ba immobilization, although this seems to be the case only if the leaching test is performed on the granules without any preliminary size reduction step. Hence, in order to verify that upon use the particles will keep their original shape and size and will not undergo excessive crushing under the loads expected in civil engineering applications, forthcoming activities will include the assessment of the mechanical properties of the products. In addition the changes in the porosity and morphology and microstructure of the core and external layer of the granules resulting from the combined granulation–carbonation treatment will be investigated.
