This paper presents that oil–liquid interfacial tension (γ
                     OL) value significantly affects the oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction processes as oil-assisted methods in fine particle processing. The decrease in the oil–liquid interfacial tension leads to the decreases in the recoveries of minerals in both oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction techniques. Eventually, these oil-assisted methods do not take place below a particular value of oil–liquid interfacial tension. The oil–liquid interfacial tension value at which oil agglomeration does not occur was defined as ‘critical oil–liquid interfacial tension for oil agglomeration, γ
                     c–OL–a’ and at which liquid–liquid extraction does not take place was also defined as ‘critical oil–liquid interfacial tension for liquid–liquid extraction, γ
                     c–OL–e’. Consequently, the oil–liquid interfacial tension of the medium for successful processes of oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction of a mineral must be higher than the related critical interfacial tension value.Fine particles produced during grinding process in mineral processing operations decrease the efficiency of the concentration processes. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing a process that could successfully handle such fine particles. Oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction are important separation techniques among oil-assisted fine particle processing processes Wetting of solid surfaces by liquids has many practical applications and consequently has been an important area of both applied and basic research for many years. The wettability properties of solids or minerals are assessed quantitatively by a number of experimental and empirical techniques. ‘The critical surface tension of wetting ( The effect of air–liquid interfacial tension on flotation, shear flocculation, oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction processes has been largely investigated previously as stated above. It is important to understand the interfacial phenomena of the three-phase system composed of oil, water and solids and to clarify the criteria of surface properties for successful operation of the oil-assisted separation methods such as emulsion flotation, oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction The aim of this work is to emphasize the importance of oil–liquid interfacial tension ( The oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction experiments were conducted using high purity samples of celestite (SrSO Methanol–water solutions of different concentrations (%, w/w) were prepared and employed in order to obtain the construction of oil agglomeration and liquid–liquid extraction recoveries (%) versus The oil agglomeration experiments were carried out in a 400 The liquid–liquid extraction tests of minerals were carried out in a stirred cylindrical cell system.
