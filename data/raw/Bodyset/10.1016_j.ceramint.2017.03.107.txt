M. Sharifitabar has commented on our manuscript. A comprehensive response has been prepared by the authors. Responses are as follow: M. Sharifitabar stated that weight percent of reactants in the initial mixture calculated using reaction According to reaction Accordingly, due to the very low weight percent of Cu element, no identification peak is anticipated to appear in XRD pattern. It should also be noted that all of the results and discussion in the manuscript entitled â€œContribution of mechanical activation and annealing in the formation of nanopowders of Al(Cu)/TiC-Al Mechanical alloying has now been shown to be capable of synthesizing a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium alloy phases starting from blended elemental or prealloyed powders. The non-equilibrium phases synthesized include supersaturated solid solutions, metastable crystalline and quasicrystalline phases, nanostructures, and amorphous alloys
