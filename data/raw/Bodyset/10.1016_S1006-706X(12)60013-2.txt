Influence of sintering temperature, basicity and MgO content on the formation characteristics of calcium ferrite in low silicon sinter of Baotou Iron and Steel Company was studied by means of mini-sintering test and miner-alographic microscope analysis. In addition, the suitable sintering parameters such as temperature and basicity were explored. The results found that optimum temperature for the formation of calcium ferrite is 1280 °C, the basicity of 2. 5–2. 8 is helpful to the development of acicular or columnar calcium ferrite, and MgO content in the low silicon sintering raw materials should be lower than 2.8% because MgO can intensively inhibit the formation of calcium ferrite. And calcium ferrite in the sinter belongs to calcium ferrite with low calcium, which is different from that in ordinary sinter at home and abroad. So, it provided theoretical basis for promoting formation of calcium ferrite in low silicon sinter and improving properties of sinter.
