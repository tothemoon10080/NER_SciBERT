Positron Emission Particle Tracking observations of charge and slurry flow have shown that the pressure drop is effectively described by an Euler equation modified by a Darcy-like term. Here we consider the inverse problem: constructing and testing approximate solutions to the new Dynamic Ergun Equation. These solutions allow the prediction of transport in tumbling mills and other systems given information on the pressure drop and charge motion.Understanding slurry transport has been a bottleneck in improving tumbling mill performance ( Herein This new Dynamic Ergun Equation is basically Eulerâ€™s equation modified by the Darcy-like first term on the right hand side. Whereas in In this paper we address the inversion problem for the slip velocity since then the superficial velocity follows trivially. The balance of this paper is organised as follows: in Section The primary difficulty with solving the Dynamic Ergun Equation is the last or convective term Here Using PEPT data for 70% of critical speed, the relative size of these driving terms is exhibited in A difficulty still lies with the derivative terms on the left hand side of Eq. Noting that the right hand side of Eq. The approximate Eq. We have shown how to construct approximate solutions of the new Dynamic Ergun Equation for the slip velocity This work was supported by
