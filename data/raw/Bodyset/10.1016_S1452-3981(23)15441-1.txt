The literature dealing with the electrochemical corrosion of copper and possibility of its prevention using inhibitors is examined. Inorganic compounds are investigated as well, but organic compounds and their derivatives in much greater numbers. Researches are directed to influence of compounds structure, concentration, method of application as well as media that inhibitor is used in on inhibition efficiency. Moreover, action mechanisms are studied. The attempts to find models, which can enable prediction of possibilities of newly synthesized compounds to act as corrosion inhibitors, combining theory and practical investigations of substances with similar structure are also significant.
