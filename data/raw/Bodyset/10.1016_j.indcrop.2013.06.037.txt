Corn straw was chemically and anatomically characterised. Hydrothermal processing (autohydrolysis) was used for the selective solubilisation of hemicelluloses. The raw material was treated under non-isothermal conditions (150–240°C) and the effects on the composition of both liquid and solid phases were evaluated.
                  The yields and composition of the solid fraction and soluble products are presented and interpreted using the severity factor (log

                  The XOS rich liquors and the glucan and lignin enrichment of the solid phase make corn straw a suitable raw material in a biorefinery framework and the hydrothermal treatment a favourable first step in the processing.Plant biomass has the potential to play an important role in the global energy future because it can be grown in a sustainable manner and converted into a variety of products, namely biofuels and chemicals, using biochemical, thermochemical or catalytic conversion processes ( In this context, agricultural residues are an interesting and potentially low-cost biomass source. Among them, corn ( Before they can be converted into biofuels and different added-value products, lignocellulosic materials need to be fractionated into their main macromolecular components, cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin ( Since autohydrolysis only uses water as reagent, several advantages are associated with this process as compared to acid hydrolysis, such as low by-product generation, limited problems derived from equipment corrosion owing to the mild pH of reaction media and reduction of operational costs since further neutralisation can be omitted ( Several biological activities of XOS have been described such as prebiotic effect, antioxidant activity, protective effect against lipid peroxidation, and anti-inflamatory activity, among others ( The aim of this work is to study the selective fractionation of hemicelluloses from corn straw using hydrothermal treatments (autohydrolysis). The effects of pre-treatment on the yield of XOS, monosaccharides and by-products, together with the effects on both cellulose and lignin recovery, were evaluated and interpreted using the severity factor (log Corn straw was supplied by Estação Nacional de Melhoramento de Plantas (Elvas, Portugal) as an heterogeneous sample containing stalks and leaves as obtained as field agricultural residue. As described in the literature, stalks represent about 70% and leaves 30% ( After granulometric characterisation of all fractions, particles smaller than 250 Corn stalks were cut as small cross-sectional discs and after inclusion in polyethylene glycol 1500, thin transverse and longitudinal sections (±17 The light microscopic observations were made using a Leica DMLA microscope and photomicrographs were taken with a Nikon Microphot–FXA. Samples of corn straw were gold coated and observed using different magnifications with a Hitachi Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (S-2300; Hitachi, Japan) using 20 Both the corn raw material and the solid residues obtained after autohydrolysis treatments at 215 and 240 Autohydrolysis treatments of the corn straw lot, containing all the granulometric fractions but one (<0.25 When the desired temperature was attained, the reactor was rapidly cooled down and the liquid and solid phases were recovered by pressing (up to 190 The materials were ground in a knife mill (IKA, Germany) to a particle size smaller than 0.5 The samples were analysed for glucan, xylan, arabinan and acetyl groups after quantitative acid hydrolysis with 72% (w/w) H The liquors were directly analysed by HPLC. Elution took place at 50 Another sample was hydrolysed with 4% (w/w) H Total phenolic compounds were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method according to For FTIR spectra acquisition the extractive-free samples were first dried in an oven at 60 The spectra were recorded with standard KBr pellet technique in a Nicolet 740 spectrometer with a dTGS/KBr detector at 4 The enzymatic digestibility of the untreated and pretreated corn straw was evaluated based on the NREL/TP-510-42629 protocol (  The epidermis forms the outermost layer as a continuous uniseriate layer of closely packed epidermal cells covered at the outside by the cuticle and a cutin layer, showing frequent stomata openings ( The vascular bundles are scattered in the ground tissue, densely packed in the periphery and loosely arranged in the central part ( The analysed structure is in accordance with previous observations on this species ( A granulometric separation was performed after size reduction of corn straw to particles inferior to 6 All the granulometric fractions were chemically characterised ( The enrichment in ash material in the fines after grinding coupled with a lower polysaccharides content has been reported for several types of biomass ( The chemical composition of the raw material used in this work is shown in Lignin content was in the range of values described for less lignified materials such as cereals and grasses ( As for ash content it was inferior to the values described by other authors (  The highest recovery of XOS was obtained by the hydrothermal treatment performed at 210 and 215 Xylose yield increased and reached a maximum value of 3.78 These results are similar to those reported for wheat straw autohydrolysis ( In contrast with xylan, glucan essentially remained in the solid phase. However, some oligosaccharides made up of glucose (gluco-oligosaccharides, GlcOS) were recovered in the liquor reaching a maximum yield of 1.36 In all conditions, HMF concentrations were also low and similar to those reported for the autohydrolysis of other raw materials ( The composition of the liquors obtained from autohydrolysis of corn straw under the different conditions is presented in Arabinose and glucose had both the maximum concentration at log Total phenolics concentration increased with severity, probably due to the solubilisation of some lignin compounds. This effect should however be small since there was no significant loss of lignin in the solid residues, even in the severest conditions (14% at the most). The pH of the liquors for the mildest condition was about 5.5 and decreased with the severity of the treatment. This decrease of pH is due to the hydrolysis of the hemicellulosic acetyl groups which is higher in more severe conditions. Under the optimised condition (log  Glucan was almost not affected by the hydrolytic treatment and therefore its content in the solid residue increased with severity in relation with the decrease of hemicellulose content. For instance the solid residue obtained for a severity of log Under the present conditions of autohydrolysis no significant removal of lignin was expected to occur and in fact, up to severity factor log The compositional changes of the autohydrolysed material were also followed by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of the raw material and of the solid residue after autohydrolysis under optimised condition at 215 The most conspicuous differences were seen at the intensity of peaks at 1265 and 1740 The band at 1630 Autohydrolysis pretreatment can alter the ratio of amorphous to crystalline cellulose associated with the ratio of intensities of the 900 and 1098 The hydrothermal pretreatment previously discussed is conducted mostly by chemical considerations to solubilise the hemicelluloses, and leaving lignin and cellulose for further applications or for a subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis step ( In order to assess the effect of hydrothermal process conditions on the cellulose digestibility, enzymatic hydrolysis of insoluble solids was carried out. The structural features of the autohydrolysed corn straw was observed at the microscopic level to see if the treatment besides affecting the chemical composition, as shown in  Autohydrolysis was highly selective towards hemicelluloses. The extent of xylan depolymerisation depended on the severity of the autohydrolysis. A high recovery of XOS, that corresponded to 53% of initial xylan, could be obtained under relatively mild conditions at 215 Cellulose and lignin were not substantially solubilised by the autohydrolysis treatment although an increase of cellulose enzymatic digestibility was attained. The XOS rich liquors and the glucan and lignin enrichment of the solid phase makes corn straw a suitable raw material to be used in a biorefinery framework and the hydrothermal treatment a favourable first step in the processing.
