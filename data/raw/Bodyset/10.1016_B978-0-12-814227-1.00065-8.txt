  More recently, Mitren has focused on developing innovative technologies to improve blast furnace productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mitren is a graduate of the University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada where he completed bachelor, masterâ€™s, and PhD degrees in materials science and engineering. His areas of expertise include thermodynamics, heat, mass, and momentum transfer in pyrometallurgical processes. Mitren is a licensed professional engineer in Ontario, Canada with 5+ years experience as a consulting process metallurgist.   Professor Davenport spent much of his career visiting industrial plants around the world. This has resulted in his co-authoring of the following books: Extractive Metallurgy of Copper Iron Blast Furnace Flash Smelting Extractive Metallurgy of Nickel, Cobalt and Platinum Group Metals Sulfuric Acid Manufacture and: Rare Earths, Science, Technology, Production and Use. Professor Davenport is a fellow and life member of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum and a 25-year member of the (U.S.) Society of Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration. He is a recipient of the CIM Alcan Award, the TMS Extractive Metallurgy Lecture Award, the Aus. IMM Sir George Fisher Award, the AIME Mineral Industry Education Award, the American Mining Hall of Fame Medal of Merit, and the SME Milton E. Wadsworth award.
