Forty years ago, in 1962, the first European Symposium on Comminution took place. Since then there has been a tremendous development in the area of comminution and classification, and it is still a challenging area. This series of symposia, providing an excellent platform for scientific and technical exchange and discussions, plays an important role in the development of comminution and classification. The planning of the 10th European Symposium on Comminution started in 1999 when Heidelberg was approved as a venue by the Working Party Comminution and Classification of the European Federation of Chemical Engineering. The Working Party on Comminution and Classification served as the scientific committee for the symposium. The organisation and the execution of all practical arrangements of the symposium were assigned to the VDI-Society of Chemical and Process Engineering, Düsseldorf, Germany. A program committee, headed by Detmar Redeker, Walsrode, was appointed. The symposium covered a wide range of topics: ultrafine grinding, mills, models, control, mechanical activation, comminution of organic and other non-brittle materials, testing, classifiers, particle breakage, applications and attrition. Financial sponsoring from a large number of companies in Germany was gratefully received. It was decided at an early stage to provide pre-prints of all lectures and posters to the symposium on CD-ROM and to publish the papers after reviewing. An agreement was made with Elsevier to publish these papers in a special volume of the Finally, I thank Mr. Peter Plegnière, VDI-Society of Chemical and Process Engineering, for his great efforts during the planning, organisation and excellent execution of the symposium. A special “thank you” goes to a couple of persons who have contributed significantly to the editing process. However, they wish to remain anonymous.
