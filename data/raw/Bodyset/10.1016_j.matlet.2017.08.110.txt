Long-term stability still remains a big issue for metal sulfides anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Porous nano-sized material possesses many advantages. Here, we have successfully synthesized the porous carbon-coated polycrystalline Co9S8 (C-CS), which exhibited a high specific capacity (841mAhg−1) and good rate property (6.4Ag−1) for LIBs. In particular, C-CS electrode showed an excellent cycling stability at 2Ag−1 with a capacity retention of 84.7% after 400 cycles, demonstrating it a promising LIBs anode.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained great success in various applications from portable electronic devices to electric vehicles due to their advantages including high energy density, long lifespan and convenience Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to search effective ways including designing novel nanostructure, carbon-coated particles and hybridization with carbonaceous materials, to address the above issues Inspired by the above discussion, we have successfully fabricated hierarchical porous Co For preparing the C-CS, 5 All the XRD diffraction peaks of C-CS ( SEM images of our sample are shown in The electrochemical performances of C-CS as anodes for LIBs were evaluated in the voltage window of 0.01–3.0  In summary, the hierarchical porous carbon-coated polycrystalline Co This work was financially supported by the
