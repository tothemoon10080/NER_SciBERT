Application of a radiometric density meter for monitoring of the coal separation process in a jig has been discussed in the paper. The signal from the meter can be used to evaluate the degree of coal grain loosening during cyclic water pulsations and to determine the separation density in a jig. The signal from the radiation detector is highly nonstationary due to stochastic decay of the radiation source and various changes in media density. The paper discusses the optimisation of analogue and discrete filters applied in an electronic circuit of a density meter. The minimum dynamic error of measurement can be achieved in the case of filters with parameters adapting to changes in the measured density. Results of industrial tests of the jig control system with the radiometric density meter have also been presented.
