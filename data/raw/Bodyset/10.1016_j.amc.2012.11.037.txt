In this paper, we are going to solve a system of two coupled discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations with a saturable nonlinearity, using the (G′/G)-expansion method. The traveling wave solutions found include hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions and rational functions. From the hyperbolic functions solutions obtained in this study, the dark, bright and multiple dark solitons solutions are derived simultaneously using the variation of the parameter of saturation.In the past few decades, many methods aimed at deriving exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations have made a tremendous progress in mathematics and physics. Several kinds of these methods developed in the literature are: the Hirota’s bilinear method More recently, the ( In this study, we explore new applications of the method, and extend the study proposed by Aslan In our analysis, we think that the application of this method to the multiple coupled discrete nonlinear equations provides a rich knowledge on the mechanism of the complicated physical phenomena and dynamical processes modeled by these forms of nonlinear evolution equations. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section In order to tackle Eqs. We assume that the solution of Eqs. For   For   For   The ODE (         In summary, using the
