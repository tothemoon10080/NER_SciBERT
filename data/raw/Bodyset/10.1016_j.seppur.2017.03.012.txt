In this study, the influence of NH4HF2 activation on the leaching of low-grade complex copper ore in NH3-NH4Cl solution was studied. The related thermodynamic, optimization, and kinetic studies were investigated by an exponential computation method, orthogonal tests, and shrinking core model, respectively. The results indicate that NH4HF2 can react with Fe2O3, SiO2 and Al2O3, and the concentration of NH4HF2 is the crucial factor on the digestion of the gangues combined with copper oxides. The optimum leaching conditions were established as 3mol/L NH4Cl, 2.5mol/L NH3·H2O, 1mol/L NH4HF2, 10mL/g liquid to solid ratio, 60°C, and 3h. Under the conditions, the leaching efficiency of copper was 89.39%. The leaching process is controlled by the diffusion of reactants across product layer, and the activation energies corresponding to 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5mol/L NH4HF2 were calculated as 27.9, 19.8, 30.7, and 32.6kJ/mol, respectively.Copper is one of the most vital metals in the world and is primarily extracted from sulfide ores As reported, ammonia is a good selective reagent for copper extraction Unfortunately, low-grade complex copper oxide ore is abundant in the world, especially in China. For example, Tangdan copper ore is the largest oxide copper mine at present in China. The characteristics of the ore, including high-grade calcium magnesium carbonate gangues, high combined rate, copper content of 0.75%, and extremely complex copper phase composition, make it difficult to be utilized by the present technologies. To destroy the blocking of gangue minerals, mechanical activation is a common method for addressing this problem If there is a chemical agent that can react with a part of the gangue minerals to destroy their obstruction and hence provide some channels for leaching agents to contact with the bonded copper oxide, the copper extraction from complex copper oxide ore will be greatly increased by adding the agent into the ammonia-ammonium chloride solution. In analytical chemistry, fluoride ions in acidic condition are a good agent for digesting silicon- and iron-containing minerals, because fluoride ion has a small ionic radius and thus presents strong permeability. Besides, literatures reported that ammonium fluorides could effectively react with silicate minerals to form (NH The copper ore used in this study was obtained from Tangdan, China. The chemical composition of the ore was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF, Rigaku, model ZSX Primus II) The leaching experiments for condition optimization were carried out in a three-neck flask of 500 In addition, the kinetic experiments were also performed using the setup shown in The dissolution thermodynamic was studied by calculating the solubility of different oxides in a solution using an exponential computation method based on both mass balance and charge balance equations As mentioned previously, the purpose of NH To investigate the effects of experimental parameters, including c(NH As shown in Since F As is well known, the leaching of bonded copper oxide is the key to the recovery of such copper ores and the concentration of NH The leaching process of copper oxide is a fluid-solid heterogeneous reaction and can be represented as the following equation For this system, the leaching reaction occurs on the interface of two phases. The shrinking core model (SCM) is the common kinetic model for fluid-solid reactions and our previous study demonstrated that the leaching of copper oxide complies with this model Chemical reaction: Product-layer diffusion: To investigate the rate-controlling mechanism, the SCM with chemical reaction and diffusion across product layer as the rate-controlling steps, Eqs. For further determining the kinetic parameters, Arrhenius equation K Obviously, for a given The following conclusions can be drawn from the thermodynamic, optimization, and kinetic studies on the leaching of low-grade complex copper oxide ore using NH Thermodynamic calculations indicate that NH The operating conditions, including c(NH The leaching process is controlled by the diffusion of reactants across the product layer, and the activation energies corresponding to 0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 The authors would like to thank the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
