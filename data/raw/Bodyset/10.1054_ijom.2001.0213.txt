Abstract.
                  By using an endoscopy assisted extraoral and transoral approach for open reduction of condylar mandible fractures with limited incisions, the risk of facial nerve damage and extensive visible scars can be reduced. The endoscopy-assisted treatment of 17 consecutive patients with fractures of the condyle was performed from April 1998 to December 1999. Of the 17 patients, 13 presented with additional mandibular fractures. Nine of the 17 patients were treated by a submandibular approach and eight by a transoral approach. Adequate anatomic reduction was achieved by the submandibular and transoral approach using an endoscopy-assisted technique. The transoral approach proved to be a reliable surgical approach for fractures of the mandibular condyle, even when dislocation with lateral override was present. In four patients, angulated drills and screwdrivers facilitated the transoral treatment of condylar fractures. Transbuccal stab incisions and the use of trochars were not needed in these four patients. The extraoral approach was indicated for severely dislocated fractures such as fractures with medial override or comminution.
