The method for the Dual Graphite (DG) iron production has been demonstrated in this work. The dual graphite iron refers to the iron with the coexistence of the Lamellar Graphite (LG) and Spheroidal Graphite (SG). The basis of this new type of iron are having the lamellar graphite structure where the damping capacity and heat transfer is needed; having the spheroidal graphite structure where the strength and impact resistance is required. To produce the DG iron, the sulfur-containing cores were placed in the mold cavities. The sulfur in the cores reacted with Mg in liquid iron upon contact creating the Mg depleted zone. As a result, the morphology of the graphite in the area adjacent to the cores was transformed from spheroidal to lamellar. In this work, the level of sulfur in cores ranging from 0 to 3.36% were used in the experiment. It was found that the thickness of LG iron increased with the sulfur level. The LG iron as thick as 4,794 Î¼m was observed at 3.36%S.
