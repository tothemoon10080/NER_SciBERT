Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’ (GUM S1) proposes a Monte Carlo method for the propagation of the probability density functions (PDFs) assigned to the input quantities that are related to an output quantity through a measurement model. Guidance is provided in GUM S1 for assigning PDFs to the input quantities for which data but no prior knowledge are available. The procedure relies on Bayes’ theorem and on the use of appropriate non-informative priors. An inconsistency in the choice of such priors is pointed out.Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’ (GUM S1) In Chapter 6 of GUM S1 the PDFs GUM S1 specifies the PDFs obtained by Bayes’ theorem for Gaussian and Poisson random processes only. In the former, available indications As mentioned above, prior functions for all imperfectly known parameters in the likelihoods are required. If some information about these parameters exists it permits prior PDFs to be established, for instance with the help of the principle of maximum entropy. However, situations arise when For example, if the likelihood function is given by Eq. The ‘posterior’ joint PDF for the unknown parameters (or the univariate PDF in the case of a single parameter) is obtained by multiplying the prior with the corresponding likelihood followed by normalization. Thus, multiplication of the likelihood The Support of
