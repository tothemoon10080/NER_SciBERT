The present communication describes the development of a novel incremental formulation for the determination of the flow stress of austenite, as a function of microstructure and deformation conditions. The proposed constitutive description is validated by employing the flow stress curves derived from axisymmetric compression tests performed with samples of a SAE 5120 steel, both under constant and transient deformation conditions. The hot-working response of this structural steel grade has been analyzed in the temperature range of 850 °C to 1200 °C, at strain rates in the range of 0.01 to 10 s−1. Under most deformation conditions dynamic recrystallization occurs and the evolution of the volume fraction recrystallized has been determined by an appropriate incremental form of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation. The work-hardening rate of the material in the work-hardening and dynamic recovery transient has been described by an equivalent incremental form of the original differential equation advanced by Estrin and Mecking. It has been shown that this novel approach allows a very precise description of the experimental values of the flow stress of the material during deformation under constant deformation conditions, as well as the trend followed by this parameter under transient loading conditions. The latter analysis is conducted on the basis of the H parameter indicated by Abbod and co-workers. It has been determined that hot working of this steel grade at low temperatures in the austenitic range, followed by cooling to room temperature at moderate rates, leads to a significant refinement of the ferrite-pearlite microstructure, with ferrite grain sizes of less than 10 µm.material parameters material parameters in the STG model, s Burgers vector, m initial austenitic grain size, µm parameter for describing the changes in Z with strain index in the incremental formulation material parameter, MPa µm material parameter material parameters in the STG model material parameters in the Hansel-Spittel model Avrami exponent universal gas constant, J mol time, s time for 50% dynamic recrystallization, s material parameter apparent activation energy for hot-working, kJ mol apparent activation energy for dynamic recrystallization, kJ mol Absolute temperature, K volume fraction recrystallized dynamically material parameter Zener-Hollomon parameter, s material parameter material parameters in the STG model, MPa strain increment time increment, s work-hardening or work-softening rate of the material, MPa total effective strain effective strain rate, s−1 temperature-dependent shear modulus, MPa dislocation density, m flow stress of the material, MPa flow stress corresponding to the work-hardening and DRV curve, MPa athermal stress, MPa critical stress for the onset of DRX, MPa peak stress, MPa yield stress, MPa saturation stress, MPa steady-state flow stress, MPa initial work-hardening rate, MPa flow softening due to dynamic recrystallization, MPa Industrial hot-working operations conducted on the different steel grades employed in the manufacture of parts and components for land transportation applications involve a large number of variables and therefore, their analytical treatment is not only extremely complex, but also quite limited. As a consequence, numerical approaches based on finite element methods (FEM) are commonly employed for modeling and optimization of such processes. An essential aspect of such methods is the accurate description of the changes in flow stress and work-hardening rate of the material with deformation conditions and microstructure. For this purpose, most commercial finite element (FE) codes assume that the flow stress of the material under processing can be described by means of simple parametric relationships such as the Hansel-Spittel (HS) work-hardening law In the above equation, σ represents the effective stress, ε the effective strain, Clearly, the above relationship exhibits a number of significant drawbacks concerning the accurate description of the flow stress of austenite. Firstly, it assumes that the material follows a mechanical equation of state and therefore that at any given strain the flow stress depends only on deformation temperature and strain rate. Secondly, it does not take into account that under some deformation conditions austenite could exhibit work-softening as a consequence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). Thirdly, since strain is consider as state parameter, the above equation would not be able to describe correctly the changes in flow stress under transient loading conditions, that is to say, when changes in deformation temperature and strain rate occur in the course of plastic deformation.  In the past few years significant efforts have been made in order to study the microstructural evolution and to develop rational constitutive formulations for describing accurately the changes in flow stress and work-hardening rate of different steels grades during deformation under hot-working conditions Another approach often employed for describing the constitutive behavior of steels deformed in wide range of deformation conditions is that involving the determination of the so called processing maps The analysis of the changes in flow stress and work-hardening rate of steels with deformation conditions during hot deformation has also been approached by means of artificial neural networks (ANN) and cellular automata formulations Multi-physics and internal state variables constitutive models formulated in incremental form, as well as cellular automata-FEM modeling have also been developed in the past few years for the analysis of the deformation behavior of both ferrous and non-ferrous materials deformed under a wide range of deformation conditions Thus, in the present communication a new constitutive formulation for the description of the flow stress and work-hardening rate of steels deformed under hot-working conditions is proposed. The advanced approach is formulated in incremental form, in such a way that it can be employed for the description of the flow stress of austenite either under constant and transient loading conditions, regardless of the occurrence of dynamic recovery (DRV) or DRX during deformation. Such analytical structure allows the updating of deformation temperature and strain rate after each strain increment, without the need of assuming the validity of a mechanical equation of state. The different parameters involved in the formulation are derived in a consistent and rational manner from the experimental flow stress data. Axisymmetric compression samples of nominally 15 mm in height and 10 mm in diameter were machined from a commercial SAE 5120 steel bar. The machined specimens were subsequently austenitized at 1173 K for 30 min and air cooled. Axisymmetric compression tests were carried out in vacuum employing a Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical system. Testing was conducted in the temperature range of 1123 to 1473 K at strain rates in the span of 0.01 to 10 s In order to reduce friction during testing, the samples were grinded on their flat surfaces employing SiC abrasive papers of 240 mesh and lubricated with a high-temperature anti-seize Ni-based compound stable up to temperatures in the range of 1427 The samples were heated up in vacuum to the testing temperature at a heating rate of 3 In order to characterize the austenitic grain size (AGS) prior to testing, a thermal etching technique was employed. As an example,  Opposite to the constitutive description provided by the HS work-hardening law, the above Figures illustrate that plastic deformation starts from a well defined yield stress, σ In the above relationship, Q represents an apparent activation energy for deformation and R the universal gas constant. Thus, the above Figures clearly illustrate that as Z increases all the stress parameters also increase. If the material only exhibits DRV as the operative dynamic softening mechanism, the work-hardening rate could be conveniently described by means of the differential model early advanced by Estrin and Mecking In the above equation, σ If the material exhibits work-softening by DRX, as the vast majority of the curves shown in In the above equation, X Here, t represents the time and n In the above equation A′, q and v represent material parameters which, together with Q An alternative incremental relationship to Where Ψ = σ The apparent activation energy for hot deformation is usually determined from the temperature and strain rate dependence of σ Whereas the Z dependence of both σ However, in the case of σ  On the other hand, The critical stress for the onset of DRX, σ An important aspect concerning the modeling of the experimental flow stress curves is that related to the description of θ The values of the parameters k The final feature concerning the structure of the incremental constitutive law that is proposed is related to the DRX kinetics of the steel under investigation. As indicated in It can be clearly observed that at constant temperature the DRX kinetics is significantly accelerated as the strain rate increases, which is in agreement with the Z dependence exhibited by t The accuracy of the developed constitutive description for predicting both the flow stress and work-hardening rate of this structural steel during deformation under hot-working conditions can be assess from It is widely known that during industrial hot-working operations deformation conditions do not remain constant, but significant changes in Z could occur. Such changes in strain rate and deformation temperature would lead to transient deformation conditions under which it would not be appropriate to compute the flow stress of the material by assuming the validity of a mechanical equation of state. An incremental constitutive formulation, as that advanced in the present work, would be more suitable for this purpose since changes in deformation conditions could be updated after each strain increment, prior to the computation of a new flow stress value. Therefore, it seems important to analyze the predictive capabilities of the formulation for describing the changes in flow stress when changes in deformation conditions take place. As indicated by Abbod et al.  In both cases, the magnitude of H = ± 5, approximately.  In order to tests the limitations of the incremental formulation for predicting the changes in flow stress, more steep changes in strain rate were performed. Finally, Commercial FE codes employed for the simulation of hot-working process usually make use of constitutive models such as that described in A plausible way of avoiding such difficulties would be the use of equivalent incremental equations, which could be more easily implemented and which still would allow the updating of deformation temperature and strain rate after each strain increment through the loading history path. Thus, Accordingly, the flow stress value after each strain increment along the work-hardening and DRV curve can be computed from its previous value, after updating the corresponding deformation conditions. In a similar way, N Both the numerical integration of Thus, as far as the computational scheme advanced in the present communication is concerned, the final computation of the flow stress could be carried out by implementing the condition that: In this way, the set of The second aspect which is important to discuss concerns the basis the of the advanced constitutive description. The proposed incremental formulation is based on the notion that the flow stress depends on the total dislocation density of the material through an equation of the form: Thus, it becomes apparent that the accuracy of the present constitutive description for predicting the flow stress values of the material during deformation under transient loading conditions will depend on the magnitude of the path change that occurs in the corresponding hot-working schedule. According to the results of The final aspect which seems important to discuss concerning the hot-working processing of the steel under investigation is that related to the ability of hot deformation for refining the microstructure of the material observed at room temperature.
