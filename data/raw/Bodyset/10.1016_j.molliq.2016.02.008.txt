Theoretical study on the strength of interaction between hydrated lanthanide cations and some organic aromatic compounds has been reported. At first, the interactions of two hydrated metal cations, ]M(H2O)9[3+ (M=La3+, Lu3+), with π-system of a number of benzene derivatives including electron donating and electron withdrawing substituents were studied. The results confirm that ]Lu(H2O)9[3+ has more affinity to adsorb on benzene ring and its derivatives than [La(H2O)9[3+. Then the interactions of above cations with carbon atoms of the benzene ring were compared with those between the [La(H2O)9]3+ cation and C80H20 armchair single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and also fullerene molecule. The results showed that, the interaction in two latter systems is considerably larger than those in corresponding complexes of benzene and its derivatives. It seems that the curvature of the surface of SWCNT and fullerene molecules provides an excellent location for landing of [La(H2O)9]3+ cation on the organic aromatic compounds through its four H2O molecules. Also the study on bond critical points (BCPs) between ]La(H2O)9[3+ cation and the SWCNT, fullerene and benzene and its derivatives indicates that among all systems investigated here the {[La(H2O)9]3+…… SWCNT} has the greatest values of electron density (ρ).Noncovalent interaction is a major concern in chemistry of liquids, molecular aggregates, and biological systems because it plays a key role in a variety of fundamental processes such as solvation, The performance of five density functional methods; BP86, B971, MPWB95, PBE and M06, with def2-TZVP basis set was investigated by computing the interaction energies of cation and benzene as π-system in {[La(H Since the interpretation of DFT results on large molecular systems is never straightforward, it is important to compare the functional against results obtained from using sophisticated post-Hartree-Fock calculations. Some researchers have successfully applied the MP2 methods for several non-covalent OH/π interaction with various systems, and their data on latter interaction are used here as reference values Two possible isomers were considered for the complexes {[M(H The optimized geometries of {[M(H The interaction energy, IE, between the [M(H Here Both the calculated IE The values of partial charges on C and H atoms involved in the bonding interactions and total charge of [M(H The maximum change in the value of charge of the interacted carbon atoms was shown in the case of {[La(H A second-order perturbation theory analysis of the Fock matrix was carried out to evaluate the donor–acceptor interactions on the base of NBO analysis. The values of donor–acceptor interactions in the compounds are given in Indeed, both [La(H According to the survey, and topological analysis of electron density data, we can obtain much information about the nature of molecular bonds. The AIM theory is based on the topological properties of the electron density field ρ(BCP) Also the order of the electron density values (ρ) in BCPs between [La(H MESP Density functional theory has been used to compare the strength and the nature of interactions between ]M(H The authors acknowledge the
