This study investigated the surface characteristics and biocompatibility of phosphate ion (P)-incorporated titanium (Ti) surfaces hydrothermally treated with various concentrations of phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The surface characteristics were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, thin-film X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, optical profilometry, contact angle and surface energy measurement and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). MC3T3-E1 cell attachment, spreading, proliferation and osteoblastic gene expression on different surfaces were evaluated. The degree of bony integration was biomechanically evaluated by removal torque testing after 4weeks of healing in rabbit tibiae. The H3PO4 treatment produced micro-rough Ti surfaces with crystalline P-incorporated Ti oxide layers. High concentration H3PO4 treatment (1% and 2%) produced significantly higher hydrophilic surfaces compared with low H3PO4 treatment (0.5%) and untreated surfaces (P
                     <0.01). ICP-MS analysis showed P ions were released from P-incorporated surfaces. Significant increased cell attachment (P
                     <0.05) and notably higher mRNA expressions of Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin and osteocalcin were observed in cells grown on P-incorporated surfaces compared with cells on untreated machined surfaces. P-incorporated surfaces showed significantly higher removal torque forces compared with untreated machined implants (P
                     <0.05). Ti surfaces treated with 2% H3PO4 showed increasing tendencies in osteoblastic gene expression and removal torque forces compared with those treated with lower H3PO4 concentrations or untreated surfaces. These results demonstrate that H3PO4 treatment may improve the biocompatibility of Ti implants by enhancing osteoblast attachment, differentiation and biomechanical anchorage.Numerous studies have demonstrated that a titanium (Ti) oxide layer modified by various methods improves bone healing around Ti implants. A micro-porous crystalline Ti oxide layer or one incorporated with potentially bioactive ions accelerates implant bone healing by promoting osteoblast cell differentiation in vitro, and by increasing bone–implant contact and biomechanical anchorage in vivo Several studies have performed anodic oxidation treatment using phosphoric acid in order to produce biocompatible Ti surfaces for biomedical applications Surface properties, including micro-topography, chemistry and wettability, are important factors affecting the quality of bone healing by influencing the biological responses of bone-interfacing implants Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the surface characteristics of Ti surfaces produced by varying the phosphoric acid concentrations for use in future biomedical applications. The surface in vitro osteoconductivity was evaluated by observing cell attachment, spreading, proliferation and osteoblastic gene expression using MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells, and in vivo implant integration was biomechanically evaluated by comparing removal torque forces in rabbit tibiae. Disks made from commercially pure Ti (ASTM grade 3) rods, 14 The surface morphologies of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4300, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The crystalline structure and chemical composition of the oxide layer were investigated by thin-film X-ray diffractometry (XRD; X’Pert-APD, Philips, Almelo, The Netherlands) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Quantera SXM, ULVAC-PHI, Tokyo, Japan). After acquiring XPS data, samples were cleaned with argon sputtering for 30 For ionic release measurement, three disks of each group were immersed in 20 MC3T3-E1 cells, a mouse calvaria-derived osteoblast-like cell line, were plated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco–BRL Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco–BRL Life Technologies), 500 The cells were seeded on disks in 24-well culture plates at a density of 4 For the evaluation of initial cell attachment and proliferation, cells were cultured on Ti disks in 24-well culture plates at an initial seeding density of 4 The cells were seeded on disks in 24-well culture plates at an initial seeding density of 4 Seven adult male New Zealand White rabbits weighing 3.5–4 The implant site osteotomies were prepared in the usual manner. A final drill diameter of 2.85 Removal torque tests were performed to evaluate implant stability in the bone bed. The removal torque value in Newton centimeters (N Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 14 statistical system (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The means and standard deviations of data were calculated. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed to evaluate differences between groups. Values of The surface morphologies of the investigated samples are shown in     The P-incorporated surfaces (TiP-1, TiP-2 and TiP-3) showed significantly lower water contact angles and significantly greater surface energy than the machined surfaces ( ICP-MS analysis revealed that P ions were released from the P-incorporated samples into the physiological saline solution (  After 1  All the P-incorporated implants showed mean removal torque values (RTV) higher than the machine-turned implants ( In this study, we investigated the surface characteristics, osteoblastic cell response and biomechanical anchorage of P-incorporated Ti oxide surfaces produced by hydrothermal treatment using various concentrations of H The P-incorporated surfaces showed better osteoblast responses, and significantly increased strength of the bony integration of implants, which was evaluated by removal torque forces, compared with untreated machine-turned implants. These results coincide with a previous in vivo study showing improved osseointegration with P-incorporated Ti oxide surfaces compared with various commercial microstructured surfaces in rabbit tibiae Enhanced initial cell attachment and spreading on P-incorporated micro-rough surfaces are in agreement with the results of other studies reporting better adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells on grit-blasted or grit-blasted/etched micro-rough surfaces compared with relatively smooth machined surfaces MC3T3-E1 cells grown on the P-incorporated surfaces showed notably higher expressions of key osteoblast genes – a major transcription factor regulating the osteoblast differentiation (Runx2 The degree of biomechanical anchorage of P-incorporated implants with bone tissue, which was evaluated by removal torque testing, showed tendencies to increase compared with untreated machine-turned implants. P-incorporated implants showed a 1.6- to 2.4-fold increase in mean removal torque values (RTVs) compared with machine-turned implants, indicating strong bone attachment behavior of P-incorporated surfaces. Ti implants treated using 2% (w/w) phosphoric acid showed higher mean RTV than those treated using lower concentrations of phosphoric acid (0.5% or 1%) and machine-turned implants. Removal torque testing has been used as a valuable biomechanical method to evaluate the strength of implant integration in bone tissue Between the Ti surfaces having similar moderately micro-rough Ti surfaces with a more homogenously covered P-incorporated oxide layer (TiP-2) showed significantly increased wettability compared with those with a nonhomogenous P-incorporated oxide layer (TiP-1), but no difference was found in RTVs between the two groups, despite different wettabilities and In this study, P-incorporated Ti oxide surfaces significantly enhanced cell attachment, osteoblastic gene expression and removal torque forces compared with machined surfaces. The primary mechanisms of action of enhanced osteoblastic cell behaviors and biomechanical anchorages are likely to be by surface wettability and P chemistry. Superior wettability might promote integrin-mediated cell attachment by increasing the adsorption of cell attachment-promoting proteins, and P might play an important role as a specific signal for inducing osteoblast cell differentiation. In addition, moderately micro-rough surface features and an increased surface area may be beneficial to further enhance osteoblast differentiation and biomechanical anchorages of P-incorporated surfaces In this study, hydrothermal treatment using various concentrations of H This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the
