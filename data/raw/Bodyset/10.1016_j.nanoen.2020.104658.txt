In this study, we develop a synergistic modulation of the thermal conductivity and power factor of Cu3SbSe4-based materials through Sn and Zr or Hf co-doping by using a facile microwave-assisted solvothermal method. A series of Cu3Sb1-xMxSe4 (M = Zr or Hf, x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08) compounds are firstly synthesized through the microwave-assisted solvothermal method combined with spark plasma sintering (SPS) process. The effect of Zr and Hf doping on the thermoelectric properties of Cu3Sb1-xMxSe4 (M = Zr or Hf) has been investigated. With increasing the content of Hf and Zr, the thermal conductivity of Cu3Sb1-xMxSe4 (M = Zr or Hf) is obviously decreased to 0.518 Wm−1K−1 of Cu3Sb0.92Hf0.08Se4 and 0.433 Wm−1K−1 of Cu3Sb0.92Zr0.08Se4 at 623 K, respectively. In addition, Sn doping further improves the low electrical conductivity and boosts the power factor, yielding a peak zT value of ~0.82 of Cu3Sb0.91Sn0.03Hf0.06Se4 at 623 K, which is ~228% higher than that of the pristine Cu3SbSe4. Our work provides a new methodology for the decoupling of thermal and electrical properties of the Cu3SbSe4-based thermoelectric materials.Thermoelectric materials, which can be used in thermal-electrical energy conversion, has drawn extensive attention [ Cu  In this study, we prepared a series of Cu Copper(II) chloride (CuCl Cu In order to remove the residual ethylenediamine and by-products, the collected powders were heat-treated at 573 K for 2 h under Ar flow. Afterwards, powders were loaded into 13 mm diameter graphite die and then sintered by spark plasma sintering (SPS-211Lx, Fuji Electronic Industrial Co., Ltd, Japan) at 623 K for 5 min under an axial pressure of 40 MPa. The density of sintered pellets was measured by the Archimedes method (shown in The phase purities of as-synthesized powder samples (before or after annealing) were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα ( Density functional theory has been carried out on the Vienna In order to understand the band structure of pristine Cu In addition, compared with the pristine Cu       The calculated temperature-dependent  Given the conclusions drawn above, we can outline that the thermoelectric performance of Cu     To further explore the electrical transport behavior of the doping samples, we further calculated   In this study, a synergistic optimization of the thermal and electrical properties for  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
