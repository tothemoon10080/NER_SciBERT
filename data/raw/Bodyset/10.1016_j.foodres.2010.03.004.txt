The thermoluminescence (TL) is one of the physical methods recommended by the European Committee for Standardization, for the identification of irradiated food from which silicate minerals can be extracted. The efficacy of the method strongly depends on the quantity and purity of the extracted minerals, and therefore on the extraction procedure. In this work we applied the TL for the identification of crustacean Nephrops norvegicus irradiated at 0.5−1.5−3.0kGy, comparing two different procedures for extracting minerals: by means of a density gradient or with acid hydrolysis. The identification of the irradiation treatment was always achieved with both procedures, without any false positive. A dose reconstruction method was also set up and tested. A little preference should be given to the acid hydrolysis extraction procedure, that requires less quantity of food sample and reagents, as well as less time to be carried out, and gives a satisfactory reconstruction of dose.Food hygienic quality can be enhanced using ionizing radiation processing to reduce food spoilage due to microorganism and to significantly decrease insect infestation, extending, this way, the shelf life of food itself. To increase the general consumer acceptance and consequently to facilitate the commercialization and trade of irradiated food, reliable analytical techniques should be available to identify irradiated foodstuffs for legal control purposes. The thermoluminescence (TL) technique is a physical method that has been validated by the European Committee for Standardization for the identification of the irradiated foodstuff, from which contaminating silicate minerals can be isolated, such as spices, aromatic herbs, and some species of shellfish ( Several authors have studied the TL response of silicate minerals extracted from seafood (see for instance The first goal of this work was to extend to the crustacean Furthermore, since the evaluation of the dose delivered to the irradiated foodstuff could be useful in a quality assurance program in food processing, a methodology for dose estimation, based on the TL measurements, was set up and tested in this work. Various approaches and procedures employing luminescence techniques have been proposed for dating purposes in archeology and geology, and are of potential applicability also in the field of food irradiation. The so-called multiple aliquot additive dose (MAAD) consists in irradiating, at various calibration additive dose, several individual aliquots (quartz and/or feldspars) of the same sample for which the dose reconstruction is required ( To overcome these restrictions, dose reconstruction procedures making use of a single aliquot have been developed. With the single aliquot additive dose (SAAD) method ( A different additive dose method, using TL, has been set up by The single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol ( As for the SAAD method, also the SAR protocol requires an accurate but not straightforward monitoring of the sensitivity of the aliquot ( In this paper we propose another method for dose estimation in a single aliquot of silicates extracted from irradiated Crustaceans were provided by the Istituto Zooprofilattico di Puglia e Basilicata, within a common research project. They were stored frozen, also throughout irradiation, until used for minerals separation and TL measurements (total storage time around 30–40 Frozen crustaceans as a whole (inside polyethylene bags), as well as the minerals transferred on steel discs, were irradiated with a The density separation method consisted of the following main steps: Grade 3 water was added to 10 The minerals were isolated from the organic material by means of a density gradient of sodium polytungstate solution (density 2.0 The carbonates adhering to the silicate minerals were dissolved adding a solution of hydrochloric acid 1 The water was removed and the separated minerals were resuspended in acetone and deposited on a stainless steel disc (0.25 The hydrolysis separation method consisted of the following main steps: Solution of hydrochloric acid 6 All the glow curves (TL emission as a function of temperature) were recorded with an Harshaw 3500 TL reader and using the following instrumental setting: voltage 500 For each recorded glow curve, the integrated TL signal was calculated as the sum of the counts recorded by the TL apparatus in a defined temperature range, selected as suggested in Annex B of the European guidelines ( The identification of irradiation treatment is based on the comparison between two successive thermoluminescence measurements of the minerals extracted from the food sample: from the first glow curve, recorded after extraction and storage at 50 Minerals extracted from unirradiated food should show a “TL Ratio” (TL For dose assessment purposes, the calibration curve of the TL Ratio as a function of the absorbed dose was built up. The TL Ratio was determined for all the aliquots of silicates extracted, following the two separation methods under investigation, from The experiments were carried out in the dose range 0.5–3.0  No significant differences were observed among the amount of minerals (usually between 1 and The results of the TL Ratios of all the samples analyzed are shown in Since the TL Ratio values increase with the given dose, we tried to use this trend for retrospective dose estimation, setting up an approach different from other methods reviewed in the Introduction. The basis of the procedure is the build-up (once and for all) of the dose–response curve for the TL Ratio of silicates extracted from For both the investigated extraction procedures, the averaged TL Ratio was plotted as a function of dose D ( Better results were obtained with the hydrolysis extraction procedure ( As blind test, the obtained best fitting functions were used as calibration functions to evaluate the given dose in samples irradiated at 0.50 or 1.50 The obtained results confirm that the thermoluminescence technique can be validly applied as identification method of irradiated crustacean All these aspects make the separation procedure with acid hydrolysis preferable in routine analyses in laboratories of food quality control.
