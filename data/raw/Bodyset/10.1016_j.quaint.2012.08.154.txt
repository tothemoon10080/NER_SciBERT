River systems respond to climate changes and regional tectonics in complex manner, and the sediments are arguably the archives of such interactions between climate, tectonics and landscapes. It has been, however, difficult to quantify long-term variations of sediment generation, transport and depositional history due to the lack of suitable method. In this study, we propose a combined approach of cosmogenic nuclides, U-series and luminescence dating to quantify sediment processes in 10â€“100 ka timescales. Cosmogenic nuclides in river sediments have been used to estimate the time-integrated basin-wide denudation rates (e.g., von Blanckenburg, 2005, EPSL, 237, 462-479). U-series comminution age dating has been proved to be useful to determine residence time of sediment particles at source outcrop and river streams (Dosseto et al., 2008, EPSL, 265, 1-17). Corrected for deposition ages by luminescence dating, the comparison of cosmogenic nuclide data and U-series ages in sediment samples allows us to test various hypotheses in rates of sediment generation, transport and possible storage of sediments in floodplains. In this paper, we present our first cosmogenic
