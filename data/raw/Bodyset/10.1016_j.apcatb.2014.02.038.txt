A series of CeO2-TiO2 composite samples were obtained by a single-pot microemulsion method followed by calcination. The composite samples contain fluorite (CeO2) and anatase (TiO2) nanometric phases with a ceria content ranging from 1 to 25mol%. Using these samples as photocatalysts, toluene mineralization and Escherichia coli 1337-H inactivation were carried out under UV and visible illumination conditions. To interpret the photo-catalytic results and provide quantitative bases to compare the performance of the composite samples with respect to titania and ceria single oxide nano-references the study focuses on analyzing kinetic differences. The kinetic analysis of both types of degradation processes provides conclusive evidence that the composite Ce-Ti system outperforms the Ti reference nano-materials (including P25) by a factor exceeding 3 under UV conditions and 1.7 for sunlight-type or visible light. Together with the low activity of the Ce single reference, the results show that a synergistic effect occurs between the two oxide components of the Ce-Ti system. Maximum activity, irrespective of the chemical or biological target nature as well as the energy of the excitation, was always achieved with samples having low Ce loadings, below 5mol%. Such a general enhanced activity indicates that the Ce-Ti system can be a “universal” candidate to provide a highly active material with improved performance with respect to nano-anatase.reaction rate, mol m inverse of number of charge carrier, dimensionless quantum efficiency correcting factor, dimensionless fractional selectivity, dimensionless local rate of photon absorption, Einstein cm lamp radiation intensity, Einstein cm spectral absorption coefficients, dimensionless thickness, cm cartesian coordinate, cm spherical coordinate, rad outwardly directed (to the catalytic film) unit normal vector, dimensionless solid angle, sr unit vector in the direction of radiation propagation, dimensionless angle between the ray trajectory and the film outwardly directed normal, rad wavelength, nm  radius of sample cylinder, cm lamp radius, cm microorganism concentration, CFU kinetic constant for microorganism inactivation, CFU pseudo-adsorption constants for microorganism inactivation, (CFU relative to i product relative to glass relative to the sample film maximum limiting value minimum limiting value relative to lamp relative to the sample film relative to the surface lamp relative to undamaged microorganisms relative to damaged microorganisms inhibition coefficient for microorganism inactivation, dimensionless Heterogeneous photocatalysis is an Advanced Oxidation Process using nanocrystalline semiconductors which find useful utilization in the degradation of both organic and biological pollutants. This is essentially based in the excellent performance and stability of titania, one of the most prominent photocatalytic material for the mineralization of typical pollutants as organic molecules or the inactivation of microorganisms that can pose serious health, food or other risks. Its action is typically carried out under mild conditions, e.g. room temperature and atmospheric pressure and using oxygen (air) as oxidant agent In this work we aim to explore the chemical potential of the CeO In this contribution we plan to test the photo-catalytic role of the CeO To this end, we subjected the photo-catalytic results concerning toluene photo-degradation and The analysis performed in this contribution indicates that the most active Ce-Ti samples contains very low quantities of CeO Materials were obtained by means of a microemulsion preparation method utilizing Gas phase selective photo-oxidation tests were carried out with toluene and using a set-up described elsewhere Reaction rates were evaluated under steady state conditions, typically achieved after ca. 8–10 The classical formulation of the quantum efficiency requires the calculation of the ratio between the number of molecules reacting by the number of photons interacting with the catalyst To evaluate the denominator of equation Where The microorganism used in this study is The xCeTi samples together with blank tests (using either light without catalyst or the materials at dark conditions) were measured using the same bacterium inoculums (8.8 Modelling of the inactivation profiles was achieved, as mentioned, using an approach grounded in a simplified (Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like multistep-type) reaction mechanism based in three parameters; kinetic ( We modified this model by assuming a fast decay from “undamaged” to inactivated cells which would lead to a simplified mechanism with a single differential equation paralleling the one of a classical Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism: Numerical solution of the corresponding set of equations was achieved with a 5th order “adaptive size controlled” Runge-Kutta program, coupled to a Full Newton (non-linear fitting) algorithm The physico-chemical characterization results for the xCeTi samples are summarized in The photo-chemical properties of the materials under UV and sunlight-type are presented in  As mentioned previously, the first step in calculating quantitative quantum efficiencies corresponds to the numerical calculation of the local net superficial rate of photon absorption ( The calculation of the quantum efficiency (Q.E.) yielded values presented in Results of the photo-inactivation of To interpret the disinfection capability of the samples, The kinetic constant behavior through the sample series is presented in The similitude between results of Finally, to justify the inactivation curves it is therefore obvious that adhesion and charge carrier attack to the microorganism are important; however, other possible effects related to surface-poisoning need to be considered. The latter is quantified within our kinetic analysis by the inhibition coefficient ( A series of five CeO In this contribution we applied kinetic schemes that open the playground for comparing quantitatively the relative performance of the CeO A.
