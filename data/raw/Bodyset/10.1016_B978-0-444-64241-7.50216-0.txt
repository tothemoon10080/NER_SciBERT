A genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed along with a novel general framework for the scheduling of a typical multipurpose/product batch plant. The majority of literature regarding these problems make use of mathematical programming methods. Modelling problems in this manner leads to numerous binary variables relating to material balance and sequence of batches along long-time horizons, thus resulting in large computational time. The proposed GA does not suffer the same scalability issues of mathematical programming approaches. The GA makes use of a coupled chromosome system with specific crossover and mutation functions utilised with the purpose of profit maximisation. Results show that optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can be achieved with a reduction of up to 98.53 % computational time in certain cases. The focus of this work is to obtain close-to-optimal solutions at reduced computational times. This is done through a novel representation of integer coded tasks and real valued times generalizable to any particular batch plant configuration and optimizable with any suitable metaheuristic. A well-posed and accepted case study of a multipurpose batch Utilising a metaheuristic approach, specifically a genetic algorithm, two examples are considered: a motivating example and the aforementioned primary example.  The corresponding data for The primary example considered involves a relatively complex flowsheet introduced by In both examples, variable processing time is considered. Mathematical programming approaches have proven successful in managing constraints where the assignment of tasks to units is dependent on preserving correct material balances. The framework and GA introduced here satisfies all the recipe-dependent constraints in the accepted STN descriptions by
