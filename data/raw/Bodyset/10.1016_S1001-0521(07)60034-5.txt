Abstract
                  The influences of solid particles in leach solution on the formation of the third phase crud during solvent extraction of copper were studied. Analyzed from the point of view of pH value and surface tension, the study results showed that the solid particle is one of the most important contributors for the formation of the third phase crud. During solvent extraction, if the pH value was greater than 2.30, the number of solid particles in the mother solution increased, in which case the possibility of forming the third phase crud could also increase, and the interface tension value might grow in pace with the quantity of the third phase crud.
