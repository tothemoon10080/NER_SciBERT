In this study, formic acid was used to reduce the carbonate content of the ground phosphate rock. Effect of acid concentration, liquid/solid ratio (v/w), reaction time and temperature has been studied to get marketable and industrially acceptable phosphate grades. Depending on leaching conditions, it was found that the P2O5% could be raised by 30–35% along with corresponding reduction in CO2% up to 67–72% at a phosphate recovery of more than 70wt.%.Phosphate rocks should not contain more than 8% carbonates in order to be economical. Organic acids can be used for selective leaching of carbonaceous materials in low-grade phosphate rocks ( Low-grade phosphate rock was crushed and screened to collect the (−4.699 Sample (5.0 Effect of acid concentration and liquid/solid ratio on P The economy of the process depends on the price of formic acid and cost of its recovery. Formic acid is recovered by a number of routes ( Formic acid can be used to reduce the calcareous material in low-grade phosphate rock as it improves the P
