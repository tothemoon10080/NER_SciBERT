This is an interesting, diverse and appropriately entitled book. This book is well presented, well written with good illustrations; I believe it is over priced. The book clearly covers what the authors intended to do, it targets industrial and analytical chemists, chemical engineers, chemical processing engineers, plant designers and computer modellers. It will also be useful to chemical and petroleum engineering students and researchers. It contains thirteen chapters and introduces a systematic molecule-based modelling approach with a system of chemical engineering software tools and shows the applicability of chemical engineering principles for building kinetic models. The book discusses a software package which integrates molecule-based kinetic modelling “Kinetic Modeler’s Toolbox” and includes examples and applications for complex process chemistry in gas oil hydroprocessing such as thermal and catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, hydrocraking, hydroheating and hydroprocessing.
