The roughness factor of barrier-type anodic oxide layer with low electrical conductivity was evaluated using electrochemical measurement in electrolyte with redox couple. To evaluate the surface roughness factor, the surface of barrier-type oxide layer was covered with thin layer of platinum by sputtering. From the limiting diffusion current method the surface roughness factor of barrier-type Al2O3 estimated to be 1.03. This factor is in good agreement with the results of the cross-sectional characteristics by using transmission electron microscope.The barrier-type anodic oxide layer on aluminum are used as a dielectric layer in aluminum electrolytic capacitors and the electrical properties of capacitor in relation to dielectric dimensions are generally expressed using the conventional equation, as given in In general, the surface roughness factor is evaluated using a limiting diffusion method, which was based upon the fact that the surface belongs to the electrically conducting materials. Therefore, for the surface of barrier-type Al For oxide layer as a working electrode a sheet of aluminum (99.99 The measurement for limiting diffusion current density was performed in 0.5  Taking the diffusion coefficient To investigate the cross-sectional morphology characteristics of both surface for barrier-type Al To validate this surface roughness factor, the calculated oxide layer thickness by EIS measured results in this research can be analyzed by using the simple equivalent circuits in The impedance characteristic of equivalent circuit model A in And with increasing frequency the Young impedance of model B converges to a capacitance The measured impedance spectra and fitted result of barrier oxide layer formed in ammonium adipate solution are shown in The surface roughness factor of barrier-type Al
