The decline in the production of single fired ceramic tiles has made it difficult to find a market for the poorer quality feldspars. Producers are thus faced with the problem of improving the quality of their products also with a view to increasing profit margins. In this context, the paper addresses the problems involved in enhancing the value of some raw materials currently sold to the less profitable markets or considered as waste material. Three different cases have been examined and the results of experimental studies have demonstrated the feasibility of applying basic mineral processing techniques such as magnetic separation, surface attrition and selective flotation for obtaining concentrates with high added value and as such more readily marketable. The processing flow sheets, usually a combination of the above techniques, become more complex and more expensive, the higher the quality desired of the final product.
