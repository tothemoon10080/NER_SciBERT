We report enhanced sensing properties of Pd-coated SnO2 nanorod (NR) arrays for detecting H2 gas in N2 and dissolved in transformer oil. The Pd nanoparticles were coated on randomly ordered vertical SnO2 NR arrays by the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) method, which utilizes an electron-beam evaporator and a DC magnetron sputtering system. The Pd-coated SnO2 NR arrays exhibited high response (104 at 1% H2) in N2. Pd-coated SnO2 NR arrays were immersed and in mineral oil that contains various concentrations of dissolved H2 and the electrical response was measured. We found that the Pd-coated SnO2 NR arrays showed superior response (R = ˜96), low detection limit (0.3 ppm), and fast response times (300 s). The Pd-coated SnO2 NR arrays had a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 3.69 × 10-3 °C−1 at various oil temperatures (20–80 °C), indicating good thermal stability at high temperatures. The sensing mechanism of the Pd-coated SnO2 NR arrays was also demonstrated by using changes in the Schottky barrier height at the Pd/SnO2 interface upon exposure to H2.Analyzing gases dissolved in insulating oil for monitoring failure of the internal components of power transformers is one of the most pressing issues in the electric power industry. Deterioration of mineral oil and insulating paper in a transformer occurs under abnormal conditions, making dielectric insulation impossible [ The severity of faults and type of failure can be determined by measuring the concentration of dissolved gases [ Here, we report the H  Five-nanometer Pd films were sputtered on the vertically ordered SnO The morphologies of the Pd-coated SnO I–V measurements of the Pd-coated SnO The Pd-coated SnO It is well known that the GLAD creates an oblique deposition geometry by tilting the substrate to a glancing angle [  The H The Ostwald coefficient is a concept derived from Henry's law, which states that the concentration of dissolved gas in liquid is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas phase [ The real-time response of the Pd-coated SnO  The sensing mechanism of the Pd-coated SnO When exposed to H The sensing mechanism can be explained in detail by the change in Schottky barrier height at the Pd/SnO We achieved enhanced H This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), and it was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (NFR-2017M3A9F1052297) and the Medium and Large Complex Technology Commercialization Project through the Commercializations Promotion Agency for R&D Outcomes funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT.
