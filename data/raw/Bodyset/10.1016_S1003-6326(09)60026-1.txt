The bioleaching of low-grade copper sulfide ore and the selective extraction of copper were investigated. Lix984 dissolved in kerosene was used as extractant. The results show that it is possible to selectively leach copper from the ores by heap leaching. The copper concentration of leaching liquor after 250 d is 2.17 g/L, and the copper concentration is 0.27 g/L after solvent extraction. The leach liquor was subjected to solvent extraction, scrubbing and selective stripping for the enrichment of copper and the removal of impurities. The pregnant copper sulfate solution produced from the stripping cycle is suitable for copper electro-winning.
