A study about how the process parameters for three different AM techniques influence the final mechanical properties of the parts was carried out in order to evaluate if customised toys can be created and manufactured with safety guarantees. Some process conditions will improve the mechanical properties of the manufactured parts, however, the design and the employed materials will have capital influence in final safety results of the toys.
