The experiments were conducted on the changes of sintering performance of one kind of ultra fine-sized iron concentrate with or without being processed by high pressure roll grinding (HPRG). The experimental results indicate that the specific surface area increases from 1723. 0 to 2201. 6 cm2/g when the iron concentrate is processed by HPRG. The permeability of sintering mix increases and the iron concentrate becomes easy to react with CaO reagent at high temperature. The effect gets intensified when iron concentrate and lime are processed together by HPRG. The further studies indicate that compared with the base case, the sinter quality also gets improved, in which the yield of sinter increases from 67.24% to 69. 52% and further to 71. 68%, the tumble index (TD increases from 60. 38% to 62. 13% and further to 64. 45%, and the productivity increases from 1. 42 to 1. 57 t/(m2 · h) and further to 1. 62 t/(m2 · h) when the iron concentrate is processed by HPRG or is processed with lime together. The metallurgical properties of sinter also get improved when the iron concentrate is pretreated by high pressure roll. The results indicate that it is conducive to the increase of sinter quality and productivity when the iron concentrates are processed by HPRG.
