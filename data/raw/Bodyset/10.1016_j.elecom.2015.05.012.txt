The hydrogen reaction in concentrated HCl(aq) solutions is a key reaction for the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolytic cell. Here, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were used to obtain new data for the hydrogen reaction on platinum submerged in highly concentrated acidic solutions at 25°C and 0.1MPa. LSV and EIS data were collected for Pt in 0.5mol/L H2SO4(aq), 1mol/L HCl(aq) and 7.71mol/L HCl(aq) solutions. It was found that exchange current density (j0
                     ) values varied between 1 and 2mA/cm2. An equivalent circuit model was used to obtain comparable j0
                      and limiting current density values from EIS data relative to values obtained with LSV data. It was found that as the concentration of acid increased, a noticeable decrease in the performance was observed.One of the most important electrochemical reactions for the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolytic cell is the hydrogen reaction, 2H Recent studies have focused on reducing the amount of platinum used in the CuCl(aq)/HCl(aq) electrolytic cell design In moderately acidic solutions, previous research on the hydrogen reaction found that different mass transport limitations and active species concentrations can significantly impact the expected reaction rates The rotating disc electrode (RDE) provides an equally accessible surface that is useful for predicting the Nernst diffusion layer and its effects on electrochemical reactions. The so called generalized Butler–Volmer A Pine Research Instrumentation RDE assembly with Polytetrafluoroethylene fittings was used to study the hydrogen reaction in 3 cases of acidic solutions, with Case 1, 2 and 3 being defined as 0.5 The LSV data obtained via RDE for Case 1, 0.5 Multiple sweeps were fit for Cases 1, 2 and 3 to obtain average fitting values for The differences between Case 1 and 2 are negligible in the HOR direction but some differences can be seen in the cathodic direction for all three cases. Overall, significantly increasing the presence of ions appeared to negatively impact An equivalent circuit with three parallel paths was used to check for agreement with the conclusions from LSV data using EIS data collected. One path used a Warburg impedance to model the impedance of a reaction limited by the diffusion of H Extracted It is important to note that these results are not implying that what was found here is the “true” New The authors declare no competing financial interests.
