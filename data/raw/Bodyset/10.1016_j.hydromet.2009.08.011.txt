The solubility of malachite in the presence of ammonia, ammonium chloride and their mixed solution is calculated by a geochemical modeling code and is measured in a series of dissolution experiments using synthetic malachite at 25 °C. The simulated results show a good agreement with the experimental data gained at 25 °C. The predicted and experimental results indicate that the precipitate CuO limits the copper solubility in aqueous ammonia and Cu(OH)1.5Cl0.5 in aqueous ammonium chloride. For a mixed solution containing ammonia and ammonium chloride, highest copper solubility can be achieved by adjusting the [NH3]/[NH4Cl] ratio to about 2:1. The thermodynamic model presented rationalises the interactions between the different components and predicts the influence of changes in the concentration of ammonia and ammonium chloride on the copper solubility of malachite.Copper oxide minerals such as tenorite (CuO) and those containing silicate (chrysocolla, (Cu,Al) Ammonia, together with ammonium salts have been tried on a commercial scale for many years. The ammonia leaching process was first used to recover copper from copper carbonate and native copper tailings at the Kennecott plant, Alaska in 1915 ( For high copper extraction and fast leaching kinetics without fine grinding, Arbiter developed an ammoniacal pressure leaching process at elevated temperatures to treat copper oxide and sulphide ores, followed by SX/EW ( Malachite is the most common mineral in copper oxide ores and a considerable amount of research focuses on the leaching kinetics of malachite in ammonia/ammonium salt solutions such as (NH In previous work on the treatment of copper oxide minerals by ammonia leaching ( The knowledge of copper solubility under these conditions is very important for developing a suitable hydrometallurgical process. An understanding the soluble and solid phases in solution during the leaching of copper oxide minerals, can give important insights into the chemical processes and the interactions between the liquid and solid phases. The modeling of these interactions using geochemical speciation codes is the basis for the chemical understanding of these processes and the factors influencing them. In addition, adequate thermodynamic models allow easy and fast parameter variations and make it possible to predict the response of the system to changes that may result from the dissolution of minerals. The aim of the present study is to use geochemical speciation codes to predict the solubility of malachite and to understand the behavior of the system in the presence of ammonia, ammonium chloride and their mixed solution. The copper solubility of malachite (Cu The reactants were stored in sealed glass-bottles, shaken at 25 The Gibbs free energy minimization program GEMS-PSI (version 2.3.0 rc8) ( Activity coefficients of aqueous species Thermodynamic data for aqueous species, as well as for many solids, were taken from the GEMS-PSI thermodynamic data base ( To estimate the dissolution behavior of malachite, the concentrations of total dissolved copper species, [Cu] It is generally difficult to measure the amount of water in equilibrium. Therefore, the concentration scale of aqueous phase calculated was converted from molality (mol per kg H Prior to the experiments for investigating the effect of NH  To understand the roles of the different copper species, the copper species distribution at equilibrium with malachite as a function of ammonia concentration is shown in The dissolution of malachite in ammonia solution is expressed by Eq. As the ammonia concentration increases, the formation of stable copper ammonia complex increases the solubility of copper ions, but the subsequent release of hydroxide ions results in the formation of secondary solid phase, Cu(OH)   Thus, according to Eq.  Early work by The results of calculated and experimental copper solubility for malachite in ammonia/ammonium chloride solutions are shown in In To provide a more quantitative estimate of the trends of copper solubility, a three-dimensional solubility surface and contour diagrams for dissolved Cu(II) are shown in  A geochemical modeling code was applied to calculate the copper solubility for malachite and the development of soluble and solid species in the presence of 0–3 m ammonia, 0–3 m ammonium chloride and their mixed solution. According to the modeling and experimental studies, higher rates of copper recovery from ammonia leaching of malachite can be achieved by selecting optimum operation conditions where the formation of solids CuO(s) and Cu(OH) The predicted data compare well with the measured copper solubility as well as XRD data on the solid phases. In aqueous ammonia, the copper solubility is determined by the solubility of CuO(s) but in aqueous ammonium chloride, the formation of Cu(OH) A quantitative estimate of copper solubility in 0 to 3 m NH The financial support of
