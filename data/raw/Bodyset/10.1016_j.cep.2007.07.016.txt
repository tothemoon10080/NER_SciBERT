This work presents simulation results for the behavior of different particles in a new magnetic-classifier (MAGCLA™) which is capable to separate and classify particles according to their magnetic susceptibilities. The influence of the angle of the trunk, α, and the speed of rotation, ω, in the outcome results is studied by comparison with the results previously reported for a blank simulation.Magnetic separation is nowadays applied to several areas of science and technology (e.g. minerals processing In a previous work The supporting theory and the apparatus working principles were described in previous papers The angle of the trunk, To measure the differences between the real and the theoretical behavior of the particles, two coefficients – As detailed in our previous work The variables considered in this study are: the angle between the body of the separator–classifier and the horizontal, As previously For each processing variable under study we only present here the final comparative results obtained for the range of values considered for the processing variable in question. The detailed partial results may be found in For a better comparison of the results of the simulations we have always considered a typical separation process, the blank simulation. A detailed characterization of this simulation may be found in The main characteristics of the particles, magnetic and non-magnetic, considered in this study were those of typical particles that can be found in these processes, and the values of the parameters considered during all this work (including the limiting conditions and the minimum value required for the rotational friction factor) are detailed in The results were divided according to the type of particles–non-magnetic and magnetic particles, and these latter ones were also divided into two types: movement of the particles upon the surface of the body of the separator–classifier and movement of the particles in flight towards the central collector. The values in percentage refer to the degree of purity of the wolframite particles separated, considering the values of the processing variables in question. This percentage was computed considering that the magnetic susceptibility of pure wolframite particles (100% of purity) is 12 For this variable we have simulated the cases of In In In Concerning the separation and classification goals previously defined, the results obtained for the different cases under study are summarized in The values obtained for the exit time of the non-magnetic particles by the top of the separator–classifier, and for the arrival time of the magnetic particles at the central collector are very low (see As seen in Comparing the trajectories followed by the non-magnetic particles in the blank-case ( The increase on the initial feeding height created by the increase on the inclination of the surface of the body of the separator–classifier, causes an increase in the lift-off radii of the magnetic particles – It should also be noticed that for the higher simulated angle (60°) the magnetic boundary conditions are almost universal, meaning, the limiting-condition (A16) (see For the speed of rotation of the trunk we have simulated the cases of: In In  Concerning the separation and classification goals previously defined, the results obtained for the different cases under study are presented in As in Section Observing It should also be noticed that the required value for the friction coefficient in the rotational direction Comparing the trajectories of non-magnetic particles for 6 The value of the lift-off radius of the magnetic particles From the comparative graphic ( In this article we report the results obtained for two of the processing variables (angle of the trunk, Regarding the influence of the angle of the trunk, the higher the angle, the lowest will be the limiting-values of the spectrum of the magnetic susceptibilities of the particles classified, and the lowest will be the value of the magnetic susceptibility of the last magnetic particle separated; increasing the value of the angle too much, the separation between the magnetic and non-magnetic particles ceases. the higher the speed rotation, the highest will be the limiting-values of the spectrum of the magnetic susceptibilities of the particles classified; the height of arrival is practically independent of unit variations of the speed of rotation of the trunk; decreasing the speed of rotation too much, the separation between the magnetic and non-magnetic particles ceases.
