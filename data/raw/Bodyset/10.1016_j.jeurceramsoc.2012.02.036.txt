The search for suitable additives for boron suboxide (B6O) materials which could improve densification, reduce sintering temperature and tailor the microstructure has been productive. B6O materials doped with 0–5vol% cobalt addition were sintered at temperatures up to 1850°C and pressure of 50MPa for 20min. Relationships between the formed phases, microstructures and mechanical properties of the sintered materials were investigated as a function of sintering conditions and added cobalt content. The hardness of the sintered B6O materials increases with sintering temperature, while the fracture toughness increases with increasing cobalt content and reduces with increasing sintering temperature.B In addition, it is very difficult to sinter B Efforts have been made to enhance the mechanical properties of B Recently it was shown that B The present authors have reported previously on the chemical interaction between B In addition, the results revealed that the liquid boride infiltrates the dense B In this paper, the densification behaviour of B The starting B Cobalt additives were precipitated on the B Pure B After sintering the materials were ground to clean their surface from reaction products with the hBN lining.
