The electrochemical reduction processes were studied on glassy carbon electrode in molten LiCl-KCl eutectic at 450 Â°C. There is a consecutive two-step electrochemical process taking place to form metallic indium from the cathodic discharge of indium ions. The process is regarded as: In3+ + 2e- = In+ and In+ + e- = In. The diffusion coefficient of In3+ ion was determined by chronoamperometry. Mass transport towards the electrode is a simple diffusion process. Metallic indium is deposited on the glassy carbon electrode, which occurs at a potential of around -0.85 V vs. the Ag+/ Ag reference electrode. InCl2 forms InCl and InCl3 disproportionately. After a certain time, the CV curves for InCl2 and InCl were essentially the same as the one obtained from the reduction of InCl3.
