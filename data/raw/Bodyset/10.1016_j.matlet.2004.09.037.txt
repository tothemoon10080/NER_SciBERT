Flower-like SrCO3 nanostructures, consisting of SrCO3 nanorods with about several hundred micrometres in length and several hundred nanometers in width, have been synthesized by a convenient hydrothermal process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals that the flower-like SrCO3 nanostructures are of orthorhombic phase. Furthermore, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) illustrate that the SrCO3 nanorods are single crystalline in nature. Finally, the formation mechanism of the SrCO3 nanostructures has been preliminary presented.In recent years, the fabrication and characterization of nanostructures have attracted great interests due to their significant potential applications In the typical hydrothermal synthesis, 0.001 mol Sr(NO The ultimate products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max-ga X-ray diffractometer with graphite monochromatized CuKÎ± radiation (  The morphology of the products characterized by FESEM is shown in Based on the above results, in the following, the formation mechanism of SrCO Because the solubility of SrCO In summary, the convenient hydrothermal process has been successfully used to synthesize the flower-like SrCO The authors would like to appreciate the financial supports of the Natural Science Foundation of China (60225010) and the Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education. We also thank Professor Youwen Wang for the TEM and FESEM measurements.
