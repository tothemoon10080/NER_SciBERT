The kinetics of the dissolution of titanium and iron from an ilmenite sample has been studied in moderately strong sulfuric acid solutions in the absence and presence of reducing agents such as titanium(III) ions and sulfur dioxide. The effects of particle size, temperature, solid/liquid ratio, sulfuric acid concentration and titanium(III) concentration on the kinetics of dissolution have been investigated. The results have shown that both particle size and acid concentration have relatively minor effects on the rate of dissolution of titanium while temperature has a significant effect under the studied conditions.
                  The batch leach kinetics of ilmenite in acid solutions appears to fit a shrinking particle model, while in the presence of a decreasing titanium(III) concentration, the rate of dissolution of titanium can be fitted to a shrinking core model. Mathematical expressions for the batch leaching of the ilmenite have been established. The results suggest that the rate of dissolution of ilmenite in acid solutions is controlled by a slow chemical reaction on the surface of the mineral, while in the presence of a reducing agent such as titanous ions, the dissolution rate of ilmenite is significantly enhanced. The use of SO2 as a reductant increases the dissolution of titanium only in the presence of ferrous ions. The role of Ti(III) ions and SO2 during leaching is assumed to involve reduction of the iron(III) component in the mineral by a redox reaction on the surface.Ilmenite (FeTiO In the Chloride Process, a feedstock of high TiO Despite the industrial importance of the Sulfate Process for ilmenite dissolution for producing pigment TiO When the sulfuric acid concentration is less than 14 The rate of dissolution of ilmenite was found to be controlled by a chemical reaction at the ilmenite surface ( The present study is part of a more extensive investigation into the kinetics of the dissolution of ilmenite in sulfuric acid solutions in the range of 400 to 600 Powdered samples of ilmenite sand were provided by a local producer and used as received. The samples were also mineralogically and chemically analysed at the former BHP Billiton Technology Centre, Newcastle, NSW. The chemical assays of various size fractions are shown in Titanium(III) solutions were prepared by dissolving metallic titanium powder of 99.7% purity (−100 mesh from Aldrich, USA) in hot sulfuric acid solutions and making up the solutions to 450 Batch leach tests were conducted in a 500 Prior to each test, nitrogen gas was used to flush the reactor in order to expel oxygen and then 200 The rate of dissolution was monitored by taking aqueous samples of 2 In experiments at controlled potential, a Metrom Dosimat 665 was utilized to inject a sulfuric acid solution of 450 The titanium concentration in the aqueous samples was analysed using spectrophotometry of the titanium(IV)-H Total iron in solution was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry. Titanium(III) concentrations were measured by titration against a 0.009 It is well established that acid concentration has a great effect on the dissolution rate of ilmenite. Experimental results reported by The effect of temperature on the rate of ilmenite dissolution was studied in the range of 85–100 It can be seen that even at 100 Several experiments were carried out using sulfuric acid concentrations varying from 450 to 600 The effect of particle size on the rate of dissolution was examined with various size fractions under otherwise standard conditions. The results, given in As outlined in the It can be seen that the dissolution rate of titanium in the presence of SO The “standard” reductive leach conditions chosen for the study were 450 The significant effect of the addition of titanium(III) ions on the rate of dissolution of both titanium and iron in a 600 The effect of solution potential on the dissolution rate of ilmenite was investigated by conducting several experiments in which the Ti(IV)/Ti(III) ratio was initially adjusted to a set potential in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 It is apparent that even under relatively mild reducing conditions at a potential of 0.4 Several experiments were performed under standard reducing conditions in which the amount of ilmenite was varied to give S/L ratios (gram mineral/mL solution) of 1/200, 1/100, and 1/20. From the results shown in The effect of the particle size of the ilmenite on the rate of leaching under reducing conditions is shown by the data for the dissolution of titanium in   The experimental results obtained in this study were examined utilizing the well known models for the dissolution of sized particles such as the shrinking particle and the shrinking core models under the assumption that the particles are homogeneous and spherical ( Note that, in the case of the shrinking particle model, As could be expected from a dissolution reaction that produces only soluble products, it was found that all of the experimental data obtained with acid alone can be fitted to the expression for the shrinking particle model.  The values of The A combination of the shrinking particle rate expression, and the effects of particle size, acid concentration and temperature on the apparent rate constant, gives an overall expression for the extent of dissolution of titanium in acid with time of the form: It should be emphasized that the above derived rate equation is only really applicable to the rate of dissolution of titanium in solutions containing only sulfuric acid within the ranges of particle size, acid concentration and temperature used in this investigation. The experimental results obtained in the presence of titanium(III) were also analysed utilizing the above two kinetic models for the reaction of spherical particles. In this case, it was not possible to maintain a constant Ti(III) concentration during an experimental run and the concentration decreased with time due to both oxidation by the iron(III) in the ilmenite and also to some extent by dissolved oxygen. A comparison of the data for dissolution of titanium as fitted to these two models is shown in It is apparent from One possible reason for this result is that the concentration of titanium(III) in the leaching solution decreases and thus the potential increases during the course of any one experiment, resulting in a decreasing slope with extent of reaction in the plots of the shrinking particle model. Thus, one cannot expect the data to fit the expected shrinking particle model unless correction could be made for the varying titanium(III) concentration. Another possible reason is the formation of a “purple-black” mixed oxidation state Ti(IV)–Ti(III) sulfate complex in sulfuric acid solutions ( In many dissolution processes, however, the fact that a particular model best fits the data does not necessarily imply that the rate-determining step is appropriate. In this case, although the model used is based on rate determining mass transport through a product layer on the surface of the mineral, the high value of apparent activation energy calculated below for the reaction indicates that mass transport is unlikely to be rate-determining. Hence, we will simply use the shrinking core model as a mathematical method of deriving an apparent rate constant (  Similarly, the values of A comparison of the calculated values for Most natural ilmenites contain some iron(III) in the lattice and, as outlined in On the basis of this, it is not unreasonable to suggest that dissolution of ilmenite in the presence of titanium(III) ions occurs as a result of this reaction coupled to that for the oxidation of titanium(III) ( This electrochemical step is then followed by 1) The kinetics of dissolution of ilmenite have been investigated at relatively low temperatures in the presence and absence of Ti(III). In solutions containing only sulfuric acid, the effects of particle size (25 to 90 2) The dissolution of ilmenite in moderately strong sulfuric acid solutions in the presence of titanium(III) ions significantly accelerates the leaching of ilmenite by reducing the iron(III) component of the mineral lattice. Again, the kinetic data obtained for the dissolution of titanium and iron in the presence of titanium(III) ions have been analysed in terms of the effects of temperature, S/L ratio, particle size and sulfuric acid concentration. A suitable mathematical expression for the leaching of ilmenite in the presence of titanium(III) ions has been found to be that used to describe the shrinking core model. The apparent activation energy was found to be 90 kJ mol 3) Use of SO The authors thank
