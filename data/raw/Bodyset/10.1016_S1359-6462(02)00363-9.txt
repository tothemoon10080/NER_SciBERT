Effect of Nb additions on the stability of the D022 structure of the Ni3V phase has been investigated using X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Such additions are found to stabilize the D0a phase. The result is explained on the basis of existing qualitative models.Many phases with A Interesting observations pertaining to the alteration of the D0 The Î³ On the basis of electron diffraction studies on Ni In view of the results reported by Moreen et al. X-ray diffraction studies on the aged samples revealed characteristic peaks of the D0  TEM studies on the aged alloy confirmed the simultaneous presence of the D0 A high density of planar faults was observed in the D0 The D0 X-ray diffraction and EDXS studies ( Different empirical rules are available in the literature, which can be used to examine the effect of the above factors on an individual structure. Sinha Although electron concentration is a major factor controlling the structure of a phase, the relative size of the constituent atoms also appeared to have played an important role in stabilizing the orthorhombic D0 Ternary Nb additions to the stoichiometric Ni Authors are grateful to Dr. S. Banerjee, Director, Materials Group and Dr. P.K. De, Head, Materials Science Division for their keen interest in this study. The authors also wish to acknowledge Mrs. P.S. Agashe for her help in preparing this manuscript.
