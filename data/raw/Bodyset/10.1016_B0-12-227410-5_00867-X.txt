    At the seam level, a large portion of mineral matter in coal arises from the inclusion during mining of roof or floor rock. At the ply and lithotype level, the mineral matter may occur as deposits in cracks and cleats or as veins. At the macerals level, the mineral matter may be present in the form of very finely disseminated discrete mineral matter particles. At the submicroscopic level, the mineral matter may be present as strongly, chemically bonded elements.        Reduction of the top size of ROM coal to make it suitable for the treatment process liberation of coal from middlings, and size reduction of clean coal to meet market specification.               air-swept ball mills, roll or ball-and-race type mills, air-swept hammer mills, and wet overflow ball mills.  Scalping off large run-of-mine coal for initial size reduction Sizing of raw coal for cleaning in different processes Removal of magnetic (dense medium) from clean coal and refuse Dewatering Separation of product coal into commercial sizes   Percentage open area Particle shape Angle of approach Screen deck area Bed motion Size distribution of feed.    Fixed screens and grizzlies (for coarse coal). Fixed sieves (for fine coal). These are used for dewatering and/or size separation of slurried coal or rejects. The sieve bend is the most commonly used in coal preparation plants for this application ( Shaking screens. These are normally operated by camshafts with eccentric bearings. They can be mounted horizontally or inclined, and operate at low speeds with fairly long strokes (speeds up to 300 Vibrating screens. These are the most commonly used screens in coal preparation and are to be found in virtually all aspects of operations. A summary of their application is shown in Resonance screens. These have been designed to save energy consumption. The screen deck is mounted on flexible hanger strips and attached to a balance frame, which is three or four times heavier than the screen itself. Electromechanical screens. This type of screen operates with a high-frequency motion of very small throw. The motion is usually caused by a moving magnet which strikes a stop.                                              Friction or adhesion between deck and particle Pressure of the moving water Differential acceleration due to the table action.

The plant cleans coarse coal by gravity methods. The gangue content in coal is reduced in the form of coarse reject from the Bradford breaker and high-gravity rejects. The yield of saleable product is 75–85%. The plant cleans coarse and intermediate size coal, leaving the fines untreated. These modern coal preparation plants clean the full size-range of raw coal. The plant produces different saleable products that vary in quality, including deep-cleaned coal that is low in sulfur and ash. The plant incorporates fine grinding to achieve a high degree of liberation, using froth flotation (oil agglomeration) and water-only cyclones (or spirals).          Microwave attenuation/phase shift: Involves transmitting a microwave beam through a given layer of coal (conveyor belt). The maximum absorption of the energy occurs at 20 Capacitance measurements: Based on the principle that electrical conductivity of coal increases with the quantity of moisture. However, it is only applicable for the measurement of surface moisture. Nuclear magnetic resonance: This method measures the hydrogen in the coal, and is able to distinguish between hydrogen in water and in hydrocarbons. Neutron moisture gauges: Neutron transmission and scatter methods can be used to measure total hydrogen content, and assumes a constant hydrocarbon hydrogen.                                   Fluids used in dense-medium separation of coal and gangue particles by their relative densities. The medium can be any suitable fluid, but in commercial coal preparation operations, it is usually a suspension of fine magnetite in water. Separation methods based on differences in density of separated minerals, such as dense-medium separation and jigging. Tests carried out to determine coal washability, by which the coal is separated into various density fractions. Description of the behavior of coal particles in froth flotation. Measure of the ease by which the size of a coal can be reduced. Values decrease with increasing resistance to grinding. Coal used in the manufacture of coke for the steel industry. Percentage of material in the feed within ±0.1 density range from the separation density. Measure of separating efficiency, calculated as Measure of separating efficiency of a separator (jig, cyclone, etc.). Calculated from a Tromp curve. Particle size distribution developed by Rossin and Rammler and found by Bennett to be useful in describing the particle size distribution of run-of-mine coal. Density of particles reporting equally to floating and sinking fractions (heavy media overflow and underflow in the dense media cyclone). The δ Actual density of the dense medium. Coals used as a fuel, mainly for power generation. These are lower-rank coals (high volatile bituminous, subbituminous, and liginites). Most widely used method of determining graphically the value of Graphical presentation of the float-sink test results. Two types of plots are in use: Henry–Reinhard washability curves and M-curves. Term denoting the most important coal preparation unit operation in which coal particles are separated from inorganic gangue in the processes based on differences in density (gravity methods) or surface properties (flotation). Cleaning then increases the heating value of raw coal.
