Potentiostatic depositions of zinc oxide (ZnO) on titania (TiO2) nanotube substrate have been observed to demonstrate remarkable enhancement in the supercapacitance behavior as reported in this study. Systematic evaluation of the morphology and crystal structure of the electrodeposited ZnO phase was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments indicated that the electrode can attain a maximum specific capacitance of 304Fg−1 that was partly attributed to the electro-active ZnO phase and partly to the highly permeable, porous, and unidirectional nanotubular TiO2 substrate.Nanotubular morphology of TiO This study has been conducted to evaluate the supercapacitance behavior of T-NT/ZnO composite electrode. The composite electrodes were synthesized using a simple, easy to implement electrodeposition technique. The fabricated T-NT/ZnO electrode indeed showed promising supercapacitance properties due to the favorable combinations of an electro-active oxide phase and porous supporting nanotubular substrate.     Anodization of Ti produced self-organized and vertically aligned nanotube array (T-NT) as shown in Potentiostatic deposition of ZnO on T-NT substrate resulted in the formation of irregular shaped morphology of the oxide phase after various deposition times. The XRD analysis conducted on the T-NT/ZnO electrode prepared for The cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles, recoded at 200 Further, CV experiments were performed at different scan rates for the electrode prepared for  The synthesis of composite electrodes comprising of zinc oxide (ZnO) and titania nanotubes (T-NT) using a simple electrodeposition process has been carried out. SEM and XRD analysis on the composite electrodes suggested evolution of various morphologies (random, hexagonal rounded and rod shaped) and crystalline phases of the ZnO deposit. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge tests conducted on the electrodes suggested that a high capacitance value (~300 The authors acknowledge Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
