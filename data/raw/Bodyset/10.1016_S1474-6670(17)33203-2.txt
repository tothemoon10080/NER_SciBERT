The modelling of the dynamics of an industrial evaporator system using an artificial neural network (ANN) is presented. Use of time series analysis and multivariable regression techniques for pre-processing the plant data of the evaporator system prior to the identification is also described. The ANN model identification was performed by first specifying and training a large fully connected feedforward network. Network pruning was then applied to remove superfluous weights. The result shows that the identified ANN model provided excellent prediction to the output of the evaporator system, i.e. the product liquor density. An intelligent geometric nonlinear control system is also presented and discussed for the evaporator system.
