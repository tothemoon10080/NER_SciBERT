The transport of Zn(II) ions through a combined supported liquid membrane/strip dispersion system was studied as a function of membrane area, fluxes, membrane composition, and pH in the feed phase. The experiments demonstrate that the transport of Zn(II) ions is coupled by the counter-flow of H+, and zinc(II) ions can be quickly separated from Cu(II) ions by the new form of a liquid membrane. The experiments verify that the new type of liquid membrane exhibits great feasibility in hydrometallurgy and the treatment of wastewater. The experiments show that the uptake of carriers out of the membrane phase into the feed phase increases with an increase of pH value in the feed phase.
