The adsorption of CN on sphalerite (110) surface and the effects of lattice impurities on the surface adsorption have been investigated using density-functional theory (DFT). The results show that CN adsorbs strongly on perfect sphalerite (110) surface, where C atom and N atom of CN molecule are bonding with two Zn atoms on the surface. The presence of Fe/Mn/Cu-impurity on sphalerite surface was shown to enhance the CN adsorption, however; Cd impurity worked in the opposite. The adsorption mode of CN on defective surfaces is mainly via C atom interacting with the impurity atom, and s orbital of C interacts with sp orbital of Fe/Mn/Cu to form the covalent bond, and d orbital of Fe/Mn/Cu donates electrons to the anti-bonding p orbital of C to form the back donating π bonding. While on the Cd-bearing surface, Cd 4d orbital donates fewer electrons to the vacant

The simulations of CN adsorption show that Fe-bearing sphalerite could be easily depressed by cyanide, while Cd-bearing sphalerite is difficult to be depressed by cyanide.As the primary source of Zn metal, sphalerite (ZnS) commonly occurs in association with pyrite, galena, chalcopyrite and other sulphides. The flotation technology of zinc sulphides is thus largely concerned with the problems of separating them from copper sulphides, iron sulphides and galena ( It is generally found in the practice that sphalerite from different deposits or different sites of the same deposit can differ in flotation behavior essentially due to the distinction of lattice impurities in the sphalerite crystal. Sphalerite almost always contains variable amounts of Fe, Mn, Cu, and Cd replacing Zn on lattice site. It has been reported that these lattice impurities could markedly affect the chemical and semiconducting properties of the sphalerite surface, and hence influence the subsequent flotation behavior of the mineral ( In order to further investigate the mechanism of adsorption of CN on sphalerite surface and to ascertain the influence of lattice impurities on the CN adsorption, we used computer simulation techniques to model the sphalerite (1 Calculations have been done using Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) developed by Zinc sulphide is naturally observed in two polymorphs, zincblende and wurtzite, with cubic and hexagonal lattice structures, respectively ( The construction of sphalerite (1 The calculated bond length of the free CN is 1.190 The adsorption energy can be expressed by the following: The calculated structural parameters of perfect sphalerite (1 Six adsorption modes were considered to simulate the CN adsorption on the perfect sphalerite surface including C-down and N-down on top, bridge and hollow site, where C-down and N-down denote a CN perpendicular to the surface via C and N, respectively.
