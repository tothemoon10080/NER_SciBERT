Experimental work has been carried out to investigate the effect of major operating variables on milling efficiency of calcium carbonate in laboratory and pilot size Tower and Sala Agitated (SAM) mills. The results suggest that the stirrer speed, media size and slurry density affect the specific energy consumption required to achieve the given product size. Media stress intensity analysis developed for high-speed horizontal mills was modified to include the effect of gravitational force in the vertical stirred mills such as the Tower and SAM units. The results suggest that this approach can be successfully applied for both mill types. For a given specific energy input, an optimum stress intensity range existed, for which the finest product was achieved. Finer product and therefore higher milling efficiency was obtained with SAM in the range of operating conditions tested.
