In this work, the removal of uranium and thorium ions from aqueous solutions was studied by solid–liquid extraction using an advantageous extractant-impregnated resin (EIR) prepared by loading carminic acid (CA) onto Amberlite XAD-16 resin beads. Batch sorption experiments using CA/XAD-16 beads for the removal of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions were carried out as a function of several parameters, like equilibration time, metal ion concentration, etc. The equilibrium data obtained from the sorption experiments were adjusted to the Langmuir isotherm model and the calculated maximum sorption capacities in terms of monolayer sorption were in agreement with those obtained from the experiments. The experimental data on the sorption behavior of both metal ions onto the EIR beads fitted well in both Bangham and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models, indicating that the intra-particle diffusion is the rate-controlling step. The thermodynamic studies at different temperatures revealed the feasibility and the spontaneous nature of the sorption process for both uranium and thorium ions.Bangham constant Average relative error (%) Tempkin constant related to the heat of sorption Langmuir constant related to the free energy of sorption (L Equilibrium concentration of the metal ion in the bulk solution (mg Intra-particle diffusion coefficient (m Mean sorption energy estimated from Dubinin–Radushkevich (J Bangham constant (mL Pseudo-first order rate constant (min Pseudo-second order rate constant (g Distribution coefficient (mL Freundlich constant indicative of the relative sorption capacity of the EIR (mg Intra-particle diffusion constant (mg Equilibrium binding constant, Tempkin constant (L Intercept in the intraparticle diffusion model (mg EIR dose, weight of EIR per liter of solution (g Number of measurements Freundlich constant indicative of the heterogeneity factor Maximum sorption capacity based on Dubinin-Radushkevich model (mol Amount of metal ion sorbed per unit weight of EIR at equilibrium (mg Theoretical q Exp experimental qe values (mg Maximum sorption capacity; Langmuir constant (mg Maximum experimental sorption capacity (mg Amount of metal ion sorbed at any time t (mg.g Universal gas constant (J Correlation coefficient Mean radius of the EIR particles (m) Removal efficiency (%) Dimensionless separation factor Root mean square error Temperature (K) Time (min) Time for half sorption of metal ion onto the EIR particles (min) Solution volume (L or mL) Weight of EIR (mg) Gibb's free energy change (J Enthalpy change (J Entropy change (J Normalized standard deviation (%) Elovich constant indicative of the initial sorption rate (mg Elovich constant indicative of the desorption constant (g Dubinin–Radushkevich constant related to the sorption energy (mol Polanyi potential Due to the high toxicity of radioactive metals, especially uranium and thorium, exposure to these pollutants has been a quickly growing problem for human health and, hence, removal of these heavy metals from polluted waters and wastewaters is very necessary Today, there is a growing interest for potential applications of sorption technology in metal separations, hydrometallurgy, water and wastewater treatment, removal and recovery of metal ions, etc Of the many kinds of solid supports used as sorbent, there are several advantages of using chelating ion exchange supports, such as high sorption capacity, selectivity and reusability. As a result, due to these advantages, there is a great quest for studying new selective chelating ion exchange sorbents for interested metal ions. Macroporous polymeric supports, including XAD series resins, have been utilized extensively due to the properties of their matrix, such as chemical and mechanical stability and high surface area, which are attributed to the existence of large numbers of cross links in their structure In our earlier group works, we have reported the application of two antraquinon compounds for preparing high stable extractant-impregnated resins and studding their capability for sorption of some toxic metal ions, including uranium and thorium, from aqueous solutions All the chemicals used were of analytical grade from Fluka (Switzerland), except Amberlite XAD-16 resin (surface area 825 A PHS-3BW Model pH-meter (Bel Italy) with a combined glass–calomel electrode was employed for measuring pH values in the aqueous solutions. A Gallenkamp automatic shaker model BKS 305-010, UK, was used for the batch experiments. A Shimadzu model UV-1601PC spectrophotometer was used for all absorbance measurements with one pair of 10 Preparation and characterization of the carminic acid-impregnated XAD-16 has been described in the previous paper Adsorption experiments were carried out in 150 In the above equations For studding both the effect of contact time and the kinetic behavior of the sorption process, the sorption capacity of the CA/XAD-16 at different contact times was examined for different initial concentrations varying from 25 to 100 (i) Pseudo-second order model The pseudo-second order model assumes that the sorption process is a pseudo-chemical reaction process. In this model, the driving force is the difference between the equilibrium capacity of EIR and the amount of radionuclide sorbed at any time ( (ii) Pseudo-first-order Lagergren model The pseudo-first order Lagergren model assumes that the rate of radionuclide removal with time is directly proportional to the difference between the equilibrium capacity of EIR and the amount of radionuclide sorbed at any time ( (iii) Elovich model The Elovich model is useful when the reaction of radionuclide with the chelating group is the rate-controlling step. The model implies a multilayer adsorption and assumes that the sorption sites increase exponentially with sorption (iv) Intra-particle diffusion model The intra-particle diffusion model assumes that the effect of the diffusion of radionuclide is the rate-controlling step for the sorption process, the intra-particle diffusivity is constant and the direction of the diffusion is radial (v) Bangham model The Bangham model assumes that the diffusion of radionuclide into the pores of EIR beads is the rate-controlling step For the equilibrium studies, the radionuclide solutions with various initial concentrations (0–250 (i) Langmuir isotherm The Langmuir model assumes that a monolayer sorption occurs at energetically equivalent sites (ii) Freundlich isotherm The Freundlich isotherm is the earliest known relationship and assumes that the sorption process is non-ideal, reversible and multilayer (iii) Tempkin isotherm The Tempkin isotherm assumes that the heat of sorption of all the sorbates in the layer decreases linearly with coverage due to sorbent–sorbate interactions and, also, the sorption process is characterized by a uniform distribution of binding energies, up to some maximum binding energy (iv) Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm The Dubinin–Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model assumes that the characteristics of sorption curves relate to the porous structure of the sorbent The mean sorption energy ( The The effect of temperature on the sorption of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions was investigated by conducting both equilibrium and kinetic experiments at 288, 298, 308, and 318. Further, the distribution constant, Carminic acid-impregnated XAD-16 resin beads are very stable in both highly acidic and basic solutions. The earlier studies exhibited that this EIR can be considered as a good sorbent for both uranium and thorium in terms of high sorption capacity, selectivity, cost, rapid sorption, etc. In addition, CA/XAD-16 was found to be useful for separating uranium from thorium, using sequential eluting of the sorbed metal ions from the EIR support It is well known that the equilibrium time can be decreased by increasing the agitation speed. In order to optimize the agitation speed for maximum sorption rate, experiments were conducted in the range of 0–300 The amount of the EIR is an important variable for the sorption of metal ions because higher dose of EIR increase the availability of chelating sites for interacting with the metal ions, and influences the extent of removal. The longer contact time result in the more complete sorption process. The required contact time for the complete sorption is an important parameter which is dependent on the nature of sorbent and the sorption mechanism. The equilibrium studies are generally used for both the design of sorption process and understanding the sorption mechanism. A solute can be sorbed from aqueous media onto surface of a solid support by several mechanisms. The operative mechanism is depended on the nature of sorption sites, surface properties, affinities of the sorbent, the type of the sorbate and the bulk properties of the aqueous solution (like pH). In order to find the best fitting isotherm model, the sorption experiments were conducted at the optimum conditions. The initial concentration of radionuclide was in the range of 10 to 250 For the evaluation of the predictive ability of the above isotherm models, the root mean square error (RMSE) can be used: For the purpose of comparison, the linear plots of sorption isotherms of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions constructed from Eqs. There is a dimensionless constant called equilibrium parameter or separation factor, The Langmuir isotherm model is based on the several assumptions such as (i) the sorption energy is constant, (ii) the maximum sorption responds to saturated monolayer of metal ions on the EIR surface, (iii) there is no transmigration of radionuclides in the EIR surface, (iv) EIR surface is homogenous, (v) all sorption sites are equivalent and (vi) sorption in an active site is independent of whether the adjacent sites are occupied or not. Therefore, the suitability of Langmuir isotherm model for describing the sorption of both uranium and thorium ions onto EIR surface can be attributed to homogenous distribution of extractant molecules, or chelating ion exchange sites, on the polymeric surface The kinetic studies are of great importance for both gaining insight on the physical chemistry of the sorption processes and the design of sorption systems. In general, the sorption of uranium and thorium onto the EIR surface is known to proceed through the following steps: Transfer of radionuclide from bulk solution to EIR surface, which is usually mentioned as bulk diffusion. Diffusion of radionuclide across the external film surrounding the EIR bead (film diffusion). Migration of radionuclide into pores, which is usually mentioned as pore diffusion. Interaction of radionuclide with available chelating sites on the interior surface of pores. The rate limiting step is resulted from one of the above steps or combination of them. For gaining insight on the sorption kinetic, the datasets from Section The correlation coefficient ( The normalized standard deviation ( A visual examination of fitted plots showed that the Bangham and intra-particle models were better than the other studied models ( Since the effect of operating temperature is important in the studies of sorption of metal ions, thermodynamic studies were performed to study how different temperatures affect the sorption of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions onto EIR surface. It is well known that temperature has two major effects on the sorption process. Due to both decrease in the solution viscosity and increase in the metal ion mobility in the solution, increasing the temperature causes increase the rate of diffusion of the metal ions across the external boundary layer and in the internal pores of the EIR beads. In addition, increasing the temperature will change the equilibrium constant and sorption capacity of the EIR for both radionuclides. Experimental results concerning the effect of temperature on the sorption of metal ions at different concentrations can be observed from the equilibrium and kinetic studies. Depended on the concentration of metal ion, an increase in temperature results in a relative increase in both the sorption percentage and sorption speed, indicating that the sorption of metal ions is an endothermic process. More rapid sorption at higher temperatures can be attributed to acceleration of pore diffusion step which is the rate-controlling step for the sorption of both uranium and thorium on the CA/XAD-16. Also, greater sorption percentages at higher temperatures are due to the bigger equilibrium constants. Evaluation of thermodynamic parameters was used to assess the spontaneity of the sorption process. The thermodynamic parameters viz.; Gibbs free energy ( This work demonstrates that Carminic acid-impregnated XAD-16 resin beads have high sorption capacity for uranium and thorium, and can be successively used for the fast removal of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions from aqueous solutions. The sorption of U(VI) and Th(IV) ions onto CA/XAD-16 is influenced by several physicochemical parameters, such as initial concentration, temperature, contact time, sorbent dose and pH. The sorption process of both radionuclides occurs rapidly, and tends to complete lesser than 2 (i) The EIR showed very high sorption affinity to both metal ions. The equilibrium studies showed that the Langmuir isotherms were highly fitted to experimental data for both metal ions at all studied temperatures, reflecting that the sorption process for both metal ions occurs via a monolayer sorption mechanism. (ii) The kinetic studies showed that both Bangham and intra-particle diffusion models provided a good description of uranium and thorium sorption datasets when compared with the other models. (iii) The thermodynamic studies were conducted to calculate different thermodynamic parameters, such as The authors wish to take this opportunity to express their sincere thanks to Prof. Mohammad Mohammad-Zadeh, the research council president of Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, for his great helps and supports during the experimental works.
