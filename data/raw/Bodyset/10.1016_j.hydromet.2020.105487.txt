The consumption of lithium has been increasing rapidly due to its increasing application in lithium-ion batteries. The recovery of lithium from salt lake brines, which accounts for more than 70% of global lithium resources, has become increasingly studied; however, some challenges remain. In a previous study, a mixed ternary solvent extraction system consisting of TBP (tributyl phosphate), FeCl3 and P507 (2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester) was developed. This newly developed system demonstrated good selectivity of Li over Mg and efficient lithium stripping simply using water. In the current study, to demonstrate its practical effectiveness, the TBP/FeCl3/P507 system was tested with a real salt lake brine in both batch and multi-stage simulated counter-current modes. Detailed conditions for extraction, scrubbing and stripping were investigated. In the three-stage simulated counter-current extraction tests, the recovery of lithium reached 99.8%, and in the three-stage simulated counter-current stripping tests, the obtained loaded strip liquor contained (g·L−1): Li, 20.9; Mg, 2.2; and B, 1.6. During stripping, the Fe3+ remained fully in the organic phase, enabling the organic phase to be directly used in the next extraction without regeneration. The high lithium selectivity, lithium recovery and efficient lithium stripping with water of the above process promotes it as a cost-effective and sustainable method for recovering lithium from brines with high Mg/Li ratios.Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely used for electric vehicles and energy storage for renewable power due to their high energy density and light weight compared to other types of batteries ( Salt lake brines and pegmatites are two main sources for the production of Li Several methods have been developed for lithium recovery from salt lake brines with high Mg/Li ratios in China, including adsorption ( Li In recent years, many alternative anions, including [PF To solve the problems associated with acid stripping of the TBP/FeCl In this study, a novel TBP/FeCl FeCl FeCl The The procedures for the three-stage simulated counter-current test (SCT) are shown in The concentrations in the aqueous samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 5300 V, Pekin-Elmer, USA) after dilution to a proper concentration range. The H Previous studies have shown that the optimum range of the Fe/Li molar ratio is 1.3–1.7 for lithium extraction ( To obtain the maximum Fe Organic phases containing various TBP (vol%) concentrations and 30 vol% P507 pre-loaded with approximately 14 g·L The Li Organic phases containing various P507 (vol%) concentrations and 40 vol% TBP pre-loaded with approximately 14 g·L It was found that the extraction of Li H The extraction of Li To investigate the effect of the O/A ratio on lithium extraction, a pre-loaded Fe The effect of temperature on the lithium extraction from brine by a pre-loaded Fe The value of ∆H of the extraction system was derived to be −10.15 kJ/mol, suggesting the exothermic nature of the extraction reaction, which meant that a low temperature was preferential for the extraction of lithium. While considering the poor fluidity of the organic phase at low temperature and the difficulty in phase separation, the following experiments were conducted at room temperature (293 K). The effect of shaking time on the lithium extraction from brine was investigated using a pre-loaded Fe The pre-loaded Fe The effect of the O/A ratio on the stripping of lithium using water was investigated using the scrubbed organic phase obtained at an optimum scrubbing O/A ratio; the results are shown in A multi-stage continuous counter-current extraction process was conducted to efficiently extract lithium from brine. The number of extraction stages was determined by the McCabe-Thiele diagram, as shown in The loaded organic phase obtained by the three-stage counter-current extraction was scrubbed by water to remove impurities. According to the scrubbing experiment at different phase ratios, the number of scrubbing stages was determined by the McCabe-Thiele diagram, as shown in The scrubbed organic phase obtained by the three-stage counter-current scrubbing was subjected to a stripping step by water. According to the stripping experiment at different phase ratios, the number of stripping stages was determined by the McCabe-Thiele diagram, as shown in The operating cost (including the reagents, power consumption, personnel and transportation) of this novel mixed ternary system for lithium extraction from a treated East Tajinar Salt Lake brine was estimated. While it is assumed to produce 1000 t/year of industrial grade Li Lithium recovery from a treated East Tajinar Salt Lake brine by using a mixed ternary solvent extraction system of TBP/FeCl The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
