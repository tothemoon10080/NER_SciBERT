The hot deformation behavior of 2060 alloy has been studied using thermal simulation test, EBSD technique and transmission electron microscopy. The flow stress could be described by a Zener-Hollomon parameter in hyperbolic sine function with the hot deformation activation energy of 205 kJ/mol. Dynamic recovery is the main dynamic soften mechanism of 2060 alloy. The relative volume fraction of subgrains increases from about 30% to 90% as the temperature rises from 350 °C to 400 °C. When the temperature is higher than 400 °C, both the relative volume fraction of the deformed grains and subgrains remain steady. The processing maps are similar in the strain ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, and the unsafe domains increase with the increase of strain. The optimum hot-working condition for 2060 alloy is 380–500 °C and 0.01–3 s−1.The family of Al–Li alloys has received much attention for military, space and commercial application because they offer low density, improved specific strength and high stiffness to weight ratio as compared to other conventional commercial alloys Basic dynamic recrystallization (DRX) theory proposes that DRX is only possible for alloys with low stacking fault energy (e.g. Cu alloys, stainless steels). Aluminum has high stacking fault energy. Al alloys exhibit a strong tendency for dynamic recovery (DRV), thus suppressing DRX by minimising the available stored energy in the microstructure which is the driving force for DRX In this research, hot compression test is performed on 2060 alloy at different temperatures and strain rates in order to investigate hot deformation behavior and microstructure evolution. The hot workability of 2060 alloy is discussed by using processing map techniques based on DMM to establish the safe and unsafe domain. EBSD technique is used to study the microstructure characteristic of 2060 alloy. The chemical composition of 2060 alloy used in this study is Al–3.6Cu–0.8Li–0.4Zn–0.7Mg–0.4Ag–0.12Zr (wt%). The alloy was cast into billets with diameter of 100 mm and length of 150 mm and then homogenized at 520 °C for 24 h and air cooled. The initial microstructure of the as-homogenized material is shown in A series of typical true stress – true strain curves of 2060 alloy at constant temperatures and strain rates are presented in All curves in The following expression was used to evaluate the effect of temperature rise on flow stress:  In hot working, the temperature and strain rate dependence of the stress can be expressed by the following equations  The power law Eq. For all stress levels, combining Eqs. In order to investigate the hot deformation behavior of the 2060 alloy, four unknown parameters Differentiating Eq. In the present study, the maximum flow stress The processing map has developed on the basis of dynamic materials model (DMM) At a constant temperature and strain, the dynamic response of the work piece material undergoing hot deformation is represented by the constitutive equation: The strain rate sensitivity ( From Eqs. For an ideal linear dissipater, The variation of efficiency with temperature and strain rate constitutes a power dissipation map. This map exhibits different domains that may be correlated with specific micro-structural processes and applied to microstructural control. The extremum principles of irreversible thermodynamics is applied to continuum mechanics of large plastic flow as described by Ziegler The variation of the instability parameter The processing maps of 2060 alloy at strain of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 are shown in It can be found that the shapes of the processing maps are similar at strains of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5, and the shade areas (unsafe domains) increase with the increase of strain. The map at a strain of 0.5 exhibits two domains where the efficiency of power dissipation reaches a local maximum: Domain I occurs in the temperature range of 350–430 °C and strain rate range of 0.01–0.05 s Domain II occurs in the temperature range of 470–500 °C and strain rate range of 0.01–0.1 s At the strain of 0.5, the processing map exhibits two instability regimes: Regime I occurs in the temperature range of 350–380 °C and strain rate range of 0.01–1 s Regime II occurs in the temperature range of 450–500 °C and strain rate range of 3–10 s In these regions, flow localization may occur. Working in these regions should be avoided. Generally, the material deformed in the condition with high efficiency of power dissipation shows good workability. However, the unstable flow may also occur when the power efficiency is high. So the temperature and strain rate corresponding to the peak efficiency in safe processing domain should be chosen as the optimum parameters for hot working. Therefore, the optimum hot-working condition of 2060 alloy is in the temperature range of 380–500 °C and the strain rate range of 0.01–3 s  In this study, the high angle grain boundary is defined when the boundary misorientation angle is higher than 10° and the low-angle grain boundary is identified if the neighbor boundary misorientation angle is between 2° and 10°. The black line represents high angle grain boundary and the red line represents low angle grain boundary in In the EBSD analysis, the grain is classified as being “deformed” if the average boundary misorientation angle in a grain exceeds 2°. Some grains consist of subgrains whose internal misorientation angle is below 2° but the misorientation angle among the subgrains is above 2°. In that case the grain is classified as “substructured”.  The hot deformation activation energy On the basis of experimental data, processing maps constructed by superimposition of the instability map over the power dissipation map were established under different strains. The safe domains and instable domains were identiﬁed in the processing maps. As mentioned above, the processing maps of the 2060 alloy exhibit optimum hot-working domain in the temperature range of 380–500 °C and the strain rate range of 0.01–3 s EBSD analysis shows that dynamic recovery is the main dynamic soften mechanism of 2060 alloy and no DRX grains are found. The absence of dynamic recrystallization in AF/C-489 alloy was also confirmed, as reported by Jain Hot compression tests were carried out to study the flow behavior of 2060 alloy in the temperature range of 300–500 °C and in the strain rate ranging from 0.01 s The flow stress can be represented by a Zener-Hollomon parameter in the hyperbolic-sine equation with the hot deformation activation energy of 205 kJ/mol. Dynamic recovery is the main dynamic soften mechanism of 2060 alloy. At low temperature of 350 °C, the subgrains are not very well formed and the volume fraction of subgrains is about 30%. As the temperature increases to 400 °C, the relative volume fraction of subgrains increases to 90%. When the temperature is more than 400 °C, both the relative volume fraction of the deformed grains and subgrains remain steady. The substructure (T > 400 °C) exhibits a high level of dynamic recovery. The processing maps are similar in the strain ranging from 0.1 to 0.5, and the unsafe domains increase with the increase of strain. The optimum hot-working condition of 2060 alloy is in the temperature range of 380–500 °C and the strain rate range of 0.01–3 s The authors wish to thank the research board of
