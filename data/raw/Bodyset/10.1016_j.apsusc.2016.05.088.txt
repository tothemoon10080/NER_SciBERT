Subsequently, the surface properties of boron concentrate and the mechanism of microwave irradiation was analyzed. Our results indicate that microwave irradiation decreased the processing temperature and shortened the roasting time by accelerating dehydroxylation and oxidation reactions in the boron concentrate, reducing the particle diameter and damaging the microstructure of the minerals, and it increased the B2O3 activity of boron from 64.68% to 86.73%, greater than the optimal conventional treatment. Compared with the simple thermal field, microwave roasting obviously increased ability of the boron concentrate to absorb OH− in the leachant and promoted boron leaching by expanding the contact area of the mineral exposed to leachant, boosting the amount of Mg2+ and Fe3+ on mineral surfaces, and increasing the hydrophilicity of the boron concentrate respectively. It enhanced the

We studied the influence of each processing parameter on the activation roasting; these included roasting temperature, output power and sample mass. Finally, we investigated the mechanism of microwave irradiation by analyzing surface properties such as hydrophilicity and surface free energy.

After crushing, grinding to 150   The SEM micrograph of the initial material presented in All chemical reagents used in this research were analytically pure and were produced by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The water used in this research was ultrapure. In this paper, microwave irradiation parameters including roasting temperature, microwave power and sample mass were optimized using a single-factor analysis method. The effect of each variable was studied and the best conventional roasting activation effect was determined. Next, the influence of microwave irradiation was studied by comparing the changes in phase composition, particle size distribution and surface free energy of the microwave-irradiated products and products roasted without microwaves under similar thermal conditions. A flow chart of the experimental method is shown in All components in the sample were analyzed using the recommended methods from the National Standard of the People's Republic of China (GB/T). The phase compositions of the samples were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (X’PERT PRO MPD/PW3040, PANalytical B.V. Corporation, Netherlands) at a scanning rate of 8°/min using Cu Kα radiation with a 2θ angle ranging from 5–75°. The surface functional groups of the samples were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy; we used an FT-IR analyzer (Nicolet-380, Thermo Corporation, USA) with a spectrum range from 400 The thermal behavior of the raw material was examined with thermogravimetry analysis (TG-DTG-DSC), which was performed in simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA 449C, NETZSCH Instrument Trading, Ltd., Germany) under an air atmosphere. Approximately 9.655 Microwave roasting was carried out in a 2.45 All conventional roasting was conducted in a laboratory muffle oven. To begin with, according to a previous study by Liu Furthermore, after the optimal microwave processing conditions are determined, a mineral sample with certain optimal sample mass was roasted under simulated conventional thermal field without microwave irradiation to investigate the influence of microwave irradiation on roasting and compare the effects of a microwave field versus a thermal field. According to enterprise standards provided by the Fengcheng Chemical Group Co., Ltd., China, the B Although the surface free energy of solids cannot be measured directly, it can be calculated based on the results of contact angle measurements with appropriate liquids. The contact angles of boron concentrate and treated products were measured using surface tension and contact angle measuring instruments (DCAT21, Dataphysics Corporation, Germany) according to the Washburn theory. The following equation was used The influence of microwave irradiation on the absolute value and interactions of the surface free energy of the boron concentrate was analyzed according to Young’s function (Eq. In Eq. The relationship of surface free energy between the solid and each probe liquid can be calculated using Eq. To ensure measurement accuracy, The TG-DTG-DSC curve of boron concentrate is shown in To better evaluate the activation efficiency, the optimal activation efficiency and processing parameters of conventional roasting were determined firstly. The B To optimize the microwave processing temperature, 100 During the roasting process, both the rate and equilibrium of the reaction were closely related to the roasting temperature. Increasing the temperature promoted chemical reactions during the roasting process. According to the Arrhenius equation, it also enhanced the rate of the chemical reaction and the diffusion of both the reactants and the products. This increased the activation effect of processing at a certain temperature range. The XRD patterns of products roasted at different temperatures shown in The result of FTIR analysis in Particle size distribution analysis of the roasted products at 600 SEM micrographs of the roasted products processed at 600 Boron concentrate is a multi-composite mineral with complicated paragenesis and structure. It has various complex crystal forms and numerous mineral phases. When boron concentrate was treated with microwave irradiation, magnetite was heated and rapidly oxidized due to its high absorption of microwaves and high heating rate Material can be rapidly heated in a microwave because the orientation polarization and interfacial polarization can be induced by microwave irradiation; the relaxation times in the material have the same order of magnitude as the period of microwaves To study the effect of microwave power on roasting efficiency, 100  As reported in previous studies, the utilization efficiency of microwave irradiation is significantly impacted by the sample mass during mineral processing The phase compositions of the roasted products were analyzed to understand the influence of sample mass on microwave heating. The XRD patterns of these products are shown in According to previous research The B  We calculated the contact angles of the three probe liquids and the surface free energy for the two roasted products; the results are shown in  The high activation efficiency caused by microwave roasting can be explained by the heating mechanism of microwave irradiation, which is conducive to chemical reactions and produces cracks and micro-cracks in the boron concentrate. The mechanisms of microwave irradiation and thermal field treatment are shown schematically in In a simple thermal field, material is heated from the surface to the interior and there is little temperature difference among neighboring phases. Microwave irradiation enters a sample as an electromagnetic wave and is absorbed and converted into heat to varying degrees by different minerals in the sample. This creates a large temperature gradient and induces cracks at mineral boundaries, damages the microstructure of the sample, and accelerates chemical reactions such as dehydroxylation and oxidation. Consequently, microwave irradiation exposes more mineral surfaces to the alkali leachant, allowing more OH This study uses microwave irradiation as a novel roasting method to efficiently activate boron concentrate. We analyzed the effect of each parameter on activation efficiency and investigated the mechanism by which microwave irradiation achieves activation roasting with an emphasis on surface properties and found that microwave irradiation roasting eases processing conditions and reduces the roasting time of boron concentrate. The activation effect during microwave processing can be greatly influenced by roasting temperature, output power and sample mass. The B The rapid and relatively complete oxidation and dehydroxylation reactions in boron concentrate induced by microwave irradiation promoted the generation of temperature gradients and thermal stresses within the mineral, and accelerated the generation of gaseous H This research was financially supported by the
