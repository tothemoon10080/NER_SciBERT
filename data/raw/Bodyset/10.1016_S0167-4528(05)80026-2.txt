Aluminum scrap contains foreign metals and non-metallic components. The aim of recycling aluminum scrap is to achieve a maximum metal yield in the later melting process. Aluminum scrap can contain extremely large components, which has to be cut or shreddered into smaller pieces prior to any further treatment. This can be done by dismantling the components into smaller pieces with only little mechanical destruction of individual components, or by crushing components into smaller pieces by applying strong mechanical forces resulting in an almost complete destruction of individual components. For large sheets, a hydraulic press and a guillotine shear are combined in one machine. The press first compacts the loose sheets into heavy packages that are subsequently cut into pieces, which are ideal for charging. Shredders are particularly used to cut flattened car hulks into fist-sized pieces and to liberate individual metals. Magnetic separation is based on the generation of magnetic forces on the particles to be separated, which are higher than opposing forces like gravity or centrifugal force. This principle is used to separate ferromagnetic particles from crushed scrap mixtures.
