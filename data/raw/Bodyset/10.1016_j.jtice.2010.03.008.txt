This paper reports detailed investigation on the influence of microwave irradiation on the cobalt oxalate (Co(C2O4)·2H2O):cobalt oxide (Co3O4) systems in different mass ratio. The analyses of the spectra attenuation and relative frequency shift showed that Co(C2O4)·2H2O had weak capability to absorb microwave irradiation, while Co3O4 had good capability to absorb microwave irradiation. The ability to absorb microwave irradiation was also assessed based on the temperature raise of the system exposed to microwave irradiation. The capability to absorb microwave irradiation of Co(C2O4)·2H2O increased with an increase of ratio Co3O4 in system.magnetic induction intensity electric displacement vector elemental volume electronic fields magnetic fields quality factor loaded with the sample quality factor in the unperturbed condition storage energy permittivity of vacuum real component of the complex permittivity imaginary part of the complex permittivity complex permittivity real component of the complex permittivity imaginary part of the complex permittivity complex permeability volumes of the cavity volumes of the sample variability resonance frequency of cavity resonance frequency of cavity loaded with the sample resonance frequency of cavity in the unperturbed condition Cobalt oxide (Co Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic energy with associated electric and magnetic fields. Microwave energy is extremely efficient in the selective heating of materials, as energy is not wasted in “bulk heating” ( The main objective of this work is to study the influence of microwave irradiation on the (Co(C Co(C The microwave absorption characteristics of sample are quantified based on the measurement of resonant frequency and the output voltage of the resonant sensor ( Microwave reactor employed in the present study is made by Key Laboratory of Unconventional Metallurgy, Ministry of Education, Kunming University of Science and Technology, which has the ability to alter the power intensity from 0 to 3000 The principle of measurement is that microwave is coupled with the microwave resonator ( It is well known that the materials with microwave-absorbing properties can be effectively heated depending on the dielectric loss factor of the materials ( The microwave spectra of output voltage versus frequency, shows the capability of the sample to absorb microwave irradiation, is presented in The degree of interaction of microwave with the materials depends on both the dielectric and the magnetic properties of the medium and these are described in terms of the complex permittivity ( The real and the imaginary part of the complex permittivity are used to express the dielectric response of materials in an applied microwave field. The real component of the complex permittivity measures the capability of material to store microwave energy. The imaginary part of the complex permittivity measures the capability of material to dissipate the stored energy into heat. In most case, The plot of attenuation versus mixture ratio of Co In order to assess the heating behavior of different samples, 10 It can be seen that higher the Co The influence of microwave irradiation on the cobalt oxalate (Co(C Financial support for this work from the
