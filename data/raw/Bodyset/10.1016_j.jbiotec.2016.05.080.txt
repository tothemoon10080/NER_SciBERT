In this study, electrospinning process was used to produce liquid smoke-loaded nanofibers in order to coat fish fillets. Chitosan, known for its bioactive properties, was used as a nanocarrier encapsulation material in this process. The optimized conditions for the spinning procedure were the distance of collector (flat) to needle and applied voltage to the system as 12
