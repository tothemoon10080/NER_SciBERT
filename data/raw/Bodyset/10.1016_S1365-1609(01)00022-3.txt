Theoretical consideration showed that the ultimate closure of a fracture under constant normal stress can be estimated from the normal stress–elastic closure curve by using the values of the relaxation modulus at t=0 and ∞, and that the ultimate time-dependent closure is independent of the normal stress if the elastic closure is linear with the logarithm of the normal stress. Experiments and a Monte Carlo simulation on time-dependent closure under constant normal stress were conducted for a hydraulic fracture created in granite in the laboratory to provide the verification of the theory. The results obtained in the experiments showed that the ultimate time-dependent closure of a hydraulic fracture was almost independent of the normal stress when the elastic closure was linear with the logarithm of the normal stress. A Monte Carlo simulation on time-dependent closure of a fracture under constant normal stress showed that time-dependent closure of a fracture for which the elastic closure is linear with the logarithm of the normal stress does not depend on the normal stress because the increase in contact area during time-dependent closure increases with the normal stress.Many researchers in civil and mining engineering have investigated the mechanical properties of discontinuities such as joints in a rock mass [e.g. 1,2], since the mechanical behaviors as well as fluid permeability of a rock mass are governed by such discontinuities. In the field of geothermal energy extraction engineering, an artificial fracture created by hydraulic fracturing is expected to act as a heat exchanger to enhance the production of geothermal energy The two surfaces of a fracture, such as a hydraulic fracture, are more or less related to each other at long wavelengths Brown and Scholz Time-dependent closure (or opening) and sliding of a fracture may occur under constant normal and shear stresses since rock is not perfectly elastic Time-dependent behaviors such as creep, stress relaxation and an elastic strain recovery of rock are often modeled with viscoclasticity by using rheological models The purpose of this study is to establish a method for estimating long-term closure of a fracture with rough surfaces under constant normal stress. For this purpose, both modeling of time-dependent behaviors of rock and modeling of a fracture are necessary. In the first phase of this paper, the time-dependent closure of a fracture with rough surfaces subjected to a stepwise normal stress was investigated theoretically based upon the viscoelastic contact of asperities on the surfaces. A formula for the relationship between constant normal stress and time-dependent closure as a function of time was derived based on the aperture distribution of the fracture and the relaxation modulus Consider two elastic spheres of radius Assuming that deformation is small, the relationships among the radius Let us consider the contact of two linear viscoelastic spheres with the same dimensions as in the elastic case described above. The constitutive law of a linear viscoelastic material is given in the Laplace domain as The constitutive law given by In the viscoelastic contact of a fracture with rough surfaces under a constant load, the load or pressure produced by the initial elastic contact on each contact area is never constant, but decreases with time because the contact area that supports a constant total load increases with time due to the time-dependent closure. However, the closure of a fracture increases monotonously with time, so both the closure and the contact area of each contact point, which is expressed with two spheres in contact in this study, increase monotonously. Accordingly, the correspondence principle can be applied to obtain closure of two viscoelastic spheres in contact from the corresponding elastic solution, whereas the boundary conditions change with time The relationship between the radius of the contact area From Now consider a fracture with a number of local summits on its composite topography, in which the The instantaneous elastic load For a local minimum aperture in contact at  In If the elastic closure Δ is linear versus the logarithm of normal stress Inada granite, quarried at lbaraki prefecture, Japan, was used in the experiments. The mechanical and physical properties are summarized in Hydraulic fracturing was carried out in the laboratory for a block of granite (150 The heights of the two fracture surfaces were measured along matched paths in an area of 41   To obtain a representative normal stress–elastic closure curve, Goodman's relation The time-dependent closure of the fracture under different constant normal stresses is shown in As mentioned previously, the closure Δ( First of all, a fracture model used in simulating time-dependent closure must reproduce the elastic closure obtained experimentally ( By using the parameters determined, local minima of apertures of magnitude according to Now time-dependent closure of a fracture under constant normal stress can be simulated by using the fracture model that reproduces the elastic closure obtained in the experiment. The relaxation modulus ( Time-dependent closure was simulated by rewriting To understand the mechanism for the independence of ultimate time-dependent closure of the normal stress, the contact area as a function of time The time-dependent closure obtained in the simulation is shown in The increase in the contact area during time-dependent closure, obtained in the simulation according to Time-dependent closure of a fracture with rough surfaces subjected to a stepwise normal stress was considered theoretically by viscoelastic modeling of rock. A formula for the relationship between constant normal stress and time-dependent closure as a function of time was derived, based upon the distributions of aperture local minima and their radii. It was shown that the ultimate closure of a fracture under constant normal stress can be estimated from the normal stress–elastic closure curve and the relaxation modulus of rock. Furthermore, the ultimate time-dependent closure was shown to be independent of the normal stress if the elastic closure is linear with the logarithm of the normal stress (Goodman's fracture). Experiments and a Monte Carlo simulation on elastic and time-dependent closure were conducted for a hydraulic fracture created in granite in the laboratory to provide the verification of the theory and to understand the mechanism for the independence of time-dependent closure of a Goodman's fracture of the normal stress. The experiments showed that the time-dependent closure of a Goodman's fracture was almost independent of the normal stress. A Monte Carlo simulation on time-dependent closure approximately reproduced the experimental results, and showed that the time-dependent closure of a Goodman's fracture does not depend on the normal stress because the increase in the contact area during time-dependent closure of the fracture increases as the normal stress increases. The constitutive law of a linear viscoelastic material is given in the Laplace domain as in the text This equation is dissolved into partial fractions.
