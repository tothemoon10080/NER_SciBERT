The roles of different intermediate oxidative species, such as singlet oxygen, triplet oxygen, superoxide radical anions and hydroperoxy or hydroxyl radicals, were studied in the mineralization reactions of solutions containing a mixture of three phenolic compounds (namely gallic, p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids). The degradation process that was developed was a ferrioxalate-induced artificial ultraviolet (UV)-A/C photo-Fenton system. Reactions were carried out in an UV reactor consisting of two 50-W UV-C lamps and two 75-W UV-A lamps. The roles played by the oxidative active species in various stages of the process were determined by running the reaction in the presence of different scavenging agents. Analyses were conducted within a multivariate experimental design combined with neural networks that included the following variables: initial concentrations of tert-butyl alcohol, 1,4-benzoquinone, sodium azide and potassium iodide. The response function was the %TOC removal after 15 and 60min of reaction. Under optimal conditions (e.g., in the absence of scavenging agents), 88% TOC removal of the phenolic mixture could be achieved in 60min at 28°C. Superoxide radical anions and triplet oxygen were the main oxidants in earlier stages of the mineralization of this phenolic-mixture solution, whereas singlet oxygen, hydroxyl and hydroperoxy radicals played more significant roles in later stages. Tert-butyl alcohol was the most significant scavenger affecting inhibition of the mineralization reaction, as it trapped almost all of the intermediate active species.Phenolic compounds present in agro-industrial wastewaters constitute one of the largest groups of high-aromatic-content organic pollutants. They are considered priority contaminants because of their high toxicity at low concentrations. Because of this high toxicity, conventional biological treatments are in some cases ineffective at degrading phenolic compounds Depending on the operating conditions and the chemicals used, the effective mineralization of a phenolic-mixture solution composed of gallic, p-coumaric and protocatechuic acids by a ferrioxalate-assisted solar photo-Fenton process can generate highly reactive intermediate oxidative active species such as hydroxyl radicals ( In this work, the contributions of different oxidative intermediate species to the overall mineralization reaction of this three-phenolic-mixture solution were quantified at different reaction times under a ferrioxalate-induced artificial ultraviolet (UV)-A/C photo-Fenton process. To quantify the oxidation levels by free radical reactions, the scavenging of intermediate active species was accomplished with tert-butyl alcohol, 1,4-benzoquinone (O The experimental results were fitted using neural networks (NNs) The mixture solutions of protocatechuic acid (PA; 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, Sigma–Aldrich, 97%), gallic acid (GA; 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, Sigma, 97.5%) and p-coumaric acid (CA; 4-hydroxycinamic acid, Sigma, 98%) were prepared by dissolving the target compounds in distilled water without further purification. FeSO In all experiments, the operating conditions used were those selected in a previous work The UV pilot plant (FLUORACADUS-08/2.2) is shown in The degree of mineralization was monitored by TOC variation, which was determined using a TOC-5050 Shimadzu analyzer (standard deviation A central-composite experimental design The design consisted of three series of experiments Temperature was not controlled during the experiments, but it was measured during the reactions. Average temperature values at 15 and 60 In this work, a linear basis function was used (e.g., a linear combination of input variables, In these experiments, the degradation of solutions containing a mixture of gallic, protocatechuic and p-coumaric acids under a ferrioxalate-assisted photo-Fenton system irradiated with artificial UV-A/C light was developed. The contributions of different oxidative intermediate species to the overall mineralization reaction were studied by running the reaction in the presence or absence of different radical scavengers. To simultaneously study the effects of different scavenging agents (factors) on %TOC removal (response function), a central-composite experimental design was used. The experimental design matrix, both coded and natural levels and variable ranges are presented in Experimental results and NN predictions of response function were in good agreement and had average errors of less than 15% in all cases (data not shown).
