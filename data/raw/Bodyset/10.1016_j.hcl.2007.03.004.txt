In 1934, fractures of the middle and distal third of the radius associated with instability of the distal radial ulnar joint (DRUJ) were described by Galeazzi. This type of lesion is characterized by its unstable nature and the need for open reduction and internal fixation to achieve a satisfactory functional outcome. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by the surgeon, and a thorough examination for instability of the DRUJ must be conducted. The marked instability of this fracture-dislocation complex is further enhanced by the disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex, either with or without ulna styloid fracture. Treatment in adults is surgical, and both bone and soft tissue injuries should be addressed.
