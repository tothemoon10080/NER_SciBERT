                      of the present Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel is attributed to a fracture initiation mechanism predominated by decohesion of prior austenitic grain boundaries at the fatigue pre-crack front. This is attributed to segregation of phosphorus along the prior austenitic grain boundaries causing embrittlement, supported by SEM and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) observations.Tempered martensitic steels are presently under active consideration as wrapper materials Amongst the DBTT evaluation procedures, the reference temperature approach (reference temperature, In the nuclear pressure vessel steels, DBTT has been found to be extremely sensitive to the trace level impurities, mainly phosphorus (P) 30 As the result obtained in this work has been compared with earlier results with plain 9Cr–1Mo steel Round bars of ∼16.9 and 17.3 Charpy impact specimens were fatigue pre-cracked in 3-point bend mode in compression with an All pre-cracked Charpy (PCVN) impact tests were conducted in a Tinius Olsen 358 Impact tests were conducted at a lower velocity of impact (∼1.12 Test temperatures for determining the reference temperature ( The load–time data sets obtained from the instrumented system were processed following the well established procedures for instrumented impact tests. The incremental displacement at each load point has been obtained by multiplying the average velocity at that point with the time interval between that point and its predecessor point, where the velocity at each point was calculated taking into account the loss of kinetic energy of the hammer. The load–displacement plots thus obtained have been used for further analysis. The mechanism of crack initiation and propagation was studied by examining the fracture surfaces of the tested samples under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). To assess the distribution of phosphorus in Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel, Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) technique was used.  The The validity of each The three parameter Weibull distribution model, as given in Eq. For the Weibull slope, a constant value of ‘4’ has been assigned in the ASTM E 1921-05 In spite of scatter, a reasonable agreement has been obtained with the forced-fit line. The correlation coefficient ( The valid dynamic fracture toughness results, obtained from the pre-cracked Charpy V-notch specimens, were first converted to 1 To determine the scale parameter (  The corresponding median These are also reported in The reference temperature for dynamic condition, (  The selection of the test temperature has always been a crucial input, in There are speculations about the applicability of the ASTM E-1921 Master Curve shape under dynamic loading rate. Though the common belief about the origin of the invariant curve shape lies with the exponential decrease of the thermal part of the local flow stress, Ortner As discussed earlier, the loading rate of 1.12 While using Eq. It is observed from The understanding of the dynamic fracture process of Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel presented here is based on three experimental tools, namely, instrumented pre-cracked Charpy test, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy. The results and observations from the instrumented pre-cracked Charpy impact test may be summarized as: (a) The observed differences between the Mod.9Cr–1Mo and plain 9Cr–1Mo steels are examined in the light of scanning electron microscopic observations of the fracture surface, and possible differences in their crack initiation mechanisms. Representative SEM images of the Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel are shown in The differences in the crack initiation mechanism in the two steels are examined in the light of the differences in their chemical compositions, that influence the grain boundary embrittlement. The difference in crack initiation mechanisms in the two steels is attributed to the difference in P-content in these two steels. The P-content (0.02 by wt.%) for the Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel in the present study is very high when compared to that (0.007 by wt.%) for plain 9Cr–1Mo steel. A critical study of conventional RPV steels correlating the chemical composition and the reference temperature (under quasi-static or dynamic condition) reveals very strong influence of phosphorus; The higher phosphorus content (0.02 by wt.%) in the chemical composition of Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel has already been reported in this paper. For studying its distribution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry technique was used. Since cold working is not expected to affect the P distribution, only the material in N&T condition has been examined. Ion beam etching of a polished surface was carried out with Cs ion and the subsequent cumulative P signals have been recorded. A SIMS image showing the P distribution is given in This conclusion is also supported by the following: The stress build up ahead of the fatigue pre-crack front for this type of steel has been reported to be 2200–2400 The P-induced grain boundary embrittlement also explains the minimal plasticity observed in the load–displacement plots, and the lack of significant effect of cold work on The ASME  The In the present Mod.9Cr–1Mo steel, the As the materials indexing parameter in describing the fracture toughness variation in the transition temperature regime, The authors are thankful to Dr. A.K.
