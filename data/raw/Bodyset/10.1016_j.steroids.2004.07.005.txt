We have isolated from the plant Onobrychis ebenoides three novel arylobenzofurans with binding affinity for the estrogen receptor. In this study, we evaluated these arylobenzofurans, namely ebenfuran I, ebenfuran II and ebenfuran III for their potential selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like properties. We examined their ability, (1) to induce the insulin growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, (2) to stimulate differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic cell culture by histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase, Alizarin Red-S staining and calcium levels in the supernatants and (3) to inhibit cell proliferation of cervical adenocarcinoma (Hela) cells by use of the MTT assay. An estrogen receptor mediated effect was investigated by carrying out chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assay on transient MCF-7 transfectants. Estradiol and the “pure” antiestrogen ICI 182780 were included to serve as control samples of the estrogenic and antiestrogenic effect respectively. Our data reveal that ebenfuran II is a highly potent SERM, exhibiting antiestrogenic activity in breast cancer cells via the estrogen receptor, estrogenic effect on osteoblasts and no stimulatory effect on cervix adenocarcinoma cells. In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate that plant derived arylobenzofurans show a SERM profile and may be considered for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as breast cancer, cervical cancer and osteoporosis.Phytoestrogens (isoflavonoids and lignans) are widely known plant compounds, which bind to estrogen receptors and exhibit estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity both in vivo and in vitro. Numerous epidemiological studies, animal studies as well as tissue culture studies have demonstrated that phytoestrogens have anabolic effects on bone and may prevent breast and prostate cancer. Furthermore, they may favourably affect endothelial function, menopausal symptoms, cognitive functions and depression The natural benzofurans and benzoypyrans is a new exciting group of plant compounds exhibiting binding affinity for the estrogen receptors; however, to our knowledge there are not data on their possible estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects on different tissues Based on the above, we proceeded to examine the natural 2-arylobenzofurans in relation to their ability to regulate the IGFBP-3 in MCF-7 cells. The arylobenzofuran exhibiting the highest antiestrogenic effect was further assessed for, (a) its stimulatory effect on differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic cells and (b) its inhibitory/stimulatory effect on cell growth of cervix adenocarcinoma Hela cells. Estradiol and the pure antiestrogen ICI 182780 were included in the study to serve as controls of the agonistic and antagonistic activity respectively. The possibility of a genomic receptor mediated effect was also investigated by carrying out a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assay on transient MCF-7 transfectants Cultures of MCF-7 cells (ATCC Cell Bank) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL) and 50 After 24 IGFBP3 was measured at zero time (before the addition of estradiol or ICI 182780), as well as after 6 Different concentrations of estradiol (10 IGFBP3 was measured in all samples directly using an enzymatically amplified “two step” sandwich-type immunoassay (DSL Diagnostic System Laboratories Inc.). Briefly, standards and samples were incubated in microtitration wells coated with anti-IGFBP3 polyclonal antibody. After incubation and washing, the wells were treated with another anti-IGFBP3 polyclonal antibody labeled with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After a second incubation and washing step, the wells were incubated with the substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). An acidic stopping solution is then added and the degree of enzymatic turnover of the substrate is determined by wavelength absorbance measurement at 620 Osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells (purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) After 24 days, the cultures in 12 well plates were rinsed with PBS followed by fixation with 5% formalin for 10 min and stained for alkaline phosphatase (20% (w/v) naphthol-ASMX phosphate diluted in 5‰ dimethylformamide (v/v); 50% (v/v) Tris buffer 0.2 Calcium in the supernatants was determined with a commercial endpoint assay (Sigma) based on the Cultures of Hela cells (ATCC Cell Bank) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco BRL), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco BRL) in T-75 MCF-7 cells were plated at 1.5 All values are expressed as the mean   The MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with the (ERE) Since ebenfuran II exhibited the highest antiestrogenic effect on MCF-7 cells, we further examined its effect on the ALP activity and mineralization by MC3T3-E1 cells. Ebenfuran II, at day 24, dose dependently increased the ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells compared to the control activity (vehicle) (data not shown). Ebenfuran II increased markedly mineralized nodule formation as shown by AR-S staining at day 24 in culture. Maximal and significant effects are observed at concentrations 10 The dose–resposne curve concerning the effect of ebenfuran II on Hela cells viability is presented in The isolation and characterization of new plant derived arylobenzofurans, ebenfuran I, ebenfuran II, ebenfuran III, showing estrogen receptor-binding affinity In our study, we used in vitro test systems, which are widespread for the determination of estrogenicity, such as the analysis of the regulation of endogenous estrogen sensitive gene in the appropriate cell line, a reporter gene assay and a cell-proliferation assay We report for the first time that plant derived compounds of high affinity for the estrogen receptor have the potential to regulate in vitro the IGFBP-3 levels in breast cancer cells reflecting thus their antiestrogenic/antitumor properties, the ebenfuran II exhibiting the highest antiestrogenic activity. The concentrations at which ebenfuran II activated the expression of the ER-regulated IGFBP-3 molecule (10 To evaluate the effects of test substances on bone, there are biological tests and biochemical markers widely recognized to reflect osteoblastic activity. In vivo studies have used the measurement of IGFBP-3 levels in serum of animals and humans as marker to assess the effect of phytoestrogens on bone The use of the cell proliferation assay MTT The 2-arylobenzofurans belong to a larger group of compounds containing benzopyrans, isosteric structures such as benzofurans and benzothiophenes and their analogues, which have been reported to have high-binding affinity for the estrogen receptor, exhibiting estrogenic/antiestrogenic activity, the 2-arylobenzothiophene raloxifene being a widely known SERM compound This work has been financied by a grant PAVE from the Greek General Secretariat of Research and Technology and the Company PHARMATEN as well as by Bodossaki Foundation.
