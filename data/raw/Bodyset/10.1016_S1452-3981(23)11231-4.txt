Iridium is considered a valuable material due to its physical, chemical and electrocatalytic properties [1-3]. Iridium recovery from post-consumed industrial materials and effluents [4, 5] is necessary, since the natural resources for its production are limited and its demand in the industry will continue growing. This paper presents the electrochemical study of the iridium deposit on titanium (Ti) and stainless steel (A304) substrates in an electrolytic medium of HCl. Cyclic voltammetry results show iridium reduction response in standard solutions from 12.5 to 3 ppm for the two electrodes used. The study of the cathodic charge, current (i) vs. Potential (E) curves, the results of semi-quantitative chemical analysis by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and the diffusion coefficient of iridium DIr, confirm the deposit of iridium on Ti electrodes and A304.
