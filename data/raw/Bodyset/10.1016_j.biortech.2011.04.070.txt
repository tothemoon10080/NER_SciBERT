The mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase gene man26A from Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88 was optimized according to the codon usage bias in Pichia pastoris and synthesized by splicing overlap extension PCR. It was successfully expressed in P. pastoris using constitutive expression vector pGAPzαA. The recombinant endo-beta-1,4-mannanase could work in an extremely board temperature range and over 30% relative activity were retained in the temperature range of 5–60°C. The optimal pH value and temperature for activity were 5.0 and 45°C, respectively. It was highly thermotolerant with a half-life time of 15min at 90°C. A novel fed-batch strategy was developed successfully for high cell-density fermentation and mannanase activity reached 5069U/mL after cultivation for 56h in 50L fermenter. The broad working temperature range, high thermotolerance and efficient expression made this enzyme possible to be applied in food, animal feed and the production of biofuels.β-1,4-Mannans are widespread in wood, tubers, plant seeds, and beans ( Mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.78) randomly hydrolyzes 1,4-beta-  Fifty-four optimized overlapping oligonucleotides of mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase gene (man26A, accession number: The recombinant plasmid pGAPZαA-man26A was linearized with The strain was inoculated into 5 The crude supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 8000 Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was performed in a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel according to the method described by Mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase activity was determined using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method ( Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford ( The optimal temperature for endo-beta-1,4-mannanase activity was determined by the standard activity assay as described above at various temperatures from −5 to 80 The substrate specificity of purified endo-beta-1,4-mannanase was evaluated with the following substrates at 5 The recombinant strain was cultured in 5 According to There are some other mannanases with high primary structure similarity to Man26A in GenBank. AfMan from The man26A gene consisted of 1005 nucleotides codes for a 335-residue with a calculated mass of 37.7 After sequencing confirmation, the construction plasmid pGAPZαA-man26A was linearized with The recombinant Man26A could be purified by metal affinity chromatography on Ni–NTA agarose and size exclusion chromatography on Superdex. However, we found that the yield of the purified enzyme after chromatography on the Ni–NTA agarose column was lower (data not shown). In this study, the crude enzyme from the supernatant was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex G-75 column ( The enzyme displayed over 30% activity in the temperature range of 5–60 The temperature properties of this recombinant endo-beta-1,4-mannanase were very different from any other endo-beta-1,4-mannanases ( In general, the high specific activity of cold-adapted enzymes at low temperature is partly due to the highly structural flexibility which conversely leads to the low thermotolerant of those enzymes ( The recombinant mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase from The maximal mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase activity reached 470 According to the time-course profiles of cultivation in 250 An acidic, cold-active and thermotolerant mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase was gained in a full active form by constitutive expression in This work was funded by the National Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
