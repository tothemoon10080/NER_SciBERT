The aim of this work was to study the anisotropic effect of crystalline CaCO3 nanoparticles (CN)-driven multiple refraction/scattering from the CN-coated agglomerated cells on the rate of photosynthesis and the product yield under high light conditions in the freshwater microalgae Neochloris oleoabundans. The CN-coating via biomineralization significantly improved the biomass and lipid production of N. oleoabundans during second stage of autotrophic induction by sustaining relatively high rate of photosynthesis at high irradiance using the multiple-splitting effect of the anisotropic polymorphism. The CN were successfully produced, adsorbed and grown on the external cells under conditions of mild alkalinity (pH 7.5–8.0), mild CaCl2 concentration (0.05 M) and under nitrogen starvation with strong light (400 µE m−2 s−1). Consequently, lipid content and productivity of N. oleoabundans cells cultured with 0.05 M CaCl2 increased by 18.4% and 31.5%, respectively, compared to the cells cultured with 0.05 M CaCl2 and acetazolamide to inhibit calcification.Climate change is the most severe problem that we are facing today due to primarily rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO Microalgae efficiently convert CO The calcifying microalgae show the tendency to coat the external cell wall surface with crystalline CaCO Natural light has been widely used for economical microalgal culture system. However, when outdoor microalgae farming is operated, the cells distributed on the surface of open pond or photobioreactor are not free from photodamage and photoinhibition due to the strong light intensity of solar radiation (1500–2000 μE m The present study aimed to investigate the anisotropic effect of CaCO Among the tested microalgae species,  In the first stage, the cells were fully grown in a TAP-C medium (pH 7.5–8.0) via cell multiplication (vegetative growth) for 6 days at 150 μE m The cell density was determined by measuring DCW using pre-weighed filter paper via filtering aliquots of samples. Then, the cell suspensions (10 mL) followed by DI water were filtered with GF/F glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Cambridge, UK) and dried at 105 °C overnight. Then, DCW was determined by the difference between the mass of the biomass-containing filter paper and that of pre-weighed filter paper. For the lipid analysis, lipid was extracted with the modified Bligh and Dyer method ( In order to assay intracellular chlorophyll, cell suspensions (10 mL) were collected by centrifuging the cell culture fluid at 5000 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min, discarding the supernatant, and rinsing the cell pellet with pre-chilled TE buffer (pH 7.5). The pellet was dissolved in pre-chilled 100% methanol with glass bead to extract pigments and homogenized with Tissue Lyser II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using pre-chilled Tissue Lyser adaptors. The extraction procedure was repeated until the cell debris was colorless. The homogenized lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min to separate the supernatant from the cell debris. Then, the fresh extracts were used to measure total chlorophyll concentration using UV spectrophotometry ( Photosynthetic oxygen evolution of microalgae cells was measured to characterize the effect of CN-coating on the rate of photosynthesis using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph, Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, UK) according to The characterization of morphology and material was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Tescan Vega3, 30 kV), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Tescan Mira 3, 30 kV) equipped with EDS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; Cary630, Agilent Technologies). The transmittance of CN -coated and -uncoated cells was examined by Ultra-Violet, Visible and Near Infra-Red (UV–Vis-NIR; Cary5000, Agilent Technologies) to convert a value from absorbance to percent transmittance (%T). After rinsing the samples containing the CN-coated cells with sterilized DI water (pH 8.0) three times with vortexing, the synthesized CN coated on the external cell surface were simply separated from the biomass by mild sonication method. The separation of CaCO In order to identify whether bio-mineralization process is suitable for vegetative growth of To induce an efficient CaCl After 5 days of autotrophic induction, the In microalgae, the single-cell mass enhancement (inductive growth) is a general phenomenon under nutrient starvation. Under N- or P-deplete conditions, the biomass increased by 112% compared to an initial cell density of the induction stage in However, the CaCO Alike CO Through photosynthesis, microalgae assimilate CO During vegetative growth (1st stage), CaCO In addition, the alkaline pH as well as salt stress still could retard the exponential growth of microalgal cells in 1st stage, even in alkaliphilic  To determine the amount of CaCO Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, cells stop proliferation, but has the tendency to accumulate lipid ( The Ca Intriguingly, lipid accumulation was better facilitated during CaCO During the induction stage (2nd stage), formation and growth of CaCO After 3 days of autotrophic induction, the compound coated on the Although CN-coated single cell was also observed, the majority of microalgae cells showed the shape of CN-coated agglomerates under nitrogen starvation. It has been previously reported that CaCO In the present study, CaCO The CaCO Nonetheless, During the induction stage (2nd stage), the chlorophyll content in the two cells of 0 M CaCl To demonstrate the effect of CaCO In general, under low light conditions, microalgae cells maintain high chlorophyll content to harvest light maximally ( It was previously reported that single light scattering technique successively improved the light distribution and microalgae growth in the optical waveguide PBR doped with light scattering nanoparticles (organosilicon) as singly scattered light can pass through the cell suspension more deeply ( In this context, the CN-coated cells (cell agglomerates) showed excellent performance on photosynthetic rate compared with the CN-uncoated cells. It is possible that the ray of high light intensity was split into several rays of moderate light intensity by CaCO After 3 days of the induction stage, the transmittance of light was compared in the visible spectrum (680–800 nm) between CN-coated and uncoated cells. As a result, the transmittance at 800 nm of porous CaCO Coincidently, assuming that the cells were fully coated with porous CN after 3 days of biomineralization process, the reduction in transmittance by half (substantially) can be attributed to the effect of multiple splitting of high light irradiance. The splitting of light into multiple ordinary and extraordinary rays would be destined to be scattered infinitely through the CaCO In order to make high value products from microalgae, a two-stage culture strategy would commonly be most adopted in microalgae industry. For effective CO When the microalgae cells were efficiently coated with CN, the ζ-potential at the cell surface (an absolute value) was weakened rapidly in Subsequently, after harvesting and drying the calcite-coated biomass, the biomass containing CaCO The CN grown on the cell surface could be easily separated from the microalgae biomass by mild sonication method, but its release in fresh or salt water should be carefully controlled to block environmental issues. The separated CN crystal could be washed (i.e., by water), dried (i.e., by sun light), and sterilized (i.e., by autoclave). The purified calcite-dominant material has many applications in the industry of concrete, paper, painting, agriculture for neutralizing the land, functional food for calcium supplement, pharmaceutics for acid neutralization and excipient.
