This work proposes a method for fault isolation by means of the structured model characterization with isolation capability, and the residual generation through dynamic principal component analysis. Specifically, the characterization is obtained using graph theory tools, and is expressed in terms of known variables and subsets of constraints. Thus, in the absence of analytical explicit models, the fault isolation task can be solved if the structured models satisfy isolability conditions and a set of nominal historical data from the process is available to carry out the dynamic principal component analysis based monitoring with adaptive standardization. Simulation results for the three tanks system show the effectiveness of the solution for fault isolation tasks.
