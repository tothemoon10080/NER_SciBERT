It has been known for many years that the impregnation of activated carbon with strategically selected compounds can help in its ability to remove toxic gases. Carbon can be impregnated by stirring it in an aqueous solution of the desired compound. Typically, an impregnant loading of 0.1â€“20% by weight is required. While there is an abundance of literature available on the adsorption of activated carbons with dilute solutions (typically in the range of 0.1 Commercially available Kuraray GC, an acid-washed coconut shell-based granular activated carbon, with particle mesh size of 12 The titrations indicate that there are no carboxylic acid surface groups, and the main constituents appear to be lactone groups with some phenolic groups Nine solutions of 100 The isotherms can be divided into two categories: those that do not show preferential adsorption, i.e. those that follow a straight line in In order to determine whether 1 The linear and Langmuir terms fitted to the preferential adsorption curves in By subtracting the linear In contrast to the values shown in The results shown in In summary, a number of common salts were impregnated onto activated carbon at high concentrations and categorized into preferential and non-preferential adsorbers. These novel results, together with others to be obtained for a variety of activated carbons, should enable a well-planned approach to impregnating carbon; for a desired impregnant loading, one can determine the required concentration of impregnant solution in a quantitative manner. In addition, our studies of the adsorption of Cu(Ac) The authors wish to thank NSERC, Killam Trusts and 3M Canada Co. for their financial support.
