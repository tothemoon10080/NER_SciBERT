Sulfuric acid is an important chemical for the industry. Thus, a proper and reliable thermodynamic model for aqueous sulfuric acid is essential, if the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations will be utilized in the process development and modelling.
                  The existing Pitzer models for aqueous H2SO4 are either limited up to 6molal (37wt% ) sulfuric acid solution or are too complicated for practical modelling purposes, including 9 to 10 model parameters, with more than 30 terms fitted from experimental data within.
                  Recently, a modified Pitzer equation for concentrated aqueous solutions was developed in National Physical Laboratory (UK). The ability of the NPL modification of Pitzer equation to describe the activity and osmotic coefficients of concentrated sulfuric acid solutions up to 15molal solutions with limited number of Pitzer parameters has been tested and found to be excellent.
                  Several sets of Pitzer parameters and four different equations for the dissociation constant of bisulfate ion, K
                     2, were studied at the temperature range 0–55°C. Four Pitzer parameters were found essential. One 5-parameter set including these four parameters was found to be able to extrapolate the osmotic coefficient up to 40molal (80wt%) sulfuric acid solution. There was only a little difference between the studied K
                     2 equations.The Pitzer ion interaction model, similar to the virial equation used for non ideal gases, has proved to be the most accurate thermodynamic model up to moderate concentrations in aqueous solutions The unsymmetrical mixing terms for ions with like sign but with unequal magnitude are not included in the original Pitzer ion interaction model. Harvie and Weare In the original Pitzer model the third virial coefficients describing the interactions between three ions were assumed to be independent of concentration, i.e., ion strength. Archer Pitzer and Simonsson Several thermodynamic models using Pitzer ion interaction model to describe the excess Gibbs energy with different Sulfuric acid is an important chemical for the industry In 2010 Sippola Recently, a modified Pitzer equation for concentrated aqueous solutions was developed in National Physical Laboratory (UK) Pitzer Parameters Assuming Osmotic coefficient ( NPL Pitzer equation is obtained by replacing the reduced molality and ion strength defined as The reduced molalities will converge to molalities in dilute solutions. Thus, the model coincides with the original Pitzer model at infinite dilution. The experimental data used for the evaluation were chosen to be the most accurate considered ones and are listed in For cell A all data below 0.005 According to Clegg et al. The experimental accuracy was evaluated for cell A and B to be ±1 No enthalpy or heat capacity data was included for the reasons explained in the following sections. MTDATA version 4.81 was used for parameter fitting The objective function (OF) used in MTDATA is The goodness of the assessments for each experimental data set There are several equations in the literature for the second dissociation constant ( The values of the second equilibrium constants at 25 The first four studied Pitzer parameter sets ( In the early stages of this study, the four parameter set The temperature dependency of all parameters is All studied parameter sets are listed in Parameter sets The standard deviations and maximum deviations obtained for each cell and the stoichiometric osmotic coefficient at 25 The parameter sets are Set All the studied equations for When comparing the results it can be concluded that the cation–anion Pitzer parameters Since several parameter sets and Five parameter sets from earlier section sharing the three most significantly parameters, namely Two 6-parameter sets were also tested: Set The relationship with the parameter sets are illustrated in The values of object functions for each fit are gathered in The six parameter sets The standard deviations obtained and the maximum deviations for each cell as well as the stoichiometric osmotic coefficient at 25 The best parameters set are Parameter sets In general, the differences between the There is little difference in the predicted values of the two best parameter sets The electrochemical potentials for cell B and C at 25 The values of fitted parameters for selected parameter sets with all the studied The extrapolating abilities of the parameter sets The parameter set The temperature extrapolation ability of the parameter set Matsushima and Okuwaki Similar values are obtained with Dickson et al.’s The NPL modification of Pitzer equation (NPL Pitzer) was found to be able to model sulfuric acid solutions well and to the high concentrations. The temperature and concentration range used in the assessment were 0–55 Four Pitzer parameters were found essential in modelling the system:    A 4-parameter set consisting of these parameters can model the sulfuric acid–water system equally or better than any of the studied five parameter sets, lacking any of the essential parameters. Two five parameter sets The agreement between the values predicted by parameter set There is little difference in quality of the assessment between the studied The new model, NPL Pitzer, enables introducing an accurate thermodynamic model for the concentrated acidic sulfate solutions common in hydrometallurgy and important in environmental chemistry. The thermodynamic description of sulfuric acid–water system will be extended by including more data on wider temperature range in the assessment.
