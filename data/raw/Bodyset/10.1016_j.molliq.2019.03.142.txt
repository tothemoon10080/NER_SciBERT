The simple and reliable conductivity measurement method has been inaugurated to disclose the mixed micellization behavior of two ionic surfactants (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB) plus sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) in H2O/NH2-CO-NH2 (urea) medium at several temperatures and compositions. The experimentally evaluated critical micelle concentration (cmc) are different those from their corresponding ideal critical micelle concentration (cmc

                     ) which signifies the mutual interaction (attractive/repulsive) amongst the current constituents. The higher cmc values of distinct surfactant and mixed system in occurrence of NH2-CO-NH2 compare to water medium which also further increase through raising the amount of urea. In urea medium, the extent of degree of dissociation (g) is lower at superior composition of TTAB which implying better packing of surfactants aggregates.

                     m values were positive in all cases studied herein.Compounds having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-hating) moieties are known as surfactant [ However, mixed micelles are experienced in almost all beneficial application in different industries such as pharmaceutical production, surface wetting, and enhanced oil recovery. This system also used in different separation techniques such as mineral processing, manufacture of mesoporous catalysts, pesticides, dyestuffs, fibers, food, detergents, paints, plastics [ Though a significant number of investigations were examined on the binary combinations of ionic (same charge) and nonionic system but the combination of opposite charges amphiphiles especially TTAB and SDS at various temperatures in aqueous & urea solution have not been studied yet. Since the mixture of cationic and anionic surfactants display of various aggregates like micelle, vesicles, bi-continuous structures, etc. Therefore, the systematic inspection of the mixture of two contrarily charged surfactants is gained attention and significance in the recent year. The electrostatic interaction amongst the constituents of mixed system led to the synergism resulting micro-ensembles having biological, pharmaceutical and analytical relevance. Moreover, the aforesaid aggregate structures affect by different additives, temperature, mixing ratio, number of alkyl chain per head group, size of surfactant head groups, concentration of surfactant, digit of chains per surfactant. Conductometric technique has become a reliable method in order to execute Seeing all the above detail, in the present investigation, various micellar parameters e.g., Herein, the utilized entire preliminary materials were of analytically grade and applied with no any successive treatment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 98.5%, BDH, England), Tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich (USA), urea (H Conductance measurement technique was employed to evaluate the more accurate and precise The preparation of pure TTAB (30 mmol·kg The evaluation of conductivity of the surfactants is one of the elementary and reliable technique that can be utilized for the estimation of The experimentally evaluated The experimentally evaluated     Herein, the magnificence of Herein, the magnificence of Han et al. [ The ideal/non-ideal habituate of the SDS-TTAB mixtures can be examined through pseudo phase separation model. The When the interaction between the components is absent i.e., in the case of ideal mixing of the components, Any divergence of experimentally estimated Any divergence of experimentally estimated Two linear segments having different slopes in the graph of specific conductivity ( Two linear segments having different slopes in the graph of specific conductivity ( Clint's model does not sustain the existence of the interaction amongst the constituents of mixed micelle solution and it illustrates that the components are non-interacting and don't meddle on the association of the other component. In the purpose of resolving the phase segregation model, mixed micellization was provided by Holland and Rubingh [ In Eq.
