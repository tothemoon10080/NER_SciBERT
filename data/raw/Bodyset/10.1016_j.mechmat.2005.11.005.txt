The present investigation involves the evaluation of hot forging features in pure iron sintered preforms. Cylindrical compacts with different aspect ratios were prepared, sintered and forged at the temperature of 1150°C. This suggests that the experimentally determined theoretical density ratio has a straight line relationship with the new geometrical shape factor

The influences of densification which take place during the plastic deformation on various parameters namely the geometrical shape factor, stress ratio parameter and barrel radius have been studied.initial perform height deformed height of the preform initial diameter of the preform contact diameter of the preform (top surface) contact diameter of the preform (bottom surface) contact diameter bulged diameter relative density initial preform density theoretical preform density deformed preform density true Hoop stress true axial stress true radial stress mean or hydrostatic stress effective stress true axial strain true hoop strain Poisson’s ratio P/M fabrication has recently drawn much attention because this method is widely used for the manufacturing of various components in industries. Compared to dense metal plastic deformation of sintered powder preforms involves additional complications due to volume fraction of voids in the preform. To attain a sound metallurgical structure voids must be closed. Axial compression of dense materials was studied by many investigators due to its practical application in wide range of metal forming process such as extrusion, forging, upsetting and coining. The use of lubrication reduces the degree of barreling and under the conditions of ideal lubrication the bulging or barreling can be reduced to zero. For a given reduction in height powder metal expands lesser amount than does a fully dense metal due to initial material flow into pores. Due to the above reason, the ratio of diameter strain to height strain is always less than 0.50, as described by Iron powder of −150 After the sintering operation the preforms were upset-forged to the different levels of height strain using a 100 The mathematical expressions used and proposed for the determination of various upsetting parameters of upsetting of various stress state conditions are discussed below. According to Eq. Since the ratio of According to According to According to According to Since A new relationship is established for Poisson’s ratio in terms of various densities namely deformed density ( Eq.   The measured barrel radius is plotted against the new parameter according to the theoretically derived Eq.   The relationship between the Poisson’s ratio and the measured barrel radius follows the empirical relationship   The stress value at which changes in slope value observed is found to be different for different stress states namely plane stress and triaxial stress. Straight lines with different slopes have been observed for any given aspect ratio due to changes in the densification pattern during plastic deformation.    The basic conclusions that can be drawn from the present investigations are as below: An exponential relationship is established between the fractional theoretical density ratio The rate of densification is greater for higher aspect ratios. A straight line relationship is established between the fractional theoretical density and the geometrical shape factor. It is established that the barrel radius values are in close proximity with the experimentally determined values. The relationship between the barrel radius and the stress ratio parameter is The relationship between the barrel radius The relationship between the stress ratio parameter in triaxial condition and the fractional theoretical density is established. A straight line relationship is established between these parameters.
