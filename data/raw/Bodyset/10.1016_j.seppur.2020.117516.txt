The management of spent acids containing heavy metals has been traditionally carried out by neutralization-precipitation technologies that often fail to provide the required selectivity for metal recovery. This work proposed a split elution process using H2SO4 and NH4OH solutions to regenerate bispicolylamine-based chelating resins (Puromet™ MTS9600) employed in a previous work to separate nickel and copper from spent sulfuric acid effluents. Operation variables namely S/L ratio, concentration of the regeneration agents and process configuration were analysed to select the best conditions to optimize the metal unloading and their selective recovery in independent solutions. It was found that 43% of nickel was eluted from the resin by H2SO4 2.0 M and recovered with purities of 98% while 47% of copper was desorbed with NH4OH 2.0 M and recovered with purities of 97%. The long-term assessment evidenced that copper removal and metal recovery were not affected after 10 adsorption-regeneration cycles, while the nickel adsorption efficacy decreased about 10%.Over the last decade growing attention has been paid worldwide to the Circular Economy model which aims to provide a more sustainable alternative to the current economic development model consisting of “take, make and dispose” In recent years, ion exchange processes have been successfully employed for heavy metals removal from industrial effluents, especially in the case of acidic solutions Liebenberg and co-workers In this work, the split desorption of nickel and copper from loaded batches of the commercial chelating resin Puromet™ MTS9600 functionalized with bis-PMA groups was carried out. Loaded batches of solid were obtained by contacting the chelating resin with spent sulfuric acid solutions containing nickel (≈ 9.0 g L Sulfate-based spent acids with the composition reported in  Initially, metal-loaded resins were obtained by contacting during 3 h 100 g of fresh resin with 250 mL of spent acid (S/L=1/2.5) at pH = 2.0. pH is controlled and maintained constant with a dynamic pH controller during all the experiment by addition of sodium hydroxide 5.0 M. Stirring rate was controlled at 200 rpm to keep the resin suspended. More details about the experimental system and operation conditions can be found elsewhere The loaded resin was rinsing with ultrapure water and then it was subjected to two in series regeneration stages using H A certain amount of loaded resin (m As depicted in The selective recovery of nickel and copper in sulfuric acid and ammonia regeneration solutions was evaluated through the calculation of the apparent molar fractions of nickel and copper assuming that only these two metals are present: After selecting the best operation conditions (S/L ratio and concentration of regeneration agents) the influence of the order of the regeneration stages on the resin regeneration and metal recovery was analyzed by performing desorption experiments starting with NH This section analyzes the influence of the operation variables namely, type and concentration of the regeneration agent, S/L ratio and number of consecutive desorption steps, on the regeneration of chelating resins. The study aims to identify the most suitable regeneration conditions to: i) restore the initial adsorption capacity of spent resins for further reuse and ii) recover nickel and copper in independent regeneration solutions as secondary sources for metal recovery. Initially loaded resins were produced by contacting the spent acid (see The results reported in On the contrary, copper desorption is strongly affected by the sulfuric acid concentration. The desorption percentages of copper achieved with sulfuric acid 4.0 M are nearly 6 to 8 times higher than those obtained with sulfuric acid 1.0 M for all the S/L ratios (i.e. for S/L=1/10 the desorption percentage of copper raises from 9% to 54% when the acid concentration increases from 1.0 M to 4.0 M). The results obtained in a previous work The desorption results also show that elution of metals improves as the volume of regeneration solution per unit mass of solid increases especially at low acid concentrations. In example, using sulfuric acid 2.0 M (see  The results reported in From the analysis of data reported in From the results reported in After evaluating the efficiency of the desorption process on the resin regeneration, the potential recovery of copper and nickel from the saturated regeneration solutions is evaluated with the objective of compensating the costs of both the separation process and the management of the spent regeneration solutions. The feasibility of metal recovery is strongly affected by metal concentration and purity, therefore the results reported in this section allows selecting the best regeneration conditions to facilitate metal recovery from the regeneration solutions. The results depicted in The results reported in If the desorption efficacy is considered together with the selective recovery of nickel, regeneration with H  The results depicted in As was previously discussed for acid regeneration, the S/L ratio has a strong influence on the copper concentration; the best results were obtained with ammonia 2.0 M which leads to concentrations of copper in the range between 1.7×10 The results previously reported in The analysis of the molar fractions reported in This section evaluates the long-term performance of the regeneration process carried out with sulfuric acid and ammonium hydroxide 2.0 M and a S/L=1/1, which are the best operation conditions in terms of resin regeneration and selective metal recovery. As depicted in Cycle 1 was performed by contacting the fresh resin with the spent acid; cycles 2–10 are conducted by contacting new batches of spent acids with the initial resin subjected to two regeneration steps with H In the first regeneration cycle (cycle 1) a sulfuric acid solution enriched in nickel (x Finally, From the microscopy photographs, it is possible to confirm the spherical shape of the resin and an average diameter lower than 1000 μm as previously reported in section 2.1. From a qualitative point of view, if images (a) and (c) corresponding to fresh and regenerated resins are compared with photograph (b) depicting a loaded resin, it is observed that the resin loaded with nickel and copper acquire a turquoise color, which disappears after regeneration. On the other hand, LIBS spectrum for nickel ( This study was focused on the assessment of the regeneration of commercial chelating resin (Puromet™ MTS9600 functionalized with bis-PMA) groups using H From the point of view of the resin regeneration, it was concluded that H Finally,  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
