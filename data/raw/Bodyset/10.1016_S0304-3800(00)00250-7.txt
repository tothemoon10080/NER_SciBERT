This model was designed to simulate the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) and biomass change of detritus soil food webs after the application of crop residue in agroecosystems. Background data and literature parameters were used to initialize the model and a short-term field experiment was conducted to calibrate the model. Our model is a synthesis and integration of many others’ previous studies because many others’ ideas on food web or SOM modeling were incorporated into our model. In our model, soil microorganisms were considered to be the major decomposers of organic matter with soil animals playing an important role in decomposing organic matter by controlling the population of soil microorganisms through trophic interactions. Though we did not model the soil food web into species or functional groups, we attempted to represent the hierarchical structure and trophic interactions of soil food webs as complete as possible. The whole soil food web was conceptualized as a ‘super organism’ to process organic matter in the model diagram. State variables of our model were categorized into soil organic matter pools, inorganic carbon pool, and soil organism pools. Flows were modeled based on first order kinetics. A tillage effect was introduced in our model by assuming that soil microorganisms, microarthropods and earthworms decrease temporarily immediately after the tillage operation. We also introduced a ‘minimum population’ protection mechanism for each group of soil organisms by assuming that predation ceases when energy obtained can not offset the energy expended in prey-searching and feeding. We found that the simulation outputs fitted the measured data very well, the simulation outputs were in the range of field measurements in most cases. However, there was a significant discrepancy in respiration between simulation output and field measurement in both conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT), particularly in NT agroecosystems. We hypothesized that plant roots should be responsible for this discrepancy. The sensitivity analysis of our model showed that the population of soil microorganisms was controlled by resources rather than predators. However, the populations of soil protozoa, nematodes and microarthropods were controlled by both resources and predators.Soil organic matter (SOM) models have been published since the 1940s ( By synthesizing and integrating many others’ modeling work, we attempted to model and monitor the responses of major groups of soil organisms to the application of crop residues in agroecosystems, and we intended to combine both organic matter and organisms into one model. The emphasis of our model was to trace C flow from crop residue to different levels of soil food webs and to simulate the C distribution in soil food webs during a short period of time. This model was designed to simulate the dynamics of SOM and biomass change of detritus soil food webs after the application of crop residue in agroecosystems. This model was written using modeling software package For a short period simulation, we assumed all forms of organic matter were processed only by soil organisms; any physical and chemical decomposition processes were not considered. Though some soil animals (e.g. earthworms) can process (digest) a certain amount of organic matter, we considered it to be too minor or too complicated to establish separate and direct links between them and organic matter pools. Soil microorganisms were considered to be major decomposers of organic matter, thus all forms of organic matter were transformed by microorganisms directly. Soil animals’ roles in decomposing organic matter operated via controlling the population of soil microorganisms through trophic interactions. In our model, the whole soil food web was conceptualized as a ‘super organism’ to process soil organic matter, so the whole soil food web was enclosed in one box in the model diagram. Consequently, only the generic links between the ‘super organism’ and other soil organic matter and CO  We categorized state variables into organic matter pools, inorganic carbon, and organism pools. Organic pools are split into crop residue or fresh organic matter, labile organic matter, resistant organic matter and inert organic matter. The inorganic carbon pool is cumulative CO For the soil organisms, we only modeled them into generic groups because of our uncertainties about various internal parameters for each individual species or functional groups, but we attempted to represent the hierarchical structure and trophic interactions of soil food webs as much as possible. For example, owing to the technical difficulty and methodological uncertainty of separately measuring the biomass of bacteria and fungi, we modeled them as a generic pool of microorganisms. Soil temperature (°C) and moisture (water potential) are considered to be driving forces in our model. It was reported that when water potential (MOIST) increases from −5.0 to −0.003 MPa, total CO We use the capital ‘R’ as the symbol of flow in our model, and two other lower case letters followed it to specify the flow. For instance, ‘Rtl’ is the flow from soil nematodes to labile organic matter pool, where ‘t’ is taken from the variable ‘TOD’ (nematodes) and ‘l’ is taken from the variable ‘LAB’ (labile OM). Likewise, ‘Rpc’ is the flow from microarthropods (POD) to soil respiration (CO2), and other flows can be easily identified in the appendixes according to this notation. We assumed that the incoming crop residue was added in the system at the end of each growing season but before the next planting. One hundred and eighty days (6 months) was considered to be a growing season, i.e. crop residue was pulse-input to the system twice yearly based on the management of the agroecosystems at our Horseshoe Bend experimental site, Athens, GA. The decomposition of crop residue was modeled based on first-order kinetics, modified by the factors of soil temperature and moisture, which can be expressed as: Similar to PAPRAN ( According to Because the turnover of soil organisms results not only from the natural death caused by unfavorable abiotic conditions but also from the predation by organisms at higher hierarchical levels, this relationship can be expressed as the following equation: Turnover=Predation+Natural death.  Many studies suggest that the density and biomass of soil organisms are significantly different under CT and NT tillage systems (  To calibrate the model, we conducted an experiment at the Horseshoe Bend experimental site near the University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The soil is characterized as a moderately acidic sandy clay loam (Thermic Kanhapludult). The research plots in this experiment consist of six alternating CT and NT plots, collectively occupying ∼0.1 ha.  A sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed for all soil organism compartments (ROB, ZOA, TOD, POD and EW) and the CO Sensitivity analysis ( We also conducted the simulations by removing different groups of soil organisms and top predators (microarthropods or earthworms in our case) from the model. Removal of soil nematodes or protozoa (results not shown), even microarthropods did not have much impact on other organisms. However, removal of earthworms caused a rapid and tremendous increase of soil protozoa, nematodes and microarhropods ( Tillage practices have a significant impact on residue decomposition and population density of soil organisms ( Though several studies suggest that bacterial based soil food webs are dominant in CT systems and fungal based soil food webs are dominant in NT ( In a food web, whether a group is controlled by resources (bottom-up control) or is controlled by its predators (top-down control) has been an argument for decades. We concluded that both top-down and bottom-up control mechanisms might function simultaneously in the same food web and their relative importance switches with the position of a specific organism. The sensitivity analysis of our model showed that soil microorganisms were sensitive to the change of decomposition rate of crop residue but were not sensitive to any change of other groups of soil organisms, which indicated that population of soil microorganisms was controlled by resources rather than predators. However, soil protozoa, nematodes and microarthropods were sensitive to the change of microbial activity and earthworm biomass, which suggested that their populations were controlled by both resources and predators. In our simulation, removal of microarthropods did not have much impact on soil microorganisms, protozoa and nematodes, nor on CO Our model was designed to predict the responses of different groups of soil organisms to the application of crop residue in agroecosystems. In other words, one can estimate the biomass changes of different groups of soil organisms as long as the decomposition rate of residue is known. Our model ran under a dynamic state rather than a steady state. Our working approaches are to initialize the model using background data and literature parameters and to calibrate the model by fitting simulation output to field measurements. Because most of the model parameters were from the literature and some of them might be site specific, validating of the model parameters needs further efforts.
