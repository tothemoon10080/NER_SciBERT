A novel activation flotation method for ilmenite was developed in this study. Pb(NO3)2 was used as an activator to effectively and selectively improve ilmenite flotability. The results of the flotation tests for a massive ilmenite ore sample indicated that, when the dosage of Pb(NO3)2 was 60 g/tonne, ilmenite recovery increased from 65% during conventional flotation to 83% during Pb(NO3)2 activated flotation. The ilmenite concentrate contained 36.6% TiO2.
