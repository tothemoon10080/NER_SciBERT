The effect of mincer plate orifice diameter (2, 5 or 10 mm) on sensory and texture attributes of low-fat (59 g/kg) beefburgers was studied. Proximate analysis of raw and cooked burgers was not affected by degree of comminution. The degree of comminution influenced sensory scores for tenderness, fattiness (P<0.001), meaty flavour, overall appearance (P<0.01), overall acceptability, crumbliness, residual connective tissue, overall flavour and moistness/juiciness (P<0.05). Scores for tenderness, crumbliness and residual connective tissue increased as the degree of comminution increased while the opposite trend was observed for the other characteristics. Warner Bratzler peak force (P<0.01) and energy (P<0.001) and Kramer shear maximum load (P<0.01) and energy (P<0.001) were also affected with higher values for burgers with larger particle size. The degree of comminution did not affect any texture profile analysis parameter. For all sensory and Warner Bratzler attributes no difference was found between burgers minced through plates with orifices of 5 and 10 mm diameter. Finely comminuted burgers were the least acceptable.
