In this letter I report on the preparation of single-crystalline gold nanoparticles, carried out by heating an aqueous solution containing poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)(PDDA) and HAuCl4 in the presence of NaOH. It is found that as-formed gold nanoparticles are primarily dominated by {111} facets.Nanosized particles of noble metals hold promise for use as advanced materials with novel electronic, optical and thermal properties as well as catalytic properties due to their potential applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, material science and their different interdisciplinary fields Polyelectrolytes have been widely used as both building blocks for the creation of multilayer thin films HAuCl UV–vis spectra were collected on a CARY 500 Scan UV–vis–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) spectrophotometer. Samples for TEM characterization were prepared by placing a drop of gold colloidal sample on carbon coated copper grid and drying at room temperature. TEM measurements were made on a JEOL 2010 transmission electron microscopy operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out on a D/Max 2500 V/PC X-ray diffractometer using Cu (40 kV, 200 mA) radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected on an ESCLAB MKII using Mg as the exciting source. The formation of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by UV–vis spectra of the resulting gold solution ( TEM image provides further evidence for the formation of gold nanoparticles, as shown in The crystalline nature of the gold nanoparticles was further confirmed by corresponding XRD of precipitate obtained from centrifuging colloidal gold solution thus formed, as shown in Heating an aqueous solution containing poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)(PDDA) and HAuCl
