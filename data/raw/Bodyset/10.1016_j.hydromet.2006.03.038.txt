The catalytic influence of Sulfolobus metallicus in bioleaching of chalcopyrite at 70 °C and pH 1.7 was characterized from studies of anodic dissolution of a chalcopyrite concentrate at constant potential. Experiments were conducted in iron-free nutrient medium which minimized the influence of jarosites formation on the process. The use of a novel electrochemical technique enabled the simultaneous determination of copper dissolution rate and the number of electrons involved in the dissolution reaction. This experimental approach permitted to monitor the degree of the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and assess its influence on the copper dissolution kinetics.
                  Experimental results showed that in bioleaching of chalcopyrite with S. metallicus there is an efficient process of oxidation of residual sulfur compounds, i.e. sulfur and polysulfides, formed during the chemical dissolution of the sulfide. This oxidative process contributes to a dramatic increase in copper dissolution rate with respect to that obtained in chalcopyrite dissolution under simple indirect bacterial action. Oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds in the presence of S. metallicus involves the participation of a mechanism of chemical catalysis triggered by the presence of dissolved oxygen in solution.Chalcopyrite, the main mineral sulfide present in the world copper reserves, is very refractory to bacterial leaching with mesophiles microorganisms such as The use of The catalytic influence of Some works have reported that The aim of the present work is to study the oxidation of reduced sulfur residues in the bioleaching of chalcopyrite with Experiments were conducted using a − The experiments were conducted in a two-chamber, three-electrode, glass electrochemical cell, thermostatized at 70 °C. The working electrode was made of 1 g of chalcopyrite particles electrically connected to a platinum foil using a conductive carbon tape. This electrode was placed in the main chamber of the cell that was filled with 150 ml of Norris medium. The counter electrode was made with 2 m of 0.5 mm diameter platinum wire, which was made into a roll. This electrode was placed in a 3.5 cm diameter separate glass compartment which was placed on the centre of the cell over the working electrode. This compartment, which was made of a cation Nafion membrane, contained 70 ml of Norris medium. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (satd.) connected to the electrolyte in the main chamber through a Luggin capillary, which ended close to the working electrode (see diagram in Chalcopyrite was anodically dissolved during 8 h at a constant applied potential of 0.7 V (SHE) in Norris basal medium at pH 1.7 and three different conditions: in abiotic conditions under nitrogen, in abiotic aerated solutions and in aerated solutions inoculated with an initial population of 5 When a particle of chalcopyrite is immersed in a leaching solution containing a given concentration of ferric ion, a potential (anodic with respect to its equilibrium potential) is induced on the sulfide which triggers its dissolution. The potential established at each ferric iron concentration, which conceptually corresponds to a corrosion potential, will depend on the kinetics of both the anodic dissolution of chalcopyrite and the reduction of ferric ion on the chalcopyrite surface, and its value can be predicted according to the mixed potential theory. The potential induced on chalcopyrite increases with the concentration of ferric ion, as it is shown in The potential induced on chalcopyrite in a solution with a certain ferric ion concentration, however, can also be experimentally reproduced in an iron-free solution if chalcopyrite is made into an electrode which is electrically connected to a potentiostat. The advantages of the the novel experimental technique used in this work, which is based on the use of this electrochemical approach, are (a) chalcopyrite can be dissolved at constant potential which enables a more accurate analysis of its dissolution kinetics, (b) the simultaneous determination of the anodic charge to sulfide dissolution enables the calculation of the number of electrons involved in the dissolution reaction, which also helps to determine its stoichiometry, (c) working with iron-free solutions helps to minimize the interference of ferric iron precipitates formation on the dissolution process, and (d) an aspect particularly relevant in the present case, this methodology can help to explicitly assess the influence of direct bacterial action on the dissolution process. The results reported in this work focus on the anodic dissolution of chalcopyrite electrodes at a constant potential of 0.7 V (SHE) which is the potential established on a chalcopyrite particle immersed in an oxygen-free solution containing 0.1 M Fe Results of copper and iron dissolution for each experimental condition are presented in In the anodic dissolution of chalcopyrite under nitrogen atmosphere copper dissolution shows the typical parabolic behaviour normally associated to the progressive passivation of this sulfide ( In the anodic dissolution of chalcopyrite in the presence of Total dissolution of copper after 8 h in abiotic aerated solutions increased 82% with respect to the dissolution under nitrogen, while in the presence of On the other hand, total dissolution of iron in abiotic and inoculated aerated solutions increased 143% and 50%, respectively, with respect to the dissolution under nitrogen. The lower increase in iron dissolution observed in the inoculated experiment is consistent with the formation of larger amounts of jarosites in this case. In fact, from data shown in The anodic dissolution of chalcopyrite involves the main following semi-reactions: The relative importance of reaction (2) over reaction (1) increases with an increase in the anodic potential, which shows as an increase in the number of electrons involved In this case chalcopyrite anodically dissolves while simultaneously reacting with protons to form the radical cation H When dissolved oxygen is introduced in the solution the following cathodic semi-reaction can occur on the chalcopyrite surface: To characterise to some extent the involvement of the previous reactions in the chalcopyrite dissolution experiments and to analyze the nature of the influence of  In the experiments conducted in the presence of dissolved oxygen, thermodynamic conditions are apt to trigger also the reduction of oxygen on chalcopyrite (reaction In addition, experiments conducted in presence of dissolved oxygen, either abiotic or biotic, show that the number of electrons increases with respect to the case of inert atmosphere up to steady values of The process of sulfate formation evidenced from the increase in the number of electrons in experiments with aerated solutions, either abiotic or inoculated, is not related to the direct oxidation of chalcopyrite with dissolved oxygen. This reaction would not influence the calculated number of electrons because in this case the electrons released by the sulfide would be directly transferred to oxygen adsorbed on its surface, and are not included in the measured anodic charge Finally, comparison of abiotic and inoculated experiments conducted in aerated solutions show that the presence of In the bioleaching of sulfides the regeneration of ferric ion by the bacterial oxidation of ferrous iron, the so-called indirect action, enables to maintain a high concentration of ferric ion in solution. This is a key catalyzing bacterial mechanism as it helps to maintain an anodic potential on the sulfide sufficient to trigger its dissolution. The anodic dissolution experiment conducted with chalcopyrite at 0.7 V (SHE) under nitrogen simulated well chalcopyrite dissolution under the pure influence of indirect catalytic action of microorganisms, for the particular case in which microorganisms are able to maintain 0.1 M of dissolved iron fully converted into ferric ion. Then the increase in copper leaching rate observed in aerated solutions in the presence of An important consequence of the existence of the catalytic mechanism mediated by the presence of dissolved oxygen is the fact that enables Bioleaching of chalcopyrite with Experimental results showed that in bioleaching of chalcopyrite with Results of the analysis of copper dissolution data according to the shrinking core model showed that chalcopyrite dissolution rate, which is controlled by solid diffusion when anodically dissolved under nitrogen, shifts to chemical control in the presence of The oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds observed in the presence of This work was funded by BHP Billiton and Conicyt Chile under Fondef Project D 00 I 1050.
