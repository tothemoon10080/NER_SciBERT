An unrestrained 36-year-old driver involved in a motor vehicle collision was found in the back seat of his sport utility vehicle. He was brought to our facility after a 20-minute extrication at the scene. The man had sustained a degloving injury to his right lower leg with a compound fracture of his tibia and fibula. The medial wound extended from the proximal third of the tibia down to the ankle. The radiographic image reflects the amount of bone disruption and the obvious comminution of the fibula. Evaluation of soft tissue disturbance proves more difficult. This patient sustained periosteal stripping of the bone, muscle crush, and loss of skin integrity. Aggressive management of these injuries includes emergent debridement of contaminated nonviable soft tissue and bone, pulse lavage irrigation, administration of prophylactic antibiotics, bone stabilization, The patient's initial surgical assessment was performed in the operating room shortly after his arrival at our facility. On day 2 he returned for a collaborative effort between the orthopedist and the plastic surgeon to repair bone and attempt to restore muscle and nerve function. He has been transferred from ICU to the orthopedics floor, where he continues to receive care.
