The use of Ni nanoparticles (NiNPs) as the catalyst for CO Firstly, the authors believe that this discrepancy is because the experimental methodology by It is also observed that the volume of liquid that Ramsden et al. used was 100 cm In the Concerning the settling time of NiNPs in solutions, it was observed that NiNPs can be dispersed in solutions by an ultrasonic horn or in ultrasonic bath ( One additional discrepancy might be the actual size of NiNPs powder. Although NiNPs are obtained from the same supplier as in the work by Bhaduri and Šiller, the actual size distribution of nanoparticles has not been analysed. Sometimes, different batches of nanoparticles, although made with the same method and provided by the same supplier, may have a different size distribution. This can also have an effect on the settling times of nanoparticles in suspension. The average size of NiNPs in the work from Bhaduri and Šiller was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and it is ∼46 nm (see In summary, it is suggested that In addition, Ramsden et al. have not referred to any previous kinetic studies on the hydration of CO The CO Recently, a pH independent kinetic study was done by In conclusion, the authors believe that the claims made by Ramsden et al. are not supported with relevant experimental or simulation data.
