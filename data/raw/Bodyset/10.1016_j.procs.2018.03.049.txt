The judgment document is the carrier of the result of the litigious activity, with complete structure and complete elements. Extracting the information of the entity information of the plaintiff, the defendant, the third party and other litigants in the judgment document is of great significance to establishing the legal dispute view of the litigants, understanding its mutual relations and the economic credit status and providing decision support for enterprise or individual production and business activities. Litigants extraction can be regarded as the named entity recognition problem. The existing open domain entity recognition model is not effective for the entity recognition of such text and canâ€™t meet the application requirements. This paper proposes a new joint named entity recognition method (Joint Method for Litigants Extraction, JMLE), which can make full use of the information of the text itself. By combining the common named entity recognition method, it realizes the efficient information extraction of the litigants in the judgment document without hand-annotated corpus. Experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can achieve a better performance for the information extraction of the litigants in the judgment document, and the F1 value can reach 89.37%.
