The kinetics of microbial ferrous-iron by Leptospirillum ferriphilum was studied at substrate loading rate of 3–90mmolL−1
                     h−1 in a novel packed column bioreactor. The study was conducted with a view to providing an understanding of the reaction kinetics in a flow-through system which may be assumed to mimic bioheap solution flow, rather than the more typical batch reactors. The bioreactor was maintained at pH of 1.45±0.05 and constant air flow rate of 15mLs−1. The Boon and Hansford, and the Monod models accurately described the experimental data. The effect of temperature on the kinetic parameters was investigated at 25, 30 and 35°C. The maximum oxidation rate,

                      revealed that the microbial affinity for ferrous biooxidation increases with increase in jarosite formation. This study reveals that jarosite maybe beneficial to bioleach heaps if it is carefully managed.Heap bioleaching is now an attractive technology for extraction of metals from low-grade ores. It is well known that biooxidation of ferrous-iron (Fe Due to the increasing popularity of heap bioleaching in hydrometallurgical applications, some studies have focused on rapid biooxidation of ferrous-iron in order to improve the leaching rate ( A study conducted in an agitated system by Activation energy of 34.46 ( It is a known fact that low pH solution condition is critical for the activity of iron-oxidising microbes in bioleach processes. However in the context of bioleach heaps, acidic dissolution of gangue minerals may increase the solution pH within a heap bioleach system. Consequently, high ferric iron concentration and high solution pH favours the formation of ferric-iron precipitate (jarosite) within the heap ore bed ( The objective of this study was to investigate the kinetics of ferrous-iron biooxidation in a novel packed-column bioreactor. The feed solution was supplied from the top of the column while the effluent is simultaneously withdrawn from the bottom; the column is aerated from the bottom similar to bioheap system. The effects of temperature and jarosite precipitate on the kinetics were investigated with the view to comparing the kinetics with previous studies and to providing an understanding of the kinetics of this sub-process in bioleach heap systems or at least in the packed column bioreactor. A schematic representation of the experimental rig is shown in Analytical-grade reagents were used for all the experiments. The ferrous-iron media consisted of 5 The novel packed-column bioreactor described in The effect of temperature, on microbial ferrous iron oxidation kinetics, was investigated at 25, 30 and 35 The feed ferrous-iron and the total iron concentrations of both feed and effluent were determined by titration with potassium dichromate solution. The measurement of redox potential using CRISON redox electrodes (Ag/AgCl) allowed the determination of ferric-to-ferrous iron ratio using a suitable calibration curve for the electrode and Nernst equation as described previously ( Various equations have previously been proposed to describe the kinetics of microbial ferrous-iron oxidation. These equations are either Monod type model or their variants, they were developed from the basic enzymatic equation for growth rate based on substrate concentration (reviewed by The rate of microbial ferrous-iron oxidation and the apparent affinity constant were determined from the fit of Eqs. The maximum overall oxidation rate The results of this and previous study by Arrhenius equation was used to assess the effect of temperature on maximum overall oxidation rate, Two separate experiments were carried out in identical column bioreactors to investigate the effect of jarosite/ferric-iron precipitate on the biooxidation of ferrous-iron. In one of the bioreactors, jarosite accumulation was limited by cleaning the bioreactor at the end of each experiment performed at specified residence time, the other was used without cleaning throughout the duration of the experiment in order to allow jarosite accumulation. The trends of microbial ferrous-iron oxidation rate ( Although high conversions were recorded in these experiments; greater that 95% in both cases (i.e. jarosite limited and jarosite accumulated data), it was observed that while jarosite limited experiment approach “washout” at 10 From Eqs.  This study revealed that the microbial ferrous-iron oxidation rate in a packed-column bioreactor can be described accurately with the Monod and the Boon and Hansford equations. The data indicated that the rates obtained from this study were higher than those obtained previously in a continuous stirred tank bioreactor. The maximum overall rate increased with an increase in temperature within the range studied. The affinity constants, for both the Monod and the Boon and Hansford models, increased significantly with an increase in temperature. The value of the activation energy obtained from the Arrhenius equation indicated that the biooxidation reaction is controlled biochemically and by diffusion. The jarosite precipitate that accumulated within the bioreactors served as a support for microbial attachment, thus increasing the rate of biooxidation. The study showed that the precipitates were retained in the bioreactor, and a maximum of 4% for jarosite was obtained from the bioreactor effluent at the dilution rates investigated. The results show that the maximum overall oxidation rate, This project was funded by National Research Foundation (NRF) and University Research Fund (URF) of Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Mr. F.
