The removal of methylene blue (C16H18ClN3S) as a cationic dye which might be rejected in textile industry wastewaters during its production or its use was the main objective in this work. The extraction was performed by an emulsified liquid membrane (ELM) consisting of sorbitan mono-oleate (SPAN80) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as a surfactant and an extractant respectively. The internal phase used was sulphuric acid.
                  Effects of important factors (concentration of H2SO4, stirring velocity, quantities of organic, aqueous, phases, external andemulsified phases, concentrations of extractant and surfactant were studied according to the stability of the ELM. Then using favourable conditions for a good stability of the membrane, the extraction and of methylene blue (MB) froman aqueous solution was investigated. Optimal conditions were then determined and the extraction efficiency reached 98.15%. The desextraction of regenerated this dye was performed at 81.91% and the membrane was
