There are a number of attempts to release and recover the valuable metals from spent refinery catalysts by bioleaching, and the heat pretreatment is widely used to remove the oil-like compounds for better bioleaching performance. However, the irrational selection of high calcinations temperature of 600–800 °C not only resulted in high energy consumption but also might be cause lower bioleaching efficiencies of metals. In this work, Plackett-Burman design was used to optimize the heat treatment process and recognize the significant control factor. Especially, the mechanisms why low calcinations temperature of 400 °C had the best enhancement on the bioleaching performance of spent catalyst were expounded via microcosmic phase change analysis, biochemical leaching process analysis and bioleaching kinetics analysis. The results showed that the calcinations temperature greatly affected the bioleaching performance and the calcinations of 400 °C witnessed the maximum release efficiencies of 94% for Co and 100% for Mo, respectively; whereas poor bioleaching occurred with 200 or 600 °C. Further studies demonstrated the 400 °C-treatment removed the toxic oil-like compounds, excited the growth of cells, transformed refractory Co/Mo sulfides into tractable Co3O4/MoO3, reduced the percent of residual from, enabled more exposure of Co/Mo oxides at catalyst surface, which caused the best bioleaching performance.A great variety of catalysts are broadly used in petroleum refining and petrochemical industries for hydro-cracking, dehydrogenation reforming, hydrogenation and so on. These refinery catalysts muse be replaced due to inactivation after two or three years of operation. Hence, large quantities of spent refinery catalysts are generated around the world ( Due to the strong toxicity of heavy metals contained, the spent refinery catalysts are classified as hazardous wastes and receive stringent supervisions in various countries including USA, EU and China. The spent catalysts are not permitted to export to third country based on Basel Convention ( Currently, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy are two main approaches to recover the valuable metals from spent refinery catalysts. However, the conventional methods have some disadvantages such as high energy cost, great safety risk, strong equipment corrosion and serious second pollution ( In general, both autotrophic acidithiobacillus and heterotrophic funguses are mainly used to extract the valuable metals from spent refinery catalysts ( Various pre-treatment strategies such as heat treatment, mechano–chemical process, chemical oxidation, roasting, acid/alkali treatment and so on, are exploited to promote the accessibility of target metals for subsequent bioleaching to enhance metals release efficiency ( Co The obsolete Co The autotrophic acidophilic bacteria The bioleaching media were obtained by adding both 8.0 g/L of element sulfur and 8.0 g/L of pyrite into the inorganic slat media, which was then subpackaged into 250 mL flasks at a portion of 100 mL per flask. Subsequently, three pure inoculums were respectively inoculated into the media at 3.3% (v/v) for each bacterium, and then the media were incubated in a shaker for fermentation. When the pH value of bioleaching media dropped from the initial 4.0 to below 0.8 after 10–12 days, the crude or treated spent catalysts were added into the media at a pulp density of 5.0% (w/v), followed by re-incubation in the shaker to initiate the bioleaching process of spent catalyst. During bioleaching, the samples were taken regularly to monitor the pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), Fe Three important calcinations factors (temperature, duration time, heating/cooling rate) with two levels (low and high) were choose to optimize the heat pre-treatment process. Different temperatures (200 and 600 °C), duration times (1.0 and 3.0 h) and heat/cool rates (2.0 and 8.0 °C/min) were adopted to thermally treat the spent catalysts. And then the thermal pre-treated spent catalysts were placed into the 10∽12-day-old bioleaching media with pH value below 0.8 at a pulp density of 5.0% to launch the bioleaching. After five days of incubation, the release efficiencies of both Co and Mo from various heat-treated catalysts were assayed and compared. The Plackett-Burman design was used to optimize the heat treatment process and recognize the significant factor which dominated the bioleaching performance of spent catalysts ( Based on the Plackett-Burman design, temperature is the leading calcinations factor to affect the bioleaching efficiencies of both Co and Mo; whereas both duration time and heat/cool rate within the tested ranges had no influence on bioleaching performance. Hence, the extraction behavior of Co and Mo from the different temperature-thermal treated spent catalysts was explored in detail. At 1.0 h of calcinations time and 8.0 °C/min of heat/cool rate, the spent catalyst was thermally treated under various temperatures ranging from 200 to 600 °C. And then the different temperature-thermal treated spent catalysts were transferred into the 10∽12-day-old bioleaching media (pH ≤ 0.8) at a pulp density of 5.0% for bioleaching. During bioleaching, the samples were taken at regular interval to assay the extraction concentrations and extraction efficiencies of both Mo and Co. For revealing the reasons why there were great differences in bioleaching efficiencies of both Co and Mo from the heat pre-treated spent catalyst under various temperatures, especially the reasons why the low-temperature heat pre-treatment at 400 °C displayed the best enhancement on bioleaching, some important bioleaching process parameters including pH, Fe In order to more directly expound the mechanism why the 400 °C-heat treatment most efficiently improved the bioleaching performance of spent catalyst, its weight loss and the removal of organic matter during calcinations was characterized by using TG; and the change of surface morphology of spent catalyst and of valence state and chemical species of both Co and Mo before and after different temperatures-thermal treatment were analyzed and compared using SEM, XPS and BCR. The bioleaching kinetics of both Co and Mo from the 400 °C-thermal treated obsolete catalyst was analyzed by establishing mathematical relationships between the fraction of Co/Mo dissolved and the bioleaching time using various kinetic models according to The pH value was measured using a precise pH meter (Hana HI2221, Italy); the ORP value (Eh) was assayed with a portable ORP meter (Hana HI2213, Italy). The number of cells was gained by directly counting the active planktonic cells in the supernatant which was taken from the bioleaching media after about 30 min of standing, and the slightly mobile active cells was easily distinguished from the other immobile solid residue such as the energy matters and dead cells under a microscope (Olympus IX71, Japan). The total Fe and the extracted concentrations of both Co and Mo were assayed using ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer Optima 8300, USA) after the samples were centrifuged (8000 rpm, 10 min) to remove both the solid matters and bacterial cells. The Fe Although thermal pre-treatment is often adopted to improve bioleaching performance of spent catalysts ( To quantitatively determine the contributions of each thermal treatment factor and recognize the leading factor affecting the bioleaching performance, the corresponding standard effect values of three important parameters on the bioleaching efficiencies of both Co and Mo were calculated according to graphical pareto analysis ( To further elaborate the dominating modes of calcinations temperature on bioleaching performance, the bioleaching behavior of Co/Mo from the heat-treated catalysts under various temperatures from 200 to 600 °C was investigated ( The extraction concentration and release efficiency of Co respectively reached 774 mg/L and 79% after 7 days of contact in the case of raw obsolete catalyst ( Unlike Co, the thermal pretreatment from 200 to 600 °C remarkably enhanced the bioleaching performance of Mo ( For a long time, the thermal pre-treatment of spent catalysts was usually carried out at a much high temperature of 600–800 °C for removing the oil compounds ( In the autotrophic bioleaching media, a large amount of active metabolic product such as H It was observed that the number of cells in bioleaching media sharply dropped from 1.6 × 10 On the other hand, the pH value in both heat-treated groups and the control without treatment went up in different degree, indicating the consumption of acid (biogenic H Besides the biogenic H The possible bioleaching mechanisms for both Co and Mo from the thermal treated catalysts at 400 °C or higher based on the process parameters analysis were presented as followings: It was showed that the extraction of both Co and Mo depends on both Fe In order to deeply explore the mechanism of thermal pre-treatment at 400 °C or higher to enhance the bioleaching efficiencies of both Co and Mo from the spent catalyst, the weight loss of spent catalyst, the transformation of Co/Mo compounds and the change of existence form and valence states of Co/Mo at different temperature-heat treatment were monitored using TG, SEM, BCR and XPS, respectively. The thermogravimetry curve (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry photograph (DSC) were presented in Due to the amorphous structure, XRD method is incapable to recognize the Co/Mo compound in the thermal-treated obsolete catalyst ( The 400 °C-thermal treatment saw more change in the morphology and components of spent catalyst than the 200 °C-heat treatment. On the one hand, more needle-like or rod-like matters representing Co/Mo oxides appeared in the surface of spent catalyst due to the removal of oil organic matters surrounding the catalyst ( In comparison with the 400 °C calcinations, the 600 °C-heat treatment enhanced the formation of Co The existing forms of both Co and Mo in the heat treatment catalysts under altered temperature were analyzed by using BCR procedure and compared with the raw spent catalyst ( However, the heat treatment significantly changed the occurrence modes of Co and Mo, especially the latter, although the variation of occurrence modes highly depended on the temperature. The 200 °C-calcinations did not bring about evident changes of the existence mode of Co and Mo, and the 600 °C-calcinations even caused an increase in the residual form of Co from 8.0% to 34.3%, resulting in the lowest Co bioleaching efficiency of 65% ( The bioleaching process of used catalysts is substantially a heterogeneous solid–liquid reaction initiated by the cells, which includes four sequential steps: (a) the diffusion of the biogenic attacking species from the bulk solution to the reactants; (b) the diffusion of the reactants through the boundary layer; (c) chemical reaction; and (d) the transfer of the resulting products to the bulk solution ( It was observed that the boundary layer diffusion model provided a better fit for the bioleaching of Co and Mo from the raw spent catalyst; whereas the chemical reaction model gave a better fit for Co and Mo bioleaching from the 400 °C-thermal pre-treated catalyst. In most cases, the boundary layer diffusion model fits well the bioleaching of spent catalysts and the chemical reaction is not a limiting step because the presence of undissolved catalyst components or a product layer maybe resist to metals dissolution ( Although thermal pretreatment is the most efficient way to tackle the spent catalyst for better bioleaching performance, an inadequate determination of high calcinations temperature of 600–800 °C not only resulted in high consumption of energy but also might cause low bioleaching of metals because of the shortage of optimization of heat treatment process ( Among the tested three parameters, the temperature was recognized as the leading factor to dominate the bioleaching performance. When the temperature increased from 200 to 400 °C, the bioleaching efficiencies of Co and Mo elevated from 79% to 94% and from 28% to 100%, respectively. However, a higher temperature of 600 °C did not cause higher metals release even lowered Co extraction to 65%. The low temperature heat treatment at 400 °C was the most favorable for bioleaching. The calcinations accelerated a transformation of refractory Co/Mo sulfides into Co/Mo oxides which were released via acidosis by biogenic H With the 400 °C-heating obsolete catalyst, a high cells density remained over the bioleaching period and the Co/Mo oxides were exposed at the surface of catalyst due to the removal of oil organic matters which surrounded the catalyst as covering layer. Meanwhile, the 400 °C-calcinations witnessed a total of 96% and 100% of acid soluble and oxide/hydroxide for Co and Mo, respectively, accounting for the best bioleaching performance which was fitted well by the chemical reaction model.
