Mineral precipitations are a common feature and limitation of initially open, permeable rock fractures by forming sealing structures or secondary roughness in open voids. Hence, the objective of this numerical study is the evaluation of hydraulic properties of fractures sealed by hydrothermally induced needle and compact quartz growth. Phase-field models of progressive syntaxial and idiomorphic quartz growth are implemented into a fluid flow simulation solving the Navier–Stokes equation. Flow simulations for both quartz types indicate an obvious correlation between changes in permeability, fracture properties (e.g. aperture, relative roughness and porosity) and crystal growth behavior, which also forms distinct flow paths. Thus, at lower sealing stages initial fracture permeability significantly drops down for the ‘needle fracture’ forming highly tortuous flow paths, while the ‘compact fracture’ records a considerably smaller loss. Fluid flow in both sealing fractures most widely is governed by a “parallel plate”-like cubic law behavior. However, the ‘needle fracture’ also reveals flow characteristics of a porous media. A semi-theoretical equation is introduced that links geometrical (a
                     
                        m
                     ) with hydraulically effective apertures (a
                     
                        h
                     ) and the relative fracture roughness. For this purpose, a geometry factor α is introduced being α= 2.5 for needle quartz and α= 1.0 for compact quartz growth. In contrast to most common a

                     -relationships this novel formulation not only reveals more precise predictions for the needle (RMSE= 1.5) and the compact fractures (RMSE= 3.2), but also exhibit a larger range of validity concerning the roughness of the ‘needle’ (σ/a

                     = 0–2.4) and the ‘compact fractures’ (σ/a

                     = 0–1.8).In the Earth's crust, rock fractures are responsible for the fluid flow and mass transfer. They can be tectonically or anthropogenically (e.g. excavation damage, hydraulic stimulation) induced and contribute decisively to the permeability of rocks as a benefiting or limiting factor depending on the geoscientific matter. While geoscientific applications such as tunnelling or nuclear waste disposal require best possible fluid tightness of the host rock, particularly reservoir engineering projects (e.g. geothermal energy, hydrocarbons or water supply) aim for permeable pathways facilitating high fluid productivity. In general, fluid flow in fractures relies on miscellaneous hydraulic properties (e.g. roughness, tortuosity or connectivity) that most widely are controlled by the geometry of the fracture and its grade of closure ( In general, H-C couplings can be caused by physicochemical ( In this context, particularly quartz represents the dominating phase in most hydrothermal fluids and therefore facilitates the precipitation of respective mineral modifications in the case of silica supersaturation due to mixing, cooling or depressurisation ( When considering progressive quartz sealing in fractures, most permeability models still maintain parallel plate approaches combined with rate law based kinetic models ( Experiments studying the relation between hydrothermal conditions and quartz growth in fractures are sparse ( Both, compact and needle quartz have in common that the idiomorphic crystals typically require a low degree of silica supersaturation below S According to that, there is a wide range of possible morphologies within sealed or partly sealed fractures that can have an additional effect on the anyway existing inherent roughness of natural fractures. In particular, sealing specific features such as “crystal bridges” ( Hence, the objective of this study is to examine how different grades of sealing affect fracture permeability, assuming two cases with different crystal growth habits. This numerical study is based on a phase-field model introduced by In the past, many numerical methods such as purely kinetic front tracking ( The basic ideas behind PFMs is to introduce an additional, smooth indicator field In The evolution equations for each phase field are derived from Here, a Lagrange multiplier λ establishes the necessary constraint In general, the phase field Nevertheless, it was found that under the given supersaturation and flow conditions the effect of silica depletion in the fluid is very small, so that we can omit the concentration equation and assume a constant supersaturation (  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used to solve and analyse potential fluid flow behavior in the sealing fractures. The qualitative results of the simulations for needle and compact quartz are exemplarily illustrated in The flow in the open (non-solid) regions of the fracture is described for viscous, incompressible fluids and stationary flows. Conservation of momentum ( In The NSE ( In a post-processing step, GeoDict computes the permeability by default according to Darcy's law from the simulated velocity field ( The simulations are carried out for a fluid with the physical properties of water at a temperature of T As mentioned above, an adjusted form of Darcy's law is applied to evaluate the simulated fracture permeabilities. In general, Darcy's law represents a special case of the incompressible, creeping, stationary Stokes equation ( Hence, the CFD code derives the permeability k of the medium by combining However, for each sealing fracture evolving in time a correction for the increasing amount of solid precipitate is required. Based on the assumption of a lateral continuation along the fracture plane fracture flow rather depends on the interstitial velocity Thus, the effective porosity Fluid flow in single fractures most often is approximated by the well-known cubic law (CL) representing the one-dimensional, vertical integration of the Stokes equation ( However, natural fractures typically do not behave like parallel plates with a uniform aperture From the PFM simulation data, the mean aperture can be calculated as the ratio of the integrated overall non-solid volume and the 2D fracture plane (e.g. for needle quartz: width ( Local hydraulic apertures are calculated based on This section is split in three parts, namely in (1) an overview about the global fracture properties and hydraulics, (2) a careful consideration of fracture properties at local scales and (3) the discussion of possible interconnections to global hydraulic properties. Different stages of sealing are represented as a function of dimensionless (numerical) time steps, since this study only focusses on the effect of different fracture geometries and does not consider time-dependent growth kinetics of the crystals. Otherwise, the time steps can be multiplied with t The results of fluid flow simulations show a distinct negative correlation between progressive fracture sealing and permeability evolution ( For both fractures maximum hydraulically effective sealing (less than 1% of initial permeability)is reached when approximately 95% of the fractures are filled with quartz, which for both fractures applies after similar growth intervals (∼7.7 days) ( The initial decrease in permeability is more pronounced for the ‘needle fracture’ than for the ‘compact fracture’ ( The different behaviors in permeability reduction significantly refer to differences in the morphology of the sealing structures due to needle or compact quartz crystallization. Compact quartz typically forms contiguous growth fronts growing against each other resembling two rough fracture walls that are closed mechanically. This growth behavior is also reflected by the initially slow decrease in permeability and the abrupt drop once both growth fronts meet each other where most voids are rapidly closed ( The fact that the ‘needle fracture’ rather resembles a porous medium is not only represented qualitatively e.g. by Based on this, the KC equation ( Before considering hydraulic properties as commonly used area-related averaged (global) values, the local hydraulic fracture properties are carefully discussed. This is important, since fluid flow strongly depends on the spatial distribution and correlation of aperture sizes ( For this reason, the 2D spatial distributions of the local apertures (SDA) ( The results indicate that the flow behavior within both fractures significantly depends on local apertures und related flow paths and thus is directly related to the crystal habit of the sealing phase. In the case of needle quartz ( For the ‘compact fracture’ bridging most widely occurs only towards the end of the sealing process being in accordance with (nearly) simultaneous coalescence of the growth fronts as discussed in Accordingly, ASDs of the local geometrical and hydraulically effective apertures ( The results for mean ( Considering the increasing deviations of This friction factor must be one ( However, According to By fitting both curves of the fractures Calculated hydraulic apertures ( Typically, values for the friction factors ( For comparison and demonstration of the new equation ( The equation introduced in this study ( Precipitation of mineral phases can play an important role particularly for the engineering of naturally fractured rock formations. This issue is unambiguous and easy to handle for completely sealed fractures, where preferential flow paths are clogged and form non-permeable hydraulic barriers ( Fortunately, A numerical study is presented to determine hydraulic properties for fractures under two types of fracture sealing, which both typically occur in natural rock fractures: needle and compact quartz growth. The simulations are performed by applying a phase-field model of syntaxial and idiomorphic quartz growth into a fluid flow simulation solving the Navier-Stokes equation. The results provide insights into different sealing stages and consequent changes in permeability. The main conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: Permeabilities of partially sealed fracture significantly depend on the crystal growth behavior evolving in the fracture voids. Due to the significant impact on the tortuosity of fracture flow - especially at lower sealing stages and even at identical relative sealing - the drop of fracture permeability K is particularly pronounced for the ‘needle fracture’ compared to the ‘compact fracture’. The simulations indicate that fracture flow in ‘compact fractures’ most widely is governed by the cubic law. Fluid flow in ‘needle fractures’ can be described by both, the cubic law and the Kozeny-Carman equation. The latter is caused by the capillary tubes structures made up by the isolated crystal growth that resembles a porous medium. Typical structures evolving in the ‘needle fracture’ are crystal bridges. Results of this study provide further indications how such bridges in natural fractures can affect fluid flow behavior in the case of geoscientific utilization. A semi-theoretical equation ( In contrast to most common  In this study, only pure quartz sealing within a fracture idealized by two parallel plates is considered. Future studies are encouraged to conduct simulations starting with rough initial fracture surfaces or adapt the model to additional prominent fracture sealings such as calcite or sulphide mineralization ( This study was supported by the
