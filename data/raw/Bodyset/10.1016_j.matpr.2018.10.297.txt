A 3-D Finite element, thermo-mechanical model of three rolls staggered flow forming was developed by using Abaqus/explicit. The simulation was validated for roll forces and thickness reduction against analytical solutions and the experimental results respectively. The simulation results were useful to study the state variables such as stress and strain distribution during the flow-forming process. The validated model was further utilized to study the effect of various process parameters such as reduction ratio and feed rate on the stress/strain distribution
