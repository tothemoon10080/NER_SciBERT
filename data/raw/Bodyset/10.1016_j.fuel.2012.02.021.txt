The fuels included a baseline ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) and a B40 (v/v) blend of a soybean methyl ester (SME)-based biodiesel and ULSD. Single fuel injections at start of injection timings over a range from 9° before to 3° after top dead center with different fuel injection pressures were investigated. It is found that at all load conditions, an increase of fuel injection pressure significantly increases NO

                      emissions. For particulate matter emissions, it is found that an increase of fuel injection pressure decreases PM emissions for all load conditions. Meanwhile, biodiesel fueling has a more significant effect on PM emissions at low load and a less significant effect at moderate to high load. For an engine running with early SOI (highest brake fuel conversion efficiency in this work), a decrease of fuel injection pressure can counter the biodiesel NO

                      effect while maintaining a similar or even lower level of PM emissions as ULSD. Both biodiesel fueling and the change of fuel injection pressure did not significantly affect the brake fuel conversion efficiency, but retarding the start of injection appears to decrease it. Apparent heat release analysis shows a faster and higher heat release peak with higher fuel injection pressure. With biodiesel fueling, an earlier of start of combustion can be observed for low load, but no significant difference in combustion phasing can be observed at moderate to high loads. A fuel spray, mixture stoichiometry field and lift-off length model was employed.

Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation of Engine tests were performed with an 8-cylinder 6.4 The test fuels include a baseline ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD) and a mixture blended with 40% v/v biodiesel (B40), which is a soybean methyl ester (SME) – based biodiesel obtained from Peter Cremer, L.P. A higher blend than that of the more commonly used B20 (20% v/v) is to increase the difference in the comparison with the baseline diesel fuel. To simplify the problem of exploring the relationship between injection strategy, biodiesel fueling, NO Three load conditions, 25%, 50% and 75% of maximum engine torque, were investigated in this work. At each load condition, three fuel injection pressures were studied: as calibrated, 20% lower and 20% higher. The three fuel injection pressures at each load condition were fixed regardless of SOI since the impact from injection timing on fuel injection pressure was not significant. For instance, at 50% load the fuel injection pressures investigated were 72 The exhaust gases went through a heated filter and a heated sample line, both held at 190 PM emissions were sampled through a Sierra Instruments BG-3 micro-dilution tunnel using a dilution ratio of 10:1 at a total flow rate of 75 cubic liter per minute (SLPM) and a sample flow rate of 7.5 SLPM for 5    Overall, the impact of SOI, fuel injection pressure and biodiesel on NO The level of particulate matter emissions is also an important concern for diesel engines.  An important evaluation of diesel engine emissions is obtained by comparing the NO  From the previous NO Overall, for the case at early SOI timing, decreasing the fuel injection pressure for biodiesel is an effective way to circumvent the biodiesel NO The brake fuel conversion efficiency investigated here is the percentage of fuel energy that is converted into engine brake energy. The same trend has also been observed for higher load. No significant difference in brake fuel conversion efficiency from the variation of fuel injection pressure and biodiesel fueling, and higher brake fuel conversion efficiency can only be observed with early SOI. For a modern engine which intends to run at a high fuel conversion efficiency, the biodiesel NO The apparent heat release profile can provide valuable information about combustion phasing. When the fuel is injected before TDC, the apparent heat release profiles are similar with the same fuel injection pressure regardless of SOI, i.e., a similar highest heat release rate with a noisy long tail. However, significant differences can be observed for the fuel injected after TDC. At the same fuel injection pressure, the maximum heat release rate of fuel with an SOI after TDC is apparently higher than those with an SOI before TDC. Furthermore, the “tail” after the main combustion event is also smaller than those with SOI before TDC. These observations suggest that the fraction of premixed combustion of fuel with a SOI after TDC is higher than those with the SOI before TDC. This can be explained in that the decreasing in-cylinder temperature and pressure due to piston motion during expansion stroke can prolong the ignition delay, resulting in longer time for premixing.    As discussed in the introduction, Mueller et al.   Overall, in this work the validity of the observation by Ye and Boehman To probe the impact of SOI, one can construct plots of slope – SOI and Therefore, it is possible to establish a general form of an equation to describe the relation between NO At 25% load At 50% load At 75% load In a compression ignition direct injection engine, the control of injection strategy, i.e., varying the start of injection and fuel injection pressure, is an effective way to control engine NO Meanwhile, the impacts of injection strategy and biodiesel fueling on PM emissions strongly depend on the engine load condition. At low load condition, both the increase of fuel injection pressure and biodiesel fueling can significantly reduce PM emissions. However, at moderate to high load conditions, the biodiesel fueling has a less significant impact on PM emissions. No significant difference in brake fuel conversion efficiency is observed with biodiesel fueling or change of fuel injection pressure. However, it is observed that retarding start of injection can reduce the brake fuel conversion efficiency. The highest brake fuel conversion efficiency in this work has been observed at SOI between 9° and 5° before top dead center. In addition, the NO The heat release analysis shows that, for all load conditions, retarding the start of injection after top dead center can increase the fraction of premixed combustion. At the same SOI, higher fuel injection pressure leads to higher apparent heat release rate and a slightly earlier start of combustion (SOC) due to the better mixing of fuel and air. At low load conditions, biodiesel fueling can advance the SOC and decrease the premixed heat release. At moderate to high loads, however, biodiesel fueling does not have a significant impact on the heat release profile. Therefore in this study, combustion phasing is not a primary factor that contributes to the biodiesel NO In the condition of this experiment (moderate speed, single injection), we confirm that the key factor that determines the NO The authors wish to express their gratitude to Katherine Richard of Infineum USA L.P. and Stuart McTavish of Infineum UK Ltd. for their support of this work.
