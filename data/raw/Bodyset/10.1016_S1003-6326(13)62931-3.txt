A formula was proposed to calculate the distribution of metal ions quantitatively in chemical reaction system forming hydroxide where precipitation and complex are formed together. The effects of some factors on formation of precipitation and complex were investigated, and the corresponding precipitation rates of zinc, iron (III), aluminum, copper and magnesium were calculated. As a result, it shows that the proposed formula is reliable. By the proposed formula, the existence state of metal ions in hydroxides reaction system with any metal ions can be well described and the effects of some factors on the distribution of metal ions were determined.
