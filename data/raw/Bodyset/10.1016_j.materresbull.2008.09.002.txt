Peanut-shaped CaCO3 aggregates, featured of two dandelion-like heads built up from rod-like subunits, have been synthesized via a facile precipitation reaction between Na2CO3 and CaCl2 at ambient temperature in the presence of magnesium ions and ethanol solvent. The as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results show that a high magnesium concentration and ethanol solvent are necessary for the formation of the unusual peanut-like aggregates. In addition, a multistep phase transformation process from amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to a mixture of ACC and calcite and ultimately to calcite and aragonite was observed in the formation process of the unusual structures. A possible mechanism for the formation of the unusual peanut-shape aggregates has been proposed and discussed.In recent years, material synthesis that mimics mineralization process of biominerals in organic systems such as calcium carbonate, magnetic iron oxide, and amorphous silica of exquisite morphology with structural and functional value, has attracted more and more attention The transformation of vaterite or aragonite into calcite has been well studied In a typical synthesis, the solutions of CaCl The morphology of the as-prepared CaCO   On the basis of the above experimental results, a possible mechanism for the formation of the peanut-like aggregates is proposed and can be simply described in To confirm the effect of magnesium ions in the reaction system, the controlled experiment was carried out in the absence of magnesium ions. As shown in In addition, we have also investigated the role of ethanol in the formation of the unusual peanut-like CaCO In summary, peanut-shaped CaCO This work was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (50625208 and 20773097).
