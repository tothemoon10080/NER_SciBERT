Three kinds of modified expanded graphite (EG), impregnated with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (P-EG), impregnated with glucose (G-EG), and impregnated with H3PO4 and glucose (G-P-EG), were prepared under a low temperature (150Â°C). The adsorption capacity of G-P-EG (Q
                     m
                     =7.016mg/g) is much higher than original expanded graphite (EG Q
                     m
                     =0.423mg/g) and other two kinds of modified expanded graphite (P-EG Q

                     =0.770mg/g; G-EG Q
                     m
                     =0.507mg/g). The physicochemical properties of EG and G-P-EG were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption, Boehm's titration and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). EG exhibited higher values of BET surface area (11.357m2/g) and total pore volume (0.0303cm3/g) than that of G-P-EG (4.808m3/g and 0.0109cm3/g). However, the results of Bohm's titration and XPS showed that G-P-EG contained more surface oxygen-containing functional groups. The Ni(II) adsorption equilibrium data agreed well with the Langmuir model. And the experimental data of EG and G-P-EG fitted better by pseudo-second order model. Based on the results of batch adsorption experiments and XPS analysis, there were several possible mechanisms for Ni(II) adsorption on the G-P-EG, including chemical adsorption, cation exchange, electrostatic attraction and surface complication.Heavy metal pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems today The common heavy metal wastewater treatment techniques include chemical precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, membrane filtration, coagulation and flocculation, flotation and electrochemical treatment Expanded graphite (EG), also known as exfoliated graphite Phosphoric acid (H In the present work, glucose and H EG used for preparing the modified expanded graphite was supplied by Nanjing Graphite Carbon Materials Company (Nanjing, China). According to the instructions provided by the manufacturer, expanded graphite is gained by crushing graphite worms, which are formed by instantaneous expansion of acidification graphite under 900 The dosages and conditions of the modified expanded graphite are presented in Surface area and pore characteristics of adsorbents EG and G-P-EG were determined from N The point of zero charge (pH The concentrations of several acidic and basic functional groups on the surface of EG and G-P-EG were determined by the Boehm titration method The batch adsorption experiments were studied to investigate the adsorption capacity and the effects of experimental parameters on the adsorption, including pH, initial concentration and ions strength. A set of 150 Adsorption kinetic experiments were performed to investigate the effect of agitation time on the adsorption and to deduce the kinetic parameters. The experiments were carried out in 1 The ionic strengths of the experimental solutions were adjusted using sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions. 0.1 The recorded data were used to calculate the adsorption capacity ( To identify the adsorption capacity of the four kinds of adsorbents, adsorption experiments were taken, with 10 Pore structure is an important parameter for adsorbents. The N The SEM micrographs and XRD patterns of EG and G-P-EG are shown in The identity and quantity of functional groups on the surface of adsorbents play an important role in the adsorption process. Two important isotherms, the Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm, are applied to this study. Adsorption isotherms can describe the interaction between adsorbates and adsorbents and provide parameters, from which the information of the adsorbent and mechanisms of adsorption are investigated. The Langmuir isotherm Freundlich isotherm Adsorption isotherms of Ni(II) on the two different adsorbents fit by the two isotherm models are displayed in The adsorption kinetics usually are used to describe the solute uptake rate on the adsorbent and possible mechanism of adsorption. Two kinetic models, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order, are applied to the experimental data to analyze the adsorption kinetics of EG and G-P-EG. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model can be represented as follow The pseudo-second-order kinetic model can take the following form The two kinetic models were applied to the experimental data and the result was showed in The calculated pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic parameters and correlating coefficient are listed in From The pH of the solution is considered to be one of the most important parameters relating to the uptake of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution The effect of ionic strength is usually used to distinguish non-specific and specific adsorption According to the results above, G-P-EG, with less  The XPS survey spectra of G-P-EG before and after nickel adsorption and Ni 2p Based on the above discussion, G-P-EG contains more acidic and oxygen-containing surface functional groups, which leads to more stronger electrostatic attraction, more sites for ion exchange, as well as more surface complexation sites.
