An investigation was undertaken to determine the kinetics of gasification of coal-chars (pulverized) derived from typical South African inertinite-rich (high-ash) coals involving char reactions with carbon dioxide and steam and the effects of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The chars used were characterized with respect to structural, chemical, mineralogical and petrographic (maceral content) properties and gasification experiments were conducted in a TGA at atmospheric pressure with different gas mixtures within a temperature range of 1073–1223K. The shrinking core model with a controlling surface reaction was shown to be applicable for the gasification of pulverized coal-chars consisting of essentially of carbon-rich particles. The validity of this model can be attributed to the core having an exceptional low porosity (high inertinite parent coal) and consequently negligible penetration of the gases. It was found that the gasification intrinsic reaction rates could be adequately described by Langmuir–Hinshelwood type rate equations and that established equations have been validated with corresponding constants according to new data processing procedures. It was found that the reaction rate constants for coal-chars derived from inertinite-rich (76–80%) coal discards were different to results published in the literature and that the intrinsic reaction rates differed only slightly (order of magnitude) for coal-chars with similar maceral (inertinite) compositions and different total ash contents. The marked inhibiting effect of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen on the carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide and steam/hydrogen gasification reactions is shown and relevant constants are reported. Experiments were done and models evaluated for a multi-component gasification mixture consisting of a feed mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam and hydrogen. Reaction constants determined with results from binary mixtures were used to predict results and it was found that the overall rate is best described with the assumption that the important reactions proceed on separate sites.free carbon site pore diameter, Å activation energy for reaction (forward) structure factor, m Eq. adsorption enthalpy for carbon dioxide, kJ adsorption enthalpy for steam, kJ specific rate constants of mechanistic reactions, ms specific rate constants of mechanistic reactions, ms reaction rate constant for reaction (forward) pre-exponential factor for adsorption constant for component pre-exponential factor for component partial pressure of component general reaction rate, m reaction rate for carbon dioxide gasification, m reaction rate for steam gasification, m reaction rate for multi-component gasification, m calculated initial particle surface area, m temperature, K time, s fractional conversion of carbon initial porosity The advantages of fluidised bed gasification using poor quality coal feed stocks (high sulphur content and low calorific value) are well known The well-known shrinking core model is considered by Bhatia and Gupta Langmuir–Hinshelwood reaction rate equations have been derived and successfully evaluated by many investigators for the gasification of coal-char with both carbon dioxide and steam An investigation was undertaken to determine the reaction rate kinetics for gasification of coal-chars, prepared from readily available South Africa discards in order to develop a process model for circulating fluidised bed gasification (CFBG). The coal-chars used were the same as those used for an investigation involving combustion, the results of which have been reported in another publication The coal-chars used were prepared by heating the parent coal in an atmosphere of flowing nitrogen at 973 The thermogravimetric analyser used was a TGA 951 model supplied by Du Pont Instruments Company (USA), which could handle essentially powders at atmospheric pressure up to 1500 Experiments were performed to illustrate the relative reactivities of the coal-chars with pure carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen and a 18% steam in nitrogen mixture over a temperature range of 573–1273 Overall reaction rate models were evaluated using isothermal reaction experimental results obtained at atmospheric pressure within the temperature range 1073–1223 In order to evaluate this model with experimental results the following procedure was adopted. Eq. After separation of variables and integration the following is obtained: Thus, a linear plot of A reaction rate equation (LH) applicable to low pressures also  Almost all published results In order to evaluate the parameters for the intrinsic reaction rate ( The determination of the structure factor Linear plots were obtained at temperatures ranging from 1073 to 1223 A comparison between reactivity experiments with mixtures of carbon dioxide with nitrogen (inert) and carbon dioxide with carbon monoxide at 1173 A comparison of the results obtained in this investigation with published results are also shown in The procedure followed for evaluation of the overall reaction rate model for the gasification with steam without and with hydrogen was the same as that for the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide mixtures described above. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood-type reaction rate equation used by many other investigators also  Again almost all published results Results from experiments without hydrogen showing the validity of the shrinking core model, Eq. Results from experiments in the presence of hydrogen and a comparison with a corresponding experiment without hydrogen are shown in The activation energies ( Experiments were carried out with a mixture consisting of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, steam and hydrogen (equilibrium gas composition) at 1173   The gasification of coal-chars derived from typical South African discards with carbon dioxide and steam was studied between 1073 and 1223 Intrinsic reaction rate constants were evaluated and it was found that on comparing with published results that these results are somewhat different (especially for carbon dioxide) which is attributed to the different chemical structure of the coal-chars surfaces formed from the inertinite rich coals. The effect of the minerals on the reaction rates was found to be minimal when the results are compared for two chars with different mineral contents and derived from coals with the same inertinite concentration. The intrinsic reaction rate equations involving steam predicted higher reaction rates than the corresponding equations involving carbon dioxide gasification and these rates decreased significantly in the presence of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide, respectively. For both gasification reactions (carbon dioxide and steam) occurring simultaneously in the presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the overall reaction rate is best described with the assumption that the reactions proceed on separate sites.
