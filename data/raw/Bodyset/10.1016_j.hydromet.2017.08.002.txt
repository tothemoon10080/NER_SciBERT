This paper investigated the efficient extraction of rhenium from the leach solution generated by roasting the copper concentrates in a copper smelting plant by direct ion exchange process using weak base resins. The adsorption behaviors of rhenium with other coexisting impurity ions belonged to kinetic control by particle diffusion process, and the reaction rate constant was calculated. Then, the influences of temperature, pH value, stirring rate and calcium oxide dosage on the equilibrium adsorption capacity of rhenium were studied by batch experiments. To verify the process of extracting rhenium in industrial application, three ion exchange columns packing with 105L resins were operated to recover rhenium by direct ion exchange method. In the adsorption process, the recovery rate of rhenium reached 97.13% after approximately 960BVs of leach solution flow. The loaded resins were eluated using 2.5% concentration of aqueous ammonia, producing a rhenium-rich solution containing 1995mg/L rhenium, in which the rhenium concentration enriched 309 times compared to the original leach solution.Rhenium is a silver-white transitions metal with the second highest melting point of any metal in periodic table. In the aerospace industry, rhenium is an indispensable component in the nickel superalloys for the production of turbine engine ( Most of rhenium deposits in molybdenum‑copper ores with concentrations of up to 0.2% as ReS The purpose of this paper is to provide useful information for developing more efficient and economical technology of recovering rhenium from the copper leach solution in industrial application. The weak base anion exchange resins were chosen to selectively recovery rhenium from the low-grade leach solution of copper smelting process. Firstly, the kinetics properties of the adsorption process were investigated and the limiting step of rhenium adsorption process was determined. Then, the ability of the adsorbents to recovery rhenium was investigated as a function of temperature, initial solution pH, stirring rate and CaO dosage by batch technique in detail. Finally, the continuous tests with columns on adsorption and desorption properties of rhenium in leach solution were carried out in industrial scale. The rhenium stock leach solution was provided by one of the copper smelters in China. The results of the chemical analysis for the leach solution were given in It can be seen that the rhenium was dissolved in the leach solution as 5.74 The main parameters of the weak base anion exchange resins were listed in A predetermined volume of the leach solution was charged to a conical flask and heated to a specific temperature while being magnetically stirred at a speed of 200 The kinetics experiments of rhenium adsorption were carried out by adding 1 The effect of temperature was conducted by adding 1 For initial pH value of untreated leach solution was 0.94, four conical flasks were filled with 250 The effect of stirring rates was conducted by adding 1 Different amounts of CaO were added to six conical flasks with 250 Following the batch experiments, pilot-scale continuous tests with columns were carried out in a copper smelting plant in China to evaluate the application of weak base resins for recovering rhenium from low-grade rhenium containing leach solution. Three ion exchange columns were consecutively operated for conducting the continuous tests with columns. The columns were fabricated of polymethyl methacrylate (inner diameter is 300 The concentrations of metal ions in the leach solution, the effluent and the eluate solution were measured by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (Intrepid II XSP, Thermo Electron, USA). The pH of the solution was measured by S210 (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) pH meter, while FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 (Thermo Electron, USA) FTIR spectrophotometer. The investigations of kinetics properties for adsorbing Re are significant as it offers valuable insight into the reaction pathways and reveals the limiting step of the adsorption process ( The concentration profiles of Re and As during adsorption process were shown in Comparison of the Re adsorption process in the leach solution, the As concentration almost kept constant over the whole reaction time except a slight decrease in initial time. Thus, it is evident that As is not practically adsorbed on the resins while Re exhibits excellent kinetics properties in the adsorption process. The adsorption process of ReO The rate controlling process was determined by fitting the evaluated data, and the data-fitting curves of the three processes were shown in For weak base ion exchange resins, the low-cost aqueous ammonia solution was extremely effective for the desorption process, and the fast kinetics associated with the Re desorption were confirmed by desorption curves at different ammonia concentrations shown in To explain the mechanism of adsorption and desorption, the FTIR spectrophotometric observation of the resins surface in the range of 400–4000 The adsorption behavior of Re at varying temperature in the range of 293–323 The pH values have substantial effect on rhenium adsorption degree of the resins and the summarized results are shown in Although the adsorption process of rhenium at pH The effect of the stirring rate on Re adsorption properties was carried out at different stirring rates 100, 150, 200 and 250 The leach solution contains large amounts of anions, especially the amount of S reaches over 90 To ascertain the effect of the concentration of sulfate ions on adsorption properties of rhenium, the adsorption process was taken by adding different CaO dosages for investigation. As shown in To verify the process of recovering rhenium in industrial application, the continuous tests with columns in pilot-scale were implemented for recovering rhenium by direct ion exchange method using weak base ion exchange resins, omitting the neutralization process of the leach solution. In this experiment, three columns packing with 105 The rhenium concentration in copper smelting plant ranged from 5 to 8 In order to evaluate the effect of arsenate ions on the adsorption properties of Re in the continuous tests with columns, the As concentration in the leach solution and effluent for 1 As explained earlier, the arsenic concentration in the leach solution is several thousands folds higher than that of rhenium, but its adsorption capacity as observed in After saturation with rhenium, the resins in 1 The main chemical compositions of eluant solution were shown in The elution curve for Re shown in The elution profiles of As and S with 2.5% concentration of aqueous ammonia were shown in The continuous tests with columns confirm the fact that the rhenium could be efficiently adsorbed on the resins from actual leach solution for copper smelting plant. Furthermore, the loaded rhenium could be completely desorbed by low-cost aqueous ammonia solution. All of the abovementioned results demonstrate that the process can efficiently recover rhenium from the leach solution in industrial application. From the results of this study, the following conclusions could be drawn: The adsorption process of rhenium was controlled by the particle diffusion process, and the reaction rate constant was calculated as 9.86 By optimizing the process conditions of the ion exchange process, the optimal conditions for adsorbing rhenium were temperature 293 In the continuous tests with columns for industrial application, the recovery rate of rhenium reached 97.13% after approximately 960 The authors express sincere thanks to the NSFC (
