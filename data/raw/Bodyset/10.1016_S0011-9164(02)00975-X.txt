Facilitated transport of silver and copper from cyanide solutions through a supported liquid membrane (SLM) containing K+-crown ether as a carrier is described. The SLM used is a thin porous polypropylene (Celgard 2500, 2400) membrane impregnated with dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6), diaza-18-crown-6 (DA18C6), hexathia-18- crown-6 (HT18C6) and hexaaza-18-crown-6 (HA18C6) dissolved in a mixture of ethanol/chloroform (v/v).
