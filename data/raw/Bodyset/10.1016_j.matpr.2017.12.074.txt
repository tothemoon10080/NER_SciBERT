Material removal rate play important role manufacturing industry especially in areas of mass production. This paper deals the effect of input parameter such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on material removal rate. The turning operation is carried on AISI 321 Austenitic Stainless Steel with CVD and PVD coated tool. The objective is to optimize the cutting parameter for maximizing material removal rate using Taguchi method. The optimum cutting parameters obtained are cutting speed at 80 m/min, feed rate at 0.2 mm/rev and depth of cut at 1 mm in case of both CVD and PVD coated tool. Material removal rate is predicted using regression model. The influence of cutting parameters on material removal rate is characterized using analysis of variance. 3D surface plots demonstrate the effect of change in cutting parameter on material removal rate. The validation experiments are performed at optimum cutting conditions to evaluate effectiveness of the technique.
