Differential strain rate compression tests were conducted to study flow behavior of hot rolled Al–5wt% B4C composite as a function of sample orientation (longitudinal and transverse) over the temperature and strain rate ranges of 25–500°C and 10−4 to 1s−1, respectively. The longitudinal samples are found to show lower flow stress than that shown by the transverse samples in the temperature range of 25–200°C. The reverse becomes true at higher temperatures of 300–500°C. The values of stress exponent (n) and activation energy for deformation (Q), based on applied stress, ranged from 10 to 46 and 307–416kJ/mol, respectively. However, by considering effective stress, these values were reduced to n

However, the strength obtained by alloying is limited to lower temperatures whereas the dispersion of inert hard particles helps in getting high strength not only at low temperature but also retaining it at high temperature. Several aluminum matrix composites have been developed for a wide range of applications with reinforcements of SiC, TiC, Al The inert particles in soft matrix hinder dislocation motion and cause high strength and better creep resistance of such reinforced materials at elevated temperatures Aluminum–5 Differential strain rate compression tests were carried out with Zwick-Roell Amsler Universal Testing Machine of 100 Morphology of boron carbide particles and the size distribution were characterised using Hitachi S-3400 model scanning electron microscope (SEM) operating at 15 The morphology and X-Ray Diffractogram plot of as-received boron carbide (B   As-rolled microstructure may undergo some changes in the course of compression test (differential strain rate test) used in the present work, especially, at high temperature. Although no systematic work in this respect was done, the microstuctural evolution upon completion of differential strain rate test was examined by EBSD in the samples tested at 500  Elongated grains of Along with the variation in sample orientation,  From the plot of flow stress as a function of temperature for various grain sizes, it is known that, at some intermediate temperature, there exists no difference in strengths of grain boundaries and grain interior and the strength for various grain sizes become comparable  The data points in The high apparent stress exponent values were commonly attributed to presence of threshold stress ( It is reported Normally the The threshold stresses are noted to decrease with increase in test temperature as shown in Activation energy ( However, these values of Differential strain rate compression tests along the longitudinal and transverse directions of Al–5% B Stress–strain curves obtained from differential strain rate tests exhibit higher flow stress in transverse direction than that in longitudinal direction in the temperature range of 25–200 Based on applied stress, the stress exponent for deformation is noted to vary from 10 to 46, depending on sample orientation, strain rate range and test temperature. However, by consideration of effective stress, all these values reduce to ∼5. Threshold stress reduces from a high value of ∼70–10 Based on effective stress, the activation energy for deformation is found to be 126–190 We would like to thank the Department of Science and Technology, India, for funding under FIST program SR/FST/ETII–054/2000 for purchase of Universal Testing Machine.
