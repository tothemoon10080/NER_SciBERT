An immobilized superparamagnetic nanocomposite comprising γ-Fe2O3 and activated carbon was synthesized via a facile thermal decomposition route. To prepare the magnetically functionalized nanocomposite, treated activated carbon (TAC) loaded with lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) nanoparticles (MAC-1) was first produced via a wet chemical method. Then magnetic activated carbon (AC/γ-Fe2O3, MAC-2) was fabricated by thermal decomposition of MAC-1 at 250°C under argon gas for 1h. Characterization analyses confirmed that superparamagnetic spherical maghemite nanoparticles of 21±2nm in size were homogeneously dispersed on the TAC. The specific surface area was 643.8m2
                     g−1 for TAC, 289m2
                     g−1 for MAC-1, and 303.5m2
                     g−1 for MAC-2. The industrially friendly nanocomposite was applied as an adsorbent for pollutant removal from aqueous solution.Activated carbon and other carbon-related materials are considered to be among the most economical materials for removal of a wide range of pollutants from water Activated carbon with a specific surface area of 643.8 The synthesis protocol presented here could be superior to others Activated carbon powder was impregnated with 4 To synthesize the precursor, approximately 5 The MAC-1 precursor was calcined at 250 The crystalline structure of TAC, MAC-1, and MAC-2 samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Philips X’pert-MPD system, Cu K XRD patterns for TAC, MAC-1, and MAC-2 are shown in The XRD pattern for MAC-2 has distinctive peaks corresponding to the cubic spinel structure related to pure maghemite ( To investigate the structural nature of TAC and MAC-2, FT-IR spectra were recorded ( Values for the BET surface area and average pore diameter are listed in  MCA-2 was regenerated in a cylindrical vessel (50  Furthermore, two-dimensional X-ray mapping of selected MAC-2 zones was carried out to investigate the distribution of Fe, O, and C elements in the composite ( EDS analysis of MAC-2 revealed that Fe, O, and C were the main elemental constituents, confirming the purity of the nanocomposite ( After washing with nitric acid, the activated carbon was dried at 55  We described a facile, low-cost route for successful synthesis of a magnetic nanocomposite from γ-FeOOH-loaded activated carbon at low temperature via lepidocrocite deposition on TAC. The highly air-stable nanocomposite showed good superparamagnetic properties (14.43 and 15.54 This work was financially supported by the
