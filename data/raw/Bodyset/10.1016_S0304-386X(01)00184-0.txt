The chemical oxidation rate of pyrite with ferric iron increases with increasing ferric-to-ferrous iron concentration ratios in the bulk-phase of the solution. In batch experiments, these high ratios were due to the presence of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans bacteria. It was proposed that the observed maximum chemical pyrite oxidation rate (mole pyrite oxidised/mole pyrite s), is determined by the mass transfer rate of chemically produced ferrous iron from the pyrite surface to the bulk-phase. The overall kinetics of chemical pyrite oxidation at pseudo-steady-states in these batch experiments are appropriately described by rate equations for the three independent sub-processes involved: (i) a linear equation that describes the chemical pyrite oxidation kinetics at the pyrite surface (i.e. production rate of ferrous iron) in terms of the ferric iron concentration in the bulk-phase, and the surface concentration of ferrous iron, (ii) mass transfer of ferrous iron from the pyrite surface to the bulk of the solution, where the solid–liquid mass transfer coefficient of ferrous iron, k
                     L(m/s), was estimated using a Sherwood correlation, and (iii) bacterial oxidation of ferrous iron by L. ferrooxidans.The kinetics of chemical pyrite oxidation has been examined in batch experiments with It was observed that in the presence of bacteria, extremely high chemical oxidation rates of pyrite are achieved when compared with pyrite oxidation rates reported for sterile batch experiments under similar conditions (e.g. The chemical oxidation of pyrite with ferric iron is a heterogeneous reaction which involves mass transfer between the pyrite surface and the bulk-phase of the solutions. The overall chemical oxidation kinetics of pyrite was examined in batch culture experiments of pyrite with It would have been more correct to express the pyrite-specific oxidation rate per square meter of pyrite surface, In order to compare the mass transfer rate of ferrous iron from the pyrite surface to the bulk-phase of the solution with the production rate of ferrous iron at the pyrite surface, the pyrite-specific rate needs to be expressed per square meter of surface. Because a well-defined size fraction of pyrite was used in the kinetic experiments If mass transfer of ferrous ions from the pyrite surface to the bulk-phase becomes rate-limiting, a significant difference between the ferrous iron concentration in the liquid-phase, [Fe It can be easily shown that the mass transfer rate of ferric iron from the bulk-phase to the pyrite surface is not rate-limiting in our experiments: Assuming that the values of The kinetics of the observed overall chemical oxidation rate of pyrite are expressed in the empirical equation In a steady state, the rates of the two sub-processes (i) and (ii) are equal: the transfer rate of Fe In this study, the results of three different batch culture experiments with In In At very low ferrous iron concentrations that occur in the bulk-phase of the solution (for Prieska pyrite used in this study 2×10 Extremely low ferrous iron concentrations in the solution are maintained by Specific surface area of pyrite (m Kinetic constant in chemical pyrite oxidation (−) Biomass concentration, expressed in mM organic carbon (C–mmol/L) Particle diameter (m) Thickness of stagnant boundary liquid layer around particle (m) Diffusion coefficient of ferrous iron (m Concentration of pyrite (mol/L or g/L) Ferrous iron concentration (mol/L) Threshold ferrous iron concentration of bacteria (mol/L) Ferric iron concentration (mol/L) Surface specific pyrite oxidation rate (mol FeS Production rate of ferrous iron at pyrite surface (mol Fe  Mass transfer rate coefficient of ferrous iron (m/s) Molar mass of pyrite (kg/mol) Kinematic viscosity of the solution (m Specific pyrite oxidation rate (mol FeS Kinetic constant in chemical pyrite oxidation (mol FeS Particle Reynolds number (dimensionless) Schmidt number (dimensionless) Sherwood number (dimensionless) Temperature (K) Settling velocity of particle (m/s) Mass flux of ferrous iron from pyrite surface to bulk-phase (mol Fe Bulk-phase of the liquid Spherical particles Surface Maximum value
