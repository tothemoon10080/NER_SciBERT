A new type of multi-degree-of-freedom and highly efficient vibrating screen based on multi-degree of freedom mechanics principle of dynamics is presented. Its prominent character is to have an additionally high frequency and short amplitude vibration on long amplitude vibration. And it can efficiently increase probability of material crashing, eliminate blinding aperture, and get high screening efficiency. A series of mechanics Equ.s are set up and parameter vibrating wave charts are gained by emluator of Matlab.
