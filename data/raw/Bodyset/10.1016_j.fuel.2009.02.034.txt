The present study determines the efficiency with which lignite and lignite washing plant tailings can adsorb Pb heavy metal ions. In the first experiment, the effect of size distribution on the absorbance capacity was investigated for the samples. Therefore, lignite sample was ground to five sizes (d
                     80
                     =0.600, 0.355, 0.250, 0.106 and 0.063mm) under nitrogen (N2), and the tailings sample was classified into seven fractions, along with the original state (original state: d
                     60
                     =0.063, −1+0.600, −0.600+0.355, −0.355+0.250, −0.250+0.106, −0.106+0.063 and −0.063mm). The test results showed that the optimum size distributions for lignite and tailings were d
                     80
                     =0.063mm and the original state (d
                     60
                     =0.063mm), respectively. Simultaneously, the adsorption capacity results of the two optimum sizes were compared with each other, and the tailings sample (d
                     60
                     =0.063mm) gave the best results, with 9.30mg/g Pb ions adsorbed value. Therefore, in the second study, a series of laboratory experiments using 23 full factorial designs was conducted to determine the optimum pH, contact time and initial metal concentration using the original tailings sample. The experimental studies showed that pH9, a 120min contact time and 300ppm initial metal concentration gave the best results, namely an adsorption of 29.92mg Pb ions/g.Environmental pollution by heavy metals is a serious and complex problem that has been, and still is, a focus of attention worldwide. Heavy metals are among the chief pollutants of surface and groundwater. Industrial and municipal wastewaters frequently contain metal ions that can be harmful to aquatic life and human health Adsorption processes have long been used in the water and wastewater industries to remove color, odor and organic pollution In recent years, numerous low-cost natural materials have been proposed as potential sources of commercial synthetic sorbents Lignites have been a popular biosorbent choice in numerous biosorption studies and are plentiful, inexpensive and widely available. They have high buffering capacity and can remove a variety of cationic and anionic contaminants from aqueous effluents This study presents to evaluate an alternative method for the tailings. The method contains an adsorption study in which the lignite washing plant tailings were used as an adsorbent to removal heavy metal ions. First, the goal of this work was to investigate the extent of removal of Pb heavy metal ions from aqueous solution by using Ömerler lignite and Ömerler lignite washing plant tailings, obtained from Kütahya, Turkey. In the meantime, lignite and lignite washing plant tailings were compared for their removal of Pb heavy metal ions. It was determined that the original tailings sample ( The lignite and lignite washing plant tailings used as adsorbent in this study were supplied by Ömerler lignite and Ömerler lignite washing plant tailings, Kütahya, Turkey. Some of their physical and chemical characteristics are shown in The amount of metal ions adsorbed per unit mass of sample (mg metal ions/g sample) was evaluated using following equation: It is well known that the size distribution of the adsorbents is an important variable in the adsorption process. Adsorption trials for size fractions were performed under the following conditions: pH  The adsorption results for removal of Pb by the seven tailings fractions were given in Lignite and lignite washing plant tailings were assessed for their ability to adsorb Pb ions from solution. The original tailings sample gave better results than the lignite optimum size fraction. Therefore, in the second experiments, this tailings sample was used to determine the optimum adsorption study parameters, such as, pH, contact time and initial metal concentration, using the Yates technique. The statistical design of experiments was used when the effect of several factors were to be studied in order to determine the main and interaction effects. The effect of a variable is the change in response produced by varying the level of the factor. When the effect of a factor depends on the level of another factor, the two factors are said to interact In the present work, three variables were taken into consideration to evaluate their main and interaction effects on the adsorption. The 2 The Yates technique for 2 The procedure for preparing the table is as follows In column (3), the upper half was obtained by adding successive pair responses, and the lower half was obtained by subtracting successive pairs. Columns (4) and (5) were calculated in the same way. Tests were repeated three times at base levels to estimate the error associated with the determination of an individual response, which was required to test statistical significance. The ANOVA procedure was applied. The table value of Statistical models can be built up for the prediction of Pb metal ions adsorbed using Yates’ analysis data ( The main effect of all the variables on adsorption capacities is significant at the 95% confidence level. The effects of pH ( Maximum adsorption capacity (mg/g) was found to be 29.92 The XRD study of the tailings sample show that it contain quartz, serpentine–kaolinite group minerals, illite, smectite group clay minerals, and amorphous matter. Quartz, the end mineral in the silicate classification, is a naturally hydrophilic oxide that has been used as a model solid to study metal ion adsorption for decades This surface charge interacts repulsively with approaching metal ions and prevents them from reaching the surface and thus, the adsorption was not much at low pH. In an alkaline medium, the clay surface becomes negatively charged favouring M  The preliminary purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of particle size distribution of lignite and lignite washing plant tailings on Pb metal ions adsorption. Batch experiments showed that the optimum size distributions of lignite and tailings were A multilinear mathematical model developed to predict the adsorption of lignite washing plant tailings sample was determined to be successful with coefficient determination ( The laboratory studies showed that lignite washing plant tailings is a possible effective and cheap adsorbent for removal of Pb heavy metal ions from aqueous solution.
