Crystallization kinetic studies of new quaternary antimonite glasses within the Sb2O3-Na2O-WO3-PbO system were performed by non-isothermal methods using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The kinetic parameters n and m which determine crystallization reaction mechanism in glasses were obtained using experimental values of the crystallized volume fraction, χ, by applying Ozawa method. Values of n and m were found as 1 indicating surface crystallization which was confirmed by SEM investigations. The values of crystallization activation energy were calculated in the range of 234–272kJ/mol by using seven different theoretical models. The calculated crystallization activation energy values were associated with the crystallization of cubic crystalline senarmontite phase of Sb2O3.Researchers have recently focused on the development of new glasses as a novel media for opto-electronic and photonic applications by incorporating rare-earth ions, metal or semiconductor nanoparticles etc. and their hybrids to the glass network Among heavy metal oxide glasses, antimony-based glasses are of growing interest since they have large optical non-linearity that is correlated to high refractive index and better thermal, mechanical and chemical durability than that of tellurite glasses In general the non-linear effect in glasses is reported to be increased with the controlled crystallization of nano-scale crystallites such as Ag nanoparticles, semiconductor nano-crystals Sb The crystallization kinetics of glasses can be investigated either isothermally or non-isothermally by using thermal analysis techniques. In the isothermal method, the sample is heated above glass transition temperature and the heat absorbed during crystallization process is measured as a function of time. On the other hand, in the non-isothermal method, the sample is heated at a fixed rate and then the change in enthalpy is recorded as a function of temperature There exist no study to our knowledge in the literature solely on the crystallization kinetics of Sb Synthesis of glasses in the Sb Amorphous nature of so produced vitreous samples was confirmed by XRD analysis. The elemental compositions of the prepared samples were checked using scanning electron microscopy / energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) techniques in JEOL Model JSM 6400 microscope linked with Oxford link ISIS energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. No considerable differences in composition were detected between synthesized glasses and starting batch compositions Characteristic temperatures of glasses ( To investigate crystallization behavior of the samples, as-cast samples were heat-treated for 48 To identify the crystalline phases, XRD analysis was performed with the heat-treated sample. XRD investigations were carried out in a PANalytical/Philips X′pert MRD system using Cu Kα radiation at 40 Non-isothermal DSC scans of glass samples were carried out at different heating rates, In non-isothermal kinetic investigations, kinetic parameters of crystallization can be obtained by monitoring the shift in the crystallization peak as a function of heating or cooling rate The crystallized volume fraction, χ, is obtained by integrating the area underneath the DSC curves. Values of χ as a function of temperature The Avrami parameter, The value of the Avrami parameter, The kinetic parameter The value of crystallization activation energy Kissinger’s model is the most commonly used model for the analysis of crystallization data of DSC The crystallization activation energy can be evaluated by the modification of the original Kissinger equation presented by Matusita et al. As given in Augis and Bennett method is helpful in obtaining kinetic parameters such as frequency factor ( Augis-Benett relation is given as below: As shown in Ozawa suggested a method for the evaluation of crystallization activation energy from the variation of crystallization peak temperature with heating rate  Matusita et al. developed a method, namely modified Ozawa equation by Matusita on the basis of the fact that crystallization does not advance by The crystallization activation energy was calculated as 234 The value of activation energy can also be calculated by using the variation of  Similar to the Augis and Bennett method, Takhor method has an extra advantage over other models in the literature for the determination of activation energy of crystallization that the intercept of ln[ The values of crystallization activation energy obtained using Kissinger, Modified Kissinger by Matusita, Augis–Bennett, Ozawa, Modified Ozawa by Matusita, Afify, and Takhor methods are listed in XRD patterns of the crystallized SNWP40 sample annealed at 418 It is well known that Sb The presence of only senarmontite Sb The calculated crystallization activation energy value of the exothermic reaction detected in DSC scans was found at around 235 kj/mol (~56 In order to confirm the crystallization mechanism obtained with kinetic studies, SEM analysis was realized with the heat-treated SNWP40 sample and the resultant micrographs are given in Crystallization kinetic studies of glasses in the Sb The authors of this study express their gratitude to Prof. Dr. Süheyla Aydın for providing her lab equipment for crystallization kinetic studies.
