Introduction
                  The aims of this study are to 1) Investigation of morphometric difference in radiological parameters of malunited and normal distal radius of same patients in two age groups. 2) Correlation of functional outcome and radiological parameters of healed fracture distal radius.
               
                  Methods
                  A prospective radiological and clinical study of 90 patients with extra-articular distal radius fracture managed by conservative or partial surgical treatment was carried out for a period of 12 months. The radial length, radial angle/inclination, radial tilt and ulnar variance of the fractured wrist were compared to the contralateral normal side on X-rays at 12 weeks. The final healed radiographs were also analyzed for their functional outcome using MHQ and DASH questionnaires.
               
                  Results
                  Shows decrease in mean value for radial length and radial angle and increase in mean value for ulnar variance and palmer tilt of malunited distal radius in both age groups. Statistically there is a significant correlation between radiological parameters and functional outcomes in the younger group patients. In older age group satisfactory functional results were achieved late (at 20th–24th week) as compared to younger age group (at 16th–20th week) despite unsatisfactory radiological results.
               
                  Discussion
                  The ultimate aim of treatment radiologically and functionally is restoration of the normal anatomical alignment and a pain free, mobile wrist joint without functional limitation. Morphological finding of this study will hopefully facilitate anatomist and clinician in describing the difference between normal and malunited distal radius.
