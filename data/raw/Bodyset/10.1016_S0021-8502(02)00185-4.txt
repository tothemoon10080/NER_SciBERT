A method of fragmenting nanoparticle agglomerates by impaction from the aerosol phase in a single-stage impactor is described. The degree of fragmentation as a function of impaction velocity is determined by TEM image analysis of impacted agglomerates. Images of unfragmented particles are obtained by diffusional deposition in the same apparatus but operated in a different way.
                  As an illustration, the method was applied to aerosols of silver, nickel and titanium dioxide agglomerates with primary particle diameters of between 3 and 8.3

                      hardly any fragmentation was observed. At a given primary particle size, however, the range of energies required for complete fragmentation was found to be relatively narrow, indicating a fairly uniform bond structure. These trends are reflected by a model that was devised to calculate bond strength distributions between polydisperse primary particles assuming there are only van-der-Waals interactions. Some measurements were also carried out to investigate potential effects of impact energy on primary particle size.The “strength” of an agglomerate particle is mainly determined by the internal coordination numbers and bond energies between its constituent primaries. These will affect its resistance to break-up under stress and ultimately also determines bulk material properties such as cohesiveness and redispersion of powders. The average coordination number for an aerosol of submicron agglomerate particles can be estimated by applying the concept of fractals on a small scale as used in the restructuring of nanoparticle agglomerates ( Much less quantitative information is available regarding interparticle bond energies for dry and/or gas-borne agglomerates. These can vary widely, ranging from weak van-der-Waals interactions to strong solid-state necking, and depend largely on the Coordination number and interparticle bond energies mainly influence the deagglomeration behavior of aerosol agglomerates. To our knowledge the first report studying disintegration of agglomerates of coal dust aerosol in a nozzle flow was published by  Apparently such comparisons between experimentally found kinetic energy for break-up and calculated interparticle bond energy have rarely been reported for gas-borne nanoparticles, aside from indirect estimates of the van-der-Waals interaction energy during collision processes ( This paper describes a So far the method has been applied to agglomerated aerosols of silver, nickel and titanium dioxide generated by gas-phase processes for which we report illustrative data. These agglomerates consisted of a few tens (for titanium dioxide) up to several hundred quasi-spherical primary particles each, which varied in size from about 3 to The design is based on a single-stage low-pressure subsonic impactor (SSLPI) described by de la Mora (1990). The concept has become quite common in aerosol laboratories so that its functional description can be limited to certain modifications made for the present purpose. Specifically, our device has a removable inlet nozzle assembly. One thus has the option of either impacting particles passing through the nozzle jet or letting the undisturbed aerosol flow past the impaction plate (which is then switched sideways) to allow particle deposition by diffusion ( During operation as an impactor, the aerosol enters the device through a critical orifice that limits the flow rate into the pre-chamber. For a given mass flow rate the impaction velocity is determined by the absolute pressure in the impaction chamber and the diameter of the second, much larger nozzle. The pressure in the impaction chamber is adjusted with an electronically controlled precision valve behind the Faraday cup-electrometer ( The device is typically operated with monodisperse aerosols generated by electrostatic pre-classification in a differential mobility analyzer (DMA). Earlier comparisons between DMA and impactor using spherical DEHS droplets in the range of about 60– The accelerating nozzle exit velocity Below a certain critical value of the specific pre-chamber pressure, aerosol of sufficiently narrow size distribution is collected entirely in the SSLPI. For fragmentation experiments, all samples are taken at pressures below this to ensure complete deposition, except for the diffusionally deposited particles, which served as references. The degree of fragmentation at a given impaction velocity is determined by image analysis of a representative number of individual agglomerates collected on TEM grids. Appropriately low particle densities on the TEM grids were selected according to preliminary experiments. The image analysis technique needs to be adjusted to the structure and size of the agglomerate particles used. A bond is considered to be broken if a clearly visible gap can be detected between the respective primary particles. At our magnifications this corresponds to a distance of about For larger but relatively open structures typical for The agglomerate structure and thus the fragmentation pattern of Aerosols of silver and nickel agglomerates in the size range between about 20 and The The The  The number of particles per volume aerosol is counted in the condensation particle counter (CPC), whereas the number of charges after impaction (corresponding to the number of particles remaining in the gas flow) is determined with a Faraday cup electrometer before the vacuum pump at the end of the line. Experiments with agglomerated silver particles were carried out for mean primary particle diameters between 3 and For At an impaction velocity of    Collision and sintering phenomena led to the remarkable agglomerate structure of blackberry-like primary clusters, themselves consisting of round sub-units. Due to this agglomerate structure, only bonds between the clusters could be broken while the sub-units themselves did not show fragmentation. The degree of fragmentation according to For titanium dioxide not only fragmentation, but also bouncing of particles for impact velocities over Although the impact energies in our experiments are somewhat uncertain at this stage, due to the relationship between nozzle exit and impact velocity, it is tempting to use these velocities for further analysis of the fragmentation data. A model was therefore developed to calculate the fragmentation probability curve based on pure van-der-Waals interaction between the primary particles but using the actually measured primary particle size distribution, i.e. considering all possible combinations of interparticle bonds within the agglomerate. Plastic deformation as well as energy dissipation were disregarded and point contact between the primary particles was assumed. The probability The van-der-Waals bond energies In order to remove a particle from the agglomerate more than one bond may have to be broken. The bond energy calculated for one bond should thus be multiplied with the coordination number. On the other hand, each particle has to supply only half of the bond energy to break the bond. Since the coordination number of silver particles is about 2, these two effects cancel each other in the first approximation. The number of breakable bonds divided by the total number of bonds represents the degree of fragmentation A comparison with our experimental data shows that the calculated curves assuming pure van-der-Waals interactions have similar slopes but a roughly 5 times lower energy. Perhaps only a fraction of the total kinetic energy is utilized to break interparticle bonds, with the remainder lost to plastic deformation of particles (see Chapter 7) and impaction plate and to heat production. If forces stronger than van-der-Waals, such as ionic and covalent bonds between the particles are present, the calculated fragmentation curve would be even move closer to the measured fragmentation curve. The occurrence of covalent or atom bonds (about 50 times higher than a van-der-Waals bond on a molecular level; The same particle density (of bulk material) was assumed and used for theoretical and for experimental determination of the fragmentation degree. The density affects the van-der-Waals bonds (the Hamaker constant is proportional to the square of the density), while the kinetic energy determined in the experiments is independent (since the mass scale with the density and the impaction velocity squared scales with the reciprocal density). Therefore, if the real density of the primary particles was lower than the bulk density, the calculated curve would move further away from the experimental fragmentation curve. Considering the apparently rather small fraction of total particle energy used for breaking bonds, it could be argued that the excess energy may induce primary particle sintering and thus lead to larger primary particles. In that case, the measured fragmentation curves would no longer be directly related to the original primary particle size distribution. In order to clarify this point, the primary particle size distributions after impact were determined for three different impaction velocities, using agglomerates of the same initial size ( A method of breaking interparticle bonds in nano-agglomerates by impaction from the aerosol phase at adjustable velocities has been described. It is based on a modified single-stage low-pressure impactor with which particles are impacted onto TEM grids. The degree of fragmentation as a function of impaction velocity is then determined by analysis of TEM images of impacted agglomerates. The degree of fragmentation has been defined as the ratio of broken bonds to total number of bonds before impact. The latter is determined by depositing particles onto the TEM grids by diffusion. The method is illustrated by showing fragmentation data for Ag, Ni and TiO For silver of a given mean primary particle diameter the degree of fragmentation increases steeply with the impaction velocity after overcoming an initial threshold. For the same impact velocity, the degree of fragmentation decreases with decreasing primary particle size (8.3, 7.7, 6.5 and For silver, the experimental fragmentation energies were compared with estimated bond energies. A model was developed to calculate the fragmentation curve based on pure van-der-Waals interactions. It determines the distribution of interparticle bond energies by taking into account the primary particle size distribution, the collision probability between primary particle pairs of different sizes, and the average coordination number. Qualitatively, the model reflects quite well the dependence on primary particle diameter and slope shown by the experimental fragmentation curves. However, calculated bond energies are about 5 times lower than fragmentation energies deduced from measurements. This difference may be caused by energy dissipation due to plastic deformation of substrate and particles and transformation into heat. However, measurements of the primary particle size distribution at different impact velocities did not show a systematic plastic deformation on the particles. Therefore, based on the available data, plastic deformation of the primary particles seems to be unlikely. Additional measurements will have to show whether the ratio between calculated van-der-Waals energies and impact energy is a constant for nanoparticles of a given material and history. If this were the case, then actual bond energies could be deduced from the fragmentation experiments.
