In this present research work, the effect of fine Post-weld Rapid cooling on Grain size and Mechanical properties of Friction Stir Welded AA 2014 was studied. The welding parameters and tool pin profile play major roles in deciding the weld quality. It is observed that the grain size is decreased to 2-4 Âµm (average size) bypost-weld rapid cooling with the mixture of dry ice and ethanol. It is also observed that mechanical properties are enormously improved. The observed grain size and mechanical properties have been correlated with microstructures and fracture features.
