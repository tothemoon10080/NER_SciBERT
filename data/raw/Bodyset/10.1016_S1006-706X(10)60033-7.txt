The effects of Sn addition on core loss and texture of non-oriented electrical steels were investigated. Experiments revealed that the core loss of non-oriented electrical steels could be obviously decreased and the intensity of {111} texture and {112} texture of final annealed specimens could be markedly reduced by Sn addition. The reasons for reducing core loss and the intensity of unfavorable texture were analyzed.
