In this work the effect of mechanical milling on the structure, thermal stability and hardness of single phase Al62.5Cu25Fe12.5 icosahedral quasi-crystals has been investigated for different milling intensities. The results indicate that, irrespective of the milling intensity used, the quasi-crystals transform to a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase during milling. This transformation starts when the grain size of the QC phase is about 10nm, which represents the critical grain size initiating the phase transformation. Upon heating the milled powder displays grain growth of the bcc phase at low temperatures, followed by transformation to the original icosahedral QC phase at higher temperatures. The phase transformations occurring during milling and subsequent annealing have a remarkable effect on the indentation hardness, which can be tuned within a wide range (7–10GPa) as a function of the volume fractions of the different phases. This suggests that a composite material with optimized mechanical properties can be produced by appropriate thermo-mechanical treatments.Soon after their discovery in 1984 This unique set of properties makes Al–Cu–Fe QC materials suitable for various coating applications The structure of quasi-crystals has a fundamental impact on their application. For example, grain size is expected to be very important for catalytic and hydrogen storage applications There have been numerous studies on the formation of Al-based quasi-crystals produced by MA of elemental powders (which may require heat treatment to achieve a stable fci phase), with particular focus on the effect of composition and milling parameters on QC formation In contrast to MA of elemental powders and intermetallic compounds, only a few studies have been carried out on MM of single phase quasi-crystals In this work the effect of mechanical milling on the structure, thermal stability and hardness of Al–Cu–Fe quasi-crystals has been investigated in detail. Among the milling parameters, the milling intensity is the most important controlling factor determining the milling process and the corresponding end product. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of milling at different milling speeds (which approximately scale with the milling intensity) on mechanically induced phase transformations during milling and the phase evolution during subsequent annealing, and to correlate the microstructure with the mechanical properties through an investigation of the hardness. The starting material for the milling experiments was a single phase QC phase with nominal composition Al The XRD pattern ( The existence of a single icosahedral phase has also been confirmed by TEM. The hardness of the as-deposited QC material is about 10 The effect of milling on the structure of the Al The structural evolution of the Al The XRD results in The XRD patterns of the Al For milling at both 250 and 350 A comparison of the variation in crystallite size and lattice strain during milling at different speeds ( The significant temperature rise occurring during milling at 350 In order to shed light on the mechanism leading to the mechanically induced formation of β phase, the kinetics of the QC to β phase transformation was studied by analyzing the quantity of β phase formed during milling at different milling speeds. The amount of β phase was evaluated from XRD measurements assuming that the quantity of QC and β phase in the milled samples are proportional to the areas of the ( The amount of β phase (wt.%) formed during milling at different milling speeds is shown in It has been suggested that the grain size can be a critical factor in determining the relative stability of the Al–Cu–Fe QC phase relative to the crystalline β phase The total energy stored during ball milling of metals and alloys can reach values of about 10 For the present mechanically milled Al A grain or crystallite size dependence of phase transitions has been observed for a wide range of materials, including oxides, ceramics, semiconductors and metals (for a review of this topic see Nièpce and Pizzagalli According to Nièpce and Pizzagalli Although these findings suggest that the main factor affecting the QC to β transformation is the crystallite size and the associated grain boundary energy, the effect of the energy stored within the QC lattice cannot be neglected. The quasi-lattice strain is related to phason defects, which are typical defects of QC phases. It has been proposed that beyond a maximum phason strain quasi-crystals may not be able to retain their quasi-periodic structure and, consequently, they may transform into periodic crystalline structures  In order to clarify the structural evolution during heating of the powder milled at 150 The pattern taken at room temperature (corresponding to the as-milled powder) shows formation of the nanoscale β phase, thus corroborating the results from the laboratory XRD experiments ( Similar results have been observed using conventional XRD ( It is worth noting that for the powders milled at 250 and 350  Powder contamination and the resulting change in composition might also have a positive effect in promoting formation of the β phase during milling. However, this is in contrast to the small amount of residual QC phase observed in the as-milled powders prepared at 250 and 350 The phase transformations occurring during milling and subsequent annealing ( The hardness decreases sharply during the first stages of milling, from 10 The mechanically induced softening can be reversed by proper heat treatment. This is shown by the red symbols in In this work the effect of milling intensity on the structure, thermal stability and hardness of single phase Al The QC to β phase transformation begins when the grain size of the quasi-crystals is reduced to about 10 During heating the milled powder displays a multi-step thermal behavior characterized by grain growth of the β phase at low temperatures, followed by its transformation to the original icosahedral QC phase at higher temperatures. The transformation is gradual and quasi-crystals and β phase coexist over a temperature interval of more than 250 The phase transformations induced by milling and subsequent annealing can be used to tune the hardness of the powders within a wide range of values (7–10 F.A. thanks the PIEAS for financial support and Dr A.
