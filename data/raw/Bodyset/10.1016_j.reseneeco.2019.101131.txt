The production of energy from renewable sources is much more intensive in minerals than that from fossil resources. The scarcity of certain minerals limits the potential for substituting renewable energy for scarce fossil resources. However, minerals can be recycled, while fossil resources cannot. We develop an intertemporal model to study the dynamics of the optimal energy mix in the presence of mineral intensive renewable energy and fossil energy. We analyze energy production when both mineral and fossil resources are scarce, but minerals are recyclable. We show that the greater the recycling rate of minerals, the more the energy mix should rely on renewable energy, and the sooner should investment in renewable capacity take place. We confirm these results even in the presence of other better known factors that affect the optimal schedule of resource use: expected productivity growth in the renewable sector, imperfect substitution between the two sources of energy, convex extraction costs for mineral resources and pollution from the use of fossil resources.Renewable sources of energy are generally more scattered than non-renewable ones. In particular this is the case of wind or solar energy, as compared to coal or gas. More infrastructure to capture these renewable sources, and therefore a larger quantity of mineral inputs is required to produce one unit of final energy from renewable than from non-renewable sources of energy. The objective of this paper is to study how the schedule of energy production depends on mineral resources, as scarce inputs in the production of renewable energy. We present a theoretical model and bring along a novel argument in favor of early development of the production capacity for energy from renewable sources, which relies on the asymmetry between the types of natural resources used to produce energy services. When a unit of non-renewable resource is directly used as fuel to supply energy services through combustion, as in the case of oil, gas and coal, that amount of resource is definitely lost. When a unit of mineral resources is embedded in the equipment and infrastructure used to produce energy from renewable sources, it supplies a flow of energy services over an interval of time and, at the end of the life cycle of the equipment, it adds to the stock of secondary mineral resources that can be recycled. Hence some part of the original unit of resource can provide services in the next period: the higher the recycling rate, the less one needs to extract minerals in the future. If minerals were not recyclable, they could not be reused – just as fossil resources - and the two types of resources would be analogous. While the opportunity to recycle a non-renewable natural resource improves the production possibilities set of the economy, it also requires time as an input in order to do so. From a technological perspective, recycling first requires to use the primary (currently extracted) resource, in order to build, with some delay, the secondary (recycled) resource. This technological constraint interacts with social preferences in determining the optimal schedule of resource extraction and use. To illustrate this, let us consider a society, with no preference for the present, where neither extraction nor recycling are costly, that wishes to maintain the level of resource use constant at a given level over a finite interval of time. If it is endowed with a stock of a non-recyclable resource, it should spread it evenly over the planning horizon. If instead the resource can be partially recycled, say at a recovery rate Together, the technological specificity of recycling mineral resources and the relative mineral intensity of renewable energy provide a rationale for developing more renewable energy infrastructure in the initial period than in subsequent ones and to choose a larger share for renewables in the energy mix, as compared to a case without recycling. Our analysis is based on a simplified description of the economic problem. In our model, agents value energy services which result from a combination of energy provided by two distinct sources: the flow of renewable energy and combustion of a non-renewable fossil resource. These sources are more or less good substitutes, either because of heterogeneous uses ( The answers we obtain encompass some well-known arguments, as for instance that the development of renewables should be postponed in the expectations of a productivity improvement of green capital. But the framework we consider allows us to put forward two original arguments: to the extent that mineral resources embedded in that equipment and infrastructure can be recycled, the development of renewable energy should be brought forward in time, and the energy mix should rely largely on renewable sources. The assumption of a finite and scarce supply of minerals to build up the stock of green capital allows us to pinpoint these novel arguments, which rely on the intertemporal dependence in the use of the two non-renewable resources. The analysis would be affected if we were to consider competition in the use of the global supply of minerals between investment in green capital and other uses. For instance, in the extreme opposite case, one can assume that the demand for minerals from the energy sector is so small that it does not affect their equilibrium price. Minerals for investment in green capital would then be available at some exogenous marginal cost, breaking the intertemporal dependence of green capital investment decisions. Other factors can affect the optimal decision on the timing of investment in green capital. In particular, mineral extraction should be delayed when endowment in green capital is excessive. Our work is related to several strands of the literature. The analytical approach focuses on the efficient management à la In our analysis, recycling is crucial for the results. The efficient paths of resource extraction and recycling are considered as early as We present our model in Section We study an economy in discrete time, where periods are denoted by Energy services combine two flows: energy from non-renewable resources, The energy flow The flow of renewable energy In our framework the distinction between fossil and renewable sources of energy hinges on the recycling rate of minerals We analyze optimal trajectories, assuming that a benevolent planner chooses the path of resource extraction that maximizes intertemporal discounted utility of the representative household, subject to technology constraints and resource dynamics. It applies a social pure discount rate In this section, we further specify the production and utility functions, in order to be able to characterize the optimal policy by closed-form solutions. Specifically, we assume a unitary elasticity of substitution between fossil and renewable energy These assumptions imply that the extraction of fossil resources is always positive, i.e. When instead the equipment for the production of renewable energy is recyclable, i.e. if There are two distinct potential reasons for shutting down the mine at some finite date. First of all, the opportunity to recycle minerals embedded in capital introduces an incentive to put forward the extraction date. To see this, consider the extreme case of a 100% recycling rate, i.e. We therefore search for the extraction paths of the two resources, such that The optimal policy is characterized by the following.        The detailed proof is in Appendix A and B. Let us explain the optimal trajectories of resource extraction and energy production specified in Proposition 1 and comment on them. First, notice that the Hotelling principle for the efficient management of non-renewable resources applies to our framework. When the optimal policy maintains a constant input ratio, consumption falls at the same rate as the common rate driving the decline in resource extraction. Say that Second, the asymmetry between the two types of resources, concerning the possibility to recycle them, implies a difference in their optimal extraction paths. To see this let us focus on the case of moderate recycling (  The value of  The results in Corollary 1 have relevant policy implications. On the one hand, the empirically grounded observation that the production of renewable energy relies on the use of specific non-renewable resources, namely minerals, suggests that the economy is poorer than it would be if the renewable energy could be produced out of non-exhaustible inputs. From this point of view, the observation points to a limitation of renewable energy as a factor to overcome the limits to growth. In terms of our framework, this argument is represented by the lower value of welfare On the other hand, our analysis illustrates that the possibility to recycle minerals embedded in green capital makes it preferable to choose an energy mix composed of more renewable energy and less conventional fossil resources. Hence, adding a plausible assumption on the recycling technology to the same empirical observation, we provide a Moreover, we present an original argument in favor of a Our discussion above abstracts from several potential reasons for putting forward or for postponing investment in green capital. In the next section we review a few of them. The framework in Proposition 1 provides already a possible reason for delaying investment. It could be that at the start of the planning horizon, the economy has inherited of a large stock of green capital. If previous investment decisions were not optimal, and inefficiently biased toward renewable resources, the resulting stock of green capital, and thus of secondary mineral resource available in the first period, could exceed the desirable initial stock of capital for the first period. This corresponds to case ( Two further remarks on case ( In the previous section, we analyzed how the asymmetry in recyclability between inputs used in the production of conventional vs. renewable energy affects the optimal timing of energy production. In this section, we consider other factors affecting this timing, and in particular initial investment in green capital To begin with, we show how the results adjust to the finite horizon case, studying the benchmark case with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function. We disentangle two mechanisms by first studying the sub-case of a logarithmic utility, then discuss the role of the preference for intertemporal consumption smoothing in the optimal timing of energy production. Within this simplified framework, we study how expected technological progress, such as improved productivity of minerals in renewable energy equipment, affects the optimal investment in green capital. We move on to consider alternative assumptions on the production technology concerning the degree of substitutability between energy services provided by the two types of resources within each period. Let us consider first the case with CRRA utility function, Cobb–Douglas production function and non-constant productivities of resource inputs. In a two-period setting the planner's problem is as follows:   See From Other results differ from the case with infinite horizon. First, the input ratio in the second period does not change with the rate of recycling. This difference is not surprising, since there is no advantage from recycling mineral resources used in the second period in a setting where there is no future period to use recycled resources (i.e. no third period). Second, as noticed, when As a second step, consider the case Our analysis shows that preferences with respect to intertemporal substitution in consumption possibilities play an important role in determining the optimal timing of resource use and investment in green capital. However, the original mechanism underscored in this paper, based on the asymmetry between the two types of resources, is still crucially at work in determining the optimal timing of investment in green capital, making it preferable to bring forward investment as the efficiency of the recycling technology increases. Finally, consider the effect of expected technological change. The asymmetry on the optimal timing of resource use implied by the possibility to recycle minerals embedded in green capital is unaffected, since the results concerning the role of parameter In the analysis hereafter we abstract again from technological change and assume again Until now, we have assumed the specific Cobb–Douglas form The degree of substitutability between the two types of energy services may affect the optimal timing of investment in green capital. To see why, consider the heuristic extreme case without recycling, nor discounting, and completely inelastic preferences over the intertemporal consumption path of energy services ( Modifying the planner's problem As shown in So far, in our analysis we ruled out extraction costs. If the marginal costs of producing fossil and mineral resources increase with the extraction rate, the optimal timing of resource use, thus of investment in green capital, should be affected. In order to show this in a clear-cut way, we present a variant of our two-period model where fossil resources play no role. How does the presence of convex extraction costs directly affect the timing of mineral resource use? Does it affect the role played by the efficiency of the recycling technology of minerals embedded in green capital on the timing of investment in green capital? To answer the former question, consider the present value of the marginal extraction cost of We have shown that, although convex extraction costs introduce an economic incentive to smooth and actually postpone extraction of minerals, and therefore the build-up of the green capital stock, our original mechanism due to the possibility of recycling minerals embedded in green capital, is still at work, since it introduces a specific incentive to bring forward One of the main reasons underpinning the development of renewable energy production capacity around the world is the general recognition of the social costs resulting of the energy production from fossil resources. Since The planner's program is modified, and writes We show in Since How is investment in green capital affected by an increase in the damage of fossil resources use in the first period, i.e. Some observers argue that renewable energy is not Our analysis has focused on the role of recycling in determining the optimal path of extraction of fossil and mineral resources, and the investment in green capital. However, we have considered a constant, costless and exogenous recycling process. It would be relevant to check how robust our argument is to relaxing these assumptions. On its own the issue of the optimal choice of the recycling rate is interesting, and more so in our context as it could affect the timing of investment in green capital. We have adopted the normative approach of the benevolent social planner. However, it can be argued that market failures would lead to inefficient equilibria. Some market failures concern imperfect competition, both in the primary resource market and in the secondary one, when there is recycling (see It could also be interesting to investigate the role of the non-recycled share of used green capital. This cumulative waste involves a social cost to the extent that it may occupy scarce space or generate pollution in the absence of specific costly treatment. The social benefit of the development of recycling would therefore be confirmed: in addition to extending the life-cycle of the natural resource, therefore its use and the ability to generate energy from renewable sources, recycling reduces the amount of waste and its associated social cost.
