                     . The results are interpreted within the framework of a model (proposed by Schulson, 1990, and Renshaw and Schulson, 2001) that predicts the transition strain rate based on the micromechanical boundary between creep and fracture processes. Model parameters primarily affected by prestrain were the power-law creep coefficient B (more so than the creep exponent n), Young's modulus E and, by extension, the fracture toughness K
                     Ic.The macroscopic behavior of ice is known to be ductile when compressed slowly, but brittle when compressed rapidly Previous work has investigated the ductile-to-brittle (D–B) transition in polycrystalline ice that was initially free from damage, for example, as a function of temperature The effects on the compressive ductile-to-brittle transition examined herein could be associated with the prestrain of other materials. For example, the strength of highly-confined rock within the earth's crust can be limited by its plasticity Schulson The model predicts the ductile-to-brittle transition strain rate for loading under uniaxial compression as The model incorporates the process of frictional sliding that occurs between opposing surfaces of an inclined crack under the action of shear stress. The coefficient of kinetic friction For initially undamaged ice under ambient conditions, the creep exponent has been found to have a typical value of Freshwater ice and saline ice were both formed in the Ice Research Laboratory at Dartmouth College by unidirectional freezing of filtered (≤20 μm) tap water (or, in the case of saline ice, a 17.5 ± 0.2‰ (ppt) solution of commercially-available “Instant Ocean” salt mixture), in tanks equilibrated to +4 °C. Freezing was controlled by placing a cold plate, chilled using a circulating bath set to −20 °C, on the surface of the water or solution, which was seeded with ≤ 4 mm equiaxed ice grains, to produce the S2 (orthotropic columnar) grain structure. The S2 growth texture was verified by the Langway The first stage of testing involved prestraining the cube-shaped specimens under uniaxial compression at constant strain rate After being prestrained, each parent specimen was quartered into subspecimens, retaining material along the center planes for thin sections. Before being measured and subsequently reloaded, the subspecimens were machined into rectangular prisms (120 mm × 60 mm × 60 mm, such as those photographed in Porosity was measured before and after prestraining, calculated as Finally, the rectangular prisms milled from the prestrained parent specimens were individually reloaded at a constant strain rate The elapsed time between prestraining and reloading was held constant at 24 ± 6 hours. The results obtained following this reloading procedure were similar (as will be shown) to those of other tests in which the specimens had been prestrained and then instantaneously loaded again at a higher rate For comparison, experiments were also performed on similarly-sized prismatic specimens milled from undamaged ice of both types. The initially-undamaged control specimens were loaded at constant strain rates ranging from 3 × 10 Two primary microstructural changes occurred as a result of the applied prestrain: damage, in the form of non-propagating cracks, and recrystallization, i.e., the nucleation of refined, equiaxed grains. Damage and recrystallization were quantified by thin-section analysis, described in detail in Ref. Both porosity and elastic compliance increased proportionally with prestrain, up to When prestrained specimens of both types of ice were reloaded, like the undamaged control specimens, they exhibited a range of ductile to brittle behavior depending upon strain rate. We observed some variability in the fracturing process of the bulk material when specimens were reloaded at strain rates just below that which caused brittle failure, as marked by a sudden drop in load-bearing ability. In some of these cases (as in Illustrating the full range of mechanical behavior under uniaxial compression of ice of both types—freshwater and saline—three-dimensional graphs of σ-ε curves at each strain rate In order to identify the transition quantitatively, we focus on the features of the Brittle: Ductile: For reloading in the Prestrain already began to have an effect at the lowest level tested ( In addition to the tests described above for reloading in the Our results were consistent with the work of previous researchers who made preliminary tests on saline ice An alternative criterion for Do the results depend on the prestrain rate The relative insensitivity of To account for the observed effect of prestrain on the transition strain rate, we consider three possibilities: that the effect is caused entirely by recrystallization accompanied by grain refinement; that it is caused entirely by cracking and an attendant increase in creep rate (more below); or that it is caused by a combination of both recrystallization and cracking. The recrystallization-cum-grain refinement explanation implies an effect of the rate of prestrain. At the lower rate, as already noted, recrystallization dominates The cracking-cum-enhanced creep explanation also implies an effect of prestrain rate, but opposite from the one just noted. At the higher rate, cracking dominates. Cracks enhance creep through an increase in the constant Yet, as noted above, it is difficult to detect any significant effect of prestrain rate. The opposing effects of prestrain rate on recrystallization and on cracking appear to lead to an unappreciable overall effect on the transition strain rate. In the relatively narrow range of prestrain rates tested, the evidence fails to single out one or the other feature as the dominant factor, but suggests that the effects of recrystallization complement the influence of damage on the transition strain rate. Often both cracks The most likely explanation is therefore the third possibility; namely, that the increase in the transition strain rate with prestrain is probably caused by both recrystallization and cracking. That said, could changes in the other factors that appear in the model (Equation To compare the observed transition strain rates Concerning friction and its dependence on velocity and temperature, values for μ have been derived from double-shear experiments The resistance of a material to crack propagation can be measured by its plane-strain critical stress intensity factor, or fracture toughness, The creep parameters, Fitting a least squares linear regression on the log The regressions based on Equation It is noteworthy that uniaxial prestrain affects the The observed and predicted values for transition strain rate are compared in The increase in the ductile-to-brittle transition with prestrain appears somewhat stronger for freshwater ice than for saline ice, a point noted with Some observations can be made by comparing Experimental uncertainty also affects the parameters ( Note that none of the parameters in the model directly represent the effects of recrystallization that we have observed to occur during compressive prestrain. The experimental evidence supports the use of the model where compression causes recrystallization accompanied by cracks on the scale of parent grain diameters. The application of the model to predict prestrain effects has not yet been tested where the dominant microstructural change is expected to be recrystallization with negligible cracking, such as for prestrain rates lower than two orders of magnitude below Why does the A similar relationship between Δ The work by Ref. The last point, regarding crack-induced concentrations in the internal stress field, introduces an explanation for the somewhat counter-intuitive damage effects we have observed. The first part of our work The role of fracture toughness on the transition strain rate is also non-linear ( Through derivations described in Clearly, there are multiple factors at play, but their effects are not unbounded, as indicated by the lack of change in Likewise, damage evolves in a non-linear way, dependent on applied stresses as well as on strain-rate: microcracks nucleate at particular sites that may be random but not arbitrary, such as grain-boundary triple points in columnar ice The experiments described herein involved specific conditions of prestrain applied under uniaxial compression. Other prestrain conditions of engineering relevance, such as biaxial compression, may change the character of imparted damage—or suppress it altogether—and possibly result in different effects. The model has the capacity to accommodate various effects of cracking and of recrystallization. If damage occurs during prestrain, the onset of cracking precedes recrystallization On the other hand, if Although these experiments were performed on columnar ice, none of the processes discussed above should differ significantly in granular versus columnar ice. Therefore, we expect granular ice to exhibit the same effects of prestrain on the D–B transition. Given the apparent universality of the model The following conclusions regarding the effects of prestrain on the ductile-to-brittle transition of columnar ice at −10 Prestrain causes a reproducible increase by a factor of 3–10 in the D–B transition strain rate, The effect on The transition rate changes only up to a certain level of prestrain. Shifts in the ductile-to-brittle transition were observed in both freshwater ice and saline ice, indicating that prestrain effects are not isolated to one material.

When Equation Creep behavior is modeled by a power-law relationship, Schulson The first partial derivative relates the change in stress intensity factor to the change in applied stress, which, in the scenario in which secondary cracks initiate from frictional sliding of primary cracks, can be written In the remaining steps of the derivations by Schulson Solving for strain rate, We can now resume following The transition to brittle behavior occurs where the size of the zone of stress concentration In this project we have dealt with uniaxial compression, With zero confinement and using In Section It could be useful instead to have a formula for Among the parameters with the greatest influence in Equation We start by recalling Equation Now consider the fracture toughness, This, combined with the Young's modulus factor in the model (Equation Substituting for the terms on the left hand side above, Equation We have reduced to 2 from 6 the number of variables in Equation Young's modulus In Refs.
