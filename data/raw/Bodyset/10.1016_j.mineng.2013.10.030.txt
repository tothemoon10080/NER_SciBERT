Ludwigite ore has not yet been utilized on an industrial scale due to its complex mineralogy and fine mineral dissemination in China. Boron–iron separation and dissolution activity of boron-bearing minerals in alkaline liquor are the two key issues in the utilization of ludwigite ore, governing the boron recovery as well as operating cost. This paper proposes an innovative process for extraction of boron and iron from ludwigite ore based on coal-based direct reduction process with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The novel process involves reduction roasting, combined leaching and grinding of reduced ludwigite ore, followed by magnetic separation of leach residue, and experimental validation for each of the processing steps is demonstrated. Alkali-activation of boron and metallization of iron were synchronously achieved during carbothermic reduction of ludwigite ore in the presence of Na2CO3. Consequently, boron was readily extracted in the form of sodium metaborate (NaBO2) with water at room temperature during ball mill grinding, and metallic iron powder was recovered from the leaching-filtering residue by magnetic separation. Boron extraction of 72.1% and iron recovery of 95.7% with corresponding iron grade of 95.7% in the magnetic concentrate were achieved when ludwigite ore was reduced with 20% sodium carbonate at 1050°C for 60min.Boron and boron compounds, with properties such as fire retardant, heat resistance, high hardness, high strength, wear resistance and catalytic performance, are widely used in the industrial and agricultural sectors ( Generally, boron–iron separation and dissolution activity of boron-bearing minerals in alkaline liquor are the two key issues in the utilization of ludwigite ore, governing the boron recovery as well as operating cost ( Direct reduction process is an effective way for the treatment of complex iron ores ( The sodium carbonate used in this work was of analytical grade. Pulverized lignite with fixed carbon content of 59.42 Ludwigite ore was taken from Liaoning province of China, and ground to 80 The overall experimental flow sheet is presented in Another sub-sample of the reduced balls was crushed to the particle size less than 1 The grind-leaching and magnetic separation results of reduced ludwigite ore obtained at varying temperatures in the absence/presence of Na The results show that both the extraction of boron and recovery of iron were enhanced by the addition of Na  Furthermore, the different magnetic separation efficiency of reduced ludwigite ore in the absence or presence of sodium carbonate as shown in The proposed novel process involves carbothermic reduction of ludwigite ore in the presence of Na Na Ludwigite ore reduced at 1050 The authors wish to express their thanks to the
