FLSmidth pioneered Deep Cone Thickening technology in the global Minerals Industry, after early development by the UK Coal Board and adaptation by Alcan in the Alumina flowsheet. As one of the world's leading Mineral Processing equipment suppliers, with particular strengths in solid-liquid separation, FLSmidth were able to adapt the technology to a wide range of uses. FLS pioneered the use of Deep Cone Thickening for applications such as; Mine Backfill, Sub-aqueous Tailings Disposal, CCD circuits, Filter Feed, Cement Kiln Feed, Reactor Feed, and In-Pit Tailings Disposal, as well as using the technology to gain global acceptance of the innovative “Thickened Tailings Discharge” (TTD), a “best practice” technology for the mining industry.
                  The paper will briefly cover the core principals of flocculation and thickening of mineral slurries, before detailing the unique aspects of the Eimco Deep Cone Thickener and the current and potential applications of the technology. Particular focus will be given to the recent installations at OCP's JFC V in Jorf Lasfar where Deep Cone Thickeners are used to thicken the feed to the acid attack tanks, reducing water and acid consumption.
