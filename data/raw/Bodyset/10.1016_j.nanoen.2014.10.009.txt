Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite with a novel three-layer-3D-structure, which consists of an external polypyrrole coating layer, an intermediate sulfur filling layer, and an internal polypyrrole split-half-tube conducting matrix layer, has been synthesized by the oxidative chemical polymerization method and chemical precipitation method in this article. Due to this unique three-layer-structure, the discharge specific capacity of Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite cathode retained at 554mAh g−1 after 50 cycles, which represents 68.8% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. In comparison, the Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite cathode, with the same components as Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, but without the three-layer-structure, has the discharge specific capacity of 370mAh g−1 after 50 cycles, which is 32.3% retention of the initial discharge specific capacity. Therefore, it can be concluded that the unique three-layer-structure plays an essential role in improving the performance of the Lithium/Sulfur batteries. Moreover, the effects of LiNO3 additive in the electrolyte on coulombic efficiency are discussed to further confirm the containment function of the external layer of polypyrrole in the Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite, which is the evidence that the external layer of polypyrrole can effectively confine the dissolved polysulfides.Due to limited global energy supplies, environmental pollution, and the increasing consumption of energy, green and efficient energy storage devices are in high demand in modern society Nevertheless, the fabrication of lithium/sulfur batteries has encountered a number of challenges. Sulfur is very much an electrically insulating material, which leads to poor electrochemical accessibility and low utilization in the electrode. The polysulfide anions, which are formed as the reaction intermediates, are highly soluble in the organic electrolyte solvent. The diffusion of polysulfides to the lithium anode results in low active material utilization, low coulombic efficiency, and short cycle life of the sulfur electrode Compared with carbon, conducting polymer has many advantages for the lithium/sulfur battery system Polyaniline, polyacrylonitrile, polypyrrole(PPy), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) – poly(styrenesulfonate), and polythiophene have been successfully applied in lithium/sulfur batteries and are reported to significantly improve the performance of lithium/sulfur batteries In order to combine the advantages of the two directions mentioned above, a Polypyrrole@Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite (PPy@S@PPy composite) with a novel three-layer-3D structure is proposed by not only loading sulfur on PPy but also coating PPy on sulfur. The composite is synthesized by the oxidative chemical polymerization method and chemical precipitation method, which has an external PPy coating layer, an intermediate sulfur filling layer and an internal PPy conducting matrix layer. In order to analyze the function of this novel three-layer-structure of the PPy@S@PPy composite, a Sulfur@Polypyrrole composite (S@PPy composite) with the same components as the prepared PPy@S@PPy composite but without three-layer-structure was synthesized for comparison. At first, the preparation process is introduced and then the XRD, Raman spectra and TGA are employed for the components confirmation for these two synthesized composites. The morphology of the composites is investigated by TEM and SEM, which confirms the unique split-half-tube structure. This unique split-half-tube structure has many advantages, such as having higher surface area, improving the amount of sulfur loading and leading to a thin and uniform coating layer of sulfur. Next, the conductivity, capacity, reversibility and rate capability of the composite cathodes are valued by the electrochemical testing, which confirms the improvements of electrochemical performance due to this novel structure. At last, the effects of LiNO Sodium thiosulphate (Na The preparation route for PPy@S@PPy composite is shown in Polypyrrole split-half-tubes were synthesized by the oxidative chemical polymerization method. 0.3 Firstly, 32.10 The polypyrrole layer was coated on the surface of the S@PPy composite by an optimized chemical polymerization method using pyrrole monomer, sodium p-toluenesulphonate (PTS Na) as the dopant, and FeCl Preparation of Solution One: 57.88 Preparation of Solution Two: 217.6 Firstly, 400 As well as the S@PPy precursor composite, another batch of S@PPy composite was also prepared for comparison. This S@PPy composite has the same ratio of sulfur to PPy as in the PPy@S@PPy composite. Firstly, 33.56 The structures of the as-prepared sulfur, S@PPy composite, and PPy@S@PPy composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a GBC MMA X-ray generator and diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation ( The S@PPy composite cathode and PPy@S@PPy composite cathode slurries were made by mixing 70  The Raman spectra of bare S, S@PPy composite, and PPy@S@PPy composite are shown in To quantify the amount of the sulfur in the as-prepared S@PPy composite and the PPy@S@PPy composite, TGA analysis was carried out in air, with heating from 50 The morphology of the as-prepared PPy was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in The morphology of the as-prepared S@PPy composite and PPy@S@PPy composite was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), as shown in To verify that the sulfur was uniformly coated on the surfaces of the split-half tubes of PPy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis was carried out on the S@PPy composite ( To investigate the electrochemical characteristics of the S@PPy composite and PPy@S@PPy composite, cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the initial five cycles in 1 M LiTFSI in PEGDME 500 with 0.1 M LiNO   In order to compare the rate capabilities of S@PPy composite and PPy@S@PPy composite cathodes, the cells were discharged to 1.5 V at different current densities from 50 Based on the above discussion, the improvement of the electrochemical performance of the cell with PPy@S@PPy composite cathode could be attributed to the multiple effects of the PPy additive and the superiority of the three-layer structure. (1) PPy is a kind of conducting polymer, so it works as a conducting additive. (2) As shown in The proposed model and a cross-sectional view of the S@PPy composite are presented in When the cells were disassembled after 100 cycles, it was clear that the PPy@S@PPy composite offered better morphological control than the S@PPy composite during cycling, as shown in A PPy@S@PPy composite with a novel three-layer-3D-structure, which consists of an external PPy coating layer, an intermediate sulfur filling layer, and an internal PPy conducting matrix layer, was synthesised by the oxidative chemical polymerization method and chemical precipitation method. The PPy@S@PPy composite has the same components with S@PPy composite except three-layer-3D-structure, which exhibits improved electrochemical performance. The discharge specific capacity of the PPy@S@PPy composite cathode is 554 mAh g Financial support provided by an Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
