The terpolymer 4-hydroxyacetophenone-thiourea-formaldehyde (4-HATUF) has been synthesized using 4-hydroxyacetophenone, thiourea, and formaldehyde in 1:1:2 molar ratios respectively, in 2 M HCl as a catalyst by microwave irradiation (MWI) as well as conventional condensation method. Synthesis by microwave irradiation has been performed at 300 W for 25 min., whereas the conventional method took 5 h refluxing at 145 °C. The synthesized terpolymer has been characterized on the basis of spectral data generated from FTIR, 1H NMR, SEM and elemental analyses. Thermal degradation studies of the terpolymer has been carried out by TG, DTG and DTA techniques to determine its mode of decomposition and relative thermal stability in air atmosphere at the heating rate of 20 °Cmin-1 from ambient temperature to 800 °C. A preliminary study of the synthesized terpolymer for its metal uptake property has been carried out in order to find its application as chelating ion exchange resin.
