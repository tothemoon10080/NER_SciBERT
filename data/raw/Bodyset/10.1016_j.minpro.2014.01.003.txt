Separation of molybdenum and cobalt from a spent catalyst leach liquor bearing 12.52g/l Mo, 1.74g/l Co and 9.98g/l Al was investigated using solvent extraction technique followed by preparation of metal oxides. Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid) and Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)dithiophosphinic acid) were used as extractants for molybdenum and cobalt, respectively. The effects of various parameters such as pH, concentration of extractant, A/O ratio and temperature on extraction of Mo and Co were studied. The number of stages required for extraction and stripping were determined from the McCabe–Thiele diagram and confirmed by counter current simulation study. The extracted species for Mo and Co were found to be MoO

The enthalpy change (ΔH) values for extraction of molybdenum and cobalt were positive indicating the extraction processes were endothermic. The oxides of molybdenum and cobalt were prepared from the strip solutions of molybdenum and cobalt by crystallization followed by thermal decomposition and the products were characterized by XRD and RAMAN spectra.Molybdenum has been used in different industries because of its high melting point, high tensile strength and has properties such as corrosion and abrasion resistance. The compounds of molybdenum are used as catalysts in petroleum-refining industries, petrochemicals and coal-derived liquids. The molybdenum catalysts are extensively used in petroleum refining industry for hydrodesulfurization and during the process, the catalysts are deactivated and contaminated with toxic material. Due to contamination of toxic material, these are dumped as hazardous waste after some time. But these spent catalysts can be used as secondary resource for metal recovery and valuable products because of increasing environmental concerns and rapid depletion of primary sources. A wide variety of experiments and studies have been carried out to recover molybdenum from spent catalyst using pyro and hydrometallurgical processes. The requirement of large amount of heat energy and evolution of harmful gases in pyrometallurgical processes attracted the attention of researchers towards hydrometallurgical process. Recovery of molybdenum has been studied using different techniques such as ion exchange ( Also works have been carried out on Mo extraction using chelating ( The phosphinic and dithiophosphinic acid extractants (Cyanex 272 and Cyanex 301) have been used for separation and recovery of different metals ( The spent catalyst containing molybdenum and cobalt was leached with H The pH of the aqueous solution was measured with a digital pH meter (ELICO, model L1 120) provided with a combined glass electrode. The metal ion concentration in the aqueous phase was measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) (Perkin Elmer, Model A Analyst-200). The crystal structure of the product was studied by X-Ray Diffraction, Model X'pert pro-3040/60 using Cu-Kα target with λ For the experiment equal volume of leach liquor containing metal ions and the extractant were equilibrated manually for 5 The leach liquor of the spent catalyst contains 12.52 To study the effect of pH on the extraction of molybdenum, experiments were carried out with different initial pH ranging from 0.52 to 3.0. The corresponding equilibrium pH was varied from 0.43 to 2.88. The concentration of Cyanex 272 and A:O phase ratio were kept constant at 0.1 The plot of log D versus equilibrium pH up to 0.99 ( To know the effect of Cyanex 272 concentration on extraction of molybdenum, the concentration of Cyanex 272 was varied in the range of 0.01 to 0.4 The plot of log D The extracted species of molybdenum was found to be MoO To determine the number of stages and A:O phase ratio required for quantitative extraction of molybdenum, the extraction isotherm was plotted. For extraction isotherm, the leach liquor containing molybdenum was contacted with the organic phase (0.2 To confirm the above data, a 3-stage counter current simulation study was carried out with 0.2 The stripping of molybdenum loaded organic was carried out with NH So NH The loaded organic contained 22.98 After extraction of molybdenum, the raffinate contained 1.74 The extraction of cobalt from the raffinate was studied using 0.1 Various concentrations (0.05–0.3 The plot of log D The extracted species of cobalt was found to be CoA To extract cobalt from the molybdenum-free solution, it was required to determine the number of stages at the chosen phase ratio for which the McCabe–Thiele plot ( The loaded organic contained 1.72 Molybdenum exhibits different ionic forms depending on the pH value of the aqueous solution. With increasing the pH value, molybdenum changes from cationic to anionic species. Within the pH range of 1 to 2, it exists in the form of Taking logarithm of Eq. The extraction mechanism of cobalt with Cyanex 301 can be written as: The effect of temperature on extraction of molybdenum and cobalt was studied in the range of 283 to 323 The ln k values for molybdenum and cobalt extraction with Cyanex 272 and Cyanex 301 were calculated from Eqs.
