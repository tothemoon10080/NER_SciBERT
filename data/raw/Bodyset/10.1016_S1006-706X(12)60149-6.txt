The influence of V2O3, FeO, TiO2, MnO and MgO in vanadium slag on the corrosion mechanism of MgO-C bricks was studied by stationary immersion tests at vanadium-extracting temperature. Experimental results show that FeO, TiO2, and MnO could enhance the corrosion rate and V2O3 and MgO could decrease it. Microstructure and phase composition of worn samples were investigated by SEM-EDS, revealing the presence of Fe particles, produced by graphite reduction, and (Mg, Fe, Mn) O solid solution at the interface. The formation process of (Mg, Fe, Mn)O solid solution was discussed and the corrosion mechnism of MgO-C bricks was thus proposed.
