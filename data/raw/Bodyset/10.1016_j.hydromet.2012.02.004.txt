Salt roasting with Na2SO4
                     +CaCl2 followed by water leaching was used to extract alkali metals from lepidolite. The experiments indicated that the best mass ratio of lepidolite /Na

The flexible roasting condition is easily controlled in industrial application. After leaching in water, the solution was cooled to −5°C for 2h to crystallise 92.1% of the sulphate and 3.9% of the chloride as Na

Evaporation and precipitation using Na2CO3 produced Li2CO3 crystals with >99.5% purity and a solution from which Rb and Cs could be recovered.Lithium is the lightest known metal and has been widely utilized for many commercial lithium products due to its fascinating electrochemical reactivity as well as other unique properties. Lithium compounds and minerals have attracted much attention for their applications in ceramics, glass, aluminum, lubrication industries, and pharmaceuticals ( Wadman and von Girsewalt ( In order to overcome these drawbacks, a simple process is introduced in this paper. After roasting, water leaching can be used to dissolve the metals, the solution can be purified by freezing which results in crystallisation of sulphate and chloride salts. The lepidolite in this study was provided by Jiangxi Province (China). The lepidolite was first crushed in a jaw crusher, then ground in a ball mill and screened to 100% Roasting was conducted by placing the mixture of lepidolite, Sodium carbonate was added into the filtrate to remove In all the experiments, AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry) was used to determine the content of In order to study the effect of roasting temperature upon lithium extraction, a series of experiments were carried out for 0.5 The effect of mass ratio of sodium sulfate to lepidolite was investigated by roasting for 0.5 To enhance extraction efficiency, it was found that a suitable amount of calcium chloride should be added. Leaching results of samples are shown in The dissolution of potassium, rubidium and cesium after roasting a lepidolite / The leaching residue under the best conditions was dried and four phases were identified using XRD. The quantitative composition of the leaching residue was refined by Rietveld analysis and found to be 54  The purified solution was evaporated, but the concentration of lithium was limited to 8.6 The sulphate-free solution was thermally evaporated and the concentration of lithium increased to 20–24 Salt roasting followed by water leaching process was used to extract valuable metals from lepidolite. The conditional experiments indicate that the optimum mass ratio of lepidolite / After removal of sulphate by freezing crystallisation of
