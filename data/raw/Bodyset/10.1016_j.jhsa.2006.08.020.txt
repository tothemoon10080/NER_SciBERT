The coronoid process is critical to elbow stability and is vulnerable during injury. Traumatic elbow injures are relatively uncommon, so it is important for surgeons to be mindful of the importance of specialized treatment of the coronoid for optimal elbow function. Optimal coronoid fracture fixation is determined by fracture morphology, which can usually be predicted based on the overall pattern of injury. There is evidence that improved understanding of coronoid fractures and their management is improving the results of treatment.
