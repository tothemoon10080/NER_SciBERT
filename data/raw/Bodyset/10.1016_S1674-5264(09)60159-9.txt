In order to study the rules of distribution in a plastic zone of rocks, surrounding a roadway, affected by tectonic stress, we first analyzed the mechanics of a roadway affected by tectonic stress and derived a theoretical formula for the plastic zone of rocks surrounding a roadway. We also analyzed the distribution characteristics of the plastic zone under different levels of tectonic stress, vertical pressure, cohesion and friction angle of the surrounding rock. Secondly, we used numerical simulation to analyze the range and shape features of the plastic zone of rocks surrounding the roadway, given different tectonic stress levels. Finally we used a rock drilling detector to carry out field measurements on the broken state of rock surrounding the roadway at the âˆ’700 substation and channels in the Xinzhuang mine of the Shenhuo mining area. Given the measured ground stress, we analyzed the relationship between tectonic stress and the distribution of this plastic zone. Our results show that the range of the plastic zone at the top and bottom of the roadway increases with an increase in tectonic stress and this increase is especially obvious at the roadway corner.
