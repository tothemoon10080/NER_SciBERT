After discussing the general aspects of photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds in aqueous solutions and the application of the rotating disk theory to (photo)catalytic phenomena, we report the oxidation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) on illuminated phosphorus modified TiO2 (P-TiO2) and TiO2 photocatalysts under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. We found that the performance of the oxygen transfer reaction can be described considering mass transport in solution and surface reaction according to Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics. From analysis of the dependence of the reaction rate on the rotation rate, we obtained the apparent organic–photocatalyst adduct interaction constant K, the rate constant k of the surface reaction between adsorbed PNP and hydroxyl radicals, and the diffusion coefficient D of PNP in solution. The results showed that degradation of PNP using P-TiO2 and UV light was readily possible, with reaction half-lives significantly lower than those obtained using pristine TiO2 photocatalyst.Since Fujishima and Honda Under conditions of TiO In recent years efforts have been directed to solve two fundamental problems associated with TiO Non-metal modification of TiO Modification of TiO The aim of the present study is to describe the kinetics of photocatalytic oxidation of Hydrodynamic techniques for the study of surface chemical reactions have been considered rigorously since the development of the rotating disk electrode (RDE) by Levich et al. The Levich equation Chemical reactions with comparable mass transfer and first order kinetic rates (with first-order heterogeneous reaction rate constant, Recently, Vargas et al. The reaction rate given by The kinetic analysis can be extended to photocatalytic reactions; in these systems the L–H rate fits very well the organic compound degradation Rotating disk experiments were carried out in a glass cell with quartz optical flat bottom, mounted on an optical-bench for irradiation from a Solar Light model LS 1000 UV solar simulator, fitted with a 1000 Phosphorus-modified TiO P-TiO The photocatalytic oxidation of PNP was studied at room temperature of 28 Some features of the synthesized photocatalysts are shown in The degradation of phenolic compounds on TiO Apparent pseudo-first-order kinetic constants (  The resulting values are reported in The photocalytic activity of P-TiO Furthermore, this study proved the effective use of the rotating disk technique with the kinetic model based on transport with surface reaction We are grateful to the members of the Electrochemistry Group at Universidad Simón Bolívar for discussions.
