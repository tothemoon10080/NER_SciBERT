In this research, oxidation of sulfide and leaching of gold from a gold–bearing sulfide concentrate using chloride–hypochlorite solution has been investigated. Effects of calcium hypochlorite concentration, initial pH and sodium chloride concentration on the recovery of gold were examined. Two conditions were considered; the stability range of the gold complex (Eh>900mV) and formation of chlorine gas (pH<3.5). During leaching, due to oxidation of sulfide and generation of acid, pH dropped. About 82% of gold was extracted from 200g/L concentrate after 2h using 200g/L Ca(OCl)2, 200g/L NaCl at initial pH of 11, stirring speed of 600rpm and temperature of 25°C.Although cyanide is used commercially for the extraction of gold, investigations have been done on alternative non-toxic leachants such as chloride/hypochlorite ( Hypochlorite salt is ionized in water and at pH In the present paper, simultaneous oxidative pre–treatment and gold leaching of a sulfide concentrate using the chloride/hypochlorite solution has been studied. The concentrate used in this study was obtained by flotation of a sample of an ore located in north-western of Iran (Barika Mine in Sardasht). The ore was ground to 90% finer than 37.4      XRD pattern of washed solid residue after 120 In Combining sulfide oxidation and gold leaching using chloride/hypochlorite solution was used for a refractory sulfide concentrate containing 20.45
