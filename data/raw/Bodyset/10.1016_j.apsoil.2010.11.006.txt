Soil microbial communities play an important role in soil carbon functioning, particularly in forest ecosystems. Their variation in response to climate change may affect soil carbon processes, highlighting the importance of understanding how environmental factors affect microbial communities. This study aimed to determine to what extent an increase in the quantity of fresh litter may affect heterotrophic mineralization of organic carbon and bacterial community structure in soil and litter. A litter manipulation experiment was performed in situ in a temperate deciduous forest. Three treatments of fresh litter inputs were considered: litter exclusion, natural conditions (control) and litter addition (twice the natural rate). Microbial and functional ecological approaches were combined to consider bacterial community structure in soil and litter using a molecular fingerprinting technique, and measurement of soil respiration both in terms of efflux intensity and isotopic composition of respired CO2 (natural abundance) over one year.
                  The quantity of fresh litter seemed to affect soil and litter bacterial community structure and to interact with soil temperature and moisture to determine the temporal variation in the bacterial community on a month to season scale. In addition, this study highlighted the large temporal variability in soil and litter bacterial community structure and that this variability may affect our ability to relate bacterial community structure to respiration processes. This highlights the need for an intensive characterisation of the bacterial community structure to relate its variations to variations in soil respiration processes.Terrestrial ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle ( Microbial community composition plays a crucial role in determining the diversity of carbon mineralization processes and their stability in response to stress ( Numerous studies have identified environmental factors affecting soil microbial community composition, at different spatial scales: from the ecosystem level to a 1 In this study, we performed In the present paper, the objective was to determine if these modifications of leaf litter amount affected bacterial community structure in soil or litter, and if these potential variations could be related to variation in soil respiration. To answer these questions, analyses of bacterial community structure in soil and litter were performed concomitantly with The experiment was performed in the Barbeau national forest (CARBOEUROPE IP network site – cluster_FR1, site FR-Fon; 48°29′N, 02°47′E; 60 A 17.6 The experimental area was divided into 12 plots (each 1.2 In each block, three treatments were applied: fresh litter exclusion (E), control (C, 486 Monthly measurements of soil water content (0–10 Soil and litter samples were collected monthly during one year from all the treatment plots. Three soil cores (0–10 Each month and for each plot, three litter samples were taken at random and combined. After lyophilisation (Christ alpha 2–4, Bioblock Scientific, Germany) and grinding in liquid N Finally, every composite sample was divided into three sub-samples that were analyzed independently. The compositing approach was chosen according to For each sampling date and treatment, three subsamples weighting 1.3 Then, DNA extraction was performed following the procedure described in Purification of crude DNA extracts was also performed as described in The Bacterial Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (B-ARISA) technique is a molecular fingerprinting method ( The bacterial ribosomal IGS was amplified using the PCR protocol described in Since the three subsamples derived from each treatment were analyzed independently for both microbial biomass and bacterial community structure, they were treated as independent replicates (see Section The effect of the treatments on microbial biomass estimated by means of [DNA] was tested through non-parametric paired tests (Friedman repeated measures one-way analysis of variance on ranks, cited as RMANOVA; and the Kruskal–Wallis test). The significance level was set at 5% and the test was performed with Statistica software (Statsoft Inc, Tulsa, USA). Data obtained from the 1D-Scan software were converted into a table summarizing the band presence (peak) and intensity (Gaussian area of peak) using the PrepRISA program ( Euclidean distances derived from sample profiles were used as a measure of the magnitude of bacterial genetic structure modification between two treatments and calculated as described in Soil functional factors (CO All statistical analysis on molecular fingerprints was performed using the ADE-4 software (  Complex B-ARISA profiles were obtained in soil and litter and visual comparisons of profiles highlighted differences between soils sampled at different periods ( The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of soil B-ARISA profiles obtained for each date in each treatment are presented in PCA analysis of litter B-ARISA profiles ( Euclidean distances derived from the sample profiles were used as an estimate of the magnitude of genetic structure modification in the E and A treatments relative to the control; and between the E and A treatments. This method was applied to both soil and litter data. Differences were observed in soil bacterial communities between E treatment and treatments C and A in May, June, and August 2006, and in February and March 2007 ( When considering litter bacterial communities in C and A treatments per date, no effect of litter treatment on litter BCS was observed until December 2006. Differences between treatments were also observed in January and March 2007. As soil and litter bacterial community structure changed among treatments and over time, the relationships between the bacterial community structure data and the corresponding soil functioning data presented in Soil microbial communities are a crucial component of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems and their response to climate change could affect soil carbon processes ( In this study, neither soil nor litter microbial biomass were affected by the quantity of fresh litter. This lack of variation may be due to the method used to measure microbial biomass that targets the whole microbial biomass and not only its active part which is commonly assumed to represent only a few percent of the total microbial biomass ( The high soil microbial biomass recorded in summer has been frequently observed in forests or tree-dominated ecosystems ( In litter, the seasonal variation in microbial biomass was different from that in soil. The maximum litter microbial biomass was observed in late autumn and could have resulted from the colonisation of litter by soil microorganisms. Soil and litter bacterial community structures varied with season with differences between a warm and a cold period being observed in all treatments except for soil in the A treatment, despite climatic conditions being identical in all treatments ( The warm and cold periods in this study correspond respectively to a period of active photosynthesis in trees and exudation of labile carbon compounds ( In litter, variation in the bacterial community structure was observed only at the end of the experiment during the “cold” period. As litter decomposition rates were the same, we may assume that increasing the quantity of litter may have affected the litter bacterial community by increasing the availability of ecological niches (physical or trophic; In soil, nutrient availability might have differed between the plots where litter was excluded and the plots with litter (natural amount or double amount) because of nutrient leaching from the litter compartment to the soil ( Additionally, the leaf litter amount may have modulated the impact of climatic factors in determining the amplitude of soil bacterial community structure variations, as soil bacterial community structure seemed to be affected by temperature only in the E treatment and in the Control at a seasonal time scale, and no differences in soil bacterial community structure were observed between the treatments during the drought stress period. Such interaction between litter amount and environmental factors has been recently reported for a dwarf shrub/graminoid heath in Sweden ( The link between microbial community composition and soil processes has been previously investigated through environmental studies and transplantation studies on carbon and/or nitrogen cycles ( According to the co-inertia analysis, the structure of the litter bacterial community seemed to be related to CO When seasonal variations in litter bacterial community structure seemed related to the CO In contrast to litter, soil bacterial community structure seemed to exhibit a weaker link with CO In addition, other microorganisms may have played an important role in respiration processes, particularly fungi. This may have precluded linking soil bacterial community composition and CO This study provides evidence for the importance of litter amount and its interactions with abiotic factors (temperature and/or moisture) in determining the dynamics of soil and litter bacterial community structure in forest ecosystems, interactions that may influence the relationship between soil respiration processes and bacterial community structure. However, this needs to be confirmed through further experiments taking advantages of litter manipulation, soil transplant and labelling techniques to decipher the respective importance of biotic and abiotic factors in determining the dynamics of bacterial community structure and its link to soil functions.
