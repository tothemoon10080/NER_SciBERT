Small leucine-rich proteoglycans, such as biglycan, and their side chain sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have been suggested to be involved in bone formation and mineralization processes. The present study was designed to investigate whether chondroitin sulfate (CS), one of the GAG, and its oversulfated structures alter the osteoblast or osteoclast differentiation. CS-E, one of the oversulfated CS structure, enhanced cell growth and differentiation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells whereas heparin enhanced only the differentiation. As well as CS-E, CS-H, chondroitin poly-sulfate (CPS) and low molecular weight CS-E (LMW CS-E) which consists of about 4 disaccharide units, also enhanced the mineralization of the cells. MC3T3-E1 cells produce oversulfated CS on the cell surface, and its mineralization was significantly inhibited by treatment of chondroitinase (CHase) ABC. CS-E enhanced the mineralization of the cells by interacting with BMP-4 in the medium. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy method using fluoresceinamine labeled GAG revealed that CS-E, LMW CS-E, CPS and heparin have a high affinity for BMP-4. Addition of these oversulfated CS further increased the capacity of BMP-4 to enhance mineralization. CS-E also enhanced the mineralization of the cells induced by BMP-2, BMP-6 and BMP-7 as well as BMP-4. On the other hands, CS-E, LMW CS-E, CS-H and CPS as well as CS-B inhibited the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cell formation from macrophage cell line RAW264 induced by RANKL. These CS structure also inhibited the pit formation on hydroxyapatite pre-coated in plates. However, the osteoclastic differentiation induced by RANKL was not affected by treatment of CHase ABC. These results suggest that endogenous and exogenous oversulfated CS, possessing CS-E structure, promotes osteoblast differentiation through the interaction with BMP, and inhibits the osteoclast differentiation.
