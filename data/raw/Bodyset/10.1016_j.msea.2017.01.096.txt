Ti and Ti-TiB composite materials were produced by selective laser melting (SLM). Ti showed an α΄ microstructure, whereas the Ti-TiB composite revealed a distribution of needle-like TiB particles across an α-Ti matrix. Hardness (H) and reduced elastic modulus (E

Comparison of the nanoindentation results with those derived from conventional hardness and compression tests indicated that 5 mN is the most suitable nanoindentation load to assess the elastic modulus and hardness properties. The wear resistance of the samples was related to their corresponding H/E

These investigations showed that there is a high degree of consistency between the characterization using nanoindentation and the wear evaluation from conventional wear tests.Titanium materials possess good mechanical properties, excellent corrosion resistance and high biocompatibility which make them outstanding candidates for various applications in the biomedical, aerospace and automotive industries Nowadays, fabrication of complex-shape titanium parts with desirable properties is in high demand. In recent years, selective laser melting (SLM), a 3D metal printing technology, has received a great deal of attention for processing various metallic parts from aluminium In general, the rapid melting and cooling rates associated with the condensed laser source applied during SLM processing can influence microstructure and, consequently, the resulting mechanical and wear properties of SLM-processed materials. Therefore, it is important to study the properties of SLM-processed materials and their relationship to processing variables involved in order to ensure that they can meet demanding performance requirements. Although conventional testing methods are widely used for measuring the mechanical properties of materials, these techniques often require bulk, standard sample geometries which can make them unsuitable for testing samples with specific attributes such as small sample sizes or irregular shapes and geometries. Nanoindentation is a well-established method for measuring the mechanical properties of a wide range of materials especially when a non-destructive approach is required . The advantage of using nanoindentation techniques in comparison to conventional testing methods includes the ability for in-situ measurement of material properties without disrupting the microstructure and causing significant damage. Additionally, no special conditions are required regarding the size and shape of the test samples To our best knowledge, nanoindentation investigations of SLM-processed titanium materials with a comparative assessment to conventional mechanical and wear tests have not been carried out. Previous investigations Commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) powder and a blended mixture of Ti-5 Prior to performing microstructural, nanoindentation and wear studies, samples were sectioned by a Struers cutting device. Their surfaces were then mechanically ground followed by polishing using standard metallographic procedures. Samples were also etched for microstructural characterizations and were examined using a Zeiss Gemini scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 The mechanical properties of the SLM-produced samples were investigated using nanoindentation. The dimensions of the disk samples used for nanoindentation were 5 Generally, the hardness ( In addition to the nanoindentation tests, dry sliding wear testing was performed at room temperature using a pin-on-disk tribometer testing machine according to the ASTM G99 standard. The cylindrical CP-Ti and Ti-TiB samples (5  SEM and TEM observations of the composite sample indicate the presence of TiB particles with needle-like morphology distributed across the α-Ti matrix ( In the present work, the diameter and length ranges for needle-like TiB particles are around 30–50  According to It is evident that the nanoindentation hardness of CP-Ti (2.95 As mentioned, the unloading curves were analyzed using the Oliver-Pharr method to determine the From A number of mechanisms are believed to account for the strength increase associated with TiB reinforcements in Ti-TiB composites and the effects of short oriented TiB reinforcement on composite strength and modulus have previously been rationalized using micromechanical models In addition to the reduced elastic modulus and hardness, nanoindentation can be used to assess the wear resistance of a material  Finally, it is concluded that the nanoindentation load can be appropriately adjusted to measure mechanical properties including hardness and elastic modulus to give good consistency to those values obtained from conventional mechanical tests. It was also shown that nanoindentation can be used to evaluate the wear resistance of the SLM-fabricated CP-Ti and Ti-TiB materials. This is very important for the production of SLM titanium parts of small sizes, unusual geometries or for those that may require regular inspection and testing during their operational lifetime. In this study, CP-Ti and Ti-TiB composite materials were processed by selective laser melting (SLM). CP-Ti had an acicular martensitic (α΄) microstructure due to the high cooling rates present during SLM. In contrast, the Ti-TiB material showed a fine distribution of TiB particles, formed by in-situ chemical reaction between Ti and TiB This research was supported from the
