Present study concentrates to identify the phase of stability of Ni3(Ti,V) phase through first principle calculations. Initially, enthalpy of formation of stable Ni3Ti in D024 and Ni3V in D022 structures are calculated and compared with the literature data. The stability of Ni3Ti and Ni3V phases in L12, D022, D024, D019, D0a crystal structures are compared by its calculated enthalpy of formation. Stability of Ni3(Ti,V) phase with respect to FCC crystal structures are calculated using Thermo-Calc software. To identify the possibility of formation of new intermediate phase such as Ni3(Ti1−XVX) [x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1] in L12, D022, D024, D019 and D0a structures, enthalpy of mixing is calculated. The result shows that Ni3Ti0.5V0.5 phase is stable at D019 crystal structure than D022 and D024.The superior high temperature mechanical properties of Ni-base superalloys are primarily due to the two phase microstructure consisting of a heavily solution-strengthened fcc matrix (γ), containing a high volume fraction of ordered coherent intermetallic precipitates of type Ni A new crystal structures are observed in the ternary Ni The geometrically closed packed structures Ni First-principles calculations are performed using the VASP software with the projected augment wave (PAW) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE). All the structures are fully relaxed with respect to cell shape, volume, and atomic coordinates. Due to super cell calculation, kinetic cut off energy kept as 350 eV and k point spacing as 0.167 Å The enthalpy of formation of stable structure of Ni The possible configuration of D0 Similar calculations are done for remaining structures. The enthalpy of formation of selected composition and low energy configuration phases are represented in The stable phases of the corresponding composition are highlighted in The phase stability of Ni The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
