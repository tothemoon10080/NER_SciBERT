The kinetics of reductive leaching of manganese from low grade pyrolusite in dilute sulfuric acid in the presence of molasses alcohol wastewater was investigated. The shrinking core model was applied to quantify the effects of reaction parameters on leaching rate. The leaching rate increases with reaction temperature, concentrations of H2SO4 and organic matter in molasses alcohol wastewater increase and ore particle size decreases. The leaching process follows the kinetics of a shrinking core model and the apparent activation energy is 57.5 kJ·mol−1. The experimental results indicate a reaction order of 0.52 for H2SO4 concentration and 0.90 for chemical oxygen demand (COD) of molasses alcohol wastewater. It is concluded that the reductive leaching of pyrolusite with molasses alcohol wastewater is controlled by the diffusion through the ash/inert layer composed of the associated minerals.
