The effect of Fe and rare-earths (Tb&Dy) addition on the martensitic transformation, magnetic and mechanical properties of the Ni50Mn30Ga20 (at%) ferromagnetic shape memory alloy was investigated. The results show that the rare-earths exhibit negligible solubility in the Ni–Mn–Ga–Fe matrix phase and formed grain boundary phase. The grain boundary precipitate enhances the compressive ductility of the alloys. The martensite transformation temperature was found to be increased by the addition of rare-earths, while, Fe increased the Curie temperature of the Ni–Mn–Ga alloy. However, with increase in Fe content, an additional (Ni,Fe)3(MnGa) precipitate is formed, leading to decrease in martensite transformation temperature and compressive ductility.Ferromagnetic shape memory (FMSM) alloys based on Ni–Mn–Ga have been widely investigated as promising actuator materials due to their large magnetic field induced strains (MFIS) and high response frequency Three polycrystalline alloys, with nominal composition Ni  X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of heat-treated alloys at room temperature are shown in In order to investigate the effect of alloying on the martensite transformation behavior, DSC measurements were carried out. The first order peaks corresponding to forward austenite to martensite transformation on cooling as well as reverse martensite to austenite transformation on heating can be clearly seen in DSC thermograms ( The Curie temperature for the alloys was determined by measuring magnetization as a function of temperature on heating (thermomagnetic curves) at a bias field of 500 In order to understand the effect of rare-earth and Fe addition on the mechanical properties of the NMG alloy, compressive tests were carried out at room temperature. The addition of rare-earths in Ni–Mn–Ga alloy was found to enhance the martensite transformation temperature and addition of Fe enhanced the Curie temperature of the Ni The authors are grateful to
