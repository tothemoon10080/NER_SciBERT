Anoxic respirometry was applied to characterize a sulfide-oxidizing nitrate-reducing (SO-NR) culture obtained from an anoxic biogas desulfurizing biotrickling filter treating high loads of H2S. Immobilized biomass extracted from the biotrickling filter was grown in a suspended culture with thiosulfate as electron donor to obtain the biomass growth yield and the S2O3

                     − consumed ratio. Afterward, respirometry was applied to describe thiosulfate oxidation under anoxic conditions. A pure culture of Thiobacillus denitrificans was also used as a control culture in order to validate the procedure proposed in this work to characterize the SO-NR biomass. Respirometric profiles obtained with this microbial culture showed that nitrite was formed as intermediate during nitrate reduction and revealed that no competitive inhibition appeared when both electron acceptors were present in the medium. Although final bioreaction products depended on the initial S2O3

                     − ratio, such ratio did not affect thiosulfate oxidation or denitrification rates. Moreover, respirometric profiles showed that the specific nitrite uptake rate depended on the biomass characteristics being that of a SO-NR mixed culture (39.8mgNg−1 VSSh−1) higher than that obtained from a pure culture of T. denitrificans (19.7mgNg−1 VSSh−1). For the first time, the stoichiometry of the two-step denitrification mechanism with thiosulfate oxidation and biomass growth associated was solved for both reactions.The presence of H Desulfurizing biotrickling filters (BTFs) are efficient and economically advantageous when compared to physical–chemical processes such as chemical scrubbers or adsorption towers ( Respirometry is the measurement and interpretation of the biological electron acceptor consumption (usually oxygen) under well-defined experimental conditions ( Regarding desulfurization, aerobic respirometry has been reported as a proper, reliable technique for the characterization of suspended and immobilized sulfide-oxidizing cultures ( Describing the biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as thiosulfate, sulfide or elemental sulfur) under anoxic conditions can be complex since it involves several steps and the potential use of different electron acceptors (nitrate, nitrite). Nonetheless, these processes are often simplified considering complete nitrate-based denitrification and neglecting biomass growth (Eqs. From the stated above, the aim of this work was to setup a procedure to characterize SO-NR microbial populations, obtained from an anoxic desulfurizing BTF, through anoxic respirometry and taking into account the two-step denitrification coupled to biomass growth. Such data are important not only to predict the needs of the carbon source, nitrogen source and the electron acceptor as well as the products obtained and the pH balance associated to the biological process but also to obtain necessary information for a further approach toward mathematical modeling of the respirometric profiles and the estimation of the corresponding kinetic parameters. Thiosulfate was used as electron donor due to its easier manipulation and for being already proved to be interchangeable with H Two continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR The second reactor (CSTR DO concentration, temperature and volumes of acid and base added to control the pH were continuously monitored through a Visual Basic based software which was also in charge of controlling pH through the addition of HCl (1 Respirometric tests were performed with both pure and mixed cultures and thiosulfate as the electron donor. Respirometric tests were carried out in a closed, batch-type, magnetically stirred respirometer with a capacity of 350 Once the biomass was washed and poured into the respirometer, the liquid and gas phases were gassed with N  Nitrite, sulfate, nitrate and thiosulfate concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography with a suppressed conductivity detection using a Dionex ICS-2000 HPLC system with an IonPac AS18-HC column (4 A respirometer can be considered as a sensor and triplicates of respirometric tests were not needed ( The start up of CSTR The growth yield was calculated using mass balances either from the exponential growth phase of the batch operation ( CSTR The experimental S Several thiosulfate concentrations and S Nitrite was formed as an intermediate of nitrate reduction. Several hypotheses with a high disparity about nitrite accumulation in denitrification systems have been proposed: (i) delay in the induction of nitrite-reducing enzymes in the presence of nitrate, (ii) low specific utilization rate of nitrite compared to nitrate, (iii) presence of a low concentration of nitrate, or (iv) the S/N ratio ( The experimental respirometric profiles ( In test A-3 ( It was found that STUR was not affected by substrate limitations at concentrations over 20 Three respirometric tests were conducted with the mixed culture (B-1, B-2 and B-3) ( Test B-1 ( Test B-2 ( Test B-3 ( The theoretical stoichiometry of single-step and two-step denitrification with thiosulfate was satisfactorily assessed using a single experimental biomass growth yield together with mass, charge and reduction degree balances.
