Although CIGS based thin film solar cells have achieved more than 22% efficiency through vacuum based methods but on large scale production consumption of materialis a great challenge to make thin film solar cells cheaper. In this context, inkjet printing technique has a potential to lower the material wastage in an efficient manner to lower the manufacturing cost. Thepresent study is mainly focused on the optimization of parameters for formulation of suitable precursor based ink for ink jet printing followed by post treatmentto achieve dense, crystalline and crack free CIGS thin film absorber layer.
