Diets based on red clover silage (RCS) typically increase the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in ruminant meat and milk and lower the efficiency of N utilization compared with grass silages (GS). Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (108 d postpartum) fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a 4×4 Latin square design with 21-d periods to evaluate the effect of incremental replacement of GS with RCS on milk production, nutrient digestion, whole-body N metabolism, and milk fatty acid composition. Treatments comprised total mixed rations offered ad libitum, containing 600g of forage/kg of diet dry matter (DM), with RCS replacing GS in ratios of 0:100, 33:67, 67:33, and 100:0 on a DM basis. Intake of DM and milk yield tended to be higher when RCS and GS were offered as a mixture than when fed alone. Forage species had no influence on the concentration or secretion of total milk fat, whereas replacing GS with RCS tended to decrease milk protein concentration and yield. Substitution of GS with RCS decreased linearly whole-tract apparent organic matter, fiber, and N digestion. Forage species had no effect on total nonammonia N at the omasum, whereas the flow of most AA at the omasum was higher for diets based on a mixture of forages. Replacing GS with RCS progressively lowered protein degradation in the rumen, increased linearly ruminal escape of dietary protein, and decreased linearly microbial protein synthesis. Incremental inclusion of RCS in the diet tended to lower whole-body N balance, increased linearly the proportion of dietary N excreted in feces and urine, and decreased linearly the utilization of dietary N for milk protein synthesis. Furthermore, replacing GS with RCS decreased linearly milk fat 4:0 to 8:0, 14:0, and 16:0 concentrations and increased linearly 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 concentrations, in the absence of changes in cis-9 18:1, cis-9, trans-11 18:2, or total trans fatty acid concentration. Inclusion of RCS in the diet progressively increased the apparent transfer of 18-carbon PUFA from the diet into milk, but had no effect on the amount of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 at the omasum recovered in milk. In conclusion, forage species modified ruminal N metabolism, the flow of AA at the omasum, and whole-body N partitioning. A lower efficiency of N utilization for milk protein synthesis with RCS relative to GS was associated with decreased availability of AA for absorption, with some evidence of an imbalance in the supply of AA relative to requirements. Higher enrichment of PUFA in milk for diets based on RCS was related to an increased supply for absorption, with no indication that forage species substantially altered PUFA bioavailability.Red clover ( Meat and milk from ruminants are characterized by high concentrations of SFA and a low abundance of PUFA, due at least in part, to extensive biohydrogenation of dietary unsaturated FA in the rumen ( Red clover has a higher polyphenol oxidase ( The aim of the present study was to provide further insight into the influence of forage species on the transformations of dietary protein in the rumen, efficiency of N utilization, and bioavailability of FA in cows fed diets relevant to more intensive milk-production systems. Four cows in a 4 All experimental procedures were approved by the National Animal Ethics Committee (Hämeenlinna, Finland) in accordance with guidelines established by the European Community Council Directives 86/609/EEC. Four multiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows (599 Individual cow intakes were recorded throughout the experiment, but only measurements for the last 7 Omasal digesta flow was determined using the omasal sampling technique ( The flow of microbial N at the omasum was estimated using 15.0 Whole-tract apparent digestibility coefficients were determined by total fecal collection over 96 Milk yield was recorded daily throughout the experiment, but only measurements made from d 15 to 21 of each period were used for statistical analysis. Samples of milk were collected from each cow over 4 consecutive milkings starting at 1645 Lipid in 1-mL milk samples was extracted 3 times with a mixture of ammonia, methanol, diethyl ether, and hexane (0.2:1:2.5:2.5, vol/vol, respectively) and converted to FAME using methanolic sodium methoxide as a catalyst ( Samples of FAME were quantified using a gas chromatograph (model 6890; Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) equipped with a flame-ionization detector, automatic injector, split injection port, and a 100-m fused silica capillary column (0.25-mm i.d.) coated with a 0.2-µm film of cyanopropyl polysiloxane (CP-Sil 88, Chromopack 7489; Chromopack, Middelburg, the Netherlands). The total FAME profile in a 2-μL sample at a split ratio of 1:50 was determined using a temperature gradient program and hydrogen as a carrier gas operated at constant pressure (137.9 The distribution of CLA isomers in milk samples was determined using an HPLC system (model 1090; Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) equipped with 4 silver-impregnated silica columns (ChromSpher 5 Lipids, 250 Milk FA composition was expressed as a weight percentage of total FA using theoretical relative response factors to account for the carbonyl deficiency in the flame-ionization detector response for 4- to 10-carbon-containing FAME ( Metabolizable energy content of experimental diets (MJ) was calculated as 0.016 × digestible OM in DM Ruminal AA balance (g/d) was calculated as flow of AA at the omasum (g/d) − intake of AA (g/d). Ruminal protein degradability (%) was calculated as follows: ({[N intake (g/d) – ammonia-N intake (g/d)] – flow of dietary NAN at the omasum (g/d)}/[N intake (g/d) − ammonia-N intake (g/d)]) × 100. Ruminal AA degradability (%) was calculated as follows: {[intake of AA (g/d) − flow of dietary AA at the omasum (g/d)]/intake of AA (g/d)} × 100. Flow of dietary AA at the omasum (g/d) was calculated as total flow of AA at the omasum (g/d) − flow of microbial AA at the omasum (g/d), assuming that AA represented, on average, 73.4% of microbial NAN entering the omasal canal ( Whole-body N balance (g/d) was calculated as N intake (g/d) − [N in milk (g/d) + N excreted in feces (g/d) + N excreted in urine (g/d)]. The transfer efficiency (%) of FA from the diet into milk was calculated as FA secretion in milk (g/d per FA intake; g/d) × 100. Efficiency of transfer (%) of FA at the omasum into milk was calculated as FA secretion in milk (g/d per FA flow at the omasum; g/d) × 100. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with a model that included the fixed effects of treatment and period and random effects cow using PROC MIXED of SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Sums of squares for treatment effects were further separated using orthogonal contrasts into single-degree-of-freedom comparisons to test for the significance of linear and quadratic components of response to incremental replacement of GS with RCS in the diet. Least squares means are reported, with treatment effects declared significant at Intakes of DM, OM, starch, and N tended ( Increases in the proportion of RCS in the diet decreased linearly ( Treatments had no effect ( Ruminal balance of total AA was negative for all diets ( Increases in the proportion of RCS in the diet decreased linearly ( Replacing GS with RCS in the diet decreased linearly ( Diets containing both forage species resulted in higher ( Treatment effects on the composition of major FA in milk are presented in Replacing GS with RCS had no effect ( Forage species also resulted in relatively small, albeit often significant, differences in the concentration of 18:2 isomers in milk ( Treatments also altered the abundance of OBCFA in milk fat ( Associations between the flow at the omasum and secretion in milk for specific FA are documented in Both experimental silages were well conserved and of high nutritive and fermentation quality as indicated by the low pH, concentration of fermentation acids, and proportions of ammonium N in total N. Even though the DM content of red clover was lower than grass at the time of ensiling (19 vs. 23% for red clover and grass swards, respectively), the DM contents of GS and RCS were similar, suggesting higher effluent losses during the ensilage of red clover compared with grass. A higher ash and CP concentration and lower concentration of NDF in RCS compared with GS reflect differences that are typical between ensiled grasses and red clover ( Diets based on a mixture of forages resulted in higher DMI compared with either GS or RCS alone, which is in agreement with several earlier reports ( Ruminal pool sizes of DM and NDF have been determined as being lower or similar in cows fed diets based on RCS compared with GS ( Despite differences in the NDF and CP concentration of silages, substituting GS for RCS had no major influence on apparent nutrient digestion in the rumen, consistent with the limited differences between these forages species reported previously ( Although forage species had limited effects on ruminal digestion, substituting GS for RCS lowered whole-tract OM, NDF, and N digestibility, indicating lower availability of nutrients in the small intestine. Previous studies have reported that RCS in the diet has no effect ( A higher CP concentration of red clover relative to grasses has often been associated with higher postruminal NAN flow, principally through greater ruminal escape of dietary protein, and to a lesser extent microbial NAN ( Higher escape of dietary N from the rumen and decreases in total-tract N digestibility when RCS replaced GS in the diet may be related to the inherent differences in PPO activity between forages, but the underlying mechanism and mode of action remains uncertain ( Red clover has an inherently higher activity of PPO than grasses, a stress-activated enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of phenols and diphenols to quinones, which will readily react with nucleophilic binding sites ( Although the net disappearance of sulfur-containing AA Met and Cys in the rumen did not differ between forage species ( It is also possible that differences in ruminal digestion kinetics offer an explanation for the effects of forage species on ruminal protein degradation. Diets based on RCS alone or as a mixture with GS have in some ( Replacing GS with RCS had no major effect on the postruminal supply of AA in the present work, whereas earlier studies reported higher flows of all AA with RCS relative to GS, other than for Met and Cys, which were unaffected by forage species ( Whole-body N balance was positive on all diets, other than when RCS was fed alone. Differences in BCS across treatments also suggest that body reserves were used to support milk production for the RCS diet. These findings may be related to lower bioavailability of AA with the RCS treatment, as indicated by the lower whole-tract N digestibility and a possible imbalance of AA available for absorption compared with diets containing GS. The effects of forage species on N retention in lactating cows are, however, inconsistent. Replacing GS with RCS in the diet has been shown to have no effect ( Replacing GS with RCS lowered the conversion of dietary N into milk N from 26.4 to 23.5%, which represents a typical response for lactating cows ( Feeding GS and RCS as a mixture increased milk yield compared with GS or RCS as the sole forage, which reflected the higher DMI of diets containing both forages. Diets based on a mixture of GS and RCS have, in some cases, been shown to improve milk yield compared with either forage alone ( Replacing GS with RCS in the diet increased linearly the secretion of lactose in milk, which can be attributed to the higher lactic acid concentration of RCS relative to GS and associated with increases in ruminal molar propionate proportions ( Often, replacing GS with RCS lowers milk fat concentration, which has been attributed to decreases in 2:0 and 4:0 availability ( Despite a marginally higher N intake of cows fed a mixture of both forages, RCS tended to lower milk protein concentration and secretion, which appears to be related to decreases in microbial protein supply and lower AA bioavailability in the small intestine. In some studies, RCS has increased milk protein yield compared with GS ( Consistent with earlier reports, substituting GS for RCS in the diet increased milk fat 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 concentration ( Replacing GS with RCS in the diet decreased linearly the proportions of several short- and medium-chain SFA in milk fat (4:0–8:0, 14:0, and 16:0). Several studies have reported that RCS decreases milk fat 14:0 and 16:0 concentrations ( Inclusion of RCS in the diet enriched Replacing GS with RCS in the diet had no effect on milk fat Secretion of Red clover silage in the diet resulted in the enrichment of several Forage species altered the relative distribution and abundance of OBCFA in milk fat. Inclusion of RCS in the diet enhanced linearly milk fat 15:0 and 17:0 concentration, whereas concentrations of Across treatments, a close positive association existed between the flow of microbial NAN and the sum of 13- to 18-carbon OBCFA at the omasum. However, secretion of total 13- to 18-carbon OBCFA in milk was poorly correlated with the flows of NAN or OBCFA at the omasum, although a positive relation was identified between the flow and secretion for Diets based on a mixture of RCS and GS stimulated higher DMI and milk yields compared with either forage alone when offered as part of a TMR with a 60:40 forage-to-concentrate DM ratio. Forage species had no effect on NAN at the omasum, with increases in ruminal escape of dietary protein compensating for lowered microbial protein synthesis when RCS replaced GS. Furthermore, RCS increased the partitioning of dietary N in feces and urine and lowered N secretion in milk. A less efficient utilization of N for milk protein synthesis on diets containing RCS appeared to be associated with lower bioavailability of AA and a possible imbalance between AA supply and requirements for milk protein synthesis. Substituting GS for RCS in the diet enriched milk fat 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 concentrations, with no evidence of differences in the bioavailability of PUFA or synthesis of 4- to 16-carbon SFA de novo in the mammary glands due to forage species. For all diets, a substantial proportion of 15:0, 17:0, and The authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of staff at the Metabolism Unit of MTT Agrifood Research Finland (Jokioinen, Finland) for the care of experimental animals and the collection of experimental samples under the supervision of Laila Hakkarainen and chemical analysis undertaken in the MTT laboratory under the guidance of Taina Jalava.
