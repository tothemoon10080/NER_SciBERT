Distal radius fractures are among the most common fractures of the upper extremity. Indications for operative and nonsurgical management have evolved over time, as have fixation techniques. Volar locking plates are commonly used in the treatment of selected distal radius fractures such as low-energy or relatively uncomplicated fractures. They have limitations, however, in the management of highly comminuted fracture patterns and in polytrauma patients. In these patients, other methods ranging from spanning fixation to fragment-specific fixation have emerged as useful alternatives in the surgeonâ€™s armamentarium for treatment of these challenging fractures.
