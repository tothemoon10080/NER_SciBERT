The nature of growth of hard surface layers consisting of a titanium diboride (TiB2) layer and a titanium boride (TiB) whisker layer on titanium, and the kinetics have been critically examined. High density of nanostructured TiB whiskers have been found to form in the sub-layer in most conditions. A very surprising and unusual result is the kinetics of growth of TiB whiskers at temperatures within a few degrees of the beta transus â€“ the whiskers grew denser and to depths larger than that at any other temperature investigated. Specifically, the nature of growth of titanium borides on the surfaces of commercially pure (CP-Ti) titanium, across the alpha and beta phase fields of titanium has not been completely understood. In our past work The objective of this work was to explore the kinetics of growth of layers on CP titanium at temperatures in the alpha and beta phase fields. Additionally, we explored the nature of coating growth at a temperature (900 Samples of commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti, Grade 2, Composition in wt.%: 0.3 Fe, 0.25 O, 0.1 C, 0.03 N, 0.015 H and 0.3 max. other elements) were polished to 800 grit surface finish. Similar to the earlier study  SEM micrographs of samples borided at 1050 In view of the above findings, a question arose naturally, as to what would be the structure and kinetics of boride layers (TiB The square of the continuous TiB That the total (TiB In conclusion, solid state diffusion of B into CP titanium results in a two layer coating comprised of an outer, continuous TiB The research was supported by the Office of Economic Development of the State of Utah (Center of Excellence Program) as well as by Ortho Development Corporation, Draper, UT.
