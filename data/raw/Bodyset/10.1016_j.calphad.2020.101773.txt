For a binary ordered solid solution, the configurational microscopic state of the system is described in terms of the correlation functions (CFs). In CE – CVM, these are functions of point CF (u
                     0, which is related to the composition), the Bragg-Williams long range order parameter (ξ), temperature (T) and cluster expansion coefficients (CECs). In this communication, a detailed procedure for obtaining the limiting values of the CFs (defined in the orthogonal basis) and their derivatives with respect to u
                     0 and ξ at the stoichiometric composition in the limit of perfect ordering is presented for several frequently occurring binary ordered phases based on bcc, fcc and cph structures. This is achieved by defining new bases called sublattice solvent bases. The results are given for the cases of the B2, B32 and D03 ordered phases based on the bcc structure using (irregular) tetrahedron (T) approximation of CE – CVM, the L10 and L12 ordered phases based on the fcc structure using (regular) tetrahedron (T) and tetrahedron-octahedron (TO) approximations as well as the L11 phase using TO approximation and the B19 and D019 ordered phases based on the cph structure using triangle-tetrahedron (TT) and TO approximations. In all these cases, limiting values of the CFs and their first derivatives with respect to u
                     0 and ξ are independent of CECs and T, while the higher order derivatives are dependent on the ratios of CECs and T. It is shown that the equilibrium values of CFs in the sublattice solvent bases can be calculated to much lower temperatures than those possible with CFs in orthogonal basis.Computational thermodynamics provides an integrated framework for representing thermodynamics and phase equilibria of alloy systems and is widely used based on the CALPHAD method [ Cluster expansion in the conventional basis for functions such as the energy of formation of an alloy is usually terminated for a finite cluster size [ Kikuchi [ The results of CE – CVM as a solution model in thermodynamics have been obtained in literature only to a limited extent. Sarma Section In addition to the Consider a crystalline system exhibiting long range chemical order having In the absence of vacancies, every site is occupied by one of the atoms of the chosen system. Hence, for the site Another operator, called site operator ( Using eqs. The choice of CE – CVM is formulated in terms of a basic cluster or set of clusters of atomic sites. A specific occupation of these sites by A or B atoms constitutes a cluster configuration. Each symmetry-wise distinct cluster in the disordered cluster is identified with a serial number In a similar manner, CVs corresponding to larger clusters can be expressed as linear functions of the CFs ( The point CFs corresponding to the two sublattices of the ordered phase are related to point CF of its disordered counterpart ( The multiplicities of the ordered clusters are denoted as The Bragg-Williams long range order parameter Using cluster expansion [ The The CVM configurational entropy of mixing is written in terms of the Boltzmann entropy summations of the subclusters ( The configurational Helmholtz energy of mixing is thus written as For a given set of CECs, the equilibrium values of CFs corresponding to a thermodynamic state defined by It is convenient to introduce a set of dimensionless parameters Sarma In the present paper, a separate solvent basis is chosen for each sublattice with The irregular tetrahedron cluster in The details of the distinct clusters in the The point CFs corresponding to the two sublattices in the Further, the Bragg-Williams long range order parameter For the limiting case of perfect order in stoichiometric The configurational energy, entropy and Helmholtz energy of mixing can be obtained by substituting from Using these relations, one can write the configurational energy of mixing as well as the configurational entropy of mixing in terms of Further simplification of equilibrium equations such as those in Eq. At the stoichiometric composition for the state of perfect order, The first order variation of By considering Taylor series expansion of equilibrium equations given in Eq. The limiting derivatives of the transformed CFs with respect to A similar methodology can be used to obtain limiting values of higher order derivatives of the CFs. Using Eq. Considering the total derivative of CFs in the orthogonal basis with respect to Similarly, the limiting values of second derivatives of the CFs in the orthogonal basis with respect to Calculation of the third derivatives of the CFs in the orthogonal basis involves first derivative of the CFs in the sublattice solvent bases, which are given in Eqs. The tetrahedron cluster used in the formulation for the This structure consists of two sublattices, Using these data, the configurational energy and the entropy of mixing for the The CFs in the orthogonal basis can be expressed in terms of those in the sublattice solvent bases in a manner similar to that followed for the As in the case of The limiting values of first derivatives of the CFs with respect to Using the relations among the CFs in the sublattice-solvent bases and those in the orthogonal basis, the limiting values The CVM configurational entropy of mixing ( These equilibrium equations in the simplified form when used with initial values of transformed CFs estimated using the limiting values become amenable to numerical solutions to much lower temperatures compared to the conventional procedures using CFs in the orthogonal basis. An illustration of the above for For It can be observed from For It is evident from the above calculations that transforming the CFs to sublattice solvent bases yields a set of equilibrium equations using which equilibrium CFs can be calculated to much lower temperatures in all the cases with proper selection of initial The limiting values of CFs in the orthogonal basis CFs and their first derivatives with respect to The authors declare that the raw data required to reproduce these findings are available, and they have no conflict of interest.
