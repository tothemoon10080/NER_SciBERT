                     x)KNLNS–xCT ceramics shifted from the coexistence of two phases to tetragonal phase with the addition of CT, and then changed from tetragonal phase to pseudo-cubic phase with further increase of CT. The relatively density of the (1−
                     x)KNLNS–xCT ceramics was improved for the formation of liquid phase caused by CT, and the Curie temperature and ferroelectric properties of the ceramics decrease with the increase of CaTiO3. The related physical mechanisms for these phenomena were also discussed. These results indicate that the CT strongly affects the phase structure, microstructure and ferroelectric properties of the (K0.50Na0.50)NbO3-based ceramics.Pb(Zr Considerable attention for lead-free piezoelectric ceramics was recently given to (K In this work, CaTiO The (1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization of the ceramics was performed using Cu Kα radiation (    The temperature dependence of the dielectric constant ( The Effects of the CaTiO This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 50410179 and 50772068) and the Foundation of Doctor Training Program in University and College in China (Grant No. 20030610035).
