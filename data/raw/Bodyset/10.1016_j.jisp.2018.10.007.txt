Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a prototype of heritable ectopic mineralization disorders, is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system, with protean manifestations ( Significant progress in understanding the pathomechanistic details how Recently, ABCC6 was found to mediate the cellular release of ATP through a not yet known mechanism, which is rapidly converted extracellularly into AMP and PPi, suggesting an unanticipated role of PPi homeostasis in the pathogenesis of PXE ( We tested the potential efficacy of these prototypic bisphosphonates, etidronate and alendronate, for the treatment of PXE. Specifically, these bisphosphonates were administered orally or by subcutaneous injections to Collectively, an appropriate PPi to inorganic phosphate ratio is critical for prevention of ectopic mineralization under homeostatic conditions. PXE, a rare heritable disorder, serves as a genetic model for common ectopic mineralization disorders, particularly arteriosclerosis. The “PXE story” is a paradigm of progress in heritable disorders with a pathway from gene discovery to signaling mechanisms and potential therapy. PXE is an example of evolving application of precision medicine to dermatological disorders. The authors state no conflict of interest.
