In conventional solvent extraction processes, Pt(IV) and Pd(II) are separated by selective stripping from the loaded amines. Solvent extraction experiments were done to find extraction conditions to selectively extract Pd(II) over Pt(IV) from HCl solutions in the concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M. For this purpose, cationic, neutral and amines were employed to investigate the extraction behavior of the two metals from the single solution. LIX 63 and Cyanex 301 showed a selectivity for Pd(II) over Pt(IV) in the HCl concentration ranges tested in this work. The extraction percentage of Pd(II) by LIX 63 was greatly reduced as HCl concentration was higher than 7 M, while Pd(II) was completely extracted by Cyanex 301 even from 9 M HCl solution. FT-IR spectra of fresh and loaded Cyanex 301 showed that strong interaction occurred between Pd(II) complex and the PS bond in Cyanex 301. Therefore, it was very difficult to strip Pd(II) from the loaded Cyanex 301. The separation behavior of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) was compared between Cyanex 301 and LIX 63. Although the separation factor by Cyanex 301 was a little higher than that by LIX 63, LIX 63 was recommended as a suitable extractant for the selective extraction of Pd(II) over Pt(IV) owing to the ease of stripping of Pd(II) from the loaded LIX 63.Palladium and platinum are widely employed in the manufacture of the advanced materials with special functions ( In general, the separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II) by solvent extraction is difficult because the extraction behavior of these two metals by commercial extractants is similar to each other. Therefore, extensive research has been done to find extraction systems by which either Pt(IV) or Pd(II) is selectively extracted from the hydrochloric acid solution. There are several extractants which can selectively extract Pd(II) over Pt(IV) from hydrochloric acid solution, namely, 2-hydroxy-5-nonylacetophenone oxime (LIX 84I) ( A key point in the separation of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) by solvent extraction is to find an appropriate extractant and to design suitable separation procedures. For this purpose, solvent extraction experiments were performed to investigate the conditions to separate Pd(II) and Pt(IV) from HCl solution in the concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M in this work. LIX 63 selectively extracts Pd(II) over Pt(IV), Ir(IV) and Rh(III) from strong hydrochloric acid solutions ( Synthetic chloride solution containing Pd(II) and Pt(IV) was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of PdCl Cyanex 272, Cyanex 301, and Cyanex 923 were provided by Cytec Inc. LIX 84I, LIX 63, TOA, and Alamine 336 were supplied by BASF Co. D2EHPA, PC 88A, and TBP were products of Daihachi Chem. and Yakuri Pure Chemical Co, respectively. These reagents were used without further purification. Kerosene (Samchun Pure Chem. Co.) was employed as a diluent. The chemical formulas of these extractants are given in Extraction experiments were carried out at room temperature by mixing equal volumes (10 mL) of the aqueous and organic phase. After shaking the mixture for 30 min using a Wrist Action Shaker (Burrell model 75, USA), the two phases were then separated using a separatory funnel. The concentration of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) in the aqueous phase before and after extraction was determined in the form of iodine complexes and stannous chloride method by using ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan) (   The concentration of Pd(II) in the leaching solution of the secondary resources is in the range of 50–500 mg/L ( Although there is some difference in the acid dissociation constants of the cationic extractants employed in this work, Pd(II) was completely extracted by Cyanex 301 even in 9 M HCl solution, indicating that acidity alone cannot explain the extraction of Pd(II) by Cyanex 301. The reason might be attributed to the difference in the chemical structure. The functional group of Cyanex 301 is thiophosphoryl group (-PSSH), while that of D2EHPA, PC 88A, and Cyanex 272 is phosphoryl group (-POOH) ( In the case of LIX 84I, the extraction percentage of Pd(II) fell off from 64 to 4% with an increase of HCl concentration. Similar to LIX 84I, the extraction of Pd(II) by LIX 63 decreased sharply from 100 to 5% as HCl concentration increased from 0.5 to 9 M. According to the works on the extraction of Pd(II) from strong hydrochloric acid solutions by LIX 63 and LIX 84I, the solvent extraction reaction is assumed to occur by solvation reaction ( The effect of the HCl concentration on the extraction of Pd(II) by TBP, Cyanex 923, TOA, and Alamine 336 is shown in The difference in the extraction of Pd(II) between TBP and Cyanex 923 might be related to hydrogen ion during the extraction. Since the interaction between hydrogen ion and Cyanex 923 is much stronger than that with TBP ( In the case of TOA and Alamine 336, the extraction of Pd(II) was complete and then decreased significantly to 40%. In the extraction of anionic complexes by tertiary amines like TOA and Alamine 336, the lone electron pair of N in a tertiary amine (R When HCl concentration is high, HCl is extracted by tertiary amine and the effective concentration of tertiary amine would be decreased, resulting in low extraction percentage of metal. This is in good agreement with our extraction data by TOA and Alamine 336. According to the data in previous section, the extraction percentage of Pd(II) by LIX 63, LIX 84I, and Cyanex 923 depends on the HCl concentration, while Cyanex 301 could completely extract Pd(II) from the HCl concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M. It is important to find out whether Pd(II) can be completely extracted by LIX 63, LIX 84I, and Cyanex 923 from strong HCl solutions. Therefore, solvent extraction experiments were performed by varying the concentration of LIX 63, LIX 84I and Cyanex 923 at several HCl concentrations (1, 5, and 9 M). In these experiments, the concentration of LIX 84I and Cyanex 923 was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 M, while that of LIX 63 was varied from 0.003 to 0.05 M. The concentration of Pd(II) was fixed at 100 mg/L, and the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase was unity.  Based on the data in Section First, the effect of Cyanex 301 concentration on the extraction of Pd(II) was investigated by varying its concentration from 0.003 to 0.05 M at 1, 5, and 9 M HCl. In these experiments, the concentration of Pd(II) was fixed at 100 mg/L. Second, the concentration of Pd(II) was varied from 100 to 2000 mg/L to check the occurrence of the polymerization of the extracted Pd(II) species in the organic phase. These experiments were done at 1 and 5 M HCl solutionss, and Cyanex 301 concentration was fixed at 0.02 M. The extraction percentage of Pd(II) decreased significantly from 100% to 21 and 17% as Pd(II) concentration increased at 1 and 5 M HCl, respectively. The extraction isotherm of Pd(II) by Cyanex 301 is shown in In solvent extraction process, stripping is important in terms of metal recovery and the regeneration of an extractant. Therefore, the stripping experiments of Pd(II) from loaded Cyanex 301 were performed. The Pd(II) in loaded Cyanex 301 was obtained by contacting 0.02 M Cyanex 301 to the aqueous solution containing 100 mg/L Pd(II) at 5 M HCl. The volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase was unity. The concentration of Pd(II) in the loaded organic was 97.5 mg/L and this organic was employed for stripping experiments. Based on the HSAB concept, Pd(II) and sulfur in Cyanex 301 molecule are soft acid-bases. Therefore, some soft base reagents containing the anion, such as SCN To get further insight on the interaction between Cyanex 301 and Pd(II) during extraction, the FT-IR spectra of the fresh Cyanex 301 and the loaded Cyanex 301 with Pd(II) were compared. The FT-IR spectra of fresh Cyanex 301 (before extraction) showed the bands of P To investigate the appropriate extractants for the separation of Pt(IV) and Pd(II), some of the extractants employed in the extraction of Pd(II) in previous section were employed for the extraction of Pt(IV). In these experiments, the concentration of Pt(IV) was fixed at 100 mg/L and the concentration of these extractants was fixed at 0.1 M and the volume ratio of organic to aqueous phase was unity. Most of Pt(IV) was completely extracted by TOA and Alamine 336, irrespective of the HCl concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M. The extraction percentage of Pt(IV) by Cyanex 301 decreased significantly from 30 to 10% as the concentration of HCl increased from 0.5 M to 9 M, while that by the other extractants (Cyanex 272, D2EHPA, PC 88A, LIX 63, and LIX 84I) was negligible. The results in previous sections indicate that Pd(II) can be selectively extracted over Pt(IV) by either Cyanex 301 or LIX 63. Moreover, both Pd(II) and Pt(IV) were extracted well by Cyanex 923, TOA and Alamine 336 in the HCl concentration from 0.5 to 5 M. However, the extraction percentage of Pt(IV) by Cyanex 923, TOA and Alamine 336 was much higher than that of Pd(II) when HCl concentration was higher than 5 M. In our data, some of Pt(IV) was extracted by Cyanex 301, while no Pt(IV) was extracted by LIX 63. In terms of separation efficiency, selective extraction of Pd(II) by either LIX 63 or Cyanex 301 seems to result in higher separation factor. Therefore, solvent extraction experiments were performed from the mixed solutions containing Pd(II) and Pt(IV) by employing Cyanex 301 and LIX 63. In these experiments, the concentration of the two metals was fixed at 100 mg/L in the HCl concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M. Two concentrations of LIX 63 and Cyanex 301 (0.01 and 0.02 M) were employed and the volume ratio of organic to aqueous was unity. The variation in the extraction of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) with Cyanex 301 is presented in Although the separation factor between Pd(II) and Pt(IV) by Cyanex 301 was higher than that by LIX 63, stripping of the Pd(II) from the loaded Cyanex 301 was very difficult compared to that from the loaded LIX 63. When HCl concentration is lower than 7 M, LIX 63 can extract Pd(II) completely and thus seems to be a better agent to selectively extract Pd(II) over Pt(IV). When HCl concentration is higher than 7 M, the extraction percentage of Pd(II) by LIX 63 decreased rapidly and thus several stages of counter current extraction would be necessary to completely extract Pd(II). Moreover, some more work should be done to find effective agents to strip Pd(II) from the loaded Cyanex 301. Solvent extraction experiments were performed to separate Pd(II) and Pt(IV) in the HCl concentration range from 0.5 to 9 M. Among the extractants employed in this work, Cyanex 301 extracted completely Pd(II) from the HCl concentration ranges tested in this work, while the extraction percentage of Pd(II) by LIX 63, LIX 84I, Cyanex 923, TOA, and Alamine 336 was rapidly decreased when HCl concentration was higher than 7 M. Comparison of the FT-IR between fresh and the loaded Cyanex 301 indicated that strong interaction between Pd(II) and Cyanex 301 occurred at P The Pt(IV) was completely extracted by TOA, Alamine 336, and Cyanex 923 in our experimental range, while the extraction percentage of Pt(IV) by LIX 63 and Cyanex 301 was very low. Therefore, the separation behavior of the two metals was compared between Cyanex 301 and LIX 63. The separation factor between the two metals by Cyanex 301 was little affected by HCl concentration, whereas the separation factor by LIX 63 was greatly reduced when HCl concentration was higher than 7 M. Although the extraction percentage of Pd(II) by LIX 63 was low when HCl concentration was higher than 7 M, ease of stripping of Pd(II) from the loaded LIX 63 should be considered in selecting the separation system.
