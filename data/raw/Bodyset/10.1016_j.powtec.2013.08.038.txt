Over the last 30 To appreciate the contribution and inspiration of Dr. Colin Thornton in the application of DEM to particle technology, this special issue on discrete element modelling was initiated on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 2011. Contributions from research groups worldwide were solicited, from which 15 invited papers are reported in this special issue. These invited papers report recent developments in discrete element modelling with special application to particle technology and cover a wide range of relevant topics, which include a review of the application of the discrete element method (DEM) in comminution The wide spectrum of discrete element modelling reported in this special issue is hopefully useful to the powder technology community. Although the work presented in this special issue and those reported in the literature demonstrate the robustness and diversity of application of discrete element modelling, many challenges remain. These include Realistic parameterisation of particles for DEM modelling, Thorough validation of discrete element modelling, Dramatic improvement of computational efficiency to meet the need of industrial applications; Rigorous modelling of the change in particle geometries (i.e. deformable particles) using DEM. It is also anticipated that the publication of this special issue will stimulate further research in discrete element modelling to address these challenges. I would like to thank Prof. Jonathan Seville, the editor-in-chief of Powder Technology, for his support and encouragement in publishing this special issue and the editorial office of Powder Technology at Elsevier for their help and guidance. I also wish to acknowledge all authors and reviewers for their contributions, support and cooperation. I am very grateful to Colin Thornton for his inspiration in much of the work reported in this special issue and wish him many happy returns.
