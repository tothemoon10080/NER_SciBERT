With the assistance of inorganic salt, graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets were prepared with increased mesoporous surface area for promoting the photocatalytic performance compared with the one without. Series of photocatalysts with different mass ratio of NH4NO3/melamine were prepared and characterized by XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, SEM, N2 physical adsorption, UV–vis and PL spectrometries. Photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation (λ>420nm) was applied to evaluate catalytic properties. The catalytic activity maximizes at an intermediate NH4NO3/melamine ratio at 0.15, giving a maximum performance, RhB totally being degraded within 30min and kinetic constant reaching 0.167min−1 that is 4.5 times as high as that on BCN. The NH4NO3 assisted procedure is a facile, repeatable, environmental friendly, and efficient method for preparing g-C3N4 nanosheets with high photocatalytic performance.Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C In this work, g-C Graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized from the thermal condensation of melamine with or without the assistance of NH The crystal structure of the as-prepared samples BCN and CN15 were characterized with XRD, FT-IR, and XPS spectra, which together demonstrated the characteristic structure of g-C The optical properties of the CNx samples were characterized with UV–vis and PL spectra and displayed in The photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation was applied as a probe reaction to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of the CNx samples.
