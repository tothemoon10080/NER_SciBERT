The thermal decomposition process of jarosite residue and the solubility of various oxides presented in the decomposed residue in NH4Cl-H2O system were studied. The results of heat decomposition of jarosite residue show that the insoluble ZnFe2O4 phase in the residue can be decomposed at temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 650 °C for 1 h. The OLI Systems software was used to study the thermodynamics of the solubility of various metal oxides existing in the decomposed residue in NH4Cl-H2O system. The results show that the solubility of ZnO, PbO, CdO, CuO and Ag2O is high, while the solubility of Fe2O3 is less than 10−4 mol/L in the pH range from 4.0 to 9.0. The calculated data are in accordance with the experimental results.
