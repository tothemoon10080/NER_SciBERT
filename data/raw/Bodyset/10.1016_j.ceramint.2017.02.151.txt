Duplex ceramic coatings, consisting of an inner NiCr-Cr3C2-based coating and an outmost AlCrN film, were produced on the steel substrate in succession by velocity oxygen-fuel spraying (HVOF) and cathodic vacuum arc methods, and then isochronally annealed at annealing temperatures below 900°C for 2h. The thermal stability and mechanical properties of the annealed samples were systematically studied by means of X-ray diffraction, Optical microscope and transmission electron microscope, in association with mechanical property measurements. The results show that the microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical properties of duplex ceramic coatings are significantly dependent on the annealing temperature. Metastable fcc-AlCrN solid solution in AlCrN film first decomposes to rich-Al and rich-Cr domains by spinodal decomposition at 700°C, leading to a notable increase in hardness due to its smaller grain size and high elastic strain field, and then to equiaxed hcp-AlN and Cr2N by the nucleation and growth at 900°C, leading to a notable decrease in hardness due to the recrystallization and the formation of hcp-AlN. Meanwhile, the both decarburization of Cr3C2 to Cr7C3 occurs at 800°C, but becomes more intensive at 900°C, leading to a notable loss in hardness. In addition, the dissolution of Cr3C2 produces high density of porosity, which also reduces the hardness. The hardness tests show the following ordering of load-bearing capacity for the duplex ceramic coatings: 700°C>As-deposited >800°C>900°C. Tribological property measurements demonstrate that the wear resistance of the tested duplex ceramic coatings obeys the following ordering: 700°C>As-deposited >800°C>900°C. The improved wear resistance is due to high surface hardness, load-bearing capacity and thermal stability. In addition, the wear mechanisms are shown.With the developments of reduced vehicle weight, improved safety and crashworthiness, high-strength steels of up to 1500 Metal nitride films, produced by physical vapor deposition (PVD), have been widely applied in cutting and cold forming devices due to high hardness, excellent wear resistance, high thermal stability and high oxidation resistance Details of the HVOF-sprayed NiCr-75 Prior to microstructural characterization, the HVOF-PVD duplex coated samples were ultrasonically cleaned in alcohol for 30 The adhesion strength of the AlCrN film to substrate was quantificationally tested by a HT-3001 multifunctional scratch tester with a diamond Rockwell indenter at a constant of 2 In previous study, the phase structure of the NiCr-Cr  It has been reported that the mechanical properties, especially tribological properties, are significantly affected by surface macro-particles (MPs) In order to further demonstrate the structure evolutions in as-deposited and annealed HVOF-sprayed coatings of the tested duplex coatings, SEM was performed, and corresponding results are shown in In order to avoid the negative effects of surface macro-particles, zero drift and plastic deformation of the substrate, the indentation depth should be in the range of 50 The H and E values have been directly obtained from the loading-unloading curves, and the E Surface hardness under different indentation loads can reflect a comprehensive hardness of the outmost PVD coating and the inward supporting matrix The adhesion strength of the AlCrN film to substrate was tested by the scratch tester at room temperature, and scratch tracks were observed by OM. The overall scratch processes can be divided into three stages: the fine cracks stage, the peeling off stage and the complete peeling off stage, and corresponding critical loads are successively denoted as LC1, LC2 and LC3  In order to further demonstrate the wear behaviors and wear mechanisms of the tested samples, the wear tracks were systematically characterized by means of OM, AlphaStep P-7 tester and EDS. As shown in For the as-deposited-sample, the wear tracks are mainly composed of gray and white zones as shown in In this work, the NiCr-75wt%Cr Decomposition of metastable fcc-AlCrN solid solution to coherently rich-Al and rich-Cr domains produces a strong strengthening effect for the annealed AlCrN film at 700 According to tribological property test, affinity of PVD coating with WC is as follows: 700 Following sequences of the as-deposited and annealed coated sample according to wear resistance test is found: 700 This work was supported by the
