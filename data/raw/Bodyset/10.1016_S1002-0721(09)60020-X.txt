The pH dependent sorption of rare earth ions (La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), Nd(III), Y(III), Sm(III), Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Lu(III), and Yb(III)) from HAC-NaAC buffer solution at 298 K by D152 resin containing -COOH function groups were presented. The sorption behaviors of D152 resin for Sm(III) were discussed as an example. The effects of operational conditions such as pH, temperature, and contact time were studied. The statically saturated sorption capacity was 510 mg/g resin at pH 6.70 in HAc-NaAc medium at 298 K. The sorption behaviors obeyed the Freundlich isotherm. The capacity value for column study was obtained by graphical integration as 495 mg/g resin. Thomas model was applied to experimental data to predict the breakthrough curve and to determine the characteristic parameters of the column useful for process design.
