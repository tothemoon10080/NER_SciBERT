The energetically favorable facet orientation of GaAs pyramids for InAs quantum dot (QD) growth was studied in terms of a crystallographic matching perspective. The predicted apparent interface is (5.611)GaAs, which agrees well with the best substrate (511)GaAs in previous experimental observations. This allows close-packed planes, (111)InAs and (

A number of questions arising from the above experimental results are: (i) why do the In The crystallographic matching analysis in the present work is conducted using the edge-to-edge matching (E2EM) model that was originally developed for predicting and understanding the crystallographic features of diffusional phase transformations in solids InAs has a face-centred cubic lattice and zinc blende structure, with a lattice parameter of Based on the lattice constants, the interatomic spacing misfit along the direction pairs, Given a pair of matching directions, [   Although the above crystallographic analysis is carried out in InAs/GaAs system, the similar approach can also be extended to In  In summary, a preferential high-index interface between the InAs QDs and the GaAs substrate has been successfully predicted based on the E2EM model.
