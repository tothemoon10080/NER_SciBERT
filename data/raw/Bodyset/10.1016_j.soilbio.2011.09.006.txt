In view of the predicted climate change in Central Europe, preventive forestry adaptation strategies are currently being developed in Germany to maintain stable forest ecosystems with high biodiversity. Mediterranean, drought-tolerant oak species such as Quercus pubescens, Quercus frainetto and Quercus ilex are being evaluated as future forest trees for German forest sites which are becoming increasingly dry. The present study represents first investigations concerning the influence of these introduced species on local soil-biological processes, especially primary leaf litter decomposition. The feeding activity of native Glomeris marginata was observed with the Mediterranean leaf litter in comparison to litter of local Quercus robur and Fagus sylvatica under laboratory conditions. In the experiments the introduced litter was readily fed upon by local millipede populations. The results furthermore show that the introduced litter is consumed at equal or even higher rates than the litter of native tree species. Leaf litter of the introduced tree species seems to have no or possibly even a positive influence on the feeding activity of G. marginata.According to current predictions of climate change in Central Europe, the average summer temperature as well as the frequency of extremely dry and hot summers will increase in the next 50–100 years ( In this process, leaf litter from primary production represents the primary food resource of the decomposer community. As a result of planting foreign tree species, the leaf litter composition and therefore the nutrient resources available to the native soil fauna will change, especially since oak leaf litter is known to decompose relatively slowly ( The present study represents the results of feeding experiments with the diplopod species The aim of the study was to determine whether local populations of this diplopod species will feed on the leaf litter of the introduced Mediterranean tree species ( The feeding experiments were undertaken with fresh, 6- and 12-month-old leaf litter. Freshly fallen litter of five different tree species ( Adult The feeding experiments with Feeding rates during the experiments were determined by measuring the surface-area loss of each litter sample with an image analysis program (Carl Zeiss KS 300) in 48-h intervals (fresh litter: 72-h). Since the five species of leaf litter have different masses per leaf area (especially At the end of each feeding experiment, each remaining litter sample was oven dried as above and subsequently weighed. Consumption (mass loss) by To test for significant differences in the consumption by In all five leaf litter species, C/N-ratio decreased with litter age ( In the feeding experiments, the feeding rates showed a very low, albeit constant slope on fresh leaf litter ( In all five species of leaf litter, the fresh litter was clearly less consumed than litter exposed to outdoor conditions for six and 12 months ( At the end of the experiments with freshly fallen leaf litter, the consumption of Leaf litter decomposition is an important process in the nutrient cycle of forests, in which the feeding activity of the saprophagous soil invertebrates plays an essential role. Especially oak leaf litter has higher decomposition rates in the presence of decomposer animals ( The results show that introduced leaf litter was partially more consumed than the native litter by An exception was the 12-month-old The results show, however, that more decomposing stages must be considered to estimate feeding activity, since some leaf litter species become more palatable after six months (e.g., In the tests with 6- and 12-month-old litter, the feeding activity was considerably higher in the first days of the experiments. The 24 h-starvation period before the tests could be a possible explanation for the initial high feeding rates (cf. It is difficult to compare the consumption measured here with previous feeding experiments, since results are often only given in relative and not absolute consumption, and usually other litter and macroarthropod species were tested ( These results show that litter of the Mediterranean tree species The present study was financially and logistically supported by the research funding programme “LOEWE − Landes-Offensive zur Entwicklung Wissenschaftlich-ökonomischer Exzellenz” of
