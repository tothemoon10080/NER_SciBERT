The analysis of rolling mill vibrations is usually limited to simple planar or low DOF vibrations. In reality, however, rolling mill vibrations take place in six DOF leading to spatial behaviors involving vertical, horizontal, axial, reverse, cross and swinging vibration modes resulting in complex relative motions between the rolls. In this paper, a complete spatial vibration characteristic analysis will be presented based on the modified Riccati-overall transfer matrix method. The proposed methodology will be applied to two distinct mill configurations, namely two high-stiffness mills with and without clearance in the chocks. Coupled vibration characteristics of cross and sway motions will be presented along with the complex mode shape analysis of the mills. Experimental results will be presented to prove the validity of the proposed method for spatial vibration analysis.spring constant in torsional spring constant in state vector of connection point generalized displacements state vector generalized force state vector upper roll lower roll state vector of upper roll and lower roll generalized displacements state vector of upper roll and lower roll generalized force state vector of upper roll and lower roll transfer matrices field transfer matrices of upper roll and lower roll stiffness matrices between the rolls mass matrix of upper roll and lower chocks coefficient matrices Young's modulus cross-sectional area moment inertia around linear density length of the roll element shear modulus rotational inertia per unit sub matrices of the rearrange of transfer matrix Riccati transfer matrix of point coefficient of equivalent viscous damping frictional damping force frictional coefficient rolling load vibration frequency complex frequency initial roll gap roll gap after horizontal displacement vibration Vibration phenomena in rolling mills are very common and complicated. For rolling mill vibrations, there are more studies on conventional vibration behaviors involving vertical, axial and torsional vibration modes of the rolls. However, as shown in The traditional research about vibration phenomena in rolling mills, including such a single vibration mode or coupling vibration modes of the rolls, belongs to planar vibration analysis based on some simplifications. It mainly includes torsional vibration analysis about axis of the rolls studied by A spatial vibration analysis for two high-stiffness rolling mills with different stability is conducted using modified Riccati-overall transfer matrix method to prove the validity of the proposed method. To develop an analytical method for spatial vibration analysis of rolling mill, a 250 In initial structure of this rolling mill, there is a small clearance Δ, of 2 Corresponding to spatial vibration of rolling mill, the traditional 3-DOF vibration model, including the discrete system model in which the roll is simplified as lumped mass in vertical or horizontal plane or the continuous system model in which the roll is simplified as a continuous elastomer and vibrates only in vertical plane passing through axis of the rolls, must be upgraded to 6-DOF involving three displacements and three rotation angles spatial vibration model. Mechanical model of high-stiffness rolling mill is shown in In the model, rods and square columns are simplified as continuous elastomer, however, considering the effect of rotation inertia and shear deformation, the roll is modeled as Timoshenko-beam illustrated by First, it is assumed that As shown in The coupling point element could be described by point transfer matrix introduced by The chocks assembly on operation side is taken as an example. The upper and lower chocks can be simplified as rigid bodies For the points 1–4 on upper and lower chocks, the forces of each point can be expressed by the displacements of each point based on the transfer matrix of square column and rod. According to theory of mechanics of rigid body, the displacements of points 1–4 can be transformed into the displacements of centroids From formula Based on above analysis and some basic data about dimensions and performance parameters of the roll, square column and rod, shown in Based on dimensions of main components of rolling mill and material property, the connection stiffness between components is shown in In this table, connections of some movement joints are non-constrained. However, due to some resistance of relative movement, a very small equivalent stiffness can be generated and it can be assumed to number one. Because there is damping between rod and chock bore, the stiffness at this position is assumed to zero and the damping is to be discussed in Section First, the spatial transfer matrix of beam element is discussed. If cross section of beam element has two axes of symmetry, the shear center coincides with the centroid. So Second, the spatial transfer matrix of elastomeric bearing element is shown as follows: Third, the spatial transfer matrix of spring joint element is shown as follows: The eigenvalue of transfer matrix of chain roll system is to be calculated using the overall transfer matrix method based on the Riccati transformation introduced by The state vector of a point is decomposed into two parts based on the Riccati transfer matrix method: The Riccati transformation is It is clear that Due to the heavy rolling load, the frictional damping between chock bore and spherical pad cannot be neglected and it has a great effect in horizontal and axial direction of the roll. The oil-lubricated frictional damping is non-viscous damping and it can be simplified as an equivalent viscous damping; the coefficient of equivalent viscous damping presented by Under some lubrication condition, Considering the effect of frictional damping, the spatial transfer matrix of system with damping can be obtained by that of system without damping, namely, the The frequency characteristic equation Δ( The experiment is conducted on high-stiffness mills without clearance to verify the numerical result. Using telemetering of YDSP dynamic testing systems for mechanical parameter, the vibrating spectrum of vertical, horizontal and axial direction can be obtained by fixing accelerometer on the bottom of upper and lower chocks on drive side with sampling frequency of 50 The results demonstrate that: (1) For each natural frequency of mill without clearance, numerical results basically agree with experimental results; (2) Whether considering damping, each natural frequency of mill without clearance, compared with that of mill with clearance, markedly increases, especially the first order and third order natural frequency have increased four times; (3) For complex frequency of either of two mills, as increase of order of frequency, the real part Due to mode shapes are complex numbers, the complex mode shape module calculation with sign of the real part is done to make sure that complex mode shape can be much easier expressed. To illustrate spatial vibration of the roll, The amplitudes of the first four complex mode shapes of rolling mill with clearance are shown in The first order mode shape for two rolls is the axial displacement mode shape in the Then the discussion is focused on the horizontal cross mode shape between two rolls. First, the dynamic abnormal axial force caused by cross leads to short service life of end-thrust roller bearing. Second, inequality of horizontal displacement shown in The amplitudes of the first four complex mode shapes of rolling mill without clearance are shown in The first and third order mode shapes for two rolls, shown in Based on the above mode shape analysis of two rolling mills, it can be seen that for two high rolling mill without clearance, the axial vibration could be avoided and the two rolls are approximately parallel in the horizontal ( In this paper, the concept of spatial vibration of rolling mill is proposed and the modified Riccati-overall transfer matrix method is given. The complete spatial vibration characteristic analysis and experiment are presented to demonstrate the existence of spatial vibration of rolling mill and the validity of proposed method for spatial vibration analysis. The following conclusions can be drawn: Rolling mill vibrations take place in 6-DOF leading to spatial behaviors involving vertical, horizontal, axial, reverse, cross and swinging vibration modes. Based on the complex mode shape analysis, the existence of unrecognized vibration modes involving horizontal, cross and swinging unusual behaviors and its effect on the quality of rolled product are revealed to demonstrate the need of spatial vibration analysis for rolling mill. For the high-stiffness rolling mill, each natural frequency greatly increases and the cross vibration between two rolls is prevented through structural improvement. These advantages have a great significance for the rolling mill to be operated with a much higher rolling speed and improve the yield of products. Damping has effect on natural frequency of rolling mill and this effect gradually becomes apparent as increase of rolling speed. The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Doctoral fund of
