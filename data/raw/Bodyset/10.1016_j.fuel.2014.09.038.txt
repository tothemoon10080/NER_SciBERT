An investigation was undertaken to determine the distribution of chemical-, petrographic- and mineralogical properties of large coal particles of different sizes and densities and to evaluate a suitable reaction rate model for combustion of corresponding chars. This was undertaken in order to contribute to the knowledge of the combustion kinetics of large particles in fluidized bed combustion and moving bed combustion/gasification. The study was confined to a mineral rich (24.1wt%) and inertinite rich (74wt%) parent coal (precursor) that was separated into different sizes and density fractions. The combustion reactive properties of chars prepared at 1100°C and at a reaction temperature of 1000°C were determined using a horizontal tubular furnace with the associated on-line analysers and temperature controllers. Coal particles in the size range of 0.50–53mm diameter and density from 1.4gcm−3 to 2.0gcm−3 were studied. The characterisation of the different coal samples consisting of ash content, maceral content, fuel ratios and calorific values showed that the parameters did not vary significantly over the particle size ranges, but were different for the different density fractions. Combustion studies showed that particle size and density influenced the time required for complete conversion of the chars. The smaller particles and low density particles reacted faster and the modeling of the experimental data showed that the isothermal shrinking un-reacted core model with film and ash layer diffusion was applicable. The effective ash layer diffusion becomes more prominent as the density increased and the mass transfer coefficients correlated well with published results.stoichiometric coefficient (carbon oxygen reaction) (−) carbon (−) concentration of reactant gas (mol particle diameter (m) effective ash layer diffusion coefficient (m film mass transfer coefficient (m molar weight of carbon B (g molar weight of diffusing gas (g Reynolds number particle radius (m) time (s) gas velocity (m conversion of carbon B (−) molar density of carbon B (kmol kinematic viscosity of air (m It is well-known that the particle properties of coal have a significant influence on its devolatilization, combustion and gasification behaviour and needs to be examined in greater detail for the optimisation of future coal conversion processes. These properties include particle size, physical structure (morphology), chemical-, petrographic- and mineral composition The reaction rate modeling for large particles can be expected to consist of diffusion mechanisms around the particle (film/boundary layer), through as ash layer and inside pores together with surface (intrinsic) chemical reactions. Reaction rate models for reaction rate controlled systems, essentially for fine coal particles, have been proposed and validated which include the shrinking core model and the random pore model Thus, in order to contribute to the understanding of the use of large particles for combustion, an investigation was undertaken to examine the properties of different size particles and density fractions and to assess the overall reaction kinetics. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to present results showing the distribution of results obtained from proximate, ultimate petrographic and mineralogical analyses for different size particles and different density fractions, and (2) to show the validity of the isothermal shrinking core model involving experimental and detailed modeling results. Samples for the characterisation and combustion experiments were prepared according to a systematic procedure involving essentially the separation of a typical South African coal batch (parent coal) into different density fractions followed by separation into different particle size ranges as shown in The original coal batch was density separated into the density fractions shown in For the combustion experiments, chars were synthesized using the coal particles prepared above followed by mechanical treatment to ensure exact particle sizes and densities shown in Chars were prepared (Section The proximate analyses and calorific values were done by the South African Bureau of Standards, Pretoria, South Africa, according to the standards shown in A horizontal tubular reactor shown in The coal samples with different sizes and densities ( The standard properties obtained from proximate, petrographic and mineralogical analyses of the different particle sizes and density fractions were used to assess the distribution of ash, macerals/microlithotypes, minerals, fuel ratios and calorific values distributed between the different size and density fractions. The distribution of ash content according to the proximate analysis is shown in An increase of ash content with increasing particle density is evident from The distribution of macerals between the different density fractions are shown in The inertite mono-maceral group makes up the bulk of the microlithotypes in each fraction with a maximum value at the intermediate density fractions. The vitrite mono-maceral is mainly found in the lowest density fraction, with minor inclusions in the other fractions. The intermediate groups show a steady decrease from the lightest to the heaviest fraction. The most prominent intermediate group was found to be the combined vitrinite and inertinite containing group known as vitrinertite. The carbominerite groups show a distinct increase from the lightest to the heaviest fraction. This again shows the tendency of the mineral groups to concentrate towards the heavy density fractions. The minerite groups increase from the lightest to the heaviest density fractions, with an almost exponential increase observed at high densities, as most of the mineral matter is concentrated in these fractions. Thus it can be seen that there is an increase in mineral-containing groups from the lightest to the heaviest density fractions, while the opposite trend is observed for the mono-maceral and intermediate groups. The mineral distributions between the different density fractions (raw coal) as determined by QEMSCAN are shown in Also the minerals present ( The fuel ratios for all the coal samples are shown in The volatile matter released for the different particle sizes and density fractions according to the proximate analysis are shown in However, the volatiles released for the different density fraction was found to be high for the lowest density fraction (1.4 Previous research has shown that the volatile matter decreases as the density increases The fixed carbon content also changes, but with a reversed behaviour in accordance with proximate analysis (daf). The fuel ratios are thus influenced by both the variation of mineral composition and maceral content over the density ranges examined. The calorific values for all the samples are shown in From the experiments for the determination of a suitable temperature ramp to ensure no fragmentation during combustion, it was found that fragmentation decreases with decreasing heating rates, and that a heating rate of 15 The results obtained from the horizontal tubular reactor involving the combustion of chars which were used for the evaluation of the model are shown in A visual examination of the combustion process was carried out to establish the depletion of the carbon within the particle as a function of conversion in order to constitute a reaction rate model. This was readily achieved with the large particles used and with an optical microscope. A typical result for the combustion of 30 The isothermal model with the different controlling mechanisms (regimes) describing the shrinking core model consisting of gas film diffusion; ash layer diffusion; and chemical reaction The results of the calculation are shown for the different sizes and different densities in The values obtained for the film mass transfer coefficients for all the experiments vary between 6.1 For the effect of different densities (fixed particle size), it was found that the mass transfer coefficient was the largest for the low density fraction which was very porous and very different to the high density fractions. This can be seen from the photographs shown in The effective diffusion coefficients for the ash layer obtained for all the experiments are in good agreement with results from literature The effect of particle size on the ash layer diffusion coefficients, especially for the larger particles, is constant, confirming again the invariant behaviour of very large particles. There is however a correlation between the particle density and the effective ash layer diffusion, with the coefficient decreasing (lower reactivity) with particle density, indicating that the heavier densities are denser with low porosities (Knudson diffusion in combination with molecular diffusion), a trend that was also observed by Chen and Kojima The ratio of the minerals and macerals between different coal particle sizes was found to be relatively invariable, whereas for the different density fractions this ratio increased with increasing density. The inertinite and carbominerite content of the coal samples increased with particle density as a result of higher densities Combustion experiments were confined to char particles in the range 20–40 Experimental combustion results showed that the rate of carbon conversion was dependant on particle size and density with the smaller particles and high density fractions being more active. Since the different particles have different properties a reaction rate model was developed with characteristic parameters to analyse these results. It was found that a shrinking core model with film and ash layer diffusion only was applicable. This model agrees with observations made on char samples taken at different reaction times and examined with a microscope, which clearly showed a decreasing central core with conversion (time). The mass transfer coefficients were found to be in accordance with values presented in literature and that derived diffusion parameters could be related to some of the coal and char properties.
