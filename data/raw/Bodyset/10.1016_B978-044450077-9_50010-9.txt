The aim of this chapter is to discuss mineral characteristics related to exploitation of iron ores from the iron-formations in the Labrador Trough in Newfoundland and Quebec in Canada, and of Minette-type oolitic sedimentary ironstone in the Peace River area in Alberta, Canada. Iron is recovered from a wide variety of iron deposits, and is generally exploited by open pit mining as high tonnage operations. Parts of some deposits consist of relatively pure massive hematite and/or magnetite, and are sold in sized lumps (<6 inches) as direct shipping ore. Most iron deposits, however, consist of iron formations that contain gangue minerals. The iron-bearing minerals in these deposits need to be concentrated by mineral processing techniques, which depend upon the mineralogical characteristics of the deposits. The concentrates are usually upgraded and pelletized to meet customer specifications. The iron-formations consist mainly of hematite, magnetite, and quartz, and occur in a stratigraphic succession of meta-sedimentary rocks, which have been metamorphosed to the epidote-amphibolite and amphibolite facies.
