Environmentally appropriate and efficient recycling of several materials contained in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) requires knowledge and the identification of materials and chemical elements forming this kind of waste. Therefore, this study presents the physical and chemical characterization of desktop computer waste and the potential recycling rates of these materials. Differently from other studies, which investigated recycling and chemical composition only of motherboards (the component that contains precious metals), here were evaluate all components, namely floppy disk drives, CD drives, IDE cables, HDs, coolers, motherboards, power supply units, lids, casings, and other parts. This study was carried out in three steps: (i) the physical characterization included the manual dismantling of these components, and grouping the materials under seven categories (plastics, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, materials with substances of interest, hazardous materials, wires and cables, and other materials); (ii) potential recycling rates were calculated according to the European Directive 2102/19/EU; (iii) chemical characterization of components based on X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that the potential recycling rate of the waste analyzed was 96.66%, which represents the amount of material that can be recycled in the samples investigated. The results also show that, besides motherboards, other components also are potentially recyclable. Noble, precious, and critical metals as well as and rare earth elements were detected in IDE cables, power supply units, hard disks, floppy disk drives, and motherboards. Parts with high levels of aluminum, copper, and zinc were also observed. Recycling of WEEE is important both economically and environmentally, since PC components, since these elements may be recycled in processes that use less energy, preventing the extraction of natural raw materials and minimizing environmental impact.        In light of the growing global waste generation figures, several countries have engaged in discussions on the creation and enforcing of laws and directives towards enhancing the effectiveness of waste treatment systems and adopting proper management actions. Passed in 2010, a specific Brazilian law ( At global level, European Directive 2012/19/UE addresses exclusively WEEE, outlining instructions to prevent generation and to devise strategies for the reuse and recycling of this class of waste, in addition to other methods to improve its value. When the reuse of WEEE and its components is not possible, value chain optimization should be the most appropriate action to take ( It has been estimated that 41.8 million tons of WEEE were generated in 2014 and that this number may reach 50 million tons by 2018 ( The popularization of information technology has prompted computer (PC) sales. In 2013 approximately 2 billion PCs were in use worldwide ( Pre-treatment includes the disassembling of PCs and the separation of parts, modules, and components ( Secondary treatment includes metallurgical, chemical, and physical processes as well as energy recovery operations ( In turn, the main methods currently used to recover metals in WEEE include pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and biometallurgical operations ( Plastics are recycled according to four main approaches, namely (i) primary (re-extrusion), (ii) secondary (mechanical recycling), (iii) tertiary (chemical recycling), and(iv) quaternary recycling (energy recovery). Primary and secondary recycling are widely used, while tertiary and quaternary systems are considered to be sustainable solutions ( Several studies have looked into recycling of cables and wires as a means to separate metals (usually copper) from plastics in these materials. For example, Importantly, recycling of the variety of materials present in PC waste emerges as an opportunity to recover raw materials using environmentally friendly methods. In this sense, the increase in metal waste prices observed recently is due to the scarcity of raw materials, a consequence of the rising demand ( Another important aspect about PC waste is the presence of several chemical elements. Although the plastics present in WEEE account for 30% of this kind of waste ( More specifically, antinomy (Sb) is sold as antinomy trioxide (Sb Lead (Pb) is used in welding operations, lead-acid batteries, CRT monitors, in addition to cables and PCBs ( Although chromium (Cr) may be found in PC linings, such applications are rare ( Used to reduce flammability of PCBs, plastics, keyboards, and cables, BFRs are halogen compounds containing bromide that, together with their chlorinated counterparts (chlorinated flame retardants, CFRs) represent the most used class of flame retardants used in several industrial sectors ( Although In this scenario, the present study presents the physical and chemical characterization of central processing units (CPUs) and describes the calculation of the potential recycling rate (PRR) of PC waste. The appropriate disposal of WEEE requires specific, in-depth knowledge, and the results of the present study may be useful in the development of environmentally friendly management approaches to dispose of this class of waste. A pre-treatment unit dedicated to PC waste was established in the Laboratory of Environmental Sanitation, Civil Engineering Post-Graduation Program, University of Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS), in the city of São Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil. We analyzed the amount of WEEE disposed of by the University in 2013. Of the 903 WEEE discarded in that year, 77.6% were desktop PCs, 34% of which were horizontal IBM advanced technology extended (ATX) 5th generation PCs equipped with a Pentium 4 processor and manufactured in October 2002. Five CPUs were selected, since they represented mots WEEE disposed by the University in 2013. These CPUs were weighed, and the weight variation coefficient was calculated as a means to assess sample homogeneity. The physical characterization of PC waste was carried out by visual inspection of each CPU, as commonly conducted in WEEE pre-treatment units. Initially, each CPU was measured (height, length, and width) using a metallic measuring tape. Then, weight was obtained using 50 kg scales with a 10 g precision range (MP-50, Balmak). Next, each CPU was disassembled manually, removing, sorting, and weighing eight components: (1) floppy disk drives, (2) CD drives, (3) integrated drive electronics (IDE) cables, (4) hard disks (HD), (5) coolers, (6) motherboards, (7) power supply units (PSUs), and (8) lids, cases and other parts. Each component was sorted, weighed, and disassembled. This stage was carried out according to Concerning PCBs of components, the parts that came off more easily were removed and then boards were placed on a hot plate at 300 °C (Quimis) until welds melted, within roughly 10 min. Then, welded elements were manually removed using appropriate tools. Since PCBs release toxic compounds when heated ( After, each component was disassembled according to seven classes of materials: (1) plastics, (2) non-ferrous metals, (3) ferrous metals, (4) materials containing substances of interest as defined by Then a mass balance of each plastic type in CPUs was carried out, for each unit individually. Plastic types were sorted following the specific official Brazilian standard ( Values of Potential recycling rates (PRR) were calculated according to the European Directive 2012/19/UE ( After sorting and calculation of PRRs of CPU waste, parts were stored according to specific Brazilian standard ( The chemical elements present in 185 parts categorized into the eight component classes described above was carried out. More specifically, elements present in motherboards were analyzed according to Qualitative chemical composition of CPU waste samples (10 g) was analyzed in an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (EDX 720, Shimadzu) by dispersive energy in the Na Grain size distribution of ground motherboards was carried out in a mechanical shaker (4879, Solotest) with 12 screen openings (#6, #12, #20, #30, #40, #50, #70, #100, #140, #200, #270, and #300 mesh). Retained fractions were weighed in analytical balance (Bioprecisa). The chemical elements of the 13 kinds of plastics sorted from the five CPUs used were also analyzed by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as described for the motherboards and other PCBs. In total, 52.81 kg CPU waste were analyzed. CPUs were of identical size (H = 13.5 cm, W = 42.5 cm, L = 41.5 cm). Mean weight of CPUs was 10.56 kg, and the coefficient of variation on weight basis (1.6%) indicates the homogeneity of samples. Mean weigh of components is shown in  The mass balance of the seven material groups is shown in   In another study,  Considering the types of plastics present in a typical desktop computer, the most common are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) (57%), polyphenylene oxide (PPO) (36%), high impact polystyrene (HIPS) (5%), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene/polycarbonate (ABS/PC) (2%). Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) represents only 6% of this value ( Concerning the plastics forming the CPUs, the most representative ones were those that could not be classified. The identification and standardization of plastics contained in WEEE are essential in the definition of disposal and recycling strategies. In addition, these measures increase the commercial value of these byproducts. It was observed that, in the year the CPUs analyzed were manufactured (2002), there was already some concern about the identification of plastics, which facilitates the management of this kind of waste. Groups (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) were considered recyclable ( Group (7) was considered non-recyclable, since these elements are produced using mixed materials, like adhesive nameplates, foams, latex, rubbers, mixed waste (plastics and metals), among others. This group did not meet the requirements prescribed in European Directive 2012/19/EU concerning the 70% recycling rate for materials ( The PRR obtained (96.66%, In total, 47 chemical elements were detected, of which 35 are classified as metals (34 non-ferrous and one ferrous metal (Fe)), four are semi-metals (silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), antimony (Sb), polonium (Po)) and eight are non-metals (phosphor (P), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and the halogens fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), brome (Br), iodine (I), astatine (At)). Non-ferrous metals observed were aluminum (Al), cobalt (Co), chrome (Cr), copper (Cu), gallium (Ga), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), rhenium (Re), tin (Sn), tantalum (Ta), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), zinc (Zn), zirconium (Zr), the alkaline metals cesium (Cs), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), the alkaline earth metals barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), the precious metals silver (Ag), gold (Au), iridium (Ir), osmium (Os) and the rare earth elements actinium (Ac), neodymium (Nd), scandium (Sc), terbium (Tb), thulium (Tm), and ytterbium (Yb)). Of the 47 elements identified, 13 were main elements, 19 were secondary elements, and 45 were present at trace levels. An element may be a main element in one component and a trace element in another.  The chemical elements detected in the chemical analyses carried out in the various parts of the components are shown in Floppy disk drives are manufactured essentially using ferrous metals ( CD drives are manufactured basically using ferrous metals ( The parts used in the manufacture of IDE cables ( The cases (P1, P6) in HD ( The main material used in the production of coolers is non-identified plastic (P3) ( Motherboards presented the highest number of chemical elements ( The capacitors (P6) analyzed presented Al as the main element, while presence of Cl indicates the that CFRs were used in the production of this component. Some capacitors were analyzed without the protective cover, which explains why Cl was not detected. In these capacitors the element detected was Ag.  Pb and Sn are used to weld motherboard components, and were detected in motherboard waste (P18) ( Motherboards are considered the most economically interesting component in PCs due to the associated amount of metals ( The comparison of the chemical composition of ground motherboards ( Substances of interest such as precious metals, rare earth elements, and critical elements are present in motherboard components ( The cases (P1, P2, P3) ( Also, Br indicates the presence of BFRs and Cl indicates the presence of CFRs. Similarly, Pb and Sn were detected in rests of PCBs (P16), indicating that part of the welds was released during heating. PCBs of power supply units measure 181.25 cm The components (P1, P2) as well as the bases of CD drives (P3) and of floppy disk drives (P4) present Zn as the main element and therefore were classified as non-ferrous metals ( The presence of Cl in sheathed wires indicates the presence of CFRs. Ca points to the presence of CaCO In 10 of the 13 analyses carried out, Br was the main element ( The presence of Ti indicates the use of titanium dioxide (TiO  (*) critical element. Recycling processes for plastics containing brominated flame retardants. However, some disadvantages have to be solved, since these processes increase recycling costs associated with these materials. Plastics may also be used as a source of energy in other production processes. This fate is considered to add value to WEEE, as discussed in European Directive 2008/98/EC. Also, Hg was not detected in any of the analyses carried out, confirming the findings by The results obtained afford to conclude that the CPUs analyzed in the present study have good recycling potential. In addition to being sources of metals like Fe, Zn, Al, and Cu, these CPUs have commercially interesting components that contain Au, Ag, rare earth elements, and critical metals. The CPUs analyzed have 96.66% potential recyclability. This parameter represents the amount of material with recycling potential in the samples analyzed. The potential recycling rate was 95.74% for HDs, 100.0% for IDE cables, 96.20% for HDs, 82.67% for coolers, 97.89% for motherboards, 81.93% for power supply units, and 99.41% for lids, casings, and other parts. The parts presenting the highest economic value were: Floppy disk drives: Cu and Co wires. CD drives: capacitors containing Ag and Ga; copper and cobalt wires. IDE cables: metal connectors with Au. HD: disk with Nd and Co; magnet with Co. Cooler: Cu and Co wires. Motherboard: processor with Au, processor socket with Au, Sc; capacitors with Ag, Yb, and Ga; heat exchanger of the processor with Nd, Yb, heat exchanger of the RAM memory with Ga; metal at the back of the processor with Co. The parts of the components with rare earth elements should be removed and appropriately stored for the time necessary and then recycled so as to recover these metals in the most efficient method possible, when industrial scale recycling processes may be used. The physico-chemical characterization of WEEE is an important step in knowing the composition of this kind of waste. Identifying plastics and metals contained in these WEEEs is essential in the definition of disposal and recycling strategies and to improve market value. Also, the identification of these materials is useful in the evaluation of environmental hazards and human health risks. The increasing volumes of WEEE is a severe environmental problem that requires knowledge and control. The recycling of computers is a sustainable alternative to mitigate the problems associated with the disposal of this kind of waste. Knowing more about WEEE is a challenge, since more studies and technical knowledge are necessary to identify the materials with some recycling potential. Few studies and data about CPU waste have been published. So, it is expected that the present study offer a contribution to increase knowledge about this kind of waste.
