Industrial applications of solid–liquid mixing generally comprise of high solids loadings with a wide range of large particles. Since the required power for the mixing of highly concentrated slurries is extremely high, it is critical to accurately assess the just-suspended impeller speed, power number as well as the degree of homogeneity. The major objective of this study was to analyze the suspension of large solid particles in highly concentrated slurries. Design of experiment (Box–Behnken Model) was used for the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) was employed to measure the extent of homogeneity in a slurry reactor. The effects of different variables such as impeller type (PBT, PF3, and A310 impellers), impeller clearance (from 0.050 to 0.133 m), solids loading (30

It was found that in a slurry reactor the particle size, solids loading, and their interaction had a significant impact on the just-suspended impeller speed for the highly concentrated slurries of large particles.Solid volumetric concentration (v/v) Impeller diameter (m) Particle diameter (m) Tank height (m) Solid loading exponent Gravitational acceleration (m/s Number of variables Corrected torque (N m) Rotational speed of impeller (rpm) Power number ( Just-suspended speed(rpm) Number of planes Dimensionless number(–) Tank diameter (m) Solids weight fraction (wt%) Zwietering solid loading (w/w) Solid volume fraction Average solid volume fraction Independent variables Predicted response Fluid volume (m Solid volume fraction (%) Experimental constant in Eq.

These applications can be considered as multiphase processes that are facilitated by mechanically agitated vessels. The goals of mixing are: (a) to prevent settling of the particles in a stirred tank, (b) to provide the uniform solid suspension within the vessel, and (c) to ensure good mass transfer, heat transfer, and reaction rates for the system by maximizing contact between the solid and liquid phases. Hence, the suspension of solid particles is considered as a key objective for the solid–liquid mixing processes. The quality of solid suspension depends on various factors such as physical properties of solid and liquid, operating conditions, geometric configurations, and agitation conditions due to the complex hydrodynamics generated in the stirred vessels. The quality of suspension can be quantified via: (1) just-suspended speed ( Normally most solid suspension applications require a complete off-bottom suspension (  The effects of a number of physical and operational parameters including the impeller off-bottom clearance (  Various techniques such as sampling ( In recent decades, electrical resistance tomography (ERT) as a non-invasive flow-visualization method has been utilized in industrial processes because of the high speed imaging competence and easiness ( Indeed, a comprehensive literature review revealed that no study has been conducted on the just-suspended speed of highly concentrated slurries ( The experimental system consisted of a flat-bottom cylindrical vessel with a diameter of In this study, the mixing tank was furnished with a non-intrusive visualization method called electrical resistance tomography (ERT, P2 + V8 model, Industrial Tomography system-ITS, Manchester, UK) including four sensor planes (P Three different classes of Ballotini impact glass beads (Potters Industries Inc.) were utilized in this study: small glass beads (SG), medium glass beads (MG), and large glass beads (LG). The average size was determined based on a mean number diameter ( The conductivity data obtained from the tomography machine can be utilized to determine the solid particles concentration by applying the Maxwell equation. The applicability of the Maxwell equation (Eq. 5) for higher volumetric solid concentration (v/v) has been tested and reported by After determining the solid concentration of each plane using Eq. The response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study to analyze the experimental data obtained for the just-suspended speed of the impeller and the impeller power consumption as a function of the solids loading, the particle size, the impeller type, and the impeller clearance. The first requirement of this method involves the design of experiments (DOE) to obtain adequate and reliable measured data. Therefore, Box–Behnken design (  In this work, the relevant experimental range and the level of each independent variable (type of impeller, solids loading, impeller clearance, and particle size) are presented in To assess the influence of solids loading on the just-suspended speed, the experimentally measured To determine the exponent of the Zwietering solid loading, which is defined as To quantify the effect of four variables (i.e. type of impeller, solids loading, impeller clearance, and particle size) and their interactions on the just-suspended speed ( The results of the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for these two response function models have been shown in F is defined and calculated by F =  To ensure that the models developed in this study for the just-suspended speed and power number (Eqs. 11 and 12) provide a reasonable estimation of the real system, the predicted values by these two equations were compared to the experimental data and the results are depicted in To visualize the influences of the independent parameters and their interactions on the response function of the just-suspended speed and the power number, the 3-D surface and 2-D contour plots were generated and shown in  Furthermore, the 2D contour and 3D surface plots were generated for the effects of the particle size and the impeller type on the response function of the just-suspended speed as presented in   To investigate the effects of the impeller clearance, solids loading, and the interaction between them, the 2D contour and 3D surface plots were generated and depicted in Finally,   The influences of particle size and impeller clearance on the response function of power number are presented in  To investigate the effects of the impeller clearance, the solids loading and their interactions on the power number, the 2D and 3D contour plots were generated and depicted in Finally, As mentioned in the Experimental Set-up and Procedure section, the tomography data were used in this study to quantify the degree of homogeneity for the highly concentrated slurries of the large particles. To quantify the distribution of the solid particles within the slurry tank, the tomography data were used to measure the level of homogeneity defined by Eq. 6. In this section of the paper, the extent of homogeneity is assessed as a function of the impeller speed, solids loading, particle size, impeller clearance, and power consumption.  As demonstrated earlier, the just-suspended speed was also increased with increasing the solids loading (see Section 4.2.1). Overall, the level of homogeneity decreased at the higher solids loadings at a fixed impeller speed due to the reduction of the axial flow within the mixing tank. Physical properties of the particles especially the particle sizes extremely affect the suspension of solid particles. To assess the influence of the particle size, the homogeneity values as a function of the impeller speed for three particle sizes ( During the experiments, it was observed that the extent of homogeneity was a function of the impeller off bottom clearance. The selection of an efficient impeller is a critical step in the design of the solid–liquid mixing operations. Normally the axial-flow impellers are utilized for the solid suspension processes rather than the radial impellers. In fact, the just-suspended speed achieved by the axial-flow impellers is less than that for the radial-flow impellers since the axial-flow pattern generated by the axial-flow impellers is more suitable for the suspension of the solid particles In this study the hydrodynamics of the highly concentrated solids suspension of the large particles in a slurry reactor was successfully investigated. The suspension of the solid particles was assessed in terms of the just-suspended speed, power number, and homogeneity of the solids suspension. To accomplish the objective of this study, electrical resistance tomography was employed to measure the homogeneity. Design of experiment (Box–Behnken Model) was used for the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. The major findings of this study were: It was revealed that the, Zwietering’s correlation under-predicted The average solids loading exponent around 0.3862 ( Based on RSM and regression analysis two expressions for the prediction of the just-suspended speed and power number were proposed and evaluated for highly concentrated slurries of large particles. It was revealed that the impeller type and its interaction with the particle size had a pivotal effect on the just-suspended speed of the highly concentrated solids suspensions of large particles. The data showed strong influences of both particle size and solids loading and their interaction on the power consumption required for the just-suspended impeller speed. It was determined that both just-suspended speed and power consumption required for the highly concentrated slurries of the large particles were a strong function of the particle size, followed by the solids loading and the impeller type, and lastly the impeller clearance. It was found that the level of homogeneity decreased with increasing the solids loading of large particles at a fixed impeller speed due to the reduction of the axial flow within the mixing tank. The extent of homogeneity increased with a decrease in the impeller clearance and the best performance was achieved at an impeller clearance of 0.050 m. The lowest degree of homogeneity at a fixed impeller speed was attained for the largest particle size ( The power consumption and homogeneity data revealed that the most energy-efficient impeller among the three impellers used in this study was the PBT impeller.
