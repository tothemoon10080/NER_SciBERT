Shore hardness (SH) has been accepted as a convenient and nondestructive method in measuring the hardness of rocks and widely used in rock mechanics since it can be correlated with other mechanical properties of weak rocks, such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS). However, a need has arisen to propose a standard method as a measure of SH to minimize the errors when it is utilized as a predictor of the UCS as well as other mechanical properties of rocks. Over the last few decades, several studies have been conducted to predict consistent SH values using different procedures. However, the results of the tests can not be compared and analyzed in an overall way. Therefore, this experimental study was implemented to meet and discuss the demand for a new method to determine standardized SH values. In result, a new empirical equation was proposed to estimate size-corrected values of SH based on a critical specimen volume of 80cm3.            Similarly, if the minimum specimen thickness (        When presenting the results of SH tests, the report should specify the information given below for each specimen tested: Source of the specimen, including the geographic location, depth and orientation when recovered. Lithological description of the rock. Number of specimens tested and the average SH for each rock type. Orientation of the test surface with respect to the bedding and foliation planes when these are significant characteristics of the rock. Approximate mineral composition, grain shape and sizes of the specimens. Date of sampling, date of specimen preparation and testing, specimen preparation procedures. Specimen dimension characteristics: thickness, test surface area and volume of the specimen. Value of the SH for each test.
