The use of mechanochemistry for the remediation of heavy metals contaminated soils is investigated. Specifically, synthetic sandy soils contaminated by

                      are prepared. The degree of metal immobilization is evaluated after the soil is subjected to mechanical treatment by analyzing the leachable fraction of heavy metals obtained through the “synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP)”. For the case of soils contaminated by heavy metals concentration levels similar to field contaminated soils, their leachability is reduced to levels lower than the USEPA regulatory threshold for drinkable water. In addition impact velocity of milling media as well as impact energy and frequency are evaluated by means of a simulation model of the used milling apparatus.Mechanical treatments by ball milling (BM) are typically used to promote specific transformations such as combustive or gradual reactions, amorphization, activation, microstructural refinement, comminution, cold-welding and alloying ( Mechanically induced reactions by BM have been successfully used for the degradation of organic pollutants such as exachlorobenzene ( Thus, the present paper consists of two parts. In the first, with the aim of quantitatively evaluating process variables (i.e., impact energies and collision frequency), which influence chemical and physical transformations of soils during milling, a suitable model for the appropriate simulation of the dynamics of a Spex Mixer/Mill, which will be used to perform the experiments, is presented. In the second part, experimental results related to the remediation of As it will be seen in the experimental section, contaminated soils have been mechanically treated by ball milling inside suitable vials. Specifically, a Spex Mixer/Mill mod. 8000, operating at the standard milling frequency of about In a Spex Mixer/Mill, balls and soils are placed in a vial which is agitated at high frequency in complex three dimensional cycles. In order to simulate the dynamic of the milling bodies within the ball milling equipment, a model which takes into account the motion of one sphere, therefore subjected to wall-sphere impacts, is presented. Then, the impact between the vial wall and the sphere is identified when position, velocity and acceleration of each point of the vial and of the sphere during the process is known. Along these lines, the 3D vial motion has been firstly simulated according to Once the movement of the vial is quantitatively described, in order to check possible impacts of the sphere with the vial wall and to quantify the energetic inputs related to the corresponding impacts, the sphere motion within the vial needs to be simulated. To this aim the vial wall has been considered to be constituted by bounded spheres, being the diameter of such spheres equal to the vial wall thickness. In this way, the impact between the sphere and the vial wall is represented as an impact between two spheres of different diameter. The model proposed by The significance of the symbols’ shown in the equations above is reported in the notation. It should be noted that the equations above need two auxiliary parameters namely By integrating From statistical distribution of impact velocity modulus obtained through the presented model, it is established that its average value is equal to about The obtained values of process parameters typical of Spex Mixer/Mill, as reported in High purity Soil contamination has been carried out in a temperature controlled shaker at Once contaminated, soils have been mechanically treated under air atmosphere for different time intervals by Spex Mixer/Mill mod. 8000, whose characteristics and operating conditions are reported in At the end of each programmed time interval of mechanical treatment, as well as for untreated ones (i.e., milling time equal to 0), soils have been suitably sampled to be analyzed. The degree of immobilization of heavy metal has been then evaluated using the “synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP)” reported by The effect of mechanical treatment under different milling regimes (i.e., BPR equal to 2, 4 and 6) and for different treatment times on It clearly appears that the immobilization efficiency increases when the soil is mechanically treated and this effect is more evident when the milling time is augmented. It should be noted that the SS soil seems to be very sensitive to the mechanical action since immobilization efficiency increases from 61.3% in absence of treatment to 94.8% when the soil is treated for 5 It should be noted that the performed XRD analyses shows the same crystalline phases, i.e., quartz and bentonite, before and after 5 On the basis of the experimental results described above, only some hypotheses may be formulated about the possible mechanisms responsible for the immobilization capacity enhancement due to mechanical treatment. First, it is possible to assume that when soil is contaminated, heavy metals are adsorbed onto soil particles through a surface coordination process which may be represented as a complexation reaction between soil surface sites and heavy metal complexes (cf. On the other hand, also breakage phenomena, taking place in parallel with the aggregation ones, may determine an increase of immobilization efficiency. In fact when a contaminated soil particle breaks, it develops new “fresh” surfaces onto which heavy metals ions may re-adsorb. These phenomena may result in a higher adsorption capacity thus increasing the corresponding immobilization efficiency of heavy metals. However, the suggested mechanism should be considered only as a reasonable hypothesis which is also based on the observation that the net particle size after milling increases (cf. In any case, although all phenomena taking place during mechanical treatment are not yet completely understood the experimental evidence confirms that for the considered soil and for all milling regimes adopted, a significant increase of the immobilization capacity is obtained because of the effect of mechanical action. For this reason, further investigations have been performed in order to assess the efficiency of mechanical treatment on soils contaminated by heavy metals when considering concentration levels close to those ones of field contaminated soils, i.e., In this work it is shown that immobilization of heavy metals in contaminated soils can be achieved through mechanical treatment. In particular, immobilization efficiency may be strongly increased as milling time is augmented. In addition, under the operating conditions investigated in this work, no significant alterations of the original characteristics of the synthesized SS soils are detected except for a weak amorphization and a relative increase of particle size. The immobilization capacity may be probably ascribed to phenomena such as entrapment of heavy metals into new formed aggregates due to aggregation of soil particles and their re-adsorption on new “fresh” surfaces produced through breakage. When mechanical treatment is applied to soils which simulate real contaminated ones very promising results have been obtained. In fact, after relatively short milling times, leachable fraction of heavy metals has been reduced under the EPA regulatory limits for drinkable water for the considered SS soil. These results demonstrate the potential applicability of this technique for the remediation of field situations. Moreover, it is important to remark that, contrarily to what happen for classical immobilization technologies, these results have been obtained without any reactant addition and taking advantage of very simple apparatuses. Moreover, process simplicity makes this technology potentially feasible. While these aspects are particularly encouraging in view of possible technological applications of the proposed technique, it should be noted that quantitative correlations between the observed results and the process parameters, i.e., impact velocity, frequency and energy needs to be developed. The approach proposed in this work may represent a starting point which needs further investigations.
