The use of (CPB) material to ameliorate geotechnical stability of underground mine is in nascent stage in India. Rheological properties of CPB change with travelling time as it is transported to underground mine stope through pipeline reticulation. In this paper, rheological properties of CPB based on mill tailings of a carbonate rich mineral processing waste are evaluated for different dosages of polycarboxylate (PC) based (SP). Each CPB sample having 78 wt% solids is mixed separately with 4%, 6% or 8% of binder dosages (ratio of the weight of dry binder to the weight of dry tailings) and, 0%, 0.5%, or 1.0% of SP dosages as weight of dry binder. The paper presents a methodology for determining yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropic behaviour of CPB mixture as a function of hydration age, binder and SP dosages. Results from the experimental campaigns indicate that SP content has significant influence on rheological behaviour of CPB and can be suitably exploited to enhance the flow characteristics of the carbonate rich process tailings. The study also develops multivariate linear regression models of yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy of CPB depending on the hydration age, binder and SP dosages.Extraction of valuable minerals from low grade ores results in the generation of huge quantity of mill tailings The paper elaborates on the experimental studies as discussed in In the following, the properties of the materials used in this study such as tailings, binder, superplasticizer and water are described in details. The tailings samples under investigation have been collected from a dolostone hosted uranium ore processing mill located in South India. The tailing samples are stored in sealed plastic containers to prevent pore water loss and occurrence of oxidation prior to their subsequent usage in laboratory experiment. Before commencement of experiments, tailings samples are air dried and homogenized by thoroughly mixing and sub samples are prepared by coning and quartering. Particle size analysis is conducted using particle size analyzer (Mastersizer 2000 E Ver. 5.20, U.K) which reveals that 47% by weight of the tailings is finer than 20 µm ( Tailing are very close to well graded with an average coefficient of uniformity The chemical composition of the tailings is analyzed using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer (Axios, PANalytical) and summarized in In this study, ordinary portland cement (OPC) of 43 grade is used as binder. OPC is found to be rich in CaO, SiO Polycarboxylate (PC) based superplasticizer (Sika® ViscoCrete® 2004 NS) admixture is used in this study and it is also widely used in the concrete industry due to their effectiveness even at lower dosages Municipal tap water is used as mixing water for preparation of CPB specimen. The pH of mixing water is found to be 8.4 which shows that it’s alkaline in nature. The geochemical analysis of tap water is carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (iCAP Q). Rheological behaviour of CPB is characterized using a strain rate-controlled rotational rheometer (Anton Paar RheolabQC, Germany) using vane spindle (diameter of 22 mm; height of 40 mm) having four number of thin blades arranged at 90° angles around the shaft as shown in The CPB’s ingredients i.e. water content or gravimetric water content         Similar technique (hysteresis loop test) was used by Huynh et al.; Ahari et al. and Vance et al. to ascertain plastic viscosity and thixotropy of concentrated cementitious suspension e.g. cement, mortar etc. using various spindle geometries like vane, concentric cylinder associated with rheometer   Yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy of CPB are analysed based on hydration age, SP and binder dosages. Experimental results are first presented in graphical form to determine the general relationship between yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy and input variables such as hydration age, binder and SP dosages. Then multivariate linear regression models are developed to determine the empirical relationships between target and input variables as well as to evaluate the significance of each input variable.  The graph of hysteresis loop test is shown in  It can be noticed from Apparent viscosity is calculated as shear stress divided by the corresponding shear rate during ramp-up in hysteresis loop test. The apparent viscosity profiles of CPB_8_1.0 are given in During ramp up, as the shear rate increases, aggregated microstructure of CPB breaks down and the randomly oriented particles of CPB matrix are more or less aligned and their spatial distribution is asymmetrical in shear direction which reduces the flow resistance and concomitantly apparent viscosity decreases. The structure breakdown continues until it reaches a steady state condition in which the rate of microstructure rebuilding due to colloidal forces and rate of shear-induced breakdown are in dynamic equilibrium over the shearing period.  The possible reason for this observation may be due to the fact that with advancement of hydration age, the amount of free water reduces due to consumption in cement hydration reaction and precipitation of hydration products mainly calcium silicate hydrates; C-S-H, calcium hydroxide gel; CH and ettringite as shown in In order to validate this phenomenon, slump tests using Mini cone of 15 cm height are also performed on CPB_4_1.0 sample. It is evident from the Thixotropy is also found to be increased logarithmically with hydration age. This can be observed from the During pumping of CPB through pipelines over a long distance, breaking up of CPB‘s microstructure by mechanical means prior to pumping considerably reduces transport energy requirements. If CPB is strongly thixotropic the rate of structure build-up is slow when pumping is halted. In this case, CPB will need longer time to retrieve its structure which can minimize start-up problems usually associated with pipeline shutdown due to paste clogging. From  The possible reason for increasing trend of yield stress with increasing binder dosage can be explained in terms of packing density and water to cement ratio (w/c). The variations in the rheological parameters after mixing are attributed to physical characteristics of the CPB mixture (e.g. particle packing) and chemical processes (hydration) of binder. Since tailings and binder have different particle size distributions, their mixture offer improved particle packing density than the individual component. Hence, when binder dosage increases from 4% to 8%, the particle packing density increases with reduction in capillary pores volume and subsequently the flowability of CPB decreases. Similar results have been observed by Deng et al.; Simon and Grabinsky and Phan et al. It can be seen from From the above analysis of results, it is quite evident that PC based superplasticizer in tandem with OPC binder control the rheological behaviour of CPB. For this reason, a ‘fluidity index’ The index In general, yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy vary negatively with Since yield stress and thixotropy are linear function of log of hydration age, The significance of the above relationships and coefficients of variables are evaluated using F and t statistics respectively and shown in In order to further validate these strong relationships, predicted versus measured target variables are plotted in This paper investigates the effect of hydration age, binder dosage and polycarboxylate (PC) based superplasticizer, on the rheology of CPB mixtures prepared with solid mass concentrations at 78%. The study suggests a methodology for conducting experiments to determine yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy of CPB. Several experiments are conducted and data are analysed to understand the variability of rheological parameters with respect to hydration age, binder and SP dosages. Based on all these analyses the following major conclusions can be drawn: Yield stress and thixotropy vary linearly with respect to The Mini slump test also corroborates the logarithmic increasing trend of yield stress with respect to hydration age ( The multivariate linear regression modelling establishes strong relationships among rheological parameters and input variables These mathematical relationships can be used for development of a suitable CPB having a desired yield stress or plastic viscosity by adjusting SP or binder contents.
