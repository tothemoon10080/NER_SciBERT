Coal is an organic sedimentary rock whose chemical composition changes with coalification. As metamorphic development of coal (coalification) is synonymous in chemical terms with progressive enrichment of the coal substance in organically bound carbon, all coals, regardless of their origin or type, can be arranged in an ascending order of carbon content. Coal chemists distinguish coals into three structures: (1) first-order structure that gives the size distribution of the macromolecules and molecules in coal and the degree of cross-linking, (2) second-order structure that details the cross-links and the structure of the carbon skeleton, (3) third-order structure that is the nature and distribution of the functional groups. In all coal classification systems by rank, volatile matter content and calorific value (heating value) are the most important indices. Lower-rank coals are classed according to their calorific values calculated on a moist basis. Coal, an organic sedimentary rock, is very heterogeneous; it contains organic matter that consists of various components with distinct chemical and physical properties referred to as “macerals” and inorganic matter mostly in the form of minerals. The definition of the macerals is based on microscopic examination. The macerals are classified into three groups—vitrinite, exinite (liptinite) and inertinite—either because of similar origin (exinite group) or because of differences in preservation (macerals of vitrinite and inertinite groups).
