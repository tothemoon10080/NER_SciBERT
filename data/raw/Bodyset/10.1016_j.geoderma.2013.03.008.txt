Mangroves are the major ecosystems of tropical and subtropical coastlines. They are considered as a sink for atmospheric CO2 because they are characterized both by high net primary production, and by low rates of organic matter decomposition. However, a recent reassessment of the global mangrove budget suggests that organic carbon sinks have been underestimated, notably CO2 efflux from sediments and creek waters, and tidal export of dissolved inorganic carbon. Our objective was to understand the influence of mangrove zonation on the magnitude of CO2 fluxes at the sediment–air interface. Transparent and opaque dynamic closed chamber systems, coupled with an infra-red gas analyzer were used to measure CO2 fluxes. In addition, the physico-chemical properties (salinity, redox potential) of pore waters were determined, as well as the carbon content and the origin of surface sediments (Chlorophyll-a and δ13C). Depending on the type of measurement (in the dark with or without biofilm, in the light with biofilm) and mangrove stand (saltflat, Avicennia sp., or Rhizophora spp.), mean surface sediment CO2 fluxes ranged between 40±56 and 199±95mmol·m−2·d−1. We suggest that these differences mainly result both from the organic content and the redox conditions of the sediments, which are influenced by the physiological activities of the root system, and by the position and the elevation of the stand in the intertidal zone. In addition, the quality and abundance of biofilm, which also vary with the mangrove stand, also appear to strongly affect sediment CO2 fluxes as a result of chemical (metabolism) and also physical (barrier) processes.The recent rapid increase in CO New Caledonia (NC) is an archipelago located in the southwestern part of the Pacific Ocean, and is characterized by the world's largest lagoon surrounding the main island. A total of 24 mangrove species occupy ~ The study site is located at the mouth of the La Foa River (21°42′41″S; 165°49′06″E), and comprised of the typical zonation of mangroves in New Caledonia, covering more than 1000 CO To measure CO Two chambers were used: one transparent chamber equipped with a photosynthetically active radiation sensor (PAR), and one opaque chamber. With the two chambers, measured fluxes are net CO Triplicate cores were collected to a depth of 50 The sediment total carbon content was determined using a Shimadzu Solid Sample Module (SSM-5000A) combined with a TOC analyzer (see application note, Shimadzu website). Only total carbon contents were measured in these sediment samples, but in all the samples from New Caledonia analyzed in previous studies, the total organic carbon content (TOC) represented ~ Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) analysis was used as an index to quantify microphytobenthic biomass ( At each CO The δ Mean CO After the removal of the top ~ Eh values varied with the stand and with depth ( Pore water salinity ranged from 34.3 to 70.3 in the saltflat, from 35.5 to 59.8 in the The mean total carbon content was 1.7 The total belowground biomass (dead and living roots) was estimated at 15.7 The δ The chlorophyll-a contents of surface sediments varied with the mangrove stand ( Considering our data set (one year survey), mean surface sediment CO At constant temperature and sediment water content, heterotrophic respiration, and hence CO On the one hand, considering the belowground biomass, On the other hand, The position in the tidal zone is another factor that has to be taken into account. The topographic zonation leads to differences in the length of immersion by tides. This not only results in a gradient of redox conditions, but also in a gradient of organic matter content ( In addition, Finally, higher CO When we combined the diffusive CO Whatever the mangrove stand, CO Concerning the δ Microphytobenthos is composed of primary producers, and can contribute significantly to the total primary production of estuarine and shallow water ecosystems ( Moreover, the microbial mat may contain chemoautotrophic organisms that are able to synthetize organic compounds from CO Both dark and light fluxes were significantly lower than fluxes measured after the removal of the surface sediment layer containing the microbial mat. Even if some authors showed that O In situ CO Our results point to a possible key role for the microbial mat in CO To improve the carbon budget in mangrove ecosystems, it is necessary to both spatially and temporally quantify, in-situ, each component of the carbon cycle, notably root respiration and DIC export through belowground water, and it is also necessary to improve our knowledge of diffusive sediment CO This study was funded by the
