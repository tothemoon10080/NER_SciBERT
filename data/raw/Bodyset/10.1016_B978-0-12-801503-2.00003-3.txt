The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) causes various problems in drinking water and drinking water treatment processes, including (1) negative effect on water quality by causing color, taste, and odor problems, (2) increased coagulant and disinfectant doses (which in turn results in increased sludge volumes and production of harmful disinfection by-products), (3) promoted biological growth in distribution system, and (4) increased levels of complexed heavy metals and adsorbed organic pollutants. NOM can be removed from drinking water through the use of several treatment options, of which the most common and economically feasible processes are considered to be coagulation and flocculation followed by sedimentation/flotation and sand filtration. Most of the NOM can be removed by coagulation, although the hydrophobic fraction and high molar mass compounds of NOM are removed more efficiently than hydrophilic fraction and the low molar mass compounds. Thus, enhanced and/or optimized coagulation, as well as new process alternatives for better removal of NOM by coagulation, have been suggested. In this chapter, we present an overview of the recent research dealing with coagulation and flocculation in the removal of NOM from drinking water.Anionic polyacrylamides Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon Carbon nanotube Cationic polyacrylamides Disinfection by-product Dissolved organic carbon Formation potential Haloacetic acids Hot filament chemical vapor deposition High molar mass Composite polyaluminum chloride Inorganic polymer flocculants Low molar mass Natural organic matter Polyacrylamide Polyaluminum chloride Polymer-polyaluminum ferric chloride Polyaluminum ferric silicate chloride Polyacrylamides Polyaluminum sulfate Polyaluminum silicate chloride Polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride Polyferric chloride Polyferric sulfate Polyferric silicate sulfate Polysilicate ferric Polytitanium silicate sulfate Response surface method Specific UV absorbance Trihalomethane Total organic carbon Generally, the most common and economically feasible standard processes for the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) (and particulate matter) are considered to be coagulation and flocculation, followed by sedimentation/flotation and sand filtration ( This chapter presents the options for NOM removal from drinking water using various coagulants and coagulation techniques. In the coagulation stage, solid particles are destabilized by a coagulant. This may include the formation of small aggregates by Brownian motion. The subsequent process by which large flocs are formed is known as Coagulation is a physical–chemical process where the repulsive potential of electrical double layer of colloids is reduced in such a way that microparticles can be produced. These microparticles collide with each other to form larger structures, called flocs in the flocculation process. The use of coagulants for NOM removal was reviewed a few years ago ( The aggregation mechanisms through which NOM is removed include a combination of charge neutralization, entrapment, adsorption, and complexation with coagulant metal ions into insoluble particulate aggregates ( The ability of coagulation to remove NOM and particles depends on several factors, including coagulant type and dosage, mixing conditions, pH, The nature of NOM has a significant effect on the coagulant dose. The optimal coagulant dose for water with HMM NOM is expected to be low because the removal mechanism is mostly charge neutralization. If NOM consists of low molar mass (LMM) or non-humic substances, however, the removal mechanism is expected to be adsorption onto metal hydroxide surfaces and the optimal coagulant dose is thus much larger. The hydrophobic fraction of NOM is generally removed more efficiently than the hydrophilic fraction by coagulation. Furthermore, HMM compounds are more readily removed than LMM compounds ( The most widely used coagulant in drinking water production has been aluminum sulfate (alum), but recently the use of ferric salts has become more popular ( It has been proposed that the removal mechanisms of ferric and alum coagulants are different ( New inorganic polymer flocculants (IPFs) have been developed during the past few years based on inorganic salts. Prehydrolyzed coagulants are formed by the forced hydrolysis of a simple coagulant, such as alum. Concerning their coagulation–flocculation properties, IPFs are considered to be somewhere between traditional inorganic salts and organic flocculants ( The most commonly used aluminum-based coagulant is alum (Al Increasing the alum dose increases NOM removal up to a certain point. At very high doses (>100 Ferric salts commonly used in coagulation processes include ferric chloride (FeCl Prehydrolyzed aluminum coagulants such as polyaluminum chloride (PACl) and polyaluminum sulfate (PAS) have been developed in the past decade ( Activated silica is an efficient coagulant aid and enhances the bridging ability of PACl ( Polyaluminum silicate chloride (PASiC) can enhance the efficiency of NOM and turbidity removal, proving more efficient than PACl in the treatment of low turbidity waters ( Instead of processing one factor at a time—which is time consuming and incapable of revealing the optimal combination of factors as it ignores the interrelation— More attention has recently been paid to inorganic polymeric iron coagulants, including polyferric sulfate (PFS), polymeric iron chloride (PICl), or polyferric chloride (PFC) ( Polymeric coagulant efficiency can be improved by adding other components to the polymer such as polysilic acid, to produce new composite coagulants such as polysilicate ferric (PSF) and polyferric silicate sulfate (PFSiS) ( A polymer is termed a Synthetic or natural polymers are used as both primary coagulants and coagulant or flocculant aids. Cationic polyelectrolytes are most commonly used for NOM removal because NOM in water is likely to be negatively charged, favoring NOM removal by charge neutralization over bridging. The cationic polymer PDADMAC has been used as primary coagulant for NOM removal, since it is highly charged and has HMM, although its high cost has been a limiting factor ( The combination of organic polymers or inorganics into IPFs to create a composite coagulant is an innovation in coagulation. These composites are synthesized by adding inorganic or organic modifiers to the respective coagulants ( A highly efficient composite polyaluminum chloride (HPAC) has been developed from PACl and other organic and inorganic additives such as active silicates and PDADMAC. HPAC has exhibited about 30% more efficiency on NOM removal than conventional coagulants or PACl ( Bioflocculants are nontoxic and biodegradable ( Al and Fe coagulants meet the need for improved NOM removal. In addition to Fe and Al salts, the inorganic coagulant Zr may prove effective due to its increased positive charge ( Aluminum formate was found to be as efficient in coagulation as conventional polyaluminum chloride and aluminum sulfate ( Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have demonstrated their efficiency as coagulants, although they lack dispersion and solubility properties ( This chapter has reviewed recent research in the field of NOM removal from drinking water by coagulation. The character and concentration of NOM in raw water sources change both regionally and seasonally ( Enhanced coagulation removed more NOM than baseline coagulation in the majority of the reported studies, yet some of the LMM compounds and nonhumic material in NOM still remained in the treated water. Applying increased coagulant dosages and controlling the raw water pH by the addition of acid or base are two common options for enhancing NOM removal by coagulation. Yet, these solutions increase the proportion of rapidly precipitated material as sludge or flocs, forming looser Conventional coagulation has been performed with inorganic salts, including alum, ferric chloride, and ferric sulfate. A recent improvement is the development of prehydrolyzed ferric and alum coagulants called IPFs (e.g., PFC and PACl). Their advantages over conventional coagulants include a broader working pH range, lower sensitivity to water temperature, and lower residual coagulant concentrations (
