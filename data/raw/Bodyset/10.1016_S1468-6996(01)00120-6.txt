Ceramic based composites with dispersion of nano sized metal/metal carbide particles have generated wide technological interest for their improved mechanical properties — hardness, fracture strength as well as fracture toughness, superior electrical properties and magnetic properties. In the present investigation alumina–silica gels have been prepared along with nickel chloride and dextrose distributed in the nanometric pores of the gel. The gels are prepared with different molar proportions of alumina and silica containing 5wt% of nickel chloride and 50wt% excess dextrose. During heat treatment at a temperature of 900°C for half an hour in nitrogen atmosphere, nickel chloride is reduced to metallic nickel by in situ generated hydrogen in the silica–alumina matrix. X-ray analyses indicate that no nickel chloride reduction is possible upto 50mol% silica in alumina–silica matrix. Beyond this range, higher the silica content, higher is the reduction of nickel chloride. The presence of metallic nickel has been substantiated further by SAD analysis. Particle size analysis based on X-ray diffraction as well as transmission electron micrograph shows the presence of nickel particles of size ∼20nm distributed in the alumina–silica nanocomposite.
