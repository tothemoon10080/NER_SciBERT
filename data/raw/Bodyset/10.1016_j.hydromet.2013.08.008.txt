Three new extractants, namely bis(1,3-dihexyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid, bis(1,3-dioctyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid and bis(1,3-di-2-ethylhexyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid, were synthesized and tested in mixture with tri-n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) in Isane IP 185 for the recovery of uranium (VI) from 5.3molL−1 synthetic phosphoric acid and 30% wt P2O5 industrial wet phosphoric acid. The results were compared with those previously obtained with bis(1,3-dibutoxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid (BiDiBOPP), under similar experimental conditions. The increase of the length of the alkyloxy chains of bis(1,3-dialkyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid is responsible for an increase of the distribution coefficients of both uranium (VI) and iron (III) whereas steric hindrance effect arising from the increase of branching improves the selectivity for uranium (VI) against iron (III). A quantitative relationship between the distribution coefficients of uranium (VI) measured for the series of 7 extractants and two molecular descriptors has been developed. This opens a way for computer-guided design of new phosphoryl-containing extractants.The recovery of uranium from wet phosphoric acid (WPA) by liquid–liquid extraction has attracted a great attention over the last three decades and various extractant systems were developed ( In a previous paper, we investigated the extraction of uranium (VI) from concentrated phosphoric acid with various synergistic extraction systems based on acid-type extractants and tri- In the present paper, the influence of the length and the ramification of the alkyl chains present in the hydrophobic part of BiDiBOPP analogs (noted R in the Hexanol (Aldrich, purity Extraction experiments were carried out by mixing the aqueous feed solution, i.e. synthetic solution containing 0.34 Preliminary experiments on the kinetics of extraction of uranium (VI) by D2EHPA/TOPO and BiDiBOPP/TOPO showed that the equilibrium was reached in all cases within 30 Uranium and iron concentrations in the aqueous solutions were determined by ICP-AES using a Varian Vista Pro spectrometer. Before analyses, the aqueous solutions were filtered with a Minisart AC STER filter (28 The RC3 version of the Comprehensive Descriptors for Structural and Statistical Analysis PRO program ( The 2D structures of 7 extractants reported in The distribution coefficients of uranium (VI) (D As expected, the increase of the length of the alkyl chains of bis(1,3-dialkyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid is responsible for an increase of the distribution coefficient of uranium (VI) since D The extraction of uranium (VI) from phosphoric acid by the D2EHPA/TOPO system can be described by Eq. The extraction constant K An increase of the number of carbon atoms in the linear alkyl chains of HL is responsible for an increase of the hydrophobicity of HL and UO2(HL)2L2T, and therefore, an increase of K Kolarik also reported K Therefore, the increase of the uranium (VI) distribution coefficients for the extractant molecules The introduction of steric hindrance by replacing linear alkyl chains R in Furthermore, the introduction of additional oxygen atoms in the alkoxy chains of bis(1,3-dialkoxypropan-2-yl)phosphoric acids, leading to bis(5,8,12,15-tetraoxanonadecan-10-yl) phosphoric acid ( The distribution coefficients of uranium (VI) increase when an industrial 30 wt % P Indeed, Eq.  The change of H The mass balance for As the concentration of extracted uranium (VI) and iron (III) are low compared to that of bis(1,3- dialkyloxypropan-2-yl) phosphoric acid and TOPO, the concentrations The contribution of the change in pH on the variation of D  From more than 500 descriptors generated for each extractant, two descriptors have been selected by the program for the best multilinear equation The distribution coefficient of uranium (VI) between 5.3 The authors thank Chemaxon company (  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
