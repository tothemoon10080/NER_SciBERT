In this study, 5-benzylidenerhodanine derivatives namely 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (SAR) and 5-((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (HNAR) used as monomer. The new polymers of SAR and HNAR (PSAR and PHNAR respectively) were synthesized by oxidative polycondensation reaction. The polymers were characterized by elemental, FT-IR, UV–Vis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, TG-DTA analyses techniques. The molecular weight distribution values of the PSAR and PHNAR were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. According to the SEC analyses, the number average molecular weight (Mn
                     ), weight average molecular weight (Mw
                     ) and polydispersity index (PDI) values of PSAR and PHNAR were found to be 5300, 7250 g mol−1 and 1.368; 5750, 7350 g mol−1 and 1.278, respectively. The Cu (II), VO (IV) complexes of PSAR and PHNAR (PSAR-Cu and PSAR-VO) were successfully prepared using Cu (AcO)2xH2O and VOSO4x5H2O hydrate salts. The polymer-metal-complexes were characterized by FT-IR, elemental and TG-DTA analysis techniques. The weight losses of PHNAR, PHNAR-Cu, PHNAR-VO, PSAR, PSAR-Cu and PSAR-VO were found to be 69.50, 58.50, 62.25, 89.05, 74.55 and 61.75% at 1000 °C, respectively. TG analyses were showed to be stable of synthesized polymers against thermal decomposition. Electrical properties of doped polymers, undoped polymers and their complexes were determined. Also, the optical band gaps (Eg) of these complexes were calculated from their absorption edges.Rhodanines are five-membered heterocyclic compounds that have range spectrum of biological activity (anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antiviral, and antidiabetic) Rhodanine derivatives are a good series of ligands capable of binding metal ions leading to metal complexes with increasing properties Polymers are useful materials on account of their ease of fabrication, flexibility, lightness of weight and chemical inertness. As such, electrically conducting polymers are potential candidates for wide variety of applications ranging from electrode materials, from organic batteries to electrochromic display devices Therefore, polychelates have also found wide spread applications in nuclear chemistry, preconcentration and recovery of trace metal ions in radioactive materials, control of pollution, hydrometallurgy, polymer drug grafts and waste water treatment In this study, we synthesized rhodanine based polymer compounds, PSAR and PHNAR, from 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (SAR) and 5-((2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methylene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one (HNAR).

For PSAR-Cu, FT-IR (cm The solubility tests were done in different solvents by using 1 mg sample and 1 mL solvent at 25 °C. The molar conductivity values of the complexes were obtained in DMSO using a digital conductivity meter (WPA CMD 750). Solid state conductivities were measured on a Keithley 2400 Electrometer. The pellets were prepared on hydraulic press developing up to 1687.2 kg/cm PHNAR, PHNAR-Cu, PHNAR-VO, PSAR, PSAR-Cu and PSAR-VO were dark brown at powder forms. The synthesized all compounds were all stable in the solid state. The solubility test results are shown in According to The observation and changes of the ligands in the FT-IR spectrum during coordination were investigated. According to elemental analysis (1:2, metal: ligand stoichiometry), the IR spectra of the complexes show that the ligands behaves as a bidentate and monobasic. The polymer ligands gave two bands at ∼3200–3040 cm The The absorption spectra of polymer and polymer-metal complexes were recorded by using DMSO, respectively, at 25 °C and are given in PSAR, PSAR-VO, PSAR-Cu, PHNAR, PHNAR-VO and PHNAR-Cu have conductivities of 2.110 × 10 As seen from these results, the conductivity of the polymer-metal complexes were found as higher than the polymers. These reasons are from the metal atoms in the structure of the polymer-metal complexes. This may be described by the length of conjugation and the existence of metal atoms in complexes arising from delocalization of π-electrons in the chelate ring. The increasing conjugation length in complexes may lead to higher conductivity The molar conductivity values of the complexes were obtained in DMSO. All complexes have conductivity in the range 8.7–20.3 Ω The thermal stability and decomposition of PHNAR, PSAR and polymer-metal complex were studied by TGA-DTG-DTA analyses at N The thermal behavior of these complexes showed that the hydrated complexes lost water molecules of hydration and coordination in the first step followed immediately by decomposition of the ligand molecules in the subsequent steps. The final decomposition steps of the complexes are attributed to complete decomposition of the complexes leaving M residues (M = Cu and V). This confirms the results of elemental analysis. The thermograms of possess one main stage of decomposition corresponding to loss of both hydration and coordination water molecules in the same stage ( Two new 5- substituted rhodanines polymers were synthesized by the oxidative polycondensation of monomers with NaOCl in an aqueous alkaline medium.
