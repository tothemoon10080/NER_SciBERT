The present paper deals with the extraction of some minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium) from ground, dried aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw (Galium mollugo L.) using an aqueous ethanol solution (50% by volume) at different temperatures (from 23 to 40°C) in the presence and absence of ultrasound. The main goal was to establish the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the two extraction processes. A phenomenological model involving simultaneous washing and diffusion was proved for both ultrasound-assisted and silent extraction of the minerals. The minerals extraction both in the presence and the absence of ultrasound is endothermic and irreversible since the enthalpy change and the entropy change are positive in the ranges of extraction temperature applied. The Gibbs free energy change for the extraction of minerals is negative, indicating that the process is feasible and spontaneous. The minerals yield increased by a factor of 1.02–1.06 and 1.14–1.27 in the absence and the presence of ultrasound, respectively for every 10°C rise in temperature.Perennial herbaceous plant of the As other medicinal plants, white lady's bedstraw can be directly used because of its bioactive constituents. However, it is generally advantageous to use its extract containing bioactive compounds, which can be more effective than using the original plant material. Aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw could be a source of both organics and minerals. The extraction of organic compounds is widely studied ( Various extraction techniques have been employed for recovering extractive substances from aromatic and medicinal plants. Today, novel extraction techniques such as ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction are recommended because they have a greater separation efficiency of bioactive compounds in a shorter time and require a less amount of extracting solvent than the traditional ones ( The kinetics of extraction of minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium) from aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw has been recently described by a model based on the instantaneous washing followed by diffusion of minerals from plant particles ( The present paper deals with ultrasound-assisted extraction of some minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium) from ground, dried aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw ( Aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw were collected during the blooming (the Vlasina Mountain, Serbia), dried in a shadow and ground immediately before the extraction (average plant particle size: 0.75 Ultrasound-assisted extraction and maceration were performed in an ultrasonic bath (Sonic, Niš, Serbia; total power 120 The ground aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw (7.5 The minerals content in the resinoid was determined by the Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Series S14 AA). Only the presence of potassium, calcium and magnesium were confirmed by the method applied. The MRPD values for the minerals yields were ±1.1% (K), ±2.7% (Ca), ±3.4% (Mg) for the maceration and ±1.0% (K), ±3.1% (Ca), The phenomenological model used in the present study includes two simultaneous processes ( The rate constants are dependent on extraction temperature according to the Arrhenius equation: Distribution coefficient, The thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy change and entropy change, were determined from the Van’t Hoff equation: The Gibbs free energy change was calculated by the following equation: The temperature coefficient indicates increasing the yield of minerals for every 10 The performances of the models developed were statistically estimated by the mean relative percent deviation (MRPD) and the coefficient of determination ( All correlations were statistically tested by the Student's The present study confirmed the presence of potassium, calcium and magnesium in the extracts obtained from aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw by an aqueous ethanol solution (50% by vol.). The minerals yield increased with increasing extraction temperature in the case of both extraction techniques applied because of better solubility of the minerals at enhanced temperatures. At a constant extraction temperature, higher minerals yields were achieved by the ultrasound-assisted extraction than by the silent maceration. Ultrasound enhanced the overall extraction rate and the minerals yield, which was attributed to the positive effects of collapsing cavitation bubbles ( Based on the observed mechanism of minerals extractions, the experimental data on the kinetics of minerals extractions (minerals yield variations with time) were modeled by the phenomenological model, Eq. According to this model, it is The fraction of washable minerals, The washing rate constant was greater than the diffusion rate constant for both extraction techniques applied, as can be seen in  In the present study, for the first time, a process of extraction from a plant material was thermodynamically analyzed in the presence and the absence of ultrasound. The thermodynamic analysis was performed to determine the basic thermodynamic quantities of the ultrasound-assisted extraction and traditional maceration of the minerals from aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw using the aqueous ethanol solution (50% by vol.). By the kinetic study performed, the minerals yields at saturation were determined, their values being presented in The minerals yields,  The enthalpy change and the entropy change for extracting the minerals from aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw using the aqueous ethanol solution (50% by vol.) were positive for both techniques in the ranges of extraction temperature applied. Thus, the extraction of the minerals both in the presence and the absence of ultrasound is endothermic and irreversible. The same result has been reported for extraction of puerarin from The values for the change enthalpy for the minerals extraction indicated the quantity of energy that the system (the plant material and the solvent) should adsorb to enable this process. It was obvious that the system adsorbed a greater quantity of energy in the presence of ultrasound when the ultrasonic energy was transformed into the heat as indicated by the higher enthalpy change ( During extraction, molecules of extractable substances, including the minerals, are extracted from the solid plant material, thus increasing the entropy of the suspension ( The Gibbs free energy change for the extraction of minerals (and resinoid, The thermodynamic analysis of extraction of total extractive substances and individual compounds from plant material performed so far shows that this process is spontaneous, irreversible and endothermic, as can be concluded from the reported data ( The temperature extraction coefficient was calculated according to Eq. The present paper deals with the kinetics and thermodynamics of the extraction of some minerals (potassium, calcium and magnesium) from aerial parts of white lady's bedstraw ( The future study should be directed toward the effects of ultrasound on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the extraction of minerals from white lady's bedstraw (
