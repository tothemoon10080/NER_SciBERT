This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).
                  This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief as it is a duplicate of a paper that has already been published in Appl. Phys. Lett., 92 (2008) 152905 1â€“3, doi:10.1063/1.2901017. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process. The first author, V.R. Singh, accepts full responsibility and would like to state that he did not consult Prof. Agrawal and Prof. Garg regarding this duplicate submission.
