This is the first report of arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of a juvenile Tillaux fracture. Arthroscopic visualization assisted with the anatomic reduction of the articular fragment. This adds arthroscopy as a modality available to help obtain accurate reduction as well as understand the nature of the fracture pattern in juvenile Tillaux fractures along with its adult counterpart and other intra-articular fractures.
                  Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, Vol 18, No 4 (April), 2002: pp 427–429Juvenile Tillaux fracture is a relatively uncommon fracture. An injury mechanism of external rotation of the foot relative to the tibia has been described. A 14-year-old freshman high school football player sustained a left ankle injury. Despite the patient’s difficulty in determining the exact mechanism of injury, his description appeared consistent with an external rotation injury. His primary complaints were of ankle swelling, lateral ankle bruising, and anterolateral ankle pain. He denied any previous ankle fracture or injury. Plain radiographs revealed a distal tibia fracture involving epiphysis, a Salter-Harris type III fracture (Fig 1). Arthroscopy was carried out through standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals. The fracture site and fragment with its articular incongruity were readily visualized (Fig 3). With the advent of arthroscopy, the visualization of intra-articular pathology has become significantly better. The use of the arthroscope in visualizing reduction of articular surfaces with intra-articular fractures of the knee and wrist has been a natural progression in the use of this powerful tool.
