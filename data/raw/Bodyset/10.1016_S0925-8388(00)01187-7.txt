The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of thermal treatment on the atomic ordering of mechanically alloyed Al3Nb. The partially disordered Al3Nb alloy is transformed into an ordered 10-nm sized Al3Nb after a following heat treatment. The value of ΔH
                     order for ordering of Al3Nb intermetallics is more negative for faster heating rates and prolonged milling time. The average values of ΔH
                     order correspond to about 35% of the ΔH necessary for Al3Nb phase formation. The activation energies for ordering of Al3Nb at 30 and 40 h of milling are relatively close to the isothermal grain growth enthalpy of nanocrystalline Al3Nb intermetallics.Among various compounds in the Al–Nb system, Al Elemental aluminum (−200 mesh, >99.8% pure) and niobium (−325 mesh, >99.8% pure) powders were used as starting materials. The composition investigated was Al–25at.%Nb corresponding to Al The structural changes of the mechanically alloyed powders were examined by X-ray diffraction analysis using a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu        The partially disordered Al The value of Δ This research was financial supported by the KOSEF (Korea Science and Engineering Foundation; 97-0300-0901-3).
