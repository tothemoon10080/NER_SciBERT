The level of deformation development of surrounding rocks is a vital predictor to evaluate impending coal mine disasters and it is important to establish accurate measurements of the deformed status to ensure coal mine safety. Traditional deformation monitoring methods are mostly based on single parameter, in this paper, multiple approaches are integrated: firstly, both electric and elastic models are established, from which electric field distribution and seismic wave recording are calculated and finally, the resistivity profiles and source position information are determined using inversion methods, from which then the deformation and failure of mine floor are evaluated. According to the inversion results of both electric and seismic field signals, multiple-parameter dynamic monitoring of surrounding rock deformation in deep mine can be performed. The methodology is validated using numerical simulation results which shows that the multi-parameter dynamic monitoring methods have better results for surrounding rock deformation in deep mine monitoring than single parameter methods.
