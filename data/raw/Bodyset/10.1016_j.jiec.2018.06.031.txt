Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-functionalized KIT-6 and KCC-1 mesoporous silicas were prepared via post-synthesis grafting and examined for their ability to promote the recovery of rare earth metal ions such as Nd3+ from an aqueous medium. The obtained adsorption isotherms were fitted to the Langmuir model, which gave a maximum adsorption of Nd3+ ions of 109.8 and 96.5mg/g for KIT-6-EDTA and KCC-1-EDTA, respectively, at 25°C and pH 6. The adsorption kinetic profile of KIT-6 was faster than KCC-1. KIT-6 was also proved to be more stable against desorption under acidic regeneration conditions.The limited mineral deposits and increasing demand for rare earth elements (REEs) from high technology industries over the last decade have made it increasingly important to recover REEs from various sources including industrial wastes Several different methods can be applied for the recovery of REEs including solvent extraction For Nd Many previous studies on metal ions adsorption in liquid phase Herein, two representative mesoporous silica, KIT-6 and KCC-1 were functionalized with EDTA groups via a simple post-synthesis grafting procedure ( Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), cetylpyridinium bromide, Pluronic P123 (EO/20:PO/70:EO/20), KIT-6 was synthesized using a procedure reported earlier KCC-1 was synthesized using a procedure reported by Polshettiwar et al. Initially, the prepared mesoporous silica was functionalized with APTES. Thus, 1 Low angle X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku) patterns of the pure and functionalized mesoporous silica were recorded using a monochromatic X-ray beam with CuKα ( The study of Nd Fig. S1a shows the low angle XRD patterns of KIT-6, KIT-6-APTES, and KIT-6-EDTA. The three major peaks of the XRD pattern for KIT-6 could be indexed to the (211), (220) and (322) reflections at 1.08, 1.25 and 2.03 2    The morphology of the functionalized adsorbents KIT-6-EDTA and KCC-1-EDTA was examined by TEM as shown in  The adsorbed amount of Nd In order to examine the adsorption kinetics of Nd The stability of the adsorbents was analyzed through a recycle experiment as shown in Based on the observed adsorption results from the pH study and previous reports on the coordination chemistry of EDTA with trivalent metal ions EDTA-functionalized KIT-6 and KCC-1 were synthesized via post-synthesis grafting and exhibited high adsorption capacities for Nd This work was financially supported by the National Strategic Project Carbon Upcycling of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), which was funded by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article:
