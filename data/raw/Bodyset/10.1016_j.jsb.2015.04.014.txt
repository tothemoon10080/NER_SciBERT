Avian eggshell mineralization is the fastest biogenic calcification process known in nature. How this is achieved while producing a highly crystalline material composed of large calcite columnar single crystals remains largely unknown. Here we report that eggshell mineral originates from the accumulation of flat disk-shaped amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) particles on specific organic sites on the eggshell membrane, which are rich in proteins and sulfated proteoglycans. These structures known as mammillary cores promote the nucleation and stabilization of a amorphous calcium carbonate with calcitic short range order which predetermine the calcite composition of the mature eggshell. The amorphous nature of the precursor phase was confirmed by the diffuse scattering of X-rays and electrons. The nascent calcitic short-range order of this transient mineral phase was revealed by infrared spectroscopy and HRTEM. The ACC mineral deposited around the mammillary core sites progressively transforms directly into calcite crystals without the occurrence of any intermediate phase. Ionic speciation data suggest that the uterine fluid is equilibrated with amorphous calcium carbonate, throughout the duration of eggshell mineralization process, supporting that this mineral phase is constantly forming at the shell mineralization front. On the other hand, the transient amorphous calcium carbonate mineral deposits, as well as the calcite crystals into which they are converted, form by the ordered aggregation of nanoparticles that support the rapid mineralization of the eggshell. The results of this study alter our current understanding of avian eggshell calcification and provide new insights into the genesis and formation of calcium carbonate biominerals in vertebrates.Polymorphs of calcium carbonate are among the most common materials used by organisms for many different functions, especially for building highly sophisticated protective mineral structures (i.e., mollusk shell, avian eggshell ( Avian eggshell formation is another biomineralization model system in which the presence of amorphous mineral phases could be highly relevant, although it has never been detected. The eggshell is sequentially assembled as the egg traverses the oviduct ( Eggshell calcium carbonate precipitates from the uterine fluid, which is highly supersaturated with respect to calcite, the only mineral constituent of the mature eggshell ( In this work, the evolution of the mineralogy and crystallinity of eggshell mineral during its formation process have been reexamined using complementary analytical techniques (i.e., X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and HRTEM) which are able to detect and characterize in detail amorphous or poorly crystalline mineral phases ( All experiments, including all animal handling protocols, were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directives concerning the practice for the care and Use of Animals for Scientific purposes and the French ministerial on Animal experimentation under the supervision of authorized scientists (authorization # 7323, delivered by the DDPP, direction départementale de la protection des populations, d’Indre et Loire). The experimental unit UE-PEAT 1295 where the birds were kept has authorization for rearing birds and for the euthanasia of experimental animals (decree N° B37-175-1 of August 28th 2012 delivered by the Préfecture d’Indre et Loire following the inspection of the Department Direction of Veterinary Services). The protocol was approved by an ethical committee (comité d’éthique de Val de Loire, officially registered under number 19 of the French national ethic committee for animal experimentation) under the authorization number 00159.02. Brown egg laying hens (48–50 Eggshell membranes collected at different times were embedded in epoxy resin for sectioning. Double polished thin-sections (<30 For Infrared spectroscopy (IR) analyses, the outer surface of intact eggshell samples were pressed against an attenuated total reflection (ATR) diamond crystal window (Pike MIRACLE) and the IR spectra was recorded at a 2 The mineralogy and microtextural properties (crystal size and orientation) of eggshell samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Eggshell samples were analyzed with a Panalytical Expert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer (The Netherlands) in reflection mode using copper radiation to determine theta-2theta scans (using and 0.017 The progress of eggshell mineralization and the kinetics of this process were determined by measuring the weight of the forming eggshell (eggshell membranes The process of eggshell mineralization at specific stages of shell calcification was followed by optical microscopy using the forming eggshell samples collected at different times after ovulation. Eggshell membrane mineralization starts at around 5 The eggshell mineralization process was monitored by SEM observation of eggshell membranes collected at different stages of eggshell deposition ( The progress of eggshell mineralization was also followed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. It could be argued that spectra with different These observations indicates that: (1) At the initial stages of eggshell formation, most of the calcium carbonate mineral is amorphous, and later on there is a mixture of ACC and an increasing amount of calcite; (2) the amorphous calcium carbonate mineral is metastable and is progressively converting/crystallizing into calcite, or dissolving and calcite is crystallizing, which is in agreement with the SEM observations described above. (3) There might be more than one ACC phase forming during the earlier stages of eggshell mineralization. One that is short-lived that produce a The spectrum of the calcite standard differs from spectra of eggshell collected at different stages, so ACC must be present in the mineralization front at all stages of eggshell mineralization, even at 14 During the first hours of eggshell deposition, as mineralization progresses, the intensity of the amide bands decreases while the main carbonate band at 1390 The mineralization of the membranes was also studied by XRD using conventional X-ray powder diffractometry, with Cu radiation, to analyze the mineral deposited at the eggshell surface (1D-XRD; In the 2D-XRD patterns ( Samples collected at 5 TEM analyses were performed on ultra thin sections (60 The novel observations reported here demonstrate that the formation of a transient amorphous calcium carbonate phase is a fundamental characteristic of controlled-mineralization of the calcium carbonate eggshell. Calcification is initiated with the formation of flat disk-shaped ACC particles that nucleate on the entire membrane surface and in particular on the mammillary cores, where they accumulate and form massive mineral deposits ( The amorphous nature of the first carbonate mineral deposited on the eggshell membranes and the presence of ACC during the rapid phase of shell calcification was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, which demonstrated that the carbonate Another important function of uterine fluid biomolecules is that they can control the kinetics of calcium carbonate precipitation. Prior to becoming incorporated into the crystal lattice, cations must desolvate, which is the rate-limiting step in crystal growth. Specific biomolecules, i.e. carboxylate- and phosphate-rich proteins, which are commonly associated with mineralization sites in organisms, can accelerate calcite growth rates several times by facilitating the desolvation of Ca Also, the eggshell membrane mammillary cores play an active role in inducing calcium carbonate mineralization which has been demonstrated On the other hand, initial flat-disk ACC particles and mineral deposits as well as the surface of calcite crystals into which they convert have a granular nanostructure similar to that described in other biominerals ( In conclusion, avian eggshell mineralization occurs through a transient amorphous mineral phase which is metastable and progressively gives way to crystalline calcite, the only calcium carbonate polymorph that is detected in the mature eggshell. The direct conversion into calcite is predetermined and facilitated by the proto-calcitic structure of the amorphous calcium carbonate. During the process of eggshell mineralization, the uterine fluid solution chemistry is controlled by the formation and dissolution of ACC, which is in equilibrium with the uterine fluid throughout the process (see We are grateful for financial support through grants CGL2011-25906 ( Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
