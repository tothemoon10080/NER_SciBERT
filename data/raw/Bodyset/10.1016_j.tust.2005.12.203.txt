Tunnelling analysis is a matter of 3-D cases rather than 2-D. In fact, to examine stress redistribution and ground response to tunnelling ahead and behind the tunnel face, 3-D FE analysis is required to be conducted. The objective of this paper is to describe and evaluate 2-D and 3-D Finite Element (FE) analyses for New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) in soft ground. First, 2-D plane strain FE analyses were conducted. The best 2-D model whose predictions were in a great agreement with the field measurements was found to be sequential excavation model (SEM), which follows closely the construction sequences used in the field. Second, 3-D FE analysis has been carried out to predict transverse and longitudinal surface settlement profiles over the tunnel centreline using the SEM process as this model produced the best predictions in 2-D analysis. In order to take account the deformations prior to lining installation Hypothetical Modulus of Elasticity (HME) soft lining approach were adopted. In this method, predetermined HME values for the lining are introduced to consider the ground deformation prior to shotcrete installation and until the shotcrete gains their full strength, green shotcrete behaviour. Karakus (2003) reported that the amount of reduction factor (
