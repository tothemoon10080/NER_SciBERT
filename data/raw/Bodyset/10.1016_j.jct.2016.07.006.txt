The phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties of FeSO4·7H2O in the FeSO4−Ti(SO4)2−H2SO4−H2O system are of critical significance because iron removal is one of the most important stages in the sulfate process for titania production. The solubility of the FeSO4·7H2O in the Ti(SO4)2−H2SO4−H2O system was measured over the temperature range from 278 to 298K using a dynamic method. The initial concentrations of Ti(SO4)2 and H2SO4 were 0.2–1.0mol·kg−1 and 2.0–3.5mol·kg−1, respectively. It was found that the solubility of FeSO4·7H2O significantly increased with the temperature throughout the entire concentration ranges of H2SO4 and Ti(SO4)2. A new chemical model was developed by obtaining the parameters of the mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE) model via regression of the solubility data of FeSO4·7H2O in the Ti(SO4)2−H2SO4−H2O system. The model with the newly obtained parameters was successfully applied to predict the sulfate speciation in both FeSO4−H2SO4−H2O and FeSO4−Ti(SO4)2−H2SO4−H2O systems and the crystallization behavior of FeSO4·7H2O. The results will provide fundamental data and thermodynamic information for improving the existing sulfate process for the production of titanium dioxide pigment.Because of its scattering properties, its chemical stability and lack of toxicity, titanium dioxide (TiO Briefly, the manufacture of titanium dioxide pigments via the sulfate process consists of the following steps: leaching of ilmenite in sulfuric acid (reactions Although the main goal of this investigation is to study the solubility of FeSO As for the Ti(SO In the present investigation, the solubility of FeSO Analytical grade FeSO The solubility of FeSO For the FeSO For solid FeSO For aqueous species HSO Two alternative methods can be used to determine the equilibrium constant.
