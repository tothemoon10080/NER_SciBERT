The interaction of natural and thermally processed (exfoliated and heated) vermiculites with CO2 during mechanical activation in a planetary ball mill (in-situ) and in an autoclave after mechanical activation (ex-situ) was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), surface area analyses and total carbon analyses. Mechanical activation under an air or a CO2 atmosphere, especially in wet mode, increased the surface area and pore volume of the studied vermiculites. Moreover, activation under a CO2 atmosphere resulted in a higher degree of amorphisation (comparing the basal reflections in the XRD patterns of the vermiculites milled under air or CO2), indicating that CO2 interacted with the sample during activation. From this type of interaction, a maximum CO2 content of 2.74% was determined for the heated vermiculite sample that was mechanically activated in dry mode under a CO2 atmosphere. If the interaction with CO2 was performed in an autoclave following mechanical activation, hydromagnesite crystallisation occurred, and a maximum CO2 content of 3.22% was found for the thermally exfoliated sample.
                  In the FT-IR spectra, the observed bands attributed to carbonate in the range of 1430–1550cm−1 were singlets (for the natural and thermally exfoliated vermiculites) or split (for the heated vermiculite). This effect is likely due to structural breakdown and increased amorphisation created by heating and mechanical activation.Vermiculite is a naturally occurring hydrated aluminium–iron magnesium silicate mineral with a 2:1 layer structure. It can be exfoliated by conventional thermal, microwave thermal and chemical methods ( Mechanical activation makes it possible to induce changes in the solid-state properties ( In the related literature, the changes observed in the properties of calcium and/or magnesium-containing silicates (diopside, enstatite, åkermanite and wollastonite) and aluminosilicates during mechanical activation in a CO Natural, commercial micron grade vermiculite from Palabora (South Africa) was used in this study. An 80% portion of the sample had a particle size between 0.710 and 0.250 The natural vermiculite sample (~ The vermiculite samples (5 The vermiculite samples were also mechanically activated under a CO The mechanically non-activated and activated (under air) vermiculite samples were exposed to CO TG/DTA curves for the natural vermiculite were obtained using Setaram Labsys equipment at a heating rate of 10 X-ray powder diffraction data were collected over the angular range 5° The surface properties were characterised by nitrogen adsorption measurements performed at 77 An infrared spectrophotometer Tensor 29 (Bruker) was used in the frequency range of 4000–400 The total carbon content in the samples was determined by a CHNS Elementar Vario Macro Cube analyser. The particle size distribution was determined using laser beam scattering in a Helos and Rodos granulometer (Sympatec GmbH, Germany). The mean particle diameter was calculated as the first moment of the volume size distribution function. The TG/DTA curves of the V sample (not shown) represent the characteristic dehydration peaks of Mg vermiculites but at lower temperatures, with the first peak at 123 The XRD pattern of the V sample ( The IR spectra of the V, VT and VH samples are shown in The specific surface areas and pore volumes of the non-activated and mechanically activated vermiculite samples milled in dry and wet modes are given in The IR spectra of the vermiculite samples that were mechanically activated in the absence/presence of CO On the other hand, when heated vermiculite is considered, the situation is somewhat different. For the VH samples that were mechanically activated under an air atmosphere with or without 5% water, no peaks belonging to carbonate were observed ( The XRD patterns in  As an alternative method of vermiculite interaction with CO In this study, the interaction of natural and thermally processed vermiculites with CO The maximum CO The support through the
