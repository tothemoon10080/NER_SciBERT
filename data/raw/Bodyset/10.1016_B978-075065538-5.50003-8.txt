This chapter explains that now, only a few people at the lead investment bank involved in the transaction have an understanding of the status of both the legal and marketing aspects of the offering. The sponsor, or lead manager develops the structure of the offering; helps to appoint other participants; coordinates all aspects of the issue; leads the drafting of documentation; organizes the due diligence and verification process; and in traditional UK offerings, is the primary underwriter. The sponsor formally backs the company's application for listing on the stock exchange. Within the investment bank, corporate financiers and equity capital markets people deal primarily with the company and develop an ongoing relationship with the issuer. Salesmen and research analysts maintain their primary relationship with investors. The junior members of the corporate finance team are responsible for the organization of the closing dinner; a major event for all the participants in the transaction that usually takes place a month or so after the shares have been trading on the stock exchange.
