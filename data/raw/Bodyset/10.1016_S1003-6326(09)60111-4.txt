Based on the study of influence of temperature, digestion time, amount of CaO added and composition of aluminate solution on reaction behavior of pure anatase in high-pressure digestion process of bauxite, reaction mechanism of anatase was preliminarily determined. Anatase first reacts with caustic soda to produce Na2TiO3, then the resultant Na2TiO3 reacts with 3CaO·Al2O3·6H2O resulting from the reaction of CaO with sodium aluminate solution to produce CaO·2TiO2·H2O which eventually converts into CaTiO3. Higher temperature, concentration of free Na2Ok (the caustic soda uncombined with aluminate anions in the form of Na2O) and molar ratio of CaO to TiO2 are favorable to the conversion of CaO·2TiO2·H2O to CaTiO3. And Al(OH)4
                     − shows the function of a catalyzer in the reaction of anatase with caustic soda with or without CaO added during the digestion process of diasporic bauxite.
