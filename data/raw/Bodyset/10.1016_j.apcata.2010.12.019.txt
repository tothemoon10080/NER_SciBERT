This study was performed to elucidate the influence of sulfur on the carbon deposition in steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons over CeO2–Al2O3 supported Ni and Rh catalysts at 800°C. The characteristics of the carbon deposits on the used catalysts after the reactions without and with sulfur were investigated by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), temperature-programmed hydrogenation (TPH), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Though abundant carbon deposits can accumulate on the pure CeO2–Al2O3 support due to fuel thermal cracking, the addition of Ni or Rh metal greatly reduced the carbon deposition in the sulfur-free reaction. The presence of sulfur increased the carbon deposition on both catalysts, which has a much more significant impact for the Ni catalyst. Carbon XANES study on the used catalysts revealed that graphitic carbon was dominant in the presence of sulfur, while oxidized carbon species (quinone-like carbon, carboxyl and carbonate) prevailed without sulfur. Meanwhile, the formation of carboxyl and carbonate more dramatically dropped on the Ni catalyst than that on the Rh catalyst. Our results strongly suggest that (I) the presence of sulfur can suppress carbon gasification and promote the formation of graphitic carbon on reforming catalysts due mainly to its poisoning effect on metals, and (II) Rh catalyst possesses stronger capability to maintain carbon gasification activity than Ni catalyst in the presence of sulfur.Hydrocarbon steam reforming for hydrogen (H Three types of carbon have been identified on reforming catalysts, including encapsulating, filamental, and pyrolytic carbons While natural gas is most widely used in commercial hydrocarbon reforming, liquid hydrocarbons are preferred in many situations when natural gas is unavailable The goal of the present study is to clarify the impact of sulfur on the carbon deposition in steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons. We comparatively study the carbon deposition on CeO The catalyst preparation and reforming reactions have been described in our previous studies A LECO RC-412 multiphase carbon analyzer was used to measure the carbon contents in the used catalysts. The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles of used catalysts were recorded using the same instrument with oxygen (UHP) flowing over the samples as they were heated from ambient temperature to 900 STXM was performed on the Beamline X1A1 located in the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY. Complete details on the design, operation, and capabilities of the microscope were described elsewhere The morphology of the carbon deposits on the used catalysts was studied by field emission SEM on a JEOL JSM 6320F at 5.0 For hydrocarbon reforming at 800 We have recently reported STXM results in TPO profiles of the used catalysts after the reactions without and with sulfur for 55 As shown in Carbon K-edge XANES spectra of the used catalysts after reforming of Norpar13 and Norpar13(350) for 55 As shown in In order to gain more insight into the dynamic impact of sulfur on carbon deposition, the two catalysts were further tested for Norpar13(350) reforming at different time on stream (5, 15, and 30  The abundant carbon deposits on the CeO As demonstrated by TPO ( In steam reforming of hydrocarbons, the carbon species initially deposited on reforming catalysts may be gasified by the surface oxygen species (O and OH derived from steam dissociation on reforming catalysts) to form carboxyl and carbonate, the decomposition of which will lead to effective carbon gasification Both the low carbon deposition and the major formation of the oxidized carbon species (quinone-like carbon, carboxyl, and carbonate) on the used Ni and Rh catalysts upon Norpar13 reforming clearly demonstrate the effective carbon gasification in the absence of sulfur. In contrast, the increased total carbon amount and the predominant formation of graphitic carbon upon Norpar13(350) reforming indicates that the presence of sulfur can retard the carbon gasification on reforming catalysts. Due to the critical role of metals in carbon gasification, we deduce that the negative impact of sulfur on the carbon deposition on reforming catalysts may largely originate from its poisoning effect on metals. Sulfur may cover the metal surfaces and block the metal-support boundary sites such that carbon gasification will be dramatically suppressed or even prohibited. Moreover, sulfur may react with the CeO The observation of the low- and high-temperature TPO peaks in the case of Norpar13(350) reforming over the Ni catalyst ( The various characterization results shown in this study clearly demonstrate that sulfur can profoundly affect the carbon deposition in steam reforming of liquid hydrocarbons, and the extent of sulfur poisoning on the carbon gasification on the Ni and Rh catalysts is different.
