                     ·10H2O and MgSO4
                     ·7H2O were determined. The effects of B/Mg mole ratio, pH, reaction time and precipitation temperature on the reaction performed at 90°C were examined. 0.04Na2O·MgO·1.23B2O3
                     ·3.42H2O and 0.06Na2O·MgO·1.65B2O3
                     ·3.34H2O were synthesized at optimum B/Mg mole ratios of 3.60 and 4.80 by precipitation at 5°C and the amorphous compounds formed were identified by B, Mg, Na and XRD analyses and some physical tests.Natural hydrated magnesium borates like kurnakovite (2MgO Mg-borates of varying compositions and properties were synthesized using different reagents and methods on the possible potential uses as thermoluminescent material This paper reports the possibility of synthesis and characterization of magnesium borates in aqueous medium using sodium borate decahydrate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate between B/Mg mole ratios of 2 to 8. Na Magnesium was analyzed by EDTA titration, boron was analyzed by NaOH titration and sodium was analyzed using both atomic absorption and ICP spectrophotometric methods. The synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer, laser particle size analyzer, TG/DTA thermal analyzer and scanning electron microscope. Considering Reaction- Each experiment in obtaining the precipitates was done in triplicate and the mean value was used in the evaluation if the deviation from the mean did not exceed 5%. Otherwise, additional experiments were repeated to satisfy that requirement. Experiments were done between B/Mg mole ratios of 2–4 and the pH of the reaction media during 15 Experiments were repeated for B/Mg mole ratio of 3.60 after increasing the pH values of the reaction media between 8.5 and 11 with sodium hydroxide solution ( To find out the effect of aging on precipitation, experiments were repeated (pH 9.8, B/Mg mole ratio The effect of temperature on aging was tested by precipitating the products at 5 and 80 In order to determine the effect of excess quantities of boron and considering the crystallization of tincalconite at increasing digestion times, experiments were done at B/Mg mole ratios of 4–8 for 1 In order to verify the effect temperature on aging, experiments were done for B/Mg mole ratio of 4.80 followed by precipitation at 5 and 80 Due to the solubility of the synthesized products in water, no washing with water was done during the filtration of the precipitates. Washing separately with absolute ethanol, acetone and diethyl ether were done for samples prepared at B/Mg mole ratios of 3.60 and 4.80 for 15 Particle size analysis and SEM photographs of the precipitates obtained for B/Mg mole ratios of 3.60 and 4.80 are given in Synthesis of magnesium borates for B/Mg mole ratios of 2–8 covering the formation of stoichiometric compositions ranging between MgO No peculiar changes in the Na, B and Mg contents were observed even in excessive usage of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate or sodium borate decahydrate. Also, no new crystalline phase formations were possible to evaluate from the XRD data. Maximum total solids recovery values obtained at B/Mg mole ratios of 3.60 and 4.80 were 23.81% and 32.51%, respectively. The low recovery values obtained was related to the solubilities of the products in water. The pH of the medium affected the reaction and above pH values of 9.8 (B/Mg mole ratio: 3.60), boron contents of the precipitates were increased with corresponding increases in sodium and especially in magnesium contents. High pH values were expected to favor Mg(OH) Increase of aging time from 1 Washing of the precipitates with absolute methanol, acetone and diethyl ether have shown to have no effect on the removal of sodium, but acetone and diethyl ether decreases the magnesium contents. As both ethanol and ether were used for the washing of similar compounds The loss on ignition value for the sample synthesized at B/Mg mole ratio of 3.60 was determined as 29.80%. This value may be considered as the crystal water content of the sample. But, theoretical calculations based on the assumption that the remaining part excluding Na, Mg and B to be the crystal water gives a value of 32.23%. On the other hand, TG analysis shows a 24% weight loss up to 700 Amorphous magnesium borates with compositions of 0.04Na
