Low-grade diasporic bauxite was treated with hydrocyclone of small cone-angle. The effects of apex diameter, feed pressure and feed concentration on separation indexes were tested, and then the separation process was discussed by hydrokinetics tentatively. The results show that the increase of apex diameter changes the spacial locality of the envelope of zero vertical velocity, resulting in decrease of the ratio of Al2O3/SiO2 in overflow and increase of the recovery of Al2O3 in underflow, while feed pressure and feed concentration have no remarkable effect on the spacial locality of the envelope of zero vertical velocity, however, the separation indexes are improved by the increase of feed pressure, but are worsened by the increase of feed concentration.
