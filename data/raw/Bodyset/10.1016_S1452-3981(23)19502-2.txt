Researches in the area of zinc coatings on steel are rather unending because of the unique properties and the very low cost that it offers. In this paper, the mechanical (wear and hardness) and corrosion behaviours of Zn Coated Mild Steel in 3.65% NaCl are described. A thin film of Zn on steel substrates was prepared by electrodeposition technique using Zn particles to form a bath plating solution. Scanning electron microscope and Atomic force microscope were used to study the surface morphology, the topography and the surface adherent properties of the coatings. The crystal particles present were observed by X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction spectrometer (EDS). The microhardness of deposited plate, the electrochemical behavior and the corrosion properties of the deposits were investigated by means of Vickers microhardness and polarization measurements. The uniform deposits of Zn showed fine grains and good protection against corrosion as appreciated 75% hardness value was achieved.
