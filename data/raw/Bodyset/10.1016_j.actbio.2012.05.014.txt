Subchondral defect repair is a multitask challenge requiring the simultaneous regeneration of cartilage and bone. Herein, we describe the features of a hydrogel system designed to simultaneously induce the endogenous regeneration of hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone. The system was constructed as two layers, spatially presenting the chondroinductive transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in one layer and the osteoinductive bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) in a second layer, via affinity binding to the matrix. Human mesenchymal stem cells seeded in the bilayer system differentiated into chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the respective layers, confirming the spatial presentation and prolonged activity of TGF-β1 and BMP-4. Administration of the bilayer system with affinity-bound TGF-β1 and BMP-4 (with no cells) into a subchondral defect in rabbits induced endogenous regeneration of articular cartilage and the subchondral bone underneath within 4weeks. Cartilage extracellular matrix proteoglycans were found in the top layer, with no mineralization, whereas the layer underneath consisted of newly formed woven bone. The results indicate that stem cells migrating into the defect are able to sense the biological cues spatially presented in the hydrogel and respond by differentiation into the appropriate cell lineage. The strategy has a real translational potential for repairing osteochondral defects in humans as it is acellular and can be implanted via a minimally invasive method.A subchondral defect is usually characterized by a structural breakdown of the articular cartilage and the bone underneath due to trauma or disease, leading to chronic disabilities. Treating such defects is an important target in regenerative medicine since damaged cartilage cannot spontaneously heal itself in adults. The avascular cartilage, with its dense extracellular matrix, prevents chondroprogenitors from migrating to the injury site, thus greatly reducing the tissue’s regenerative potential. For decades, cell-based strategies have been developed for treating cartilage defects, involving the injection of cell suspensions (chondrocytes, stem cells) or their combination with biomaterials Recently, following the identification and efficient production of molecular inducers of tissue regeneration and with the development of hydrogels for their sustained delivery, there has been a shift in trend towards adopting acellular therapeutic approaches. Such strategies have been fueled by the finding that microfracture surgical techniques can induce the recruitment of bone marrow stem cells into the chondral defect and initiate its repair Herein, we aimed to examine whether the complex task of osteochondral regeneration can be achieved by administrating the chondroinductive transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) Sodium alginates (VLVG, LVG; >65% guluronic acid monomer content) were from FMC Biopolymers (Drammen, Norway). Alginate-sulfate was synthesized from VLVG as previously described High-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), The animal experiments were conducted at Hannover Medical School, following an ethics committee-approved protocol in accordance with German federal welfare legislation and guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Ref. No: 33.9-42502-04-08/1505). Adult New Zealand white rabbits (female, 8 Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis for BMP-4 binding onto immobilized alginate-sulfate was carried out as previously described TGF-β1 or BMP-4 (50 Macroporous scaffolds were fabricated from the above mixture by a freeze-dry technique to yield a ∼90% porous sponge, with interconnected pores in the size range of 65–85 For construction of the bilayered in vitro system, half of the scaffolds containing either TGF-β1 (100 For the in vivo studies, the bilayer hydrogels were formed in situ in the subchondral defect by injecting, layer by layer, first the BMP-4/affinity-bound alginate solution then the TGF-β1/affinity-bound alginate solution ( BMP-4 bioactivity in the scaffold was evaluated by quantification of collagen deposition in a monolayer of rat cardiofibroblasts, seeded in 24-well plates (150,000 Human MSCs were generated from bone marrow aspirates of healthy donors, collected after informed consent, as previously described Cell seeding onto the scaffold was attained by dropping 15 The DNA content in cell constructs was measured after dissolving the scaffolds in citrate buffer (6% w/v in PBS, pH Cell constructs were dissolved with citrate buffer (6% w/v in PBS, pH Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured using an ALP assay kit (MD Biosciences, MN). Briefly, freed cells from the construct were washed with PBS, lysed for 20 Cell constructs were gradually dehydrated by soaking in alcohol solutions (70–100%), embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm-thick sections, mounted on slides and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (to detect nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively) or immunostained with anti-collagen type II antibody, anti-human aggrecan G1-IGD-G2 domains. In the case of the latter, cross-sections were co-stained with hematoxylin. To detect phosphate salt deposits, typical during osteogenic differentiation, cross-sections of hMSC constructs were stained using von Kossa reagent All rabbits were premedicated with intramuscular injections of 25 The explants were frozen and scanned by μCT (v|tome|x L Explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (v/v, in PBS, pH For type II collagen immunohistochemistry, the rehydrated sections were first mildly digested for antigen retrieval with 2% (v/v) proteinase K (Dako) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 20 Photomicrographs were taken with a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam Mrc digital camera and Zeiss AxioVision software (all from Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All variables are expressed as mean The binding and activity of attached factors in the affinity binding system, as well as their differentiation induction capabilities, were initially evaluated in separate experiments to eliminate interactions or interference between the factors. Following this, the spatial differentiation of hMSCs in the TGF-β1/BMP-4 bilayer scaffold was examined to validate regeneration of the osteochondral interface. The results of the affinity binding of TGF-β1 to alginate sulfate/alginate scaffold were recently published To validate BMP-4 binding to alginate-sulfate, SPR analysis was performed, revealing a strong and specific binding of BMP-4 to alginate-sulfate ( To ensure BMP-4 bioactivity, monolayers of rat cardiofibroblasts were treated with the released medium from the BMP-4/affinity-bound scaffolds. The released medium, collected at day 1 of the release study, was diluted to a BMP-4 concentration of 9 BMP-4 activation of MAPK signal transduction pathway, known to be involved in hMSC osteogenic differentiation The osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs within BMP-4/affinity-bound scaffolds was evaluated by measuring the activity of ALP, a known marker for osteogenic differentiation The capability of the bilayer system to induce a spatial differentiation pattern of hMSCs, into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts, according to the respective affinity-bound factor in the layer, was evaluated by measuring the ALP activity in each layer, as well as by immunostaining for the presence of aggrecan, collagen type II and von Kossa staining for mineral deposition ( The ALP activity was significantly greater in the BMP-4 layer, either as part of the bilayer system or as a stand-alone layer, compared to the activity seen in the TGF-β1-bound layer(s) ( After proving the capability of the bilayer system to induce spatial differentiation of seeded hMSCs in vitro, we sought to test its capability to do so for migrating cells in a subchondral defect in rabbits. The in situ formed hydrogel was constructed layer by layer; the BMP-4/affinity-bound alginate layer was first constructed in the hole, then the TGF-β1/affinity-bound alginate was layered on top ( Gross morphology of the explants, 2 Toluidine blue staining of two-week explants for cartilage proteoglycan detection indicated the formation of a new cartilage layer at the top, clearly distinguishable from the bottom bone tissue ( In the four-week explants, the deep purple color indicated the presence of richer cartilaginous ECM in the newly formed cartilage layer as well as in the surrounding cartilage tissue. The newly formed cartilage was shown to be well integrated with the surrounding cartilage tissue, and was clearly distinguishable from the bone phase found deeper in the drill hole ( In control untreated animals, 2 Immunostaining of the two-week explants for collagen type II, a major component in cartilaginous ECM, revealed the presence of two phases in the cartilage layer, well integrated to each other, but distinguishable from each other by the extent of staining to collagen type II and by cellularity ( In the four-week explants, the newly formed cartilage was well integrated with the surrounding native tissues, and was strongly stained for collagen type II, both in the depth and surface of the cartilage layer ( In control untreated animals, 2 Two weeks post-operation, microtomography scans revealed the presence of bone tissue at the bottom and rim of the drilled hole ( Herein, we aimed to test whether regeneration of the osteochondral interface could be simultaneously induced in a bilayer system, spatially presenting the chondroinductive TGF-β1 and the osteoinductive BMP-4 in two distinct layers. Our collective results from in vitro culture studies using seeded hMSCs in a two-layer scaffold, as well as from rabbit subchondral defects, where an acellular two-layer hydrogel was created in situ, demonstrate the unique ability of the bilayer system to regenerate distinguishable cartilage and bone in their respective layers, thus recreating the osteochondral interface. The key attribute to the success of the bilayer system may be the presentation of the inductive factors as affinity-bound to the matrix, mimicking their presentation by the ECM In a subchondral defect in rabbits, in situ reconstruction of the two-layer hydrogel with factor loading similar to the amount found effective in inducing cell differentiation in vitro was shown to induce endogenous regeneration of cartilage and subchondral bone underneath, as judged by the μCT scans, and histological and immunostaining for collagen type II analyses. Four weeks after implantation, the drilled hole was completely filled by a distinguishable cartilage layer with woven bone underneath. Since no cells were co-injected with the hydrogel, it is assumed that alginate hydrogel enabled the penetration of migrating cells from the bone marrow that were coaxed to differentiate into either chondrocytes or bone cells, depending on the layer to which they migrated, thus creating the osteochondral interface. The progression in migrated cell differentiation along the endochondral bone formation is notably demonstrated when comparing the results of the two-week explants to those after 4 In recent years, the acellular strategy for tissue regeneration using biomaterials combined with signaling molecules has been examined in several studies The bilayer system described herein is unique since it presents the factors in a similar manner to their natural presentation by the ECM, as affinity-bound to the matrix. Moreover, since the hydrogel is formed in situ, it may be delivered via a minimally invasive method and its final shape will accurately match that of the irregular formed subchondral defect, ensuring a precise fit between the biomaterial and the defected tissue, thus enabling its better integration with the surrounding tissues. The proposed system is an attractive solution, more easily applied than strategies which require press-fit fixation of a preformed material We describe herein a new strategy for inducing the endogenous regeneration of the osteochondral interface in a model of subchondral defect by constructing an in situ formed affinity-binding alginate hydrogel, spatially presenting TGF-β1 and BMP-4 in two distinct layers. The prolonged presentation of the factors enabled the complete differentiation of migrating stem cells to either chondrocytes or osteoblasts in the respective layers within 4 T.R. acknowledges a generous fellowship from the Certain figures in this article, particularly Figs. 1–3, and 5–10, are difficult to interpret in black and white.
