Effect of silver (Ag) catalyst in bioleaching of enargite (Cu3AsS4) concentrate was studied using mixed cultures of moderately thermophilic acidophilic microorganisms at 45 °C. Addition of Ag2S enabled selective Cu dissolution from enargite while suppressing pyrite oxidation: At the highest Ag2S concentration of 0.04%, Cu recovery reached 96% while Fe dissolution was suppressed to reach only 29% by day 72. Overall results from thermodynamic calculation, liquid/solid analyses and kinetic study suggested that Ag-catalyzed bioleaching of enargite concentrate proceeds via formation of at least two types of secondary products (chalcocite, Cu2S; trisilver arsenic sulfide, Ag3AsS4): Addition of Ag2S as Ag catalyst thermodynamically and microbiologically contributed to lowering solution redox potentials during bioleaching, consequently satisfying E

Formation of trisilver arsenic sulfide and its intermediate layer (Cu,Ag)3AsS4 indicated that Cu ion in the enargite lattice is gradually substituted with Ag. Such secondary products did not impose a rate-limiting step, since the Ag-catalyzed bioleaching was shown to be controlled by a chemical surface reaction, rather than diffusion through product film which was the case in the absence of Ag2S.Recent depletion of high-grade copper ores has been directing researchers' attention towards utilization of low-grade and refractory copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS In the case of chalcopyrite bioleaching, the catalytic effect of different metal ions has been studied so far: Among those metals tested, Ag ion was found to be effective in catalyzing chalcopyrite dissolution, whereas Co, Mn, Sb, Bi, Ni and Sn ions showed weak or no catalytic abilities ( The mechanism of Ag-catalyzed chalcopyrite leaching has been explained by different research groups based on abiotic leaching studies, such as via (i) improvement of electrical conductivity by formation of Ag   As for enargite leaching, studies on the mechanism of Ag catalyst are still highly limited. An electrochemical study by The objectives of this study were therefore set to evaluate the catalytic effect of Ag on bioleaching of enargite concentrate and to elucidate its mechanism. Three bacterial strains ( The enargite concentrate (P Pre-grown cells of each of four strains were collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with acidified water (pH 1.7 with H Pre-grown cells of each of four strains were collected by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with acidified water (pH 1.7 with H Liquid samples were filtered (0.20 μm) to measure concentrations of total Cu, Fe and As by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; PerkinElmer Optima 8300DV), and Fe In order to investigate the microbial population structure in bioleaching cultures, real-time PCR (Bio-Rad MiniOpticon) was conducted according to the methods described by In the absence of Ag XRD analysis of the original enargite concentrate ( The effect of Ag As for (i), the real-time PCR analysis found that Fe-oxidizing This difference in microbial population structure resulted in deterioration of microbial Fe As for (ii), rest potentials of the minerals were reported to be as follows: 164 mV vs. SCE (408 mV vs. SHE) for enargite, 398 mV vs. SCE (642 mV vs. SHE) for pyrite ( Since pyrite bioleaching favors high redox potential conditions, the above effects would likely have contributed to suppression of pyrite bioleaching. The theory of Ag-catalyzed chalcopyrite leaching ( In the absence of Ag, when The optimal   In order to estimate whether or not the above Cu In order to estimate whether or not the above Cu The calculated The calculated In the presence of Ag, this optimal range was greatly expanded due to the higher redox potential of In the presence of Ag, this optimal range was greatly expanded due to the higher redox potential of Following identification of trisilver arsenic sulfide by XRD ( ( To further analyze the formation of Ag-containing passivation layers, EPMA quantitative analysis was conducted on different locations of the particle ( In chemical/electrochemical studies for chalcopyrite, metal-deficient sulfur-rich layers (Cu The shrinking core model is frequently utilized to model the mineral dissolution process. Based on this model, the dissolution reaction proceeds either via diffusion through liquid film (Eq. In order to investigate which process rate-limits Cu dissolution during bioleaching of enargite concentrate with and without Ag In the absence of Ag Based on the overall results obtained in this study, a proposed mechanism for Ag-catalyzed bioleaching of enargite concentrate was summarized in Chalcocite intermediate: Due to the low rest potential of Ag Trisilver arsenic sulfide: Cu ion in the enargite structure is gradually substituted with Ag The combination of the above reactions contributes to enhanced enargite bioleaching in the presence of Ag The following are the supplementary data related to this article.
