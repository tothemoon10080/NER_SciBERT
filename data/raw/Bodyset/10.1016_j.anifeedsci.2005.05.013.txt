Ruminal degradation of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) in samples of soybean meal (SBM), barley grain (BG) and lucerne hay (LH) were measured by an in situ ruminal technique considering either only the outflow rate of particles from the rumen (k
                     
                        p
                     ) or, both k
                     
                        p
                      and rate of particle comminution (k
                     
                        c
                     ). The effect of correction for the microbial contamination using an 15N technique was also determined for LH. Degradation and transit studies were completed on three wethers cannulated in the rumen and duodenum and fed a mixed diet of LH and concentrate (2:1 on DM), at an intake level of 50g DM/kg BW0.75. Transit studies of concentrates and forages were completed with SBM and LH samples marked with Yb and Eu, respectively. Mean values of k
                     
                        c
                      were higher in SBM than in LH (0.357 versus 0.204h, P
                     <0.05). The same trend was observed for k
                     
                        p
                      (0.0587 versus 0.0452/h; P
                     <0.1). Apparent estimates of the proportion of rumen undegraded CP obtained using both rates were 0.884, 0.745 and 0.825 of those obtained using only k
                     
                        p
                      (0.535, 0.247 and 0.303 for SBM, BG and LH, respectively). Differences occurred for SBM and LH (P
                     <0.01) and for BG (P
                     <0.05). The pattern of microbial contamination of LH, expressed as a proportion of residual DM or CP, fitted exponential curves with asymptotic values of 0.076 and 0.586, respectively. Correction for microbial contamination reduced (P
                     <0.05) estimates of undegraded CP from 0.303 to 0.238, which was further reduced to 0.178 (P
                     <0.01) when the effect of k
                     
                        c
                      was also considered.Current systems of protein rationing for ruminants require estimates of protein degradability of feeds in the forestomachs. The methodology employed should be adapted to the complexity of the digestive physiology of these compartments. Estimates of ruminal effective degradability (ED) are normally obtained by in situ techniques using the rate of outflow of particles from the rumen (e.g., Another limitation of in situ techniques is the error introduced by contamination of rumen incubated residues with adherent micro-organisms. Under-estimations of ED estimates of crude protein (CP) by not correcting for microbial contamination can be important for many feed groups, especially those with a high fibre content ( This experiment was designed to examine effects of considering rate of comminution of particles on estimates of rumen undegraded CP in soybean meal (SBM), barley grain (BG) and lucerne hay (LH). Effects of the correction for microbial contamination using Three Manchega wethers fitted with rumen cannulae and simple “T”-type duodenal cannulae were used to estimate rumen degradation of DM and CP. All feeds (i.e., SBM, BG and LH) were included in the diet fed, which was a 45:55 (dry matter (DM)) LH to concentrate ratio, starting 10 days before the in situ experimental period. The concentrate contained (g/kg): BG (892), SBM (89.2) and minerals and vitamins (NaHCO Transit of LH and SBM particles through the stomachs was determined by pulse dosing to each wether, before the first morning meal (i.e., 09:00 Nylon bags (110 Disappearance of DM or CP (including 0 In accordance with The samples were analysed for DM by drying at 105 Kinetics associated with the models employed were fitted using non-linear regression models. Variance analysis examining effects allocated to the studied factor ( The most distinguishing characteristic of the SBM sample was its high NDF and NDIN ( The mean value of the highest rate constant ( In SBM, the undegradable fraction ( There is a general agreement that allocation of the smaller transit rate constant ( Apparent values of undegraded CP for BG and LH were similar to feed tables ( Apparent values of undegraded DM or CP decreased when considering the additional time of rumen residence associated with mixing and comminution of particles. For CP, the proportional over-evaluation associated with using only The exponential pattern with rumen residence time of the microbial contamination of LH, expressed as DM or CP, agrees with Results of ED of CP estimated using only An in situ method to determine protein degradation in the rumen can be improved by accounting for rates of particle comminution therein. This approach is better adapted to describing rumen physiology, versus using only rumen outflow rates, and leads to lower values of undegraded CP. These differences were important in all tested feeds, with large differences in chemical composition and degradation characteristics. Estimates of undegraded CP also decrease with correction for microbial contamination, errors that are quantitatively important in forages.
