The multiphase (ferrite-bainite-martensite) microalloyed steel was turned to study the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed and depth of cut on cutting forces. The mechanical properties of the multiphase microalloyed steels are analogues to the quenched and tempered steel. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify the significant contribution of machining parameters. The result shows that feed and depth of cut influence more on cutting force than cutting speed. The optimal cutting condition to machine the multiphase microalloyed steels were identified.
