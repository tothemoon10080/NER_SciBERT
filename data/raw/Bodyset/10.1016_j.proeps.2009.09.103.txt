Coal blending optimization of coal preparation production process is one of the most important segments in the schedule of coal preparation production, and the last link of product quality control in coal preparation plant. It can increase the diversity of prepared coal, quality stability and flexibility of production. In the work, a model of coal blending schedule was given with the objective of economic benefits. Relations of optimization parameters were obtained by process analysis, and their model are non-linear. Using adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm (ASAGA), coal blending parameters were optimized. Simulation shows that GSAA can obtain better optimization effects and the optimal parameters have instructive significance on production schedule.
