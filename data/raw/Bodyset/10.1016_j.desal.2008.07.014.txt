The process, called electrodeposition, was used for recovery of metals from aqueous solutions. The aqueous solutions of the sulfate forms of copper and cobalt metals were used as the catholyte solution and 0.1 M NaNO3 was used as an anolyte solution. The effect of current density, metal concentration and type of the cation-exchange membrane to the recovery of metals were investigated, optimum conditions were obtained and % recovery value (%R) for each metal was calculated. At the end of this study, it was observed that, in general, for each metal the recovery of metal increased with current density and concentration. On the other hand, it was determined that %R value increased in the order of CMB >CMX >CMS membrane type. All experiments were carried out at room temperature and the concentration of metals was determined with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
