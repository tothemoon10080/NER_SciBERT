Air exposure of the magnesium hydride materials can lead to severe degradation on the hydrogen storage properties, and therefore is one of the key remaining challenges for its application. In this work, the effects of direct air exposure and solvent-protected air exposure for catalyzed MgH2 on the hydrogen storage properties are systematically investigated. Results show that the direct air exposure of catalyzed MgH2 leads to reduction of the hydrogen storage capacity, and moderate deterioration of the hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics, but has limited impact on reversibility and cycle stability. A short-time air exposure (15 min) causes the decrease of hydrogen storage capacity of MgH2–5%VTiCr by 0.2 wt%, and long-time air exposure (2400 min) significantly deteriorates the hydrogen storage capacity by 1.95 wt%. During the direct exposure in ambient air, MgH2 reacts with oxygen and moisture, and the surface forms a layer consisting of Mg(OH)2 and MgO. Various solvents, hexane, acetone, and ethanol, are used to protect MgH2–5%TiMn2 material. The hydrogen storage properties of the solvent-protected materials after air exposure for 1500 min are evaluated, both the hydrogen storage capacity and kinetics are degraded after exposure. The acetone-protected MgH2–5%TiMn2 shows better kinetics and capacities compare to those protected by hexane and ethanol.Magnesium based hydride has attracted continuing attention as a promising material for hydrogen storage and thermal energy storage owing to its high hydrogen storage capacity (7.76 wt%), low cost and good reversibility [ Air exposure is an important and practical problem to metal hydride materials because it commonly deteriorates the hydrogen storage properties [ In addition, previous efforts have been made to prevent air exposure by using various approaches, such as using polymer protection [ The present research is dedicated to understanding the effect of air exposure on hydrogen storage properties of catalyzed MgH MgH The air exposure of MgH The isothermal hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and cycle stability tests were performed by using a commercial Sieverts-type apparatus (Hy-Energy LLC., PCTPro-2000) that have been used in our previous studies [ The 5 mol% VTiCr doped MgH The XRD patterns of MgH  In addition, it can be seen that the weight losses of the samples did not decrease, but instead showed a slight increase as the air exposure prolonged. For instance, 0 min, 10 min, 200 min, 500 min and 1500 min air-exposed samples exhibited the 5.42%, 5.60%, 5.72%, 5.72% and 5.81% of weight losses, respectively. This is because of the formation of Mg(OH) Consequently, the weight losses of the air-exposed samples correspond to the total amount of both H Activation energies of dehydrogenation were also calculated to evaluate the effect of direct air exposure on the kinetics of MgH Based on Eq. The activation energy is then evaluated using the heating rates ( In order to examine the cycle stability of air-exposed MgH Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetic tests of MgH Furthermore, the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetic tests of pure MgH Three solvents, hexane, acetone and ethanol, were added to the as-milled MgH  The acetone-protected samples showed a higher hydrogen storage capacity and better kinetics than those of the hexane- and ethanol-protected samples. The acetone-protected sample also exhibited the fastest dehydrogenation kinetics, even better than that of as-milled MgH TEM analysis of MgH XPS analysis of MgH According to the calculation by using thermodynamic databases and the software HSC Chemistry, the Gibbs free energies (ΔG) of possible reactions during air exposure are listed in  In the meantime, the surface layer will continue to grow. After long time air exposure, the composition of surface layer become a large fraction of Mg(OH) It is noted that both the Mg(OH) It has been reported the decomposition of Mg(OH) In order to further understand the kinetic behavior of the catalyzed MgH  The values of the reaction rate constant However, it should not be ignored that the catalysts may also be oxidized during air exposure, which could lead to the kinetic degradation. As mentioned before, the kinetics of MgH In order to compare absorption and desorption kinetics of the 1500 min air-exposed MgH Interestingly, the dehydrogenation kinetics after solvent-protected air exposure show different kinetic behavior. The value of the dehydrogenation In addition, an attempt to derive reaction activation energies was conducted using lnk versus 1/T. Unfortuantely, relations of lnk versus 1/T obtained from most of the solvent-protected samples ( From the present kinetics analyses, it was inferred that the MgO contamination has only moderate or limited negative effect on the kinetics of these catalyzed MgH The formation of MgO and Mg(OH) In summary, the effect of air exposure and solvent-protected air exposure on hydrogen storage behaviors of TiMn Exposure the catalyzed MgH The decomposition temperature of the MgH Short time air exposure has limited impact on the kinetics and capacity of MgH Solvent protection using hexane, acetone and ethanol are effective to preserve the hydrogen storage properties of MgH  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
