Strain rate sensitivity measurements were made at 299 K by displacement controlled micro-indentation of an Al–Mg–Si alloy undergoing natural and artificial ageing at 299 and 463 K, respectively. The measured apparent activation volumes and apparent activation work are shown to discriminate differences in microstructural decomposition products expected for each ageing treatment that are not tractable from hardness measurements alone.Hardness testing was one of the first techniques to detect age hardening In the present work we follow the ageing sequence of the Al–Mg–Si alloy, originally characterized by tensile testing The aluminum alloy used in this study contained (wt.%) 0.91Si, 0.42Mg, 0.21Fe, 0.05Cu, 0.05Mn, 0.011Ti, 0.01Cr and 0.01Zn. The chemical composition infers a possible 0.66 wt.% Mg   A composite Haasen plot can be constructed from the measured inverse activation volumes, calculated as the product of Burgers vector cubed ( The measured increase in hardness with ageing follows the trend observed for tensile yield strengths, which suggests that the increase in hardness is due to precipitation strengthening. Comparison of the measured tensile yield strengths For the two-obstacle squared superposition model of Ageing of the SSS at 463 K puts the matrix composition into the   The above discussion assumes that the amount of work hardening from indenting to a depth of 4 μm is large and that It can be concluded that measurement of the apparent activation volume, The authors wish to thank the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support, and the J.P.
