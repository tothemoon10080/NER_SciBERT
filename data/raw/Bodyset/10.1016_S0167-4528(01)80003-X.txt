Coal preparation plants may consist of nothing more than a simple crushing/sizing operation but commonly involve complex circuits cleaning the entire size range of feed coal to reject the majority of impurities associated with run-of-mine (ROM) material. While gravity concentration (dense-medium baths, jigs, and dense-medium cyclones) is the dominant cleaning method for coarse and intermediate coal size fractions, flotation is the dominant cleaning method for fine size fractions. Coal preparation is the stage in coal production at which the ROM coal is made into a clean, graded, and consistent product suitable for the market. This precedes the end use as a fuel, reductant, or conversion plant feed. Coal preparation includes physical processes that upgrade the quality of coal by regulating its size and reducing the content of mineral matter (expressed as ash and sulfur). The major unit operations are classification (screening), cleaning (washing, beneficiation), crushing, and solid–liquid separation, which also includes dewatering by drying. In the seam-to-steam strategy, fine coal is utilized in the form of coal-water fuel (CWF) also referred to as coal–water slurry (CWS). This concentrated suspension of fine coal in water is required to contain about 65–70% coal and not exceed a viscosity of approximately 41 Pas. A final requirement for CWF is that it should be stable with respect to sedimentation.
