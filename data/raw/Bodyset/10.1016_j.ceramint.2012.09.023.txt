Two different hydroxyapatite based composites reinforced by oxide ceramic (20wt%) nano crystals were synthesized by high-energy ball milling and sintered by pressure less technique. Alumina and titania nanoparticles as secondary phases improved densification and mechanical behavior of apatite and postponed its decomposition to the tricalcium phosphate (TCP) phases at elevated temperatures. Increasing the relative density of apatite using nano reinforcements leads to enhance the bending strength by more than 40% and 27% (as compared to the pure HA) and increase the hardness from 2.52 to 5.12 (Al2O3 composite) and 4.21 (TiO2 addition) GPa, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy were employed to study morphologies, fracture surfaces and phase compositions, respectively. The morphological study and micro structural analysis confirm the X-ray diffraction and relative density diagrams.Several paradigm shifts have taken place in different areas such as electronics, robotics, medicine and surgery by the advent of nanomaterials. To some extent, the field of medicine and surgery is the most important area because it is related to human’s health. In this case, biomaterials play a very important role. Among different categories of biomaterials, bioactive ceramics such as hydroxyapatite are attractive candidates for body’s hard tissues replacement Beside the advanced processing routes, bioinert polymer or ceramic materials as reinforcing agents in different forms like whiskers, platelets, fibers and particles have been employed to improve the mechanical properties of HA It has been reported that alumina and titania particles are the best choices for making composite with HA due to their good mechanical properties and bio inertness The purpose of this work is to study the applicability of a newly devised biomimetic synthesizing technique for the production of the nanocrystalline needle-like apatite powder and subsequent preparation of nanocomposite by high-energy ball milling in order to obtain highly dense objects with desired mechanical properties. The effects of alumina and titania nanoparticles on microstructure, phase decomposition and mechanical properties of the product have also been investigated. In the previous study Nanocrystalline alumina powder with the average particle size of 50 Non-isothermal sintering was performed upon heating with the rate of 5 The morphology of the biomimetically produced nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite has been analyzed by TEM ( To study the phase stability of pure nHA compacts, X-ray diffraction of green and sintered samples was performed (  To investigate the effect of the reinforcements as secondary phases on the sintering behavior and mechanical properties of nanocomposite, the green bodies of composites were sintered up to 1400 The same trend for nHA/TiO Similarly, it is reported that by using fine 3YSZ as second phase, HA/3YSZ nanocomposite decomposition (TCP phase formation) was hindered from 1050 X-ray diffraction pattern of sintered nHA/TiO Alumina reinforced composite has shown lower rate of densification ( The formation and kinetics of calcium aluminates have been well documented in the literature Al The density of nHA/Alumina samples increased with the temperature. In other words, the aluminate phases exhibit better flexural strength of nanocomposite in comparison with titanate ones at 1350 Comparing the microhardness results of the samples heat treated at 1250 up to 1400 However, nHA/Alumina samples sintered below 1300  Nano hydroxyapatite particles of ∼50 The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Parvaneh Sangpour for valuable comments and critical review of the manuscript.
