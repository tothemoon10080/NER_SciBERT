Bond Grindability Tests are used to provide basic data for designing industrial comminution circuits. The Bond Work Index (Wi) of an ore is determined by Bond Grindability Tests that indicate resistance the to comminution. The work index is very important but its determination is time consuming and requires skilled staff and 10 kgs of specially prepared feed sample. Consequently attempts have been made to correlate Bond Tests to classical batch grinding tests. In this study, computer simulation of the Bond Grindability Test was made by using a Cumulative Based Kinetic Model. Standard Bond Grindability Test procedure was carried out to determine the actual work indices of six samples. Batch grinding tests were also performed to determine model parameters. After validation of the model, computer simulations were carried out and the results were compared.
