Degassing-induced crystallization in volatile rich intermediate composition magmas results in material stiffening and strengthening that prior to solidification is reflected in non-Newtonian rheology. We explore the effects of a spectrum of such rheological regimes on eruptive style and morphologic evolution of lava domes, using a two-dimensional (2D) particle-dynamics model for a spreading viscoplastic (Bingham) fluid. We assume that the ductile magma core of a 2D synthetic lava dome develops finite yield strength, and that deformable frictional talus evolves from a carapace that caps the magma core. Our new model is calibrated against an existing analytical model for a spreading viscoplastic lava dome and is further compared against observational data of lava dome growth. Results indicate that a degassing-induced increase in strength of the injected magma causes a transition in the lava dome morphology from a dome with low surface relief evolving endogenously (with apparent bulk yield strength - 104 < τ

Our model results indicate a strong correlation between apparent yield strength and dome morphology, with both controlled by degassing-induced crystallization and extrusion rate.Magma rheology is affected by pressure, temperature, volatile content, and crystallization, with these parameters varying throughout the magmatic plumbing systems with a strong feedback on dome evolution ( Degassing-induced crystallization is the dominant process of stiffening in intermediate-composition magmas, such as at Soufrière Hills Volcano ( Different growth patterns are observed for varying rates of surface cooling, degassing, and magma extrusion ( Here we extend the latter approach to further develop a 2D model to represent growth of a lava dome above a horizontal foundation, where the dome grows about the axis of a vertical conduit. The 2D model only considers two force components (neglecting the out-of-plane component for calculations using the equation of motion and the force-displacement laws) and a moment component, unlike the case of a 3D model (three components each of force and moment). The model uses the discrete element method (DEM) ( A magma flux with assumed composition and initial volatile content at depth, is specified as inputs to the system. The development of the dome morphology in the model is influenced by rate of magma influx, system-generated variations in magma viscosity and yield strength and frictional strength of the talus. In We represent the lava dome as an aggregate of discrete particles representing “packets of magma” ( The synthetic 2D lava dome grows over a rigid horizontal base fed by a vertical conduit with a specified flow-rate history. Particles of specified diameter (1.5 m diameter (D) in this study) are idealized as “packets of magma” that reflect bulk magma behavior for computational modeling purposes. The ascending magma is treated as bubble free with a constant density ρ ( Parallel bonds are used in our particulate mechanics model to represent the rheology of a crystal bearing magma with finite yield strength ( Modes of deformation are influenced by mechanical properties of the particle assemblage ( In our models the transition of a soft dome core (indicated by red particles in The particle interaction for the talus are governed by the constitutive linear contact model, and the repulsive contact force in the normal and shear direction are given as, The values of the macroscopic magnitudes of cohesion and coefficient of friction that we select are based on back-analyses of failure on slopes. The range for cohesion and friction angles obtained from such analyses vary from 0 to 1.1 MPa and 0–45°, which covers the rheologic range of viscous andesite magma through solidified lava ( An approximation commonly used to describe the non-Newtonian behavior of magma flow is the Bingham flow law where shear stress ( The onset of non-Newtonian behavior is observed for a crystal fraction higher than 0.4 and a yield stress >2 × 10 Our particle-mechanics model simulations track both temporal and spatial evolution of idealized endogenous lava dome growth. We explore the sensitivity of the patterns of lava dome growth to key adjustable parameters of the mechanical model, and show how the strength properties and extrusion rates influence the morphology of the evolving dome. In The effective bulk viscosity of the magma (mixture of melt and crystal) at any point can be characterized by an apparent flow viscosity that captures the macrophysics of the flow (Eq.  Our modeled lava dome evolution is followed as a function of height and radius in A solid lava plug (red curve in The small lava domes are defined by a model of spreading Newtonian fluid if the viscous stress in the flowing dome is much greater than the bulk yield strength of the lava. This ratio, termed the Bingham number (B), defines the flow behavior of the fluid ( In general the magma in lava domes does In the previous section, we illustrated that for a simulated lava dome evolving endogenously, the apparent yield strength ( Our modeled lava domes are simulated in 2D, and comparison with observed field values requires a 3D model. The development of a 3D model, however, is currently restricted by the very high simulation time required to perform the calculations (this will decrease in future, but current codes are not parallelized). The maximum time step in our model is constrained by the stable mechanical time step ( Surface cooling can affect carapace strength and influence gross behavior of some domes ( Constant flow-rate analog dome-building experiments using kaolin slurry or polyethylene glycol ( The simulation runs are in 2D with the geometry shown in In this section we compare observations of lava dome growth at SHV with our simulations, and focus particularly on the lava dome growth period from 1st October to 12th December 1996. This was stage IV of the SHV eruption ( We focus on the lava dome growth rates during this period (1st–23rd October 1996) which varied from 2 to 0.2 m  The evolution of radii for our simulated lava domes are shown in At intermediate extrusion rates (1.5–7 m Magma ascent rates and decompression paths largely control the evolution of magma properties and contribute to the evolving morphology of complex lava domes. We present a model that incorporates evolving strength and rheology (spatially) into a growing volcanic pile. Our model provides a first-order understanding of the effects of apparent bulk yield strength on simulated lava dome morphology, building on analytical work by Our simulations are intended to improve understanding of dome growth patterns such as observed at SHV and in particular the effect of yield strength on lava dome morphology. Degassing-induced crystallization, as observed at SHV, causes increased strength. The evolution of magma strength causes the viscous material, comprising the core of the lava dome, to become stiffer, which we model here by increasing the parallel bond strength between adjacent particles. The increase in yield strength in turn produces a transition of rheology, resulting in the development of a Pelean lava dome with spine growth (Bingham flow with high yield strength and low flow rate), from an initial dome of lower height that had grown endogenously (dominantly viscous flow, with low yield strength, and higher flow rate). Simulation results discussed in In addition, we conclude that yield strength plays a dominant role during dome growth even where surface cooling from radiation is not significant ( For crystal-bearing magmas such as those erupted at SHV, the magma evolves toward large apparent viscosities which influence magma rheology and growth style ( This work is a partial result of support from the  Correlation of normal stiffness ( Force–Displacement equation is given by Eq. Young's modulus and deformation are related by Eq. Area perpendicular to the applied force is given by Eq. Thus, stiffness is given by Eq. Original length of sample is obtained and is given by Eq. Therefore, stiffness is given Eq. Correlation of Shear stiffness ( The Force-Displacement equation is given by Eq. The expression for shear modulus is given by Eq. Hence the correlation between shear stiffness and shear modulus is given by Eq. Correlation of 2D flow rate with actual 3D values Average velocity of a fluid flowing through a pipe can be expressed by Hagen – Poisseuille's flow and is given by Eq. If the flow velocity in the 2D model (specified in the simulation run) is maintained equal to the 3D value, then to correlate the flow rate in the 2 cases, an equivalent characteristic length/width is calculated. Characteristic length is the width of the 2D model (which for most models is considered as unit thickness). The correlation is given by Eqs. Correlation of microscopic modulus for particle-particle contact with contact stiffness Using Eq. Correlation of microscopic modulus for parallel bond with parallel bond stiffness Parallel bond stiffness is expressed in units of stiffness per unit area and is given by Eq. The original length of the particle system is expressed in Eq. Correlation of radius in 2D model with an effective 3D value Total volume of the simulated lava dome of radius ( Integral of the simple parabolic curve is observed to fit the experimental data of the volume of the slurry dome obtained by Assuming the volume in both the lava domes (3D and 2D geometry) is equal (same flow-rate history). Equating Eqs. The evolution of height of the simulated lava dome (2D model) is observed to be in agreement with the predicted values obtained from the analytical solution. Thus, the radius in the 2D model is correlated with the 3D radius in Eq. The best-fit curve obtained by the multivariable regression analysis (coefficient of determination – R Correlation of Parallel Bond Stiffness with Viscosity The ductile core material is treated as a non-Newtonian fluid (Bingham fluid). The material flow initiates on the application of stress greater than the material yield stress (τ If the change in shear stress ( Change in shear displacement for a given time step in PFC Change in shear stress due to parallel bond shear stiffness is given by Eq. Equating Eqs. Dividing both sides by the same length ( In Eq. (51), the term Hence parallel bond stiffness acts as the plastic viscosity term in the modeling of the bonded material. The effective plastic viscosity in the model is influenced by the time step magnitude which is a function of the mass of the particle and the linear contact stiffness. Thus a change in the size of the time step affects the plastic viscosity of the modeled particle assemblage.
