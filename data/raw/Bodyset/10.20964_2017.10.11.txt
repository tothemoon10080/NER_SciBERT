Nano-LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 cathode materials with nano-sized particles were successfully synthesized by a low temperature molten-salt combustion method at 400 °C for 1 h and then two-stage calcination at 600 °C for 3 h. The crystal structures and morphologies of nano-LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All obtained samples with good crystallinity were identified as the cubic spinel structure of LiMn2O4. The lattice parameters and the particle size of samples decreased as the Ni doped. The effects of Ni2+ ion doping on the electrochemical properties of nano-LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 were investigated by a galvanostatic charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the nano-LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 sample exhibited the initial discharge capacity of 112.4 mAh g-1 with capacity retention of 80.7% after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C (1 C = 148.0 mAh g-1). In addition, the nano-LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 sample exhibited good rate capabilities at different current densities from 0.5 C to 5.0 C. These improvements are attributed to the synergistic effects of the nano-structure and nickel doping of the LiNi0.05Mn1.95O4 sample.
