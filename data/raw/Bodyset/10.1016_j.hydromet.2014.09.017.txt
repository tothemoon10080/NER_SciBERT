The graft-polymerization of hydroxyethyl methylacrylate (HEMA) on micro-sized silica gel particles was first conducted by initiating of a surface-initiating system, which was constituted by the bonded amino groups on the modified silica gel particles and persulfate in the solution, obtaining the grafted particles PHEMA/SiO2 with a high grafting degree of 40g/100g. Subsequently, 8-hydroxyquinoline as a ligand with strong chelating ability for metal ions was bonded on the side chains of the grafted macromolecule PHEMA through the substitution reaction between 5-chloromethyl-8-hydroxyquinoline (CHQ) and the hydroxyl group of the grafted macromolecule PHEMA, preparing the functional grafted particles HQ-PHEMA/SiO2. On the basis of examining the chelating adsorption property of HQ-PHEMA/SiO2 particles for Pr3+ ion, the Pr3+ ion surface-imprinting was carried out by using the effective surface-imprinting technique of “pre-grafting and post-crosslinking/imprinting” established by our group. During the surface-imprinting process, Pr3+ ion was used as a template ion, and 2,2′-dichlorodiethyl ether was used crosslinked, resulting in the Pr3+ ion surface-imprinted material IIP-HQP/SiO2. The recognition and binding characters of IIP-HQP/SiO2 towards Pr3+ ion were investigated in-depth with La3+ and Ce3+ ions as two contrast ions. The experimental results show that the IIP-HQP/SiO2 particles possess special recognition selectivity and high binding ability for Pr3+ ion. The binding capacity of IIP-HQP/SiO2 for Pr3+ ion reaches 0.13mmol/g, and relative to La3+ and Ce3+ ions, the selectivity coefficients of IIP-HQP/SiO2 for Pr3+ ion are 5.22 and 5.12, respectively. La, Ce and Pr are three neighbouring rare earth elements, and the ion radius differences between La3+, Ce3+ and Pr3+ ions are only in a range of 2–5pm. Obviously, in this investigation, the mutual separation of La3+, Ce3+ and Pr3+ ions at picometre scale is realized successfully by using the ion surface-imprinted polymer material with high performance.Rare earth (RE) elements are a very important group of chemical elements. Owing to their peculiar physical, chemical, and nuclear properties of themselves or their compounds, the RE elements play an important role in many fields of advanced materials science such as electronics, magnetism, metallurgy, phosphors, catalysts, glass, laser and ceramic technology ( In the present work, we propose a more simple and highly effective separation technique based on the rare earth ion surface-imprinted material, and try to conduct the separation of the three neighbouring light rare earth ions, lanthanum (La Molecular imprinting is a technique for creating polymeric matrices containing tailor-made receptors and having special recognition ability and predesigned selectivity for the template molecule ( The conventional method of preparing molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) is entrapment way, and the prepared MIPs have some disadvantages ( In the prior research of ours ( Silica (about 125 The instruments used in this study were as follows: Perkin-Elmer 1700 infrared spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Company, USA); LEO-438VP scanning electronic microscope (SEM, LEO Company, UK), STA449 thermogravimetry analyzer (TGA, Netzsch Company, Germany); PHS-3C pH meter (Shanghai Precision Scientific Apparatus Inc., Shanghai, China); THZ-92C constant temperature shaker equipped with water bath (Shanghai Boxun Medical Treatment Equipment Factory, Shanghai, China); Unic-2602 UV/vis spectrophotometer (Unic Company, Shanghai).
