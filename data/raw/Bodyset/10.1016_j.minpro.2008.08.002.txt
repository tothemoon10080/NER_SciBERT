The size–density bivariate partition function is an operator that maps the distributed feed to a gravity separator into distributions of sink and float products. Because separator efficiency is primarily determined by size and density, bivariate partition function provides a more meaningful and quantitative assessment of the steady state performance of both stand-alone and multi-stage separators than the more commonly invoked partition functions in a single particle attribute, namely, size or density. Based on the nodal mass balance, we derive generic expressions for the overall bivariate partition function of a multi-stage separator in terms of the bivariate partition functions of its constituent equipment, their statistical expectations and circuit configuration. A recently proposed stochastic model of size–density partition function for the stand-alone separator is embedded in the circuit equations in order to simulate the published coal cleaner data for an air table, which has clean coal, middlings, and refuse product streams. The air table is modeled as single pass, two-stage separators in series in which the coal feed is split into clean coal and bulk refuse in the first stage, and the latter is separated into middlings and reject in the second stage. General expressions for the overall bivariate partition function and bypass of a two-stage separator configured in four different ways are derived. The partition functions of individual units are converted into equivalent overall stochastic partition functions. Simulation results and their analyses indicate that compared to the constituent equipment operating alone, all two-stage separators give, as expected, sharper performance in terms of ecart probable; depending on the configuration, the overall bypass increases, decreases or remains more or less unchanged; and the cut density can be manipulated over a broad range by changing the circuit configuration. In general, the performance of a multi-stage separator is strongly dependent on the manner in which its individual equipment is linked. Our model could provide a convenient tool for identifying the optimal circuit for a given separation/cleaning task.The probability of a feed particle exiting by sink or float stream of a gravity concentrator is dictated in first instance by its size Our objective in this paper is to describe and analyze the performance of a stage separator in terms of bivariate partition functions of the constituent equipment as well as circuit configuration. In particular, we derive generic expressions for the overall bivariate partition function, including bypass of two-stage circuits connected in different ways. For simulation, we embed in the circuit equations a recently proposed stochastic model of size–density partition function for the stand-alone separator ( The steady state mass balance equation around a separator having mass flow rates Integrating out the attributes size and density yields Since the mass flow rate of particles of size The total mass flow rate of particles in sink stream is given by And the normalized bivariate product distribution in sink stream becomes Or The total mass flow rate of particles in float stream is And the normalized bivariate product distribution in float stream becomes The marginal distributions of sink stream in size (or density) only is obtained by integrating out density (or size) in Eq. Similarly, the marginal distributions of float stream from Eq. It should be noted that the marginal distribution of a set of random variables can be obtained by integrating (or summing) the joint distribution over all values of the other variables. The most common marginal distribution is the individual marginal distribution (i.e., the marginal distribution of one random variable). The Eqs. A stochastic model of the bivariate partition function was derived recently by imposing a random walk on interacting particles settling in a drifting fluid medium in the separator ( Because the bypass is generally considered to be invariant of particle density, it should be same for both bivariate partition function and size only partition function. Moreover, the bypass fraction For validation, the partition model is inserted in the separator equations given in the previous section and used for simulation of coal cleaning on an industrial air table ( As described by earlier workers ( For simulation of the two-stage circuits, the constituent separators are assigned different stochastic partition functions. The values of their parameters are given in   Although the method demonstrated here is for two-stage circuit configurations, it is evident that the model and mass balance approach in general can readily be extended to any arbitrary circuit with any complexity as was demonstrated earlier for a flotation circuit by The construction of a bivariate partition function from experimental data of feed and product samples of an operating separator (  partition surface parameter that accounts centrifugal and viscous forces partition surface parameter that accounts bypass fraction partition surface parameter that accounts hydrodynamic condition of separator marginal distribution of float in size attribute marginal distribution of float in density attribute bivariate distribution of float in density form mass flow rate of float stream mass flow rate of particles of size marginal distribution of feed in size attribute marginal distribution of feed in density attribute bivariate distribution of feed in density form ecart probable mass flow rate of feed stream mass flow rate of particles of size bypass fraction to sink circuit bypass fraction marginal distribution of sink in size attribute marginal distribution of sink in density attribute bivariate distribution of sink in density form mass flow rate of sink stream mass flow rate of particles of size bivariate partition function overall partition function particle size expectation of particle density Scott pivot density cut density The authors acknowledge Prof. Mathai Joseph, Ex Executive Director, Tata Research Development and Design Centre (TRDDC) for his encouragement and for providing management support.
