Solid residues from hydrometallurgical zinc plants contain high concentrations of heavy metals such as zinc, cadmium and nickel, and these residues are considered as hazardous waste. Recovery of cadmium from this waste using sulfuric acid leaching has been studied. It was found that the cadmium extraction rate increased by increasing acid concentration, stirring speed and temperature and decreasing solid-to-liquid ratio and particle size. The dissolution kinetics at 25–75°C was found to follow shrinking core model, with activation energy of 7.21kJ/mol, which was characteristic of a diffusion controlled process. The orders of reaction with respect to important parameters were obtained, and the rate of reaction was proposed as follows:

                     The XRD and SEM analysis confirmed the leaching mechanism, and the results showed that the final residue can be used in other industries, and recycling is a sustainable approach for this waste management.Cadmium is relatively rare metal in the earth’s crust and occurs naturally as a minor constituent of base metal ores Cadmium is used in different industries such as electroplating, pigments, synthetic chemicals, ceramics, metallurgical and photographic products, and electronics industries Zinc plant residue is a hazardous waste which is produced in hydrometallurgical zinc extraction. This waste contains considerable amounts of metal values, such as zinc, cadmium and nickel. Due to high concentration of heavy metals, this residue is classified as hazardous waste, and it cannot be landfilled. It has been shown that the zinc plant residue poses potential environmental risks because it exhibits significant heavy metals solubilization Contributing to base metal losses and potential environmental pollution, it is possible to manage zinc plant residue and mitigate its environmental impacts by using it as cadmium secondary resource. Some studies have been performed to recycle cadmium and other metals from zinc plant residues using chemical methods A zinc plant residue was obtained from Calcimin zinc plant in Zanjan, Iran. The sample was crushed in a jaw crusher and a double roll crusher to 100% passing 2 Reagent grade sulfuric acid (98%) was obtained from Merck (Germany) and used as leaching reagent. Leaching experiments were conducted in a 500 In heterogeneous solid–liquid reactions, the soluble reactants diffuse across the interface and/or through the porous solid layer. Afterwards, chemical reactions occur. The reaction rate is controlled either by the diffusion of reactant through the solution boundary layer, or through a solid product layer, or by rate of the chemical reaction at the surface of the core of unreacted particles. The step with the highest resistance is the rate controlling step The temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant is defined by the Arrhenius equation ( In the Arrhenius equation, The effect of temperature on cadmium extraction was examined in the range 25–75 More than 88% of the cadmium present in the sample was extracted after 15 The cadmium extraction data at different temperatures ( These results indicate that the dissolution rate of cadmium is controlled by the diffusion control process and not by the surface chemical reactions. In the Safarzadeh et al., this model A plot of cadmium dissolution against time at various acid concentrations is presented in The optimum acid concentrations for cadmium extraction have been obtained 20% and 1.7 Extraction data of The effects of solid–liquid ratio on cadmium dissolution was determined in 8% (v/v) H Experimental data in The effect of particle size on the leaching of cadmium from the zinc plant residue was studied using different size fractions. Within these series of tests, acid concentration (8% (v/v)), S/L (0.10 The leaching results in According to experimental results presented in Effect of stirring speed on the leaching of cadmium (particle size: −250 It can be seen from The reaction order with respect to stirring speed was 0.58 ( The leaching residues obtained under different leaching time were characterized using XRF, XRD and SEM analyses. The XRF results showed that the cadmium concentration in the leaching residue after 30 Diffractograms of the residues obtained after 5, 15 and 30 The gypsum and lead oxide intensity in the sample increased markedly after leaching, and the nickel and cadmium intensity decreased extremely. It could be expected that nickel and cadmium compound dissolved in the system. Furthermore, the Fe SEM images of the samples are shown in The results of this study such as activation energy and effects of particle size showed that the rate of cadmium leaching was governed by the ash layer diffusion-controlled process of shrinking core model. The following equation is presented based on our study: In the present study, the leaching kinetics of zinc plant residue in sulfuric acid solution was studied. It was found that the reaction rate increased with an increase in acid concentration, reaction temperature and stirring speed. The decrease in the particle size and solid to liquid ratio enhanced cadmium dissolution. Shrinking core model was used to describe the dissolution kinetics, and it was found that the process was controlled by the shrinking core model for diffusion-controlled process. The activation energy was calculated as about 7.21
