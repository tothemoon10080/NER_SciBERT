Present study concerns assessment of nanomechanical property in the bulk Al65Cu20Ti15 alloy with varying microstructure synthesized by consolidation of mechanically alloyed powder at different temperature. The microstructure after consolidation at room temperature and 500°C exhibits completely amorphous and nanocrystalline states respectively. Nanoindentation experiments suggest that the maximum strength and hardness values are achieved in the sample sintered at 450°C. The corresponding microstructure revealed dispersion of nanocrystalline intermetallic phase (<50nm) in the amorphous matrix.Enhancement of specific strength of aluminum alloys has always drawn the special interest. Recently, different metastable microstructures of Al-based alloys have been synthesized by non-equilibrium processing techniques like rapid solidification and mechanical alloying Recently, various consolidation techniques like spark plasma Elemental powders of Al, Cu and Ti, each having at least 99.5% purity and average particle size of about 50–100 The alloy powder milled for 25 The ball milled powder and the sintered samples were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Philips (PW1710) diffractometer with Cu-K The microstructure of the composite samples were examined using a JEOL JEM 2100 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an Oxford energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) unit and a JEOL JSM-5800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). The nanoindentation measurement of the compacted samples sintered at different temperature was performed by using CSM make NHTX S/N: 55-0019 instrument. The measurement includes the cyclic mode of indentation using the Berkovich diamond tip (radius of curvature Further, The net oxygen content has been found to be approximately 1.7  The samples hot pressed at 450    Despite the fact that the amorphous phase is harder than the crystalline phases, the crystalline phase dispersed amorphous matrix microstructure obtained after sintering at 450  Consolidation of mechanically alloyed amorphous Al Nanoindentation experiments conducted by applying incremental load at the fixed indentation spot minimized the effect of surface residual stress and/or roughness on load dependence of hardness. The observed load dependence is predominantly due to plastic strain gradient which is prominent for the completely crystalline sample obtained after consolidation at 500 Best combination of hardness, Young's modulus, and strength is achieved after consolidation at 450
