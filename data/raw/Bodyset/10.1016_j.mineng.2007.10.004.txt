Bioshale is a project co-funded by the European Commission (FP6 programme) that started in October 2004. The main objective of the Bioshale project is to define innovative biotechnological processes for ‘environmentally-aware’ exploitation of black shale ores. Three black shale deposits have been chosen as targets of the R&D actions. These include one deposit that exists under natural conditions (Talvivaara, Finland), one currently being processed (Lubin, Poland) and one after mining (Mansfeld, Germany).
                  The black shale ores contain base, precious and ‘high-tech’ and rare metals but also high contents of organic matter that handicap metal recovery by conventional techniques.
                  In summary, the main technical aspects of the work plan are:

The natural ability of microbes to degrade minerals was already used in the Roman times for copper recovery, without awareness of the role of microorganisms. In the last 30 years, extensive research has been carried out on biooxidation and bioleaching processes. As a consequence, and where circumstances are favourable, biohydrometallurgy emerged as an industrial reality and an alternative for the treatment of some minerals (sulphides, oxides) for the recovery of metals such as copper, gold and cobalt. There could be applications of “biomining” technologies for the recovery of other metals, such as rare and precious metals (PGM), or for processing other type of mineral targets, such as black shale ores but these would need significant technical and scientific engineering advances. Depending on the metal grade and on the metal bearing-materials, two principal technologies are most frequently implemented: heap bioleaching or stirred tank bioleaching ( be used on a wider range of mineral resources, including metal-bearing wastes of the mining industries; be economically viable and technically robust, with reasonable energy and water consumption and acceptable waste production; help to reduce the environmental impact of the mining industry; benefit from an expansion of the knowledge base, especially of microbiological aspects. This paper presents the Bioshale project, and the first scientific and technical results obtained after two years, with emphasis on the biotechnological aspects of the project. European deposits of black shale ores contain considerable reserves of base and highly valuable rare and precious metals (including Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Ag, Zn, Co, Au, Pt, Pd), of which Europe is a main consumer. The black shale ores are typically poly-metallic ores with a variable proportion of sulphide components. In particular, the “Kupferschiefer” is a lithological formation that extends over 600,000 These three sites, at three different stages of development, were targeted to support the studies of innovative ways of processing black shale ores. Two major difficulties restrict the exploitation of such abundant resources. The first is the low efficiency of the conventional technical means for recovering valuable metals, from mining extraction to metallurgical processing. The second is the environmental impact of the application of the conventional techniques, even with the goodwill of the mining and metallurgy industries on this matter. From the processing point of view the black shale ores have specific features within a variable morphology: the metal-bearing compounds are dispersed as small-size particles and the valuable metals may be trapped in organic matter in the ore or in slimes. This explains the limited recovery of the metals and the problems encountered in the processing and management of the tailings. The research and development challenge in this respect is twofold. The first is to transpose the existing know-how in the treatment of sulphidic ores to black shale ores, and the second is to investigate new processing ways for beneficiation of the shales, among which could be the biotreatment of the organic components and the use of bioflotation for improving the production of concentrates. Therefore, natural biological activity in ore deposits and mining wastes stockpiles has been screened in a search for new bioprocessing reagents and in order to assess its influence on the environmental impact of the present and future mining activities. The two main tasks of Bioshale project can be summarised as follows: (i) to realise scientific and technical breakthroughs in geological models, biogeochemistry, bioprocessing, hydrometallurgy and chemical engineering and (ii) to carry out a technical-economic pre-feasibility study to assess the potential of biotechnology for treatment of black shale ores, integrating socio-economic and environmental impact assessments. The main milestones of the project are: evaluation of the geological resources (geological modelling); selection of metal-bearing components and microbial consortia to be tested; assessment of bioprocessing methods and selection of complementary hydrometallurgical processing routes for metals recovery; risk assessment relative to waste management of the new processing routes; techno-economic evaluation of new processes from mining to metal recovery including social and environmental impacts. From an administrative point of view, the Bioshale project is a Specific Targeted Research Project co-funded by the European Commission in the FP6 programme (contract – NMP2-CT-2004 505 710). The project duration is 3 years (start date 1st October 2004), and the total budget is 3.4 The project structure ( The present knowledge of black shale deposits (geology, mineralogy and geochemistry) is to be compiled and the three sites which provide the base for the project are to be characterized. The distribution of metals of potential economic value in relation to the organic matter content of the ores is a point of focus. Data is required in relation to environmental impact assessments of target deposits. The indigenous microorganisms are to be studied for any roles as potential reactive agents in both environmental impact and mineral processing contexts. The mining extraction and mineral processing treatments (from crushing to beneficiation/flotation) of the European black shale ore deposits (Polish Lubin, Finnish Talvivaara) are to be considered in the context of optimal development of potential bio-hydrometallurgical technology. The objective is also to investigate residues from former and current black shale ore mineral processing. This core of the project is aimed at defining new processing routes (incorporating biological treatments), that are economically viable and environmentally friendly, for extraction of valuable metals from black shale ores. The experimental work covers technical evaluation, environmental impact assessment and microbiological aspects including the assessment of microorganisms indigenous to black shale deposits and bioprocessing cultures by molecular microbial ecology. The main target is to design the selective separation of the metals and their recovery in a marketable form by hydrometallurgical downstream processing of the produced solids and solutions, potentially using precipitation, solvent extraction, ion exchange, electro winning, etc. A service of mineralogical characterization for the processing and environmental investigations is required, including for the mineralogical associations in ores (including with organic matter), tailings and process products (from biological and hydrometallurgical treatments). This work also aims at evaluating the potential leaching of metal contaminants in various contexts (e.g. weathering effects, long term storage, re-use in road construction). A summary of the results of technical studies, by means of process simulation and economic, social and environmental modelling will complete the project. The environmental impacts of the developed technology will be assessed in order to evaluate any potential risk related to the residues generated, following the EC BREF instruction of non-ferrous metal industries. Waste minimisation and promotion of re-use will be emphasised. In order to address multidisciplinary challenges of these work packages, a consortium with partners from different scientific disciplines was established ( In order to evaluate the potential of bioprocess alternatives regarding technical, environmental and economic criteria, a global analysis was carried out to better understand the real position of biotechnologies in comparison with alternative ones. This general study was mainly focused on copper of which production is ensured through a variety of processes. In biohydrometallurgy, two types of techniques exist and are proved as being reasonable technical and industrial options. The first one, and most simple, is bioheap leaching technology. This technology is mainly applied for the treatment of copper ores. Some operations for pre-treatment of gold-bearing ores were also implemented. There are currently several bioheap-leach operations worldwide processing copper sulphide ores ( Some extensive and complete reviews were recently published concerning the role of biotechnology in the mining industry in general, and more specifically in the copper industry ( In terms of process development, it is now known that the Talvivaara Mining Company Ltd. is intending to use bioheap technology and extensive studies have already been made on leaching the Talvivaara ore ( In the case of Lubin, there is an existing concentrator plant ( Many Bioshale process options were considered by the consortium during the first two years of the project ( Bioheap leaching of Lubin run-of-mine ore (option 1) would be a classical bioheap leaching using agglomerated ore. Potential strong points of such an option are those usually related to heap operations. For example, sulphuric acid produced by the present pyrometallurgical processing of the concentrate could find use in heap leaching copper from a fraction of the ore, provided that the leaching of the carbonates and subsequent precipitation of gypsum did not impede percolation through the stacked ore. Weak points include the problem of recovery of silver from the residue and that it would be an option which could not be easily integrated into the actual Lubin district operations. Bioleaching tests showed that the Lubin black shale middlings and concentrate fractions were amenable to bioleaching, with extraction of up to 98% of the copper (options 2 and 3). A variety of microorganisms from different phylogenetic groups were used successfully at widely different temperatures, ranging from 30 Bioleaching of the Lubin concentrate after non-oxidative acid pre-treatment for carbonate decomposition was selected during the initial bioprocess selection ( Following successful batch culture tests with the pre-treated (non-oxidative acid leaching) materials, processing in continuous conditions is necessary to determine the specifications for the application of the stirred tank technology to a sulphide concentrate from black shale ores. The work carried out on the downstream processing is also a technical challenge, specifically the recovery of silver from the bioleached residues. Preliminary results showed that more than 90% of the copper and more than 85% of the silver can be extracted using the continuous stirred tank technology. Better performances are expected to be obtained following optimisation steps. Several process options concerning the Lubin middlings ( Selective shale flotation (including bioflotation) of the Lubin middlings (option 5) was tested. The flotation experiments proved that upgrading the middlings is very difficult. It is necessary to produce a concentrate with a sufficiently high copper grade concentrate for further bioleaching before this option can be considered further. In conclusion, the technical and economical viability of any process on Lubin middlings remains very uncertain. The real consequences of bleeding the middlings stream are still not perfectly known and difficult to evaluate. Two stage bioleaching of Lubin middlings (option 7) was also considered ( Using the preliminary information obtained so far, a calculation tool to compare different process alternatives for processing of black shales has been developed by Técnicas Reunidas. Using available information from R&D tasks, bibliographic information and in some cases estimated data, a preliminary key index indicating percentage of increasing of net incomes over the current situation has been determined. The key index will be useful for comparison of proposed alternatives with different levels of performance. Assumptions for the increase in production, copper recovery and concentrate quality used in the study remain to be demonstrated experimentally to validate the options. In addition, the technical implementation of bioleaching steps remain to be demonstrated at a larger scale. The Talvivaara deposit belongs to the Talvivaara Mining Company Ltd. Prior to the Bioshale project, Tampere University of Technology and Outokumpu Research Center (ORC) did extensive column bioleaching tests in order to demonstrate the feasibility of a bioheap leaching process ( In the frame of Bioshale, several actions were undertaken both on the GTK pilot column and on the pilot bioheaps of Talvivaara Mining Company Ltd. including microbial monitoring, complementary bioleaching tests at laboratory scale and modelling of heat transfer. Even though the industrial project flow-sheet is focused on bioheap leaching of agglomerated ore (option 8), another option of (bio)flotation and tank bioleaching was investigated in the Bioshale project (option 9). In the beneficiation tests, the production of bulk sulphide concentrate was studied for subsequent leaching/bioleaching test in stirred tank reactors. However, the grade of valuable metals (Ni, Zn and Cu) in a Talvivaara concentrate was very low and, from an economic point of view, it was concluded that this route was not an option. The use of microbes as activators, depressants or collectors during bioflotation tests with the ore failed to improve the concentrate recovery or grade compared to flotation tests. The microbial monitoring of the pilot bioleaching tests, on-site in Talvivaara and at GTK in Outokumpu, was implemented. This work was coordinated by Talvivaara Mining Company Ltd. and carried out in close contact with Tampere University of Technology. The work is still in progress and will be reported in the end of Bioshale project. In the frame of the project, column bioleaching tests were carried out using high temperature cultures (>70 In addition to the development of bioprocess options, some more academic scientific research has been carried out during the first two years of the Bioshale project. Production of new scientific data on noble metals occurrence (PGE, Research into the identification of noble metal carriers in metal rich shales in order to explain the mechanism of the origin of noble metals in various black shales worldwide.

The reports that were produced by the Bioshale consortium since the beginning of the project are confidential, but abstracts are available on the Bioshale web site ( Between 2003, the preparation phase of the project, and the beginning of 2007, the project’s final year, some changes occurred and some adjustments were made to the original programme. The beginning of the project coincided with a spectacular rise in worldwide commodity prices. Non-ferrous metals all witnessed a strong price increase over 2005 and early 2006, that was sustained over 2006 ( The consequence of all these issues on the Bioshale project was that the recovery of base metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) from black shale ores became the main priority over the challenge of the recovery of valuable minor metals (PGE, V, Re, etc.) potentially trapped in organic matter. Official contacts were also established with Talvivaara Mining Company Ltd. in order to exchange information and to adapt R&D actions of Bioshale partners to the new local situation. The (bio)processing R&D actions on Polish ores and concentrates from Lubin Area have been focused mainly on copper and silver recovery. Some samples from Polkowice mine (Poland), that should contain higher concentrations of PGE were included for R&D actions in Bioshale project. The various process options presented in this paper have been investigated or are still under investigation. The most promising ones will be assessed against technical, economic and environmental criteria. The results of these pre-feasibility studies will be presented at the end of the project.
