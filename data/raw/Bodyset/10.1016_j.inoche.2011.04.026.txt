Pure SrMoO4 and CaMoO4, and SrMoO4 solid solution crystallites were successfully prepared by a simple electrochemical process. The photoluminescence (PL) of SrMoO4 can be greatly improved by incorporating Ca2+ into its matrix to form solid solutions, and their emission bands slightly red-shift from 500nm to 509nm due to the local structure relaxation. Doping Ca2+ would inhibit the growth of SrMoO4 solid solution crystallites to result in smaller size crystallization. The smaller the particle sizes of the solid solutions, the higher their PL intensity.Alkaline earth molybdates (MMoO In the present study, Ca For the electrochemical synthesis, molybdenum (Mo) plates (99.9% purity) with a dimension of 100   Emission spectra of these samples are given in In summary, well-crystallized SrMoO This work was partially supported by the
