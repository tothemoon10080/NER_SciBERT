Engineering practice shows that rock is commonly loaded cyclically during construction. Acoustic emissions (AEs) are still not effective for use as damage assessment precursors for rocks under cyclic loading-unloading. To explore more accurate damage precursors based on multiple AE indices, uniaxial loading-unloading tests were carried out on granite and marble specimens. The results show that at low stress levels, there are almost no AEs generated in the unloading stage but at higher stress levels, there are numerous AE events in the unloading part of the cycle. In each loading-unloading test, the AE count rate,

During the entire loading-unloading series, the AEs exhibited Kaiser effect and Felicity effects and the Felicity ratio,

                      can be used as signals for rock failure warnings and these combined indices can increase the accuracy of rock dynamic disaster predictions, especially for rocks under loading-unloading cycles. The research findings reported here should provide a more efficient method for issuing early warnings for dynamic rock disasters and provide guidance for the development of warning strategies.Numerous engineering studies have shown that rock is not in a stable stress state when subjected to repeated loading and unloading, such as during the excavation of high slopes, when subgrade highways are being constructed, or during the driving of tunnels In some situations, when the stress on a material subjected to repeated cycles of mechanical stress does not exceed the previous maximum value, there are no AEs until the stress exceeds the previous maximum value. When the stress does exceed the previous maximum value, the AEs increase significantly. This phenomenon is called the Kaiser effect The b-value originated in the study of the relationship between earthquake magnitude and frequency and was introduced to rock mechanics in 1941; it attracted the attention of many researchers. Colombo et al. In 1993, Xie and Pariseau Considerable research on rock failure precursors has been done but most of the studies have focused on a single index or two indices. This makes it difficult to monitor the rock and issue accurate early warnings about rock failures. In addition, because of the different data collection requirements for the different indices, the application of each index as an indicator for impending rock failure has its limitations. For this paper, in order to study the AE rock failure precursor information more systematically, granite and marble, two of the most common natural construction materials, are employed for uniaxial cyclic loading-unloading tests. The AE rate, Felicity effect, and fractal characteristics of each step in the loading-unloading cycle are analyzed. Granite and marble samples were used for the tests. The samples were cored and ground to produce specimens 50 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length in strict accordance with the standards specified by the International Society for Rock Mechanics. To reduce the dispersion of experimental results caused by the natural differences in rock specimens, specimens with fewer cracks and no obvious defects were selected for testing. The ends of each sample were ground flat so that surface roughness did not exceed ± 0.05 mm to avoid stress concentration during loading. The granite and marble specimens used in the tests are shown in A hydraulic press, a servo-controlled YAW4306 compression testing machine (MTS Industrial Systems (China) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used for the loading and unloading tests. An Express-8 AE System with 24 high-speed channels (Physical Acoustic Corp., Princeton, NJ, USA) was used to monitor the AEs. The signals acquired by AE sensors (R15 α, Ф19 mm × 22 mm) are amplified by the preamplifier and transmitted to the 16-bit A/D conversion module. The digital signal parameters and data are then stored in a buffer and subsequently passed to a computer for further processing and display. A schematic diagram of the testing system and photographs of a number of the system’s components are shown in Uniaxial compression tests on specimen groups G1, G2, M1, and M2 were conducted first to obtain the approximate uniaxial compressive strength of the two rock materials so that the cyclic loading and unloading test program could be formulated. The testing schemes were as follows: granite specimens were loaded and unloaded at a rate of 400 N/s in steps of 20 kN; marble specimens were loaded and unloaded at a rate of 200 N/s with each step being 10 kN. In order to prevent the specimen from sliding off the compression head, the load was only unloaded to 1 kN in each cyclic step. The loading-unloading cycles were repeated until the specimen failed. Before each experimental run, the eight AE sensors described above were attached to the specimen at the numbered locations shown in Cyclic loading and unloading of rocks are always accompanied by the compaction of primary cracks and the initiation, propagation, and coalescence of new cracks that generate AE signals. Curves showing load, AE count, and cumulative AE count versus time during the cyclic loading and unloading of specimens G3 and M4 are shown in As can be seen from  The AE count rate for granite and marble specimens during each loading-unloading cycle were calculated by Eq. Acoustic emissions can reflect the rocks internal damage and the emissions are affected by many factors including stress state, loading history, rock structure, rock composition, and others. Among these factors, loading history has a significant effect on the AEs. Kaiser The size of the Kaiser effect can be measured by the Felicity ratio ( There is no uniform standard for determining what constitutes a “significant increase” in AEs for the Felicity effect. As mentioned, Chen et al. The changes in Felicity ratios can only reflect the amount of damage sustained by the specimen in the previous loading-unloading cycle; the damage in any cycle is only reflected in the next cycle. The fractal characteristics of AEs can make up for this deficiency. Grassberger and Procaccia When the first Moving one data point to the right forms the second vector: The For a given The G-P algorithm is influenced by the phase space dimension has an influence on the correlation dimension The relationships between From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the AE counts from cyclic steps 1 and 2 on specimens G3 and M4 have no fractal characteristics. However, starting with cyclic step 3, the AE count shows clear fractal characteristics and the correlation dimensions can be calculated. As shown in Laboratory experiments and in-situ tests by previous workers have shown that AEs can reliably reflect the stress conditions and internal fractures in rocks As previously mentioned, the AE Felicity ratio ( The minimum The Based on the above analysis, AE count rate, Significantly, the use of these combinations of several damage precursors, AE count rate, The main conclusions to be drawn from this study are: As the number of loading-unloading cycles increases, the AE counting rate for each loading cycle shows a steady increase but the rate increases sharply for the last cycle. If an appropriate critical safety value is determined, the AE counting rate can be used as a signal to predict rock failure. During the entire series of loading and unloading cycles, the AEs exhibited clear Kaiser and Felicity effects. As the number of cycles increases, the Felicity ratio ( The AE count does not have fractal characteristics during the first and second cycles; fractal characteristics only begin to appear in the third cycle. The correlation dimension declines rapidly starting with the third cycle and then continues to decline slightly until the rock ruptures. A downward trend in the correlation dimension can be used as a signal for rock failure in most cases, but it cannot be used in the early cycles. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of the above three precursor indices, the best way to improve the accuracy of rock failure prediction would be to use the AE counting rate and The damage precursor information from the three different combinations just described can also be used to predict the failure of other rock-like materials (like rock, concrete, and coal) under different stress conditions such as loading-unloading, step loading, and tension.
