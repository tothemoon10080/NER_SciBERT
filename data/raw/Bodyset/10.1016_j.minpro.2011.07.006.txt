The effect of mechanical activation of bag filter wastes in titanium production (ilmenite concentrate) with carbon on the production of titanium dioxide pigment was studied. Results of mechanochemical liberation, reduction and sulphuric acid enrichment of ilmenite concentrate are reported. It is shown that mechanical activation significantly changes the morphology of particles of produced pigment compared to the standard. The conditions of mechanical activation correlate with the specific surface values of samples and sizes of ilmenite crystallites.The effect of preliminary mechanical activation ( To investigate the effect of MA of ilmenite concentrate in mixture with coke in various mechanochemical reactors on changes in physicochemical properties of MA products; To apply the existing sulphuric method ( The initial raw material was the waste of ilmenite concentrate ( For the MA (time τ of MA was varied over the range 5–90 A steel three-vial planetary mill PMM An AGO Here cos For increase the degree of carbothermal reduction of WIC, both coke (with the mass fraction On the basis of the results obtained, investigation was carried out with an increased mass concentration of the reducing agent up to 35% in the batch; this allowed complete transformation of iron into the magnetic phase. Roasting of the samples was carried out in a similar manner. Investigation of the effect of joint MA of the systems WIC In industry, the raw material for manufacturing the pigment is titanium-containing slag obtained by thermal reduction of the ore according to the scheme: FeO·TiO Depending on smelting conditions, phases of products with different treatability in sulphur acid treatment can be formed in the slag of similar chemical composition. Because of this, in order to decrease the temperature of reducing process, it is recommended to carry out MA of the initial mixture with the WIC mass concentration of 80%, carbon-containing component 20% under the following optimal conditions: MA time, It is known that MA causes an increase in specific surface ( It was shown ( It should be noted that the mechanism of MA in the system (WIC The effect of mechanical activation of ilmenite concentrate with carbon additives on its phase composition, reduction roasting, magnetic separation, and sulphuric acid leaching was studied. The specific surface
