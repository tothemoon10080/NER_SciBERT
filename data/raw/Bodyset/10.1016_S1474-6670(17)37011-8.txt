Automation of the sorting of non-ferrous metallic scrap particles is not generally applied, despite the availability of a number of sorting systems. This contribution highlights the components of a sorting system, their state-of-the-art, and their prospects regarding farther improvements. Advanced data processing and the combination of different sensors are expected to gain in importance in future applications, and increase the automation of sorting. A prototype system developed at Delft University demonstrates the advantages of this approach.
