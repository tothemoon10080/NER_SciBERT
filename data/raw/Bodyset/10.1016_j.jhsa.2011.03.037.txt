Boutonniere deformity associated with a dorsal avulsion fracture of the central slip overlying the proximal interphalangeal joint results in loss of extension of the joint and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint. This article reports a surgical technique for treatment of the injury in 21 digits, which involves application of loop stainless steel wire. We also present the long-term results using the technique on the digits. Loop wire fixation is a successful surgical technique for the treatment of displaced central slip avulsion fracture.
