Osteosynthesis in children and adolescents has been widely modified during last years. Growth in child is anatomically and physiologically controlled by physis and periosteum. It also has been impacted by recent progresses.
               Concerning pediatric traumatolgy, Elastic Stable Intra Medullary Nailing has become the common and gold standard surgical procedure. Choose of material, size of pins are detailled. All misfits and complications are exposed, conducting to define method's limits.
               Concerning orthopedic surgery in children, protection of periosteum is the main goal. New types of osteosynthesis like locking screws plates have been introduced in pediatric practice for osteotomies. Theses new materials are particulary indicated for children due to the small size of devices and the necesserary micromovements for consolidation.
               These new devices allow early mobility and restoratoration of autonomy which is important in neurologic child, avoiding complementary casting.
               A presentation showing current experimental datas of usual osteosynthesis has been done for respect of physis, wich is well known in children's surgeon world. Adjustable abutments pins allow compression control entering the therapeutical challenge, just between pins and screws wich are now cannulated, conducting to a mini-invasive surgery development.
               The aim of this lecture is to justify paediatric technical particularities establishing a straight link betwen growth's schemas, bone consolidation and techological development.
