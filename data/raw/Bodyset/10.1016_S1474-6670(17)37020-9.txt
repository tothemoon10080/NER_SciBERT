The growing interest in utilising multivariable statistical dimension reduction techniques, PCA and PLS, and neural networks in process monitoring and analysis has resulted in a number of successful industrial applications. This paper describes a process study on the effects of the chemical quality of the anodes on the physical quality of produced cathodes at a copper electrorefining plant through PCA, SOM and a combination of these two techniques. The clustering of anode analysis data over time was compared with the physical quality data of the cathodes.
