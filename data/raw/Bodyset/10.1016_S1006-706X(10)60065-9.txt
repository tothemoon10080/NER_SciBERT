One of the effective methods of reducing coke consumption is pulverized coal injection. The most important problems encountered in this method are reduced permeability, unburned and high ash content. To select the best coal for injection, suitable tests can be used. Therefore, experiments such as proximate and ultimate analysis, Rock-Eval and combustion tests were performed on four kinds of coals from different mines, including Sarakhs, Sangrood, Karmozd, and Tabas. The results of proximate and ultimate analysis indicated that although the sulfur content and ash content of selected coals were a little high, they were suitable for coal injection. The results of combustion experiments and Rock-Eval tests showed that Karmozd coal was the best one to be injected into blast furnace. The result indicated that the mixing of coals could improve the combustion properties of pulverized coals.
