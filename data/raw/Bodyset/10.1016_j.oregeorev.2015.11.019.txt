The Anle Zn–Pb deposit, hosted by Upper Cambrian dolostone, is located in the southern Songpan–Ganzi Block in southwest China. In this deposit, ore bodies occur as stratiform lenses and consist of galena, sphalerite and pyrite as ore minerals, and quartz, dolomite and calcite as gangue minerals. The mineralization shows mainly vein, banded and brecciated structures. Four ore bodies have been found in the Anle deposit, with a combined 2.0milliontonnes (Mt) of sulfide ores at average grades of 1.64wt.% Pb, 6.64wt.% Zn and 45g/t Ag. Brown, brownish-yellow and yellow sphalerite samples have δ66Zn values ranging from +0.08 to +0.10‰ (average+0.09‰, n
                     =3), +0.12 to +0.38‰ (average+0.24‰, n
                     =8) and +0.40 to +0.50‰ (average+0.46‰, n
                     =3), respectively. We interpret the progressively heavier Zn isotopes from brown to yellow sphalerite as being led by kinetic Raleigh fractional crystallization. Calcite samples have δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values ranging from −4.8 to −0.2‰ (average −1.7‰, n
                     =7) and +17.9 to +21.4‰ (average +19.6‰, n
                     =7), respectively. Whole-rock δ13CPDB and δ18OSMOW values of the Cambrian ore-hosting dolostone range from +0.1 to +1.1‰ (average +0.6‰, n
                     =3) and +23.2 to +24.1‰ (average +23.6‰, n
                     =3), respectively. This suggests that carbon in the ore-forming fluids was provided by the host dolostone through carbonate dissolution. δ34SCDT values of sulfide samples range between −1.3‰ and +17.8‰ with an average value of +6.3‰ (n
                     =25), lower than evaporites (such as barite +19.8‰) in the overlaying Lower Ordovician sedimentary strata. The data suggest that sulfur in the hydrothermal fluids were derived from evaporites by thermo-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR). 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios for sulfide minerals range from 17.63 to 17.86, 15.58 to 15.69 and 37.62 to 37.95, respectively. The data are similar to those of the age-corrected Cambrian ore-hosting dolostone (206Pb/204Pb=17.70–17.98, 207Pb/204Pb=15.58–15.65 and 208Pb/204Pb=37.67–38.06), but lower than those of age-corrected Ordovician sandstone and slate (206Pb/204Pb=18.54–19.58, 207Pb/204Pb=15.73–15.81 and 208Pb/204Pb=38.44–39.60). This indicates that ore Pb was most likely to be derived from the Cambrian ore-hosting dolostone. Therefore, our new geological and isotopic evidence suggests that the Anle Zn–Pb deposit is best classified to be an epigenetic carbonate-hosted Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposit.The Sanjiang (three rivers in Chinese: Jinshajiang, Lancangjiang and Nujiang) tectonic belt in southwestern China, extending for more than 1500 The Anle Zn–Pb deposit has been mined since 1736 C–O and S isotopes have been widely used to constrain the source of the ore-forming fluids (e.g., The Songpan–Ganzi Block is bounded by the Yangtze Block to the east and the Sanjiang fold belt to the west ( In the Anle Zn–Pb deposit area, the exposed strata include Middle to Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks, and Quaternary colluviums ( Folded Middle–Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks form the NW-trending Anle anticline ( Four ore bodies occurring as strata-bound lenses have been found in the Anle deposit ( Ore minerals mainly consist of galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Gangue minerals include mainly quartz and calcite. These minerals formed simple mineral assemblages, including sphalerite Ore-forming processes of the Anle Zn–Pb deposit include hydrothermal and supergene oxidizing two stages. Based on crosscutting, overgrowth and replacement relationships, the hydrothermal stage is divided into the sulfide Wall rock alteration is characterized by pyritic, siliceous, ferruginous and carbonate minerals ( Representative sulfide ores and wall rocks hand specimens from drill cores and subsurface were collected. Samples were crushed, and sphalerite (brown, brownish-yellow and yellow), pyrite, galena and calcite separates were handpicked from these specimens using a binocular microscope for S, Zn and Pb, and C–O isotope analyses, respectively. In addition, dolostone, and sandstone and slate whole-rock samples were collected for C–O and Pb isotope analyses, respectively. δ Sulfur isotope analysis was undertaken at the State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, by using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Chinese GBW 04415 and GBW 04414 Ag Sphalerite grains were digested in HCl and then taken up in 6 Pb isotope analysis was carried out using a GV Isoprobe-T thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) at the Beijing Institute of Uranium Geology. The analytical procedure involved dissolution of samples using HF and HClO δ δ δ Lead isotopic compositions of sulfide minerals from the Anle Zn–Pb deposit and wall rock samples are listed in Significant variations of δ Previous studies have shown that at low to medium temperatures (below 250 Additionally, similar to sphalerite from the Cévennes (δ In general, hydrothermal fluids obtain carbon from three main reservoirs: (i) mantle, (ii) marine carbonate rocks, and (iii) sedimentary organic matter (e.g., Ore minerals in the Anle Zn–Pb deposit include sphalerite, pyrite and galena, and gangue minerals include quartz, calcite and dolomite, whereas sulfate is absent. Previous studies demonstrate that under low oxygen conditions, δ Because some Pb isotopes are radiogenic, the Pb isotopic ratios need to be corrected to a consistent age in order to make comparisons between different metallogenic phases. Sulfides have very low U and Th contents, hence radiogenic Pb is negligible and no age correction is needed, whereas age correction for the whole-rock Pb isotopes are needed (e.g., Ore deposits in southwestern China may have been affected by thermo-tectonic reworking and recrystallization by multiple orogenic episodes (e.g., The Anle Zn–Pb deposit is hosted by Upper Cambrian dolostone in the Sanjiang tectonic belt, southwest China, and occurs within the NW-trending Anle anticline. At Anle, sulfur may have been derived from evaporites, while carbon and metals may have been sourced from the ore-hosting dolostone that was affected by the Songpan–Ganzi orogenic event. Probably due to fractional crystallization, the late yellow sphalerite has higher δ This research was financially supported by the
