Bone is a dynamic tissue that undergoes remodelling and mineralization. During the mineralization process, a subset of the osteoblasts become embedded in the matrix forming osteocytes with dendrite-like cytoplasmic extensions that extend into a canalicular (neural-like) network inside the mineralized matrix. Osteocytes act as both sensors and effectors of skeletal homeostasis. We have shown that osteocytes sense mechanical loads, at least in part through primary cilia/polycystin complexes, and function as an “endocrine organ” that secretes FGF23 to coordinate renal phosphate handling and bone homeostasis through FGF23 actions on the kidney to inhibit renal phosphate reabsorption and 1, 25(OH)
