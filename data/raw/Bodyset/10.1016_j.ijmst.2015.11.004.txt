The purpose of this paper is to establish confidence in anticipated minimum bond strength for inflatable rock bolts by comparing the bond strength to variable geotechnical conditions using the rock mass rating (RMR) system. To investigate a correlation between these parameters, the minimum bond strength of pull-out tested inflatable rock bolts was compared to the RMR of the rock in which these bolts were placed. Bond strength vs. RMR plots indicate that expected minimum bond strength is positively correlated with RMR; however, the correlation is not strong. Cumulative percent graphs indicate that 97% of pull-out tests result in a minimum bond strength of 3.3 and 1.7ton/m in RMRâ©¾45 and <45, respectively. Although lower bond strengths are more commonly encountered in low RMR ground, high bond strengths are possible as well, yielding higher variability in bond strengths in low RMR ground. Bond strength of friction bolts relies on contact between the rock bolt and drill hole. Experience in Nevada indicates that RMR is known to affect both the quality and consistency of drill holes which likely affects bond strength. Drilling and bolting in low RMR ground is more sensitive to drilling and bolting practices, and strategies for maximizing bond strength in these conditions are discussed.
