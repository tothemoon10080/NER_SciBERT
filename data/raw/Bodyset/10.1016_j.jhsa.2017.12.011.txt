Displaced unstable extra-articular radius fractures are common and frequently treated with open reduction and internal fixation with a fixed-angle volar plate. Although this treatment yields good results, it might be more invasive than necessary for management of this often relatively simple fracture. In this article, we present the technique of using a cannulated self-drilling, self-tapping (CSDT) construct that can be employed in a minimally invasive fashion. The CSDT offers a minimally invasive alternative to volar fixed-angle plating for unstable extra-articular distal radius fractures. It also can be useful in isolated displaced radial styloid fractures. Placed appropriately, implants rarely have to be removed. The CSDT also allows for early motion and rapid return to activities with anticipated satisfactory range of motion andÂ function.
