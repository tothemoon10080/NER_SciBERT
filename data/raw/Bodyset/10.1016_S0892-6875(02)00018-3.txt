The Camis Mining flotation plant in Turkey treats silica sand using three cleaning stages of flotation to produce a silica sand concentrate for the glass industry. Recently, in an effort to reduce the cost of collectors and improve concentrate quality by reducing iron content, various alternative collectors have been considered as replacements for the existing suite of AERO 801 and AERO 825 promoters. A series of laboratory tests was conducted on flotation plant feed materials to compare the performance of new collectors against the existing reagents. A comparative plant trial using alternative operating conditions was also conducted with the reagents to determine whether any improvement had in fact occurred. For this, the plant performance data were analysed by the paired t-test, and differences between the new flotation reagents (HA-110+HA-150) and the existing collectors were identified in terms of iron content of the concentrate. Furthermore, the cost of the existing collectors is much higher than the new collectors and as a result the company has opted to use the new collectors at the flotation plant.Industrial minerals, such as silica/glass sand, china clays and feldspar are often associated with deleterious iron minerals which impair transmission in optical fibres, affect the transparency of glasses, discolour ceramic products and lower the melting point of refractory materials. The iron content can be reduced by a number of physical, physicochemical or chemical methods, the most appropriate method depending on the mineralogical forms and distribution of iron in the ore ( For specific flotation reagents, it is desirable that their performance is significantly higher than the existing ones due to the high costs involved in procuring them ( A bulk silica sand sample was taken from the feed to the rougher stage of the Camis flotation plant. The sample assayed 97.46% SiO  These data result: The new flotation collectors were trialled in the concentrator and sequential pairs of daily concentrate grade data are shown in The aim of the study was to determine whether the new collectors could produce a lower Fe Mean (normal, AERO 801 Mean (trial, HA-110 In order to test From the results obtained in laboratory and plant trials, the following conclusions are deduced: There is a difference in the performance of the new collectors (HA-100 The recovery-grade data (Fe Since the cost of the existing collectors (AERO 801, 2.7 $/kg; AERO 825, 3.2 $/kg) is much higher than the new collectors (HA-110 and HA-150, 0.7 $/kg), there is a significant cost advantage. Consequently, the company has decided to use the new collectors at the flotation plant.
