I read with interest the article by B. Venkateswaran, R.M. Warner and N. Hunt Firstly, the technique described to measure the length of the tibial nail by measuring the distance from knee joint to the ankle joint (JJm) routinely involves the deduction by 2 Secondly, we also have to bear in mind that the discrepancy in the nail length may also arise due to the distraction at the fracture site which occassionally occurs while hammering the nail into the medullary canal. Hence even though the nail length measurement taken preoperatively are correct, the nail looks shorter in the post operative films due to the distraction. Occassionally the comminution or the bone loss at the fracture site may also cause the similar problems. We usually confirm intra-operatively, the measured preoperative length of the nail by measuring the length of the guide wire. The guide wire is passed through the fracture site and impacted into the cancellous bone of the distal tibia with manual force which is the subchondral bone of the distal tibia and we measure the length till the tibial tuberosity which in most of the cases is the same as the length measured preoperatively using the joint line technique.
