The KMnO4
                     Fe(II) process was proved to have good application potential in Microcystis aeruginosa removal, although at relatively high doses. This study aims to improve the algae removal in KMnO4
                     Fe(II) process by moderate prechlorination, which can realize the desorption of surface-adsorbed organic matter (S-AOM) from algae cells without damaging cell integrity. S-AOM was proved to not only inhibit algae removal but also maintain cell integrity, using various dilution methods for algal suspension preparation. The dilution after filtration method mainly removed the dissolved organics in cultured M. aeruginosa, while the dilution after centrifugal cleaning method could also remove the S-AOM on algae cells. Compared with the S-AOM-removed algal suspension, the lower algae removal in KMnO4
                     Fe(II) process and the reduced proportion of damaged cells during prechlorination of algal suspension without S-AOM removed indicated the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal and the protective function of S-AOM toward cell integrity, respectively. Moderate prechlorination of directly diluted M. aeruginosa could be realized at chlorine doses of below 0.5 mg/L, and the damaged cell ratios were below 4% after 5-min prechlorination. The ability of the KMnO4
                     Fe(II) process to remove algae was dramatically enhanced by the elevation of chlorine dose from 0 to 0.5 mg/L, as more S-AOM was desorbed during prechlorination. Additionally, algae cells were easily captured by flocs after moderate prechlorination, which benefited the floc aggregation for formation of tightly bounded algae flocs. Therefore, the desorption of S-AOM without damaging cell integrity is the key feature of moderate prechlorination, which can be applied in improving the algae removal of KMnO4
                     Fe(II) process.The removal of algae cells in water sources is a continuing concern for drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) worldwide. The traditional water treatment processes show limited efficiency in achieving satisfactory removal of algae cells, not only because of the high motility, low specific density, diverse morphology and negative surface charge characteristics of algae cells ( Many strategies have been proposed to enhance algae removal based on the conventional treatment processes, such as the introduction of dissolved air flotation, ultrafiltration, hydrodynamic cavitation and electro-coagulation-flotation processes ( It is worth mentioning that the reaction between KMnO In addition, lower-dosed oxidant has been reported to mainly react with the S-AOM without damaging the algae cell integrity ( Based on the above considerations, this study aims to: 1) investigate the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal; 2) verify the protective function of S-AOM toward cell integrity; 3) clarify the moderate prechlorination process from both S-AOM desorption and cell integrity maintenance aspects; 4) evaluate the feasibility of applying moderate prechlorination in algae removal by the KMnO The algae species used in this study was Four dilution methods with source water were used for testing the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal by the KMnO In order to test the protective function of S-AOM toward cell integrity, the cultured algae cells were suspended with PBS after filtration and centrifugal cleaning respectively. All samples were rapidly mixed at 250 rpm for 5 min after the addition of chlorine (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg/L). Na The effects of prechlorination on cell integrity and S-AOM desorption were tested by the direct dilution of algae cells with source water. All the samples were rapidly mixed with the added chlorine (0–2 mg/L) at 250 rpm for 5 min Na For testing the effects of prechlorination on algae removal by the KMnO Cell integrity was determined for individual cells using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur 4CLR, BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) equipped with an argon ion laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm for fluorescence measurement. SYTOX green nucleic acid stain was used to determine the cell integrity according to the method of Daly ( OD The DOC concentration in the dissolved phase of algal suspension was measured with a Shimadzu TOC-V Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; SU-8020, Hitachi, Japan) was used to observe the morphologies of algae flocs formed during the KMnO To investigate the role of S-AOM in algae removal and cell integrity, four dilution methods were used for algal suspension preparation, including direct dilution and diluting the deposited cells after filtration, centrifugation, and centrifugal cleaning respectively. The effects of dilution methods on the removal of dissolved organics and S-AOM from cultured algae are summarized in The directly diluted algal suspension contains both organics in the dissolved phase and S-AOM on algae cells. The filtration method can mainly remove the dissolved organics in cultured algae. Centrifugation has been widely used for separating the algae cells from the cultured suspension ( The effects of S-AOM on algae removal from source water are illustrated in In order to further demonstrate the inhibitory role of S-AOM in algae removal from source water, the algae removal efficiency was tested with various doses of KMnO  Chlorine has been reported to be capable of damaging algae cells, and the damage level is highly dependent on the oxidant dose (  Chlorine at low doses, i.e., below 0.5 mg/L, mainly reacted with the dissolved organics and S-AOM rather than directly damaging the algae cells during the 5-min preoxidation, as indicated by the low ratios of damaged cells. This result is in agreement with the previous findings that chlorine is capable of damaging algae cells, and the damage extent is mainly influenced by the oxidant dose ( The variation of DOC values after the prechlorination of directly diluted To illustrate the effects of prechlorination on the removal of directly diluted The increase of algae removal with elevation of chlorine dose from 0 to 0.5 mg/L can be explained by the low ratios of damaged cells found in  This study directly proved that S-AOM could not only inhibit the algae removal by the KMnO This work was supported by the The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
