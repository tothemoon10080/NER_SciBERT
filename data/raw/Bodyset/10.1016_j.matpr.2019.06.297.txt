The paper presents the results of the various properties that are hardness, compactablity, permeability, compression strength, shear strength and collapsibility, which are carried on self-setting sand molds. These molds are prepared by mixing the ferro-silicon and sodium silicate with silica sand, in some cases the experiment is also carried out by mixing bentonite to the former mixture. The above mentioned properties are carried out at room temperature, 50°C, 100°C and 150°C. The sodium silicate used has specific gravity 1.5. The different sizes of ferro-silicon used in the experiment were -40+70, -70+120 and -120. Bentonite used is of size -100.After mixing the various percentages and different sizes of ferro-silicon with 3% or4% sodium silicate and silica sand, the preferred combinations that we can obtain the required hardness are 4% sodium silicate & 1% Fe-Si and 3% sodium silicate, 1% Fe-Si & 0.5% bentonite. Also observed that the temperature of the mold increases, the time required to obtain the required hardness reduces.
