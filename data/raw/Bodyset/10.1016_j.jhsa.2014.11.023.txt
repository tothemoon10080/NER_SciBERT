Purpose
                  To present the technique, indications, and outcomes of metacarpal and phalangeal fractures fixed with intramedullary cannulated headless screws (CHS).
               
                  Methods
                  We retrospectively reviewed all charts of patients whose metacarpal and phalangeal fractures had been treated with intramedullary CHS in our practice. A total of 69 fractures (48 metacarpal and 21 phalangeal) were identified in 59 patients. Seventeen were open fractures. Eleven patients had multiple fractures (29 in total); of those, 21 were managed with CHS. In 4 other fractures the method was abandoned intraoperatively. The defect created by the entrance of the screw in the proximal phalanx was identified by computed tomography in 20 patients.
               
                  Results
                  In 63 fractures a single screw was used; in 6 fractures 2 screws were used to provide stronger fixation. All patients returned to full duties or sport activities at an average of 76 days (range, 3 wk to 15 mo). At the latest follow-up (range, 5–54 mo; average, 19 mo) total active motion was on average 247° (range, 150° to 270°) for all fractures, 249° (range, 210° to 270°) for metacarpal, and 243° (range, 150° to 270°) for proximal phalangeal fractures. All fractures were healed and within acceptable radiological parameters. A comminuted basilar phalangeal fracture displaced secondarily yielding a poor functional result. Two patients required tenolysis and further procedures before the final result was achieved. The screw hole represents around 20% of the proximal phalanx distal articular surface.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Unstable transverse fractures in the phalanx and metacarpal are amenable to single intramedullary CHS fixation. Comminuted fractures require more complex configurations.
