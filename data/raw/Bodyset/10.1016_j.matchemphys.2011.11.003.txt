The magnetic structure of the seven layered (7M) modulated martensite phases in Mn-rich Ni–Mn–Ga alloys was studied using Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Mössbauer results clearly demonstrate that in contrast to the non-modulated tetragonal structure two new magnetic sublattices exists for the 7M orthorhombic martensite phase. Based on the unit cell symmetry and atomic coordination, the additional magnetic sublattices have been assigned to the Ni site. The variation in the magnetic properties of the martensite phases has been related to the underlying magnetic structure.Ni–Mn–Ga alloys based on near stoichiometric Ni In the present paper, using Mössbauer spectroscopy, the magnetic structure of the orthorhombic 7 Three polycrystalline alloys, with nominal compositions Ni  In order to determine the crystal structure of martensite phase, the annealed powders were examined with XRD at room temperature. In the thermomagnetic curve, a faint kink (indicated by arrow in In order to study the magnetic structure of these alloys, we have carried out The magnetic structure of these alloys in the NM tetragonal crystal structure has been reported in Ref. In the Ni–Mn–Ga system, it is known that the martensitic transformation temperatures have a strong correlation with the electron concentration. However, if the magnetic and martensitic transformation occurs in the same temperature range, then the transformation behavior is complex Further, the XRD and Mössbauer results clearly reveal the two additional hyperfine components in the 7 The magnetic structure of the martensite phases was studied by systematically doping The authors are grateful to
