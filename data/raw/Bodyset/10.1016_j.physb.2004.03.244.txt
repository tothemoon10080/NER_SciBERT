The kinetics of CaCO3 mineralization was studied by SANS in a 0.1M aqueous CaCl2 solution in the presence of the protein ovalbumin found in chicken eggs. As the scattering from the protein and the mineral was observed within different Q regimes the evolution of the protein and mineral could be followed independently. It is observed that ovalbumin denaturates during the first 3h and leads to a strong enhancement of mineralization.The process of (bio)mineralization plays an essential role in nature as “structural” entities such as bones, teeth or shells are built up by such a process The elementary process of biomineralization is not well understood and subject of intense research. Scattering methods such as small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are a tool which can be successfully applied especially to focus on the starting process of the mineral nucleation and growth. In this respect only very few results are presently in literature We will show here SANS results from mineralization of CaCO The mineralization was studied in situ in a SANS experiment at a temperature of 30°C. The mineralization occurred in a 0.1   Process “2” has about the same shape for the two concentrations but is more pronounced for the lower protein content. Probably, the Ca From SANS experiments we gave an example of the process of CaCO This work was performed within the “Schwerpunktprogramm” of “Principles of Biomineralization” funded by the German Science Foundation.
