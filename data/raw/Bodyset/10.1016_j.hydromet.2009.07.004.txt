The kinetics of pressure oxidative leaching of lead-containing copper matte with sulfuric acid was investigated. The effects of particle size, leaching temperature, oxygen partial pressure and sulfuric acid concentration on the kinetics and mechanism of copper extraction were studied. It was found that the reaction kinetic model follows the shrinking core model of chemical reaction control and the apparent activation energy was determined as 39.1kJ/mol. The order of the reaction with respect to total pressure was found to be 0.64. The kinetic equations for the effect of particle size, leaching temperature, total pressure and sulfuric acid concentration were obtained and a mathematical model of copper extraction from lead-containing copper matte was developed as:

                     This equation estimates the extraction of copper with very good agreement (r
                     =0.99) between the experimental and calculated values.With increasing use of copper for different applications, worldwide efforts are being made to look for secondary resources for the recovery of copper. Copper contained in lead minerals is usually separated from the lead in the form of copper sulfide (called lead-containing copper matte) by adding sulfur in the pyro-refining of lead bullion. Lead-containing copper matte usually contains lead, silver and other valuable metals besides copper. Up to now, it was always treated by pyrometallurgy which has many disadvantages such as low recovery of metals, high environmental pollution, complex flow sheet, high investment and cost etc. Various hydrometallurgical treatments have been examined such as acid or ammonia leaching and electrowinning processes ( More recently, we determined the optimum conditions for the pressure oxidative leaching (Pox) of this matte, that offers high recovery of copper and low environmental pollution ( The leaching of lead-containing copper matte in the presence of oxygen in sulfuric acid medium can be described by the following chemical reactions. In general, Cu The experimental kinetic data was analyzed on the basis of the shrinking core model ( By using Henry's Law to relate the oxygen solubility to oxygen pressure, Eq. Therefore, under chemical reaction control there is a linear relationship between 1 The matte sample was obtained from Xiangyun Feilong Co., Ltd., China, which was produced by the pyro-refining of lead bullion. It was dried, crushed, ball-milled and then screened for different particle sizes with Tyler Sieves, using a mechanical vibrator. The chemical composition of the 0.097–0.105 The leaching experiments were conducted in a 2 Typically, 5 Generally, the rate of extraction of metals increases with a decrease of particle size and there is a linear relationship between the leaching rate and the reciprocal value of particle size according to the shrinking core model. So it is important to investigate the effect of particle size on the leaching of lead-containing copper matte. The effect of particle size from 0.075 to 0.125 The particle size fraction of 0.097–0.105 The effect of leaching temperature from 120 to 150 The calculated results according to Eq. According to the criteria for determining the rate-controlling step ( The vapor pressure of dilute sulfuric acid solution under a leaching temperature of 130 In order to estimate the value of The order of the reaction with respect to total pressure is proportional to a 0.64 power. Acid concentration is another important factor during the leaching process. The effect of changing the sulfuric acid concentration from 33 to 54 The combined regression equation for all the variables using of SPSS statistical software is given as Eq. According to Eq. The calculated and experimental values are compared in  Copper extraction increases with a decrease of particle size and an increase of temperature and total pressure but sulfuric acid concentration has little effect in the range 33–54 The kinetics follows the shrinking core model with surface chemical reaction control and the apparent activation energy of the leaching reaction is 39.1 The order of the reaction with respect to total pressure was found to be 0.64. Kinetic equations relating particle size, leaching temperature, total pressure and sulfuric acid concentration were determined and an overall mathematical model of copper extraction from lead-containing copper matte was derived which gave very good agreement between the experimental and calculated values with a correlation coefficient of 0.99.
