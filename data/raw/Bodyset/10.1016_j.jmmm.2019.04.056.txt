Magnetic materials with high specific loss power (SLP) are desirable for magnetic hyperthermia to minimise the amount of material required to obtain the therapeutic temperature (42–46 °C) to destroy the cancer cells. The exchange coupled core-shell structure and the nanoclusters of magnetic nanoparticles having high SLP values are the most suitable candidates for this purpose. Herein, a simple method has been demonstrated for the synthesis of exchange coupled magnetic nanoflowers consisting of γ-Fe2O3 magnetic grains grown over the surface of MnFe2O4 core. The aqueous ferrofluid of nanoflowers displayed higher SLP values than single phase MnFe2O4 core. The intrinsic loss parameter for the nanoflowers was 3.30 nH m2 Kg−1 at an applied magnetic field of amplitude 250 Oe and frequency 113 kHz, which was significantly higher than the commercially available ferrofluids. The cytotoxicity of the nanoflowers were studied with HeLa cells. The magnetic hyperthermia treatment for 30 min with 0.75 mg/mL ferrofluid of the nanoflowers demonstrated a temperature rise to 46 °C and decreased the cell viability to 17% for HeLa cells. These nanoflowers (size around 40–60 nm) showed better magnetic properties viz. higher saturation magnetisation, initial susceptibility and lower coercivity, making them a suitable candidate for biomedical applications.Magnetic hyperthermia treatment (MHT) is an emerging and efficient technique for cancer therapy In addition to exchange coupled CS structure, magnetic nanoflowers have also been explored as an efficient candidate for MHT with high heat losses The synthesis of core-shell nano-structure mainly involves the seed-mediated growth process, where a layer or shell of the desired material is deposited over the surface of pre-synthesised nanomaterial known as the seed. In this process, the shell, as well as core (or seed), are usually produced by thermal decomposition of metal-oleate or metal-acetylacetonate in high boiling point organic solvents (viz. 1-Octadecene The current work reports the heating behaviour of exchange coupled magnetic nanoflowers consisting of MnFe Ethylene glycol (EG) (Fisher scientific, 98%), Manganese (II) Chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl The synthesis of exchange coupled magnetic nanoflowers were carried out by microwave-assisted polyol method using MnFe For the synthesis of MnFe The aqueous ferrofluids were prepared to study the heating behaviour of MnFe The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for all the samples were obtained using Rigaku SmartLab high-resolution X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å).

Then, the culture flask was placed in a 5% CO MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was carried out to quantify the cytocompatibility of the synthesised MNPs with varying concentration, as described elsewhere The fluorescence imaging was done to investigate the effect of MNPs on the Hela cells.
