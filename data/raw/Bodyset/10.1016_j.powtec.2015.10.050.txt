Fractal dimension is an important parameter to characterize size distribution and shape features of particles. However, it still remains unclear whether the fractal dimensions measured with different methods for the same particles will have the identical results, or whether the similar quantitative relationship exists between D

                     1 are defined in a unified way, and their relationships are obtained under the defined assumptions including the product–sum theorem. The two fractional mathematical models and the three new algorithms including the power spectrum method presented in this paper provide the solutions to the problems encountered in the measurement of fractal dimensions. The Gauss–Newton iterative method of R–R distribution is superior to the existing fitted method. The four relationships of the fractal dimensions have been verified both experimentally and by the computational models. The results show that the relationships among D

                     1 are rational and valid.A self-similar system is called a fractal Most particles satisfy the statistical self-similarity and belong to irregular fractals. The fractal dimension is considered as a useful parameter to characterize the complexity of 2DSPIs. The measurement methods for fractal dimensions are usually diverse in the practical applications. A. G. Flook measured the fractal dimensions of carbon agglomerates by the yardstick method, in which the relationship between the exponent and the fractal dimension is Upon reviewing the previous work on fractal dimensions, it still remains unclear whether the fractal dimensions measured with different methods for the same particles will have the identical results, or whether the similar quantitative relationship exists between If the density for dimensionless coordinates Where 〈……〉 denotes average. If the distribution in all directions is equal, the correlation function can be expressed by the function of the distance between the two points The fractal dimension Where Assume that there exists the correlation function Where, What Eqs. In Eq. Since all three fractal dimensions are unique for a given particle, the necessary and sufficient conditions that satisfy the product–sum theorem from Eqs. Then Then, the relationships between Since the exponents in the equations above are all negative, the reciprocal of Thus the relationships among the three fractal dimensions should be: The relationship between The relationship between The relationship between The relationship among By means of the fractal size, Where, Eqs. The distribution function method is one of the five fractal dimension measurement methods Where, Assuming that the characteristic particle size of every unit section length is Where Where, Where Assume that the step length of the measured 2DSPI profile is Where power exponent α Two different particles, silicon dioxide and potassium feldspar, were selected as the test samples (the materials were provided by Dandong Better Instrument Ltd, in Liaoning Province, China). The samples were divided into 9 and 7 groups respectively. BT-9300H laser particle sizer (also provided by Dandong Better Instrument Ltd) was used to measure particle size distributions. The measurement results from group seven of the potassium feldspar is shown in BT-1600 Particle Image Analysis System (provided by Dandong Better Instrument Ltd) was used to obtain the particle images. The experimental medium was deionized water with a refractive index of 1.333. The shading ratio range was 9.0–14.0. Each sample was divided into four parts and spoon emulated by the multi-point sampling method. The sample particles were dispersed in municipal water with ethanol and municipal water for 1–2 In this paper, the Gauss–Newton method was used to fit R–R PSD functions to obtain the characterized particle size The main factor that influences the measurement of For a fractal surface, when the power spectrum Where the power exponent However, it has not been reported that this method could be applied to the study of fractal characteristics of 2DSPIs prior to this paper. The key to solving this problem is to transform the 2DSPI profiles analysis into a spectrum analysis. In this paper, the 2DSPI profile is composed of straight lines, connecting to the adjacent pixel coordinate points. When the 2DSPI profile satisfies the fractal conditions, the datum circumference can be determined using the centroid of the boundary curves as the center and the average distance from the center to each boundary point as the radius. Then the surface fractal dimension can be obtained through the spectrum analysis of the fluctuation of the boundary points along the datum circumference in the radial direction. When Two main factors affect the surface fractal dimension: the first one is the option of the starting point, and the second is the determination of the cut-off frequency. The intersections of the datum circumference and the 2DSPI profile were taken as the starting points and the cut-off frequency was determined by the following formula: Where Yardstick method is a basic method for measuring the fractal dimension of 2DSPI profiles. The image extraction and the assumption of 2DSPI profiles are both the same as in Section The main factors affecting the measurement results of The experimental data of PSDs for From the results for Most particles satisfy the statistical self-similarity and belong to irregular fractals. The mathematical models for measuring fractal dimensions based on the fractal size provide a new way to study the effect of irregular fractals in particle characterizations. The fractional model for The close agreement between the experimental data and the simulated results in  By introducing fractal size, Silicon dioxide and potassium feldspar were selected for PDS measurements. The fractional mathematical models for The 2DSPIs were extracted from silicon oxide and potassium feldspar particles.
