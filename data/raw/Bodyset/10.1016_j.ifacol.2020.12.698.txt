A survey was conducted to establish the status-quo of industrial flotation control. The survey focussed on the measurements and actuators generally available in industry, the reliability and accuracy of measurements, and how important process variables are controlled. It is evident from the survey that regulatory control is well established with reliable and relatively accurate measurements available throughout a plant. The introduction of froth image analysers seems to gain good traction and enables improved control of mass pull to achieve consistent concentrate grade. Although supervisory control may soon be the new standard for flotation plants, on-line grade optimisation requires further work.
