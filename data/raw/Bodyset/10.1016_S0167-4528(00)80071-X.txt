The bituminous coal fines (<0.5 mm) of the Zonguldak Central Coal Washery Plant belonging to Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise is burned in power plants. In this research, cleaning of the fines having 47.52% ash was attempted with column flotation. The flotation tests were carried out systematically in a 5Ã—5Ã—200 cm3 plexiglass column having an internal sparger. Column flotation parameters, such as froth depth, superficial air-flow velocity and frother dosage, were investigated to obtain clean coal suitable for coking. A rougher concentrate having an ash content of 10% and a combustible recovery of 73.52% was obtained. Cleaning of rougher concentrate with and without vibration were also investigated. By this cleaning process, a concentrate containing 5.88% ash was obtained, with a combustible recovery of 59.27%.
