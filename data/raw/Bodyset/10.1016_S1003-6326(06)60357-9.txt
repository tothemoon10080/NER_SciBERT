Aiming at seeded precipitation of aluminate solution with high caustic ratio(Î±k>2.4), corresponding to the late period of seeded precipitation, the influence of different types of seed on precipitation ratio was explained with respect to solution structure in the interface of seed and the evolution of Al(OH)3 growth units in this layer. The effects of solid content and seed size on agglomeration were determined by calculating the particle number of product. The results imply that the solution structure in the interface of seed imposes a notable significance on the process in the late period of seeded precipitation. Agglomeration still exists in this period. However, the agglomeration bodies break in the case of prolonging precipitation due to the mechanical effect, which results in the increase of particle number.
