A two-stage heap leach process to extract base and precious metals from the Platreef low-grade ores is currently being investigated industrially. As part of the investigation, and by analogy with current gold recovery practices, the present study investigates the preferential adsorption of precious metals (Pt, Pd and Au) over base metals (Cu, Ni and Fe) from an alkaline cyanide medium, by means of granular activated carbon. Experiments were designed statistically to optimise the process parameters using synthetic alkaline cyanide solutions similar in composition to those expected from plant leach solutions. Precious metal adsorption efficiency was studied in terms of process kinetics and recovery as a function of solution pH, and the concentrations of copper, nickel, free cyanide, thiocyanate, precious metals (Pt, Pd and Au) and activated carbon. Results of kinetic experiments demonstrated that the adsorption of PGM and Au was effective and rapid. Based on their distribution coefficients, the affinity of activated carbon for metal ions follows the selectivity sequence expressed below.

                  It was shown that adsorption rates of precious metals within the first 60min were very high, giving more than 90% extraction. Among the different adsorption parameters, nickel concentration had the most influential effect on the adsorption process followed by the adsorbent concentration. Adsorption of Ni was found to proceed at approximately the same rate as the precious metals, showing a recovery of approximately 90% in 2h. The kinetics of Cu adsorption were slower, with less than 30% being recovered within the 120min period. This suggests that the co-adsorption of Cu can be minimised by shortening the residence time. Adsorption of Fe was found to be less than 5%, while the recovery of Rh was negligibly small. The effect of thiocyanate ion concentration was not as important as the effect of free cyanide ion concentration but still had some influence. Under optimal (best) conditions, for a load cycle time of 2h and 10 discontinuous loading cycles, the loading capacity of the activated carbon for PMs was observed to be 0.64, 0.66, 0.17mg of Pt, Pd and Au/g of carbon, respectively.Approximately 75% of the world’s platinum production and 35% of the world’s palladium production in 2011 originated from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa. The most important platinum group metal (PGM) reefs mined are the Merensky, Upper Group Two (UG2) and Platreef. Ore grades range from 3 to 8 However high-grade precious metal reserves have been diminished and the remaining reserves contain low-grade ores associated with high chromite grades (in the case of UG2) or high pyrrhotite content (in the case of Platreef), which invariably leads to high smelting costs (low-grade) and smelter integrity risks (due to the chromite). Hence, many studies have been recently focused on the extraction of precious metals from low-grade ore/concentrate due to both increasing industrial need for these metals and their limited sources (see, e.g. The conventional methods for the extraction of metallocyanide complexes from pregnant leach solutions include solvent extraction, resin ion-exchange, Merrill–Crowe zinc precipitation and adsorption onto activated carbon ( The PGMs dissolve forming complexes with general formula Unlike the gold industry, where carbon adsorption has found widespread use in extracting values from low-grade solutions, no such methods have been widely applied at an industrial level in the PGM industry. The potential for recovery of platinum, palladium and eventually other noble metals from their alkaline cyanide solutions by adsorption onto carbonized supports is largely unexplored and requires fundamental studies of the mechanism by which they are adsorbed with particular regard to possible impurities in the ore body and leach solution which may interfere with the process. A literature survey of the above requirements revealed very little relevant information.  In the present research the mechanism of precious metal adsorption on activated carbon has been studied. Taking into account that a considerable number of variables can affect the extraction yield and may also be correlated, optimization was carried out through a multivariate approach. The factors studied include the influence of solution pH, copper, nickel, free cyanide ion, thiocyanate ion, adsorbent and initial metal ion concentrations on the adsorption kinetics of the system. Firstly, a fractional factorial design was employed as a screening step for the main parameters affecting the extraction process and then a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the values of the significant variables in order to obtain the best responses. The granular activated carbon MC 110 was supplied by Marlyn Chemicals (Pty) Ltd-South Africa. The BET surface area was 1200 Synthetic mixed solutions simulating the cyanided heap leach solution post base metals removal — containing Pt(II), Pd(II), Au(I) and appropriate amounts of Ni(II), Cu(I) — were made by dissolving the required weighted amount of analytical grade of corresponding metal cyanides: K Unless otherwise stated, in all experiments the pH of solutions was manually adjusted using either NaOH solution (1N) or H In order to reduce the total number of experiments to achieve the best conditions of the batch adsorption procedure, two sets of experiments were carried out. Initially, a The results were statistically tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student’s The adsorption tests were performed with the bottle-on-rolls method in 2.5 In order to ensure that pseudo-equilibrium was attained, the mixture was rotated for 72 To prevent attrition of the activated carbon, while still ensuring a good solid/liquid contact, the rotational rate was kept at 105 The distribution coefficient For a solid–liquid adsorption process, the solute transfer is usually characterised by either external mass transfer (boundary layer diffusion) or intraparticle diffusion or both. The most commonly used technique for evaluating the mechanism involved in the adsorption process is by fitting an intraparticle diffusion plot described in Eq. The intraparticle diffusion is the sole rate-limiting step in determining the kinetics of the process if the plot of However a plot of ln(1− The pseudo-second order model constants can be determined experimentally by plotting Solution sampling was done at pre-determined times depending on screening or optimum tests and involved withdrawal of 5 The choice of parameter values can greatly affect the final outcome of a process, thus care must be taken in their determination. In order to best select operating variables for the test-work, consideration of the behaviour of copper during precious metals leaching and carbon adsorption processes was important. Copper remains one of the most troubling elements in both processes. The variables affecting its adsorption on activated carbon included, The effect of contact time on the adsorption of PMs onto activated carbon was studied over mixing times of 0 to 72 In order to identify the factors influencing adsorption of PMs (Pt, Pd and Au) onto activated carbon, the results were tested for significance graphically (  If there were no significant interactions between the factors, a main effects analysis would provide a simple determination of parameter values to maximise adsorption of PMs. However the presence of interactions renders the interpretation (individually for each factor) of these observations difficult, and a multiple response optimization method is a convenient strategy to find the best combination among parameters, which provides high adsorption for several elements simultaneously. The aim of this study was to obtain the optimum conditions under which the multiple adsorption could be carried out. Desirability is an objective function that ranges from 0 outside of the desired limits, to 1 at the goal value. Desirability function approaches are based on the idea that, when one of the quality characteristics of a process or product with many characteristics is not within the desired limits, then the entire quality of the industrial process or the product is not desirable ( The bar graph displayed in Numerical optimization performed to achieve the optimum solutions of factor combinations, produced 49 optimum solutions with desirability of >90%. The best combination in A As the results of the eight runs at centre point were consistent, hence only a single replicate experiment (32 Finally, to assure the validity of the experimental results (optimum conditions and reproducibility), three additional confirmatory tests were conducted using the optimized parameters. The outcomes showed the adsorption efficiency of Pt, Pd and Au of more than 95% over a period of 2 Based on the optimum conditions in The cumulative adsorption loading capacity at the activated carbon to aqueous phase ratio of 1% As the base metal concentrations being relatively higher than the PM (  According to However, in this study, the correlation coefficients ( The use of a factorial experimental design has allowed the identification of the most important factors and their interactions influencing the simultaneous adsorption of Pt(II), Pd(II) and Au(I) from cyanide medium employing coconut shell activated carbon as adsorbent. The simultaneous optimization of the multi-response system by a desirability function indicated that approximately 98%, 92%, 100% of Pt, Pd and Au respectively can be possibly adsorbed within 2 Because base metal concentrations were significantly higher than those of the precious metals, it seemed that competition for activated carbon sites was responsible for depression of PM loading. Maximum control of the stability of nickel complexes would be a key factor for success, especially for the heap leach operation. In other words, for PMs (Pt, Pd and Au) to be efficiently extracted from the pregnant leach solution, it is necessary for all the nickel in solution to be extracted first. Adsorption of Ni was found to proceed at approximately the same rate and with the same recovery as the precious metals, showing a recovery of approximately 90% in 2 Ni(II) concentration was the most significant adsorption process parameter due to its highest percentage contribution (negative) among the process parameters followed by the adsorbent concentration. The adsorption system exhibits pseudo-second order kinetics and that the rate-limiting step may be chemical adsorption or chemisorption involving valency forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate. Based on their distribution coefficients, the affinity of activated carbon for metal ions follows the selectivity sequence expressed below.
