The deposition of synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles on the surface of cotton fiber under ultrasonic irradiation was reported in this study. The presence of the hexagonal phase of the crystalline metal oxide was confirmed by the XRD results. We also studied the electrochemical features of ZnO employed as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. ZnO showed favorable lithium storage properties.
