The bioleaching of pure chalcopyrite by thermophilic Archaea strain Acidianus manzaensis YN-25 under different constant pH was first comparatively investigated. Then the relevant sulfur speciation was analyzed by synchrotron radiation based X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. The acidity of the leaching solution was monitored at 3-h intervals to make it steady at pH 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.25 and 2.50, respectively. Leaching results showed that the copper ion extraction increased during chemical leaching but decreased during bioleaching when pH value decreased from 2.50 to 1.25. SR-XRD analysis showed that, during bioleaching, new elemental sulfur (S0) phase was detected at all tested pH cases; new jarosite phase was detected at cases of pH 1.50 to 2.50; and jarosite gradually became a major phase when pH value increased. XANES analysis further showed that covellite was detected during bioleaching at cases of pH 1.25 to 2.00 at higher redox potential (ORP) value, while chalcocite and bornite were detected at cases of pH 2.25 and 2.50 at lower ORP value. These results suggested that the formation of S0 was mainly accounting for hindering the dissolution of chalcopyrite while the formation of bornite could accelerate the dissolution of chalcopyrite by A. manzaensis.Biohydrometallurgy is an emerging technology and plays an important role in copper recovery from copper sulfides with economic, environmental and social benefits ( Chalcopyrite is an acid soluble metal sulfide, which can be dissolved by H The most studied bioleaching microorganisms include Due to the consumption and regeneration of protons (Eqs. Besides, during bioleaching, some leaching products may precipitate on mineral surface to hinder the dissolution ( Though pH can determine the bioleaching process and it is usually monitored and maintained in a suitable value in industrial bioleaching practice, the effect of pH on bioleaching of chalcopyrite is not clear, because of the limitation in the study by the following reasons: (1) the pH always changes with (bio)leaching; (2) the pH consumption or accumulation is always accompanied with change of ORP and precipitation of leaching products, such as S Up to now, synchrotron radiation-based X-ray diffraction (SR-XRD) and S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy have been efficient for analysis of the composition on mineral surface with high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. By linear combination fitting of “unknown spectra” with “reference spectra”, S K-edge XANES can determine the possible species and speciation transformation on the mineral surface ( The extremely thermoacidophilic Archaea strain The original chalcopyrite used in this study was provided by the School of Minerals Processing and Bioengineering, Central South University, Changsha, China. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopic analysis showed the original chalcopyrite contained: 33.69% of Cu, 29.62% of Fe, 34.34% of S; 1.91% of O, 0.31% of Si; 0.04% of Al, 0.02% of Ca, 0.01% of Se and 0.02% of P. The mineralogical composition tests (by XRD) indicated that the original chalcopyrite mineral is basically pure. The mineral was ground to fine powder guaranteeing that the particle size was 37–75 Before the bioleaching experiment, During bioleaching, solution samples were taken out at 1-day intervals to monitor cell densities, pH value, ORP value, ferric iron ion concentration ([Fe During bioleaching, leaching residues were characterized by SR-XRD and S K-edge XANES spectroscopy. Before these analyses, the residue samples were washed three times with diluted sulfuric acid and diluted hydrochloric acid, respectively, whose pH value was corresponding to the acidity of each culture medium (i.e. 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.25 and 2.5). Then the residue samples were dried in a vacuum drying oven (DZF-6020) and stored in nitrogen atmosphere at −20 The parameters of chalcopyrite leached by For the bioleaching experiment, the results showed that at day 1 the [Cu By contrast, for the sterile control, after 10 The SR-XRD patterns of chalcopyrite residues leached by The S K-edge XANES spectra of chalcopyrite during bioleaching ( The fitting compositions are shown in This work compared the leaching process of chalcopyrite by Compared with chemical leaching, the copper recovery during bioleaching was significantly promoted by thermophilic The variation tendency of total [Fe] showed similarity to that of [Cu The results also suggested the lower pH value, the higher ORP value for both chemical leaching and bioleaching ( On the other hand, the dissolution of chalcopyrite at low ORP value was suggested due to the oxidation of the formed intermediates (iron deficient second minerals), while chalcopyrite was directly oxidized by ferric ion at high ORP value ( It should be noted S For the XANES results at cases of pH 2.25 and 2.50 during bioleaching, except plenty of jarosite, new phase of bornite was also detected as the main phase. The formation of bornite was probably caused by the faster release of iron into electrolyte than copper ( Leaching results showed that the copper extraction increased when pH value decreased during chemical leaching, while copper ion extraction decreased when pH value decreased during bioleaching. Since the higher pH values could result in the lower ORP value, the leaching results also indicated that the bioleaching of chalcopyrite could be promoted at lower ORP value by We are grateful to the staff at beamline BL14B Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) and at beamlines 4B7 Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility for their help in beamlines operation and data collection.
