The controllable synthesis of single nitrogen (N) type doped carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) is of significant importance to evaluate the effects of different N types on electro-catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in experiment. Herein, the chaotic edge planes of the as-synthesized platelet carbon nanofibers (plCNFs) are tailored by acid etching of HF to obtain abundant exposed active edge sites while maintaining the interior graphene patterns intact. The N bonding configuration belonging to pyridinic type is nearly 100% and the concentration of the pyridinic-N in the tailored plCNFs reaches up to 12.61 at.%. Electrochemical tests show that N-plCNFs (HF) exhibits improved ORR activities compared with N-plCNFs and the carbon atoms adjacent to pyridinic-N could be the catalytic active sites for ORR. In addition, the generation mechanism of pyridinic-N in tailored plCNFs is briefly elaborated.Although Pt-based catalysts exhibit remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), researchers have tried their best to develop innovative catalysts to substitute Pt-based catalysts due to the prohibitive-cost, scarcity and limited durability Therefore, researchers attempt to synthesize single pure pyridinic-N doped CNMs Considering that platelet carbon-nanofibers (plCNFs) with large specific surface area possess good graphene patterns, which is similar to HOPG, and taking inspiration from that the edge-patterned surface in HOPG was produced by Ar The home-made carbon paper (CP) is used as the substrate to synthesize plCNFs by APCVD and the detailed synthesis procedure is as follows: Firstly, the home-made CP was impregnated in 0.5 M HNO The as-prepared plCNFs/CP was directly mounted in tube furnace, and the temperature was heated up to 700 The as-prepared plCNFs/CP was chemical etched by 20 M HF, (named as plCNFs/CP(HF)), to generate an ideal doping model without disordered loop structure, then the plCNFs/CP(HF) was washed with deionized water to neutral and dried in oven at 80 To describe the as-prepared samples clearly, we specially make a table of the abbreviations of the corresponding as-prepared samples, as shown in The morphologies and element analysis are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F) and Energy Disperse Spectroscopy (EDS). The microstructures are represented by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM and HRTEM, JEM-2100F). The surface element content and bonding configurations are characterized by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) apparatus (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source of 1486.6 eV. The bulk element distributions are characterized by TC-436 oxygen/nitrogen analyzer and the bulk concentration of nickel element of the as-prepared samples is tested by Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AA240FS + GTA120). The Raman spectroscopy was measured by Raman spectroscope (Horiba LabRAM ARAMIS) using an excitation wavelength of 532.08 nm. The electrochemical measurements were performed by an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660e, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co. Ltd., China) and the Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) (AFMSRCE). All electrochemical tests are carried out in 0.1 M O The glassy carbon electrode was carefully polished, then washed with double distilled water, followed once ethanol solution and dried in vacuum. The powders were scraped gently from the corresponding as-prepared pl-CNFs, N-plCNFs/CP, and N-plCNFs/CP (HF). Then 3.5 mg powdery sample was dissolved in the 1 ml solvent (V For comparison, 3.5 mg ml The morphology and microstructure of plCNFs are shown in To make certain nitrogen doping mechanism, we characterize the samples by HRTEM images and the corresponding schematic images ( It can be seen quite good graphene patterns in plCNFs and the boundary is close to a straight line (red dotted line in It is obviously observed the differences among the plCNFs, N-plCNFs and N-plCNFs (HF) respectively ( In addition, the result can also be laterally verified by the bulk and surface element concentration of samples ( The catalytic activity of the as-prepared samples for ORR is carried out via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M O In The Raman Spectroscopy is used to further investigate the structural characteristics of the as-prepared samples ( In addition, the specific area increases with HF etching (plCNFs: 52.62 m X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is mainly used to characterize the bonding configurations of the incorporated N atoms, as well as C and O atoms. Clearly, for the N-plCNFs and N-plCNFs (HF) before ORR, besides an intensive C1s peak, significant but much weaker signals for the N1s and O1s peaks, as well as extremely weak Ni2p peak are presented ( To further investigate what the component at 399.8 eV is, the C1s XPS spectra before and after ORR are also analyzed ( Based on this, it can be speculated that the carbon atoms adjacent to the pyridinic-N absorb and react with In addition, the C, N, O and extremely small amounts of Ni residuals SEM mapping images are exhibited in In conclusion, we developed a novel and facile method of tailoring plCNFs used as substrate of high-purity and high-concentration pyridinic-N doping. The chaotic edge planes of the plCNFs were tailored by HF etching to generate abundant exposed and patterned edge-sites, where the pyridinic-N atoms can be located preferentially. As a result, the plCNFs doped with pure pyridinic-N (12.61 at.%) were synthesized and the carbon atoms adjacent to pyridinic-N could be the catalytic active sites for ORR, which exhibits a nearly 4e The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
