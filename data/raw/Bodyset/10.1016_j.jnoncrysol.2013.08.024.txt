Variation in the microhardness behavior has been discussed based on a structure–property correlation.Storage is a crucial issue for bringing in hydrogen, a renewable, inexhaustive, clean and climate friendly fuel. The storage capacity of hydrogen in metals and alloys is determined by chemical interactions between the metal and hydrogen atoms, as well as by the type, number and size of the potential interstitials sites for hydrogen. The most common materials for hydrogen storage are metals and alloys that are based on transition metals. In most of these materials, hydrogen tends to occupy tetrahedral interstitials sites. Therefore, the combination of local tetrahedral order and favorable chemical composition makes Zr–Al–Cu–Ni quasicrystalline alloys, a promising material for the hydrogen storage applications Keeping the aforesaid considerations in view, the hydrogenation behavior of (Zr Alloy ingots of compositions (Zr The structural characterization was done by employing an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro PANalytical diffractometer) with CuK In order to understand the effect of hydrogenation on the microhardness behavior, indentation tests were conducted at room temperature using SHIMADZU HMV-2T microhardness tester under different loads. The standard diamond pyramid shape Vickers indenter with tip edge ~  The formation of quasicrystalline phase in these samples was further investigated by TEM. For the composition determination, a quantitative energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was performed. The hydrogen storage characteristics of (Zr The hydrogen desorption behavior of (Zr In order to investigate the structural changes with hydrogenation, the hydrogenated samples are characterized through XRD.

Further, the effect of hydrogenation on the microhardness behavior of these alloys has also been investigated.
