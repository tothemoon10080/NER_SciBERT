In this work, the change in microstructure, mechanical properties and wear rate of high leaded tin bronze alloy was studied after multidirectional forging (MDF) process. The total equivalent strain of 0.75 was applied. During MDF process improved ultimate tensile strength, hardness and wear rate along with maintained ductility was reported. The initial average grain size of 120nm was refined to the final average grain size of 37nm. The transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope and optical microscope was used for microstructure observation of the sample without MDF, MDF and wear worn surfaces.
