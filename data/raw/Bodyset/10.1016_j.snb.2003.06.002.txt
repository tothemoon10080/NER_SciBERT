The polypyrrole (Ppy) incorporated with DBSA and APS was synthesized by chemical polymerization at 0Â°C under atmospheric conditions. Ppy films were prepared by the dip coating method on the alumina substrate with interdigitated electrodes in order to employ the gas sensor. The electrical properties of the sensors, such as sensitivity, response and recovery time, reproducibility and long-term stability were investigated in the flow systems after various pretreatments. The electrical properties of the sensors depended on the pretreatment conditions. Soaking pretreatment resulted in a quick response and recovery time of the sensor and maintained electrical properties of the sensor for 3 months. Initial resistance of the sensor decreased with thermal treatment and this improved the stability of the sensor.Environmental pollutions have greatly increased during the last few decades. Especially, VOCs have been recognized as the main cause of sick house syndrome which is a product of poor indoor air quality. These can cause or aggravate certain conditions including allergies, asthma, cancer, and emphysema Ppy was synthesized by chemical polymerization at 0 The detecting materials having a liquid phase at atmospheric pressure were vaporized by using their vapor pressures and their concentrations were precisely controlled by the flow system having a mass flow controller (MFC), temperature controller and measuring chamber, as shown in Initial resistances of the sensors with/without soaking pretreatment using methanol solvent were investigated at room temperature in N   The reproducibility of the sensor after soaking and thermal pretreatment was investigated for 10 cyclic tests. The sensitivity of this sensor for other VOC gases was investigated and shown in The Ppy incorporated with DBSA and APS was synthesized by chemical polymerization at 0 We wish to appreciate the financial support of National Research Lab. from Ministry of Science and Technology.
