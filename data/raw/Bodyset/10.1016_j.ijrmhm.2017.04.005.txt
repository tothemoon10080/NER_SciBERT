In this paper, interfacial reaction between diamond grit and Sn-6Ti alloy was systematically studied at brazing temperatures from 600 to 1030°C. A thin and uniform layer of scallop-like nano-sized TiC grains was formed after brazing for 30min at 600°C, and interfacial TiC grains subsequently coarsened as brazing temperature increased to 740 and 880°C. Strip-like columnar TiC grains in a bilayer structure was further grown as brazing temperature increased to 930°C. After brazing at 1030°C, a dense layer of columnar TiC grains were formed. Based on the TEM micrographs of interfacial TiC, the formation and evolution of the growth morphologies of interfacial TiC was believed to be controlled by the diffusion of C flux from diamond grits, which is dependent on the brazing temperatures.Brazing is a promising method for the manufacturing of diamond abrasive tools Because established brazing approach involves the use of high brazing temperatures, the extensive formation of interfacial carbide inevitably results in undesirable thermal damage of brazed diamond grits This work thus aimed to understand the effect of brazing temperatures on the formation and growth behaviors of TiC formed during brazing of diamond grits at temperatures ranged from 600 to 1030 Sn-6Ti (in wt% unless mentioned elsewhere) ingots were prepared by melting commercial purity Sn and Sn-20Ti master alloy in a non-consumable arc furnace in high-purity Ar atmosphere. Chemical composition of the casted alloy was determined to be Sn-5.9Ti by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. The casted ingots were mechanically cut and rolled into foils of 3    Thermodynamically, the reaction, i.e. Ti The evolution of interfacial TiC morphologies can be correlated to the progress of interface reaction, and the evolution of TiC morphologies with the increased brazing temperature are thus schematically illustrated in  To create a reliable metallurgical bond with minimal thermal damage of diamond grits, it is desirable to ensure the formation of a continuous and uniform layer of TiC, but avoid the extensive formation of TiC. In order to further confirm the phase formation after brazing at variable temperatures, Raman spectrum measured on brazed diamond surface after removing Sn-Ti filler alloy was given in In this work, the growth morphologies of TiC formed during interface reaction between diamond grits and Sn-6Ti alloys were studied at variable brazing temperatures.
