With the advancement and applications of technologies in mineral processing industry, an automated mine optimization system is developed to include the following functions: mine production optimizer; various dynamic crusher controllers; and a set of soft sensors.
                  The system consists of a real-time engine to run optimizer, dynamic controllers and soft sensors. The real-time engine is integrated with process control systems at a mine, including mining dispatch system and geological data base through ODBC protocol, processing plant SCADA system and production reporting systems via OPC protocol. The system can potentially help increase production output up to 30% of a mine with mining and mineral processing operations, such as diamond mine, iron ore mine, chromite ore mine, manganese ore mine, coal mine, etc.
