We present a three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations (LES) study on the hydrodynamics of a circular cylinder close to a wall. Intermittent gaps between the cylinder and wall, forming spanning and non-spanning sections along the span are considered. This geometry setting represents an idealized model of pipelines laid on an uneven seabed. As compared to that of the corresponding spanwise-uniform cylinders, the drag coefficient on spanning sections is generally smaller, while the drag on non-spanning sections is slightly larger. Large amplitudes of the sectional forces are observed, partially due to the variations of the gap flow under the spanned sections. Flow deflection from the non-spanning section to the spanning section induces changes in local force and pressure distributions. Despite these changes, the mean force on the cylinder with intermittent contact as a whole is shown to be reasonably estimated by pro rata of forces from spanwise-uniform cylinders over the parameter space considered in this study.The research on hydrodynamics around a horizontal circular cylinder near a plane boundary has been largely driven by pipeline engineering in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been well documented in the monographs by In fact, many pipelines have to cross seafloor areas characterized by rocks, valleys and hills, in the presence of frequent severe storm events. This paper forms part of a wider research effort being undertaken by the University of Western Australia (UWA) using both physical and numerical testing of pipe behavior over artificially-created rocky seabed. The work includes lateral resistance of pipes on rocky seabed ( The hydrodynamic characteristics on a circular cylinder subjected to steady current includes the drag coefficient For a wall-free circular cylinder, the hydrodynamic forces and Strouhal number are mainly influenced by the Reynolds number ( But for avoidance of confusion in this paper, From the observations by For a circular cylinder above a plane wall, the general trend is that the mean drag coefficient For a partially buried cylinder, both hydrodynamic forces and the flow features have been reasonably researched (  Available research on hydrodynamics on a cylinder above an uneven wall is relatively rare. The unevenness of a seabed may lead to free spans of submarine pipelines, which are crucial for the structural behavior and safety (  This paper studies the hydrodynamic forces on a circular cylinder in steady flow seated on an uneven wall, which were mimicked by staggered gaps and wedge-shaped shoulders underneath the cylinder, as shown A Large Eddy Simulation model is employed in this study. The filtered incompressible Navier–Stokes (NS) equations together with the continuity equation read, A computational domain of rectangular prism is employed ( The size of the computational domain is determined based on experience from previous numerical studies on similar problems ( A case with Re = 2.5 × 10 As summarized in Unlike a conventional numerically modelled embedded cylinder, in this work a quarter of the cylinder surface was covered by the wedge-shoulder type of seabed in the present non-spanning scenarios, as illustrated in It should also be noted that the unaffected boundary layer thickness  For the fully non-spanning case as in the present setting, both The statistics on force coefficients of each section from the zebraic cases at three The The The sectional length has the most noticeable influence on oscillation amplitudes of forces (  For the lift coefficient on the spanning sections, On the other hand, the change of  From the above observations, the total hydrodynamic forces for a circular cylinder seated on an uneven seabed with zebraic contact can be approximately calculated by independently considering the spanning sections and the non-spanning sections. That is, the force coefficient can be calculated by a weighted average of the forces from the spanwise-uniform cylinder, according to, The direction of resolved hydrodynamic force is calculated based on the total The time histories of the sectional force coefficients are presented in The phase of the force coefficients over spanning and non-spanning sections keeps changing between in-phase and anti-phase, as illustrated with two boxes at Another reason for the large amplitude of oscillation in sectional forces is due to the gap flow. The fluid near the non-spanning sections is partially deflected to the spanning sections in order to pass the cylinder, and this is not expected to be a steady process. The variations in the time history of force coefficients in    The change in force coefficient along the span of the cylinder is shown A significant jump in We present a numerical study on the steady flow around wall-bounded cylinder by Large Eddy Simulation. The hydrodynamic forces have been investigated under the influences of small intermittent spanning and non-spanning sections across the spanwise direction of the cylinders. Three pipe elevation ratios between the cylinder and the far-field wall ( The spanwise difference brings distinct changes to the sectional forces. The drag coefficient on spanning sections is generally smaller than the corresponding spanwise-uniform cylinder (all spanning); and the drag coefficient on non-spanning sections is generally larger than that of the fully non-spanning cylinder. Large mean lift coefficient is observed at cases with small Despite the changes in the sectional forces induced by the geometry difference, the total mean force on the cylinder with intermittent contact can be estimated by a weighted average approach of forces from the spanwise-uniform cylinders. This linear approximation accurately predicts the drag and lift coefficients, within 20% of difference, and the method is only found to be less accurate when gap flow is encouraged at either large The sectional difference also leads to approximately four times larger amplitudes in sectional force oscillations as compared to that of spanwise-uniform cylinders, which is due to the variations in gap flow and the turbulence in the flow field. Interestingly, due to the phase difference in sectional forces, the total force on the whole cylinder has small oscillation amplitude. Deflected flow was observed from the non-spanning section to the spanning sections and this has given rise to changes in local force and pressure distributions, especially near the shoulders between spanning and non-spanning sections.
