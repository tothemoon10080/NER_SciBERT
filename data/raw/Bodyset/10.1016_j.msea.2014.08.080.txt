An addition of ≤0.5wt% lanthanum boride (LaB6) to powder metallurgy commercially pure Ti (CP-Ti), Ti–6Al–4V and Ti–10V–2Fe–3Al (all in wt%) resulted in improved sintered density, substantial microstructural refinement, and noticeably increased tensile elongation. The addition of LaB6 led to scavenging of both oxygen (O) and chlorine (Cl) from the titanium powder during sintering, evidenced by the formation of La2O3 and LaCl

                      and TiB inhibited prior-β grain growth and resulted in subsequent smaller α-laths. The formation of nearly equiaxed α-Ti phase is partially attributed to the nucleation effect of α-Ti on TiB. The improved sintered density was caused by B from LaB6 rather than La, while excessive formation of La2O3 and TiB with an addition of >0.5wt% LaB6 resulted in a noticeable decrease in sintered density. The improved tensile elongation with an addition of ≤0.5wt% LaB6 was mainly attributed to the scavenging of oxygen by LaB6, partially assisted by the improved sintered density. However, an addition of >0.5wt% LaB6 led to the formation of large La2O3 aggregates and more brittle TiB whiskers and therefore decreased tensile elongation. Balanced scavenging of O is thus important. The optimal addition of LaB6 was 0.5wt% but this may change depending on the powder size of the LaB6 to be used.The costly manufacturing process based on the ingot metallurgy approach hinders the wider application of titanium (Ti) alloys, despite their outstanding properties Rare earth (RE) elements have proved to be effective scavengers of O for both PM Ti alloys La is inexpensive. In fact, it is cheaper than the HDH Ti powder made from Ti sponge and also cheaper than Sn and much cheaper than Mo and V, which are common alloying elements for Ti. In addition, LaB enlightened by previous studies of yttrium B enhances the sintering and refines the microstructure of PM Ti materials and the resultant TiB is an effective reinforcement phase for Ti alloys It should be noted that LaB This paper presents a systematic study of the effect of LaB  The powder mixing, cold compaction and tensile sample preparation were similar to those described elsewhere Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Model Netzsch STA 409CD, Germany) was used to examine the stability of LaB Tensile specimens (3  Also shown in   Significant microstructural refinement was observed in each as-sintered material with an addition of 0.3% LaB Four microstructural features were quantified to characterise the microstructural refinement and modification versus the addition of LaB In order to determine the role of La, as-sintered microstructures with equivalent elemental B additions were similarly quantitatively analysed. The results are also included in   Representative fracture features of as-sintered CP-Ti, CP-Ti–0.3LaB An addition of ≤0.5% LaB Given the beneficial effect of B, the decrease in the sintered density with an addition of >0.5% LaB The formation of TiB in PM Ti alloys can effectively restrict the prior-β grain growth leading to substantial refinement However, as pointed out earlier, the formation of the near-equiaxed α-Ti in both Ti–6Al–4V–0.3LaB The tensile properties of CP-Ti and Ti alloys are sensitive to their O content in solid solution. The experimental results listed in The scavenging of O from the Ti matrix reduces the solid solution strengthening effect of O.
