In this paper, bulk flotation followed by separation was investigated to concentrate purified molybdenite product from Jinduicheng molybdenum ores (Shanxi province, China). The bench scale tests mainly focussed on separation of molybdenite from other sulfide minerals using the new type of depressants. The effect of each single depressant, including organic depressant-modified dextrin (MD), P-Nokes reagent (PN) and sodium trithiocarbonate (ST), and their mixtures on galena, chalcopyrite and other sulfide ores, was examined in turn by changing the concentrations used in cleaner flotation tests. Closed circuit experiments were carried out under the optimal condition and satisfying recovery and grade of molybdenite concentrate could be achieved (86.294% and 53.157%, respectively). A potential reagent regime was developed, with more environmental friendly and more economical advantages due to the introduction of modified dextrin.
