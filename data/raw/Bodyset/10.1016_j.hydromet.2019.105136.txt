Separation of adjacent rare-earth elements, such as Pr and Nd, is extremely difficult due to the similarity in their physicochemical properties. Enhanced separation of adjacent rare-earth elements based on the “push-pull effect” by addition of water-soluble complexing agents was an effective strategy in traditional organic-aqueous two-phase extraction. However, environmental pollution is serious due to the residual of complexing agent in the extraction raffinates. In present work, a novel “external push-pull” extraction system, composed of three coexisting liquid phases, P507 organic phase, ionic liquid (tributyl-methyl ammonium nitrate, N4441NO3)-rich phase and NaNO3 aqueous solutions, is suggested to improve the separation between Pr and Nd. It is revealed that Nd and Pr can be enriched respectively into the P507 organic top phase and N4441NO3-rich ionic liquid middle phase in the external push-pull extraction system, owing to a so-called “external push-pull effect” from a reversed extraction selectivity of P507 organic phase and N4441NO3 ionic liquid-rich phase towards Nd and Pr, respectively. Compared to traditional organic-water two-phase systems, the separation factor of Pr to Nd in the suggested external push-pull extraction system could increase obviously to 3.5 or even more. Various effects from the aqueous pH, NaNO3 concentration, the initial concentration ratios of Pr to Nd in feed aqueous solutions, and the addition amount of N4441NO3, the volume of P507 organic phase on the separation between Pr and Nd are discussed. In addition, reversal extraction of rare earth ions in the ionic liquid-rich phase is found to be closely related to the complexation behavior of rare earth ions with NO3

Based on this work, a possibility for extraction and separation of 14 rare-earth element ions from their coexisting aqueous solutions using the suggested external push-pull extraction system is also explored. The present work highlights a novel green strategy for improving the separation of adjacent rare-earth elements.The separation and recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) are of critical importance to the development of renewable energy applications, electric vehicles, and advanced electronic devices due to the irreplaceability of REEs in these applications ( Various strategies were used to enhance the separation of adjacent REEs using the solvent extraction. Generally, there were two kinds of strategies employed to improve the separation selectivity. The first strategy was the synthesis of various novel organic extractants with excellent selectivity towards different REEs ( Another effective strategy for improving the separation between adjacent REEs was the addition of a water-soluble complexing agent into the aqueous solution containing rare earths for selective complexation with different REEs ( In the present work, a novel “external push-pull” extraction system composed of three coexisting liquid phases, Tributyl-methyl ammonium chloride (N Tributyl-methyl ammonium nitrate was prepared by the ionic exchange process of tributyl-methyl ammonium chloride. The detailed procedures were given in the previous literature ( Experimental aqueous solutions containing Pr and Nd was prepared by diluting their corresponding stock solutions (concentration of metal ions in the stock solutions were 100 mmol/L) with deionized water. A certain amount of NaNO After phase separation, ionic liquid-rich middle phase and salt-rich bottom aqueous phase was diluted by deionized water and the concentrations of metal ions in different phases were then analyzed by an OPTIMA 7000 DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, PekinElmer, U.S). The concentration of metal ions in the P507-rich top organic phase could be calculated from the mass balance. The extraction experiments were performed three times to make sure that the experimental data were repeatable. The error bars were added in the follow experimental results. The mass fractions of metal ions in the salt-rich bottom phase, ionic liquid-rich phase and P507-organic phase were expressed as follows: The distribution coefficients (D) of metal ions in the P507-organic phase and ionic liquid-rich phase were expressed as follows: The separation factor of Nd/Pr in the P507-organic phase and separation factor of Pr/Nd in the ionic liquid-rich phase were expressed as follows: MD simulations were conducted by using the program NAMD, version 2.10 (  As can be seen that P507 preferred to extract Nd, and the separation factor of β As can be seen that two peaks were observed in the g(r), suggesting two coordination shells of O atoms of NO Inspired by the reversed extraction selectivity of Pr and Nd in the two kinds of extraction systems, an external push-pull extraction system was constructed by combining P507-extraction system and ionic liquid-aqueous two-phase system. The photograph of the extraction system is shown in As can be seen that a stable three-liquid-phase coexisting system could be formed. In this extraction system, the top P507 organic phase preferred to extract Nd, while the middle ionic liquid-rich phase preferred to extract Pr. The combination of reversed extraction selectivity in an extraction system might lead to an enhanced separation efficiency. This phenomenon was similar to the “push-pull effect” in the extraction-complexation systems ( In the conventional push-pull extraction systems, large amount of rare earth ions complexed with the complexing agents will be remained in the aqueous raffinate. To recycle these rare earth ions, decomposition of the complexes of rare earth by adding acid into the aqueous solutions is a common strategy. The introduction of acid into the system is not in favour of environmental protection, and also increases the cost of production. In addition, recycling of complexing agent is difficult. In the present system, not only the expensive complexing agent could be avoided, but also the preferentially enrichment of Pr and Nd respectively into the ionic liquid-rich phase and P507 organic phase in the three-liquid-phase system could be obtained simultaneously. Our works demonstrated that Pr (III) ions could be stripped efficiently when contacting the loaded ionic liquid-rich phase with a concentrated HNO         To verify the feasibility of our suggested three-liquid-phase system for the separation of other rare earths, the distribution behavior of a mixed rare earths, including La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er Tm, Yb and Lu, was investigated. The results are depicted in As can be seen that the extraction percentage of rare earth ions in the organic phase increased gradually with the increase of atomic number of rare earths. While the extraction percentage of rare earth ions in the ionic liquid-rich phase decreased gradually with the increase of atomic number of rare earths. The results indicated that heavy REEs preferred to be extracted into the organic phase. By contrast, light REEs preferred to be extracted into the ionic liquid-rich phase. Obviously, light REEs-rich component and heavy REEs-rich component could be obtained simultaneously in our suggested three-liquid-phase extraction system. In addition, the separation factor of Pr/Nd in the multi-rare earth elements coexisting solution also reached nearly 2.0. They are both higher than that in the two-liquid phase extraction systems. The separation factor of Pr/Nd could be further improved by optimizing the experimental parameters. The essence of “external push-pull effect” in the present system was combining the reversed extraction selectivity of target components in the different individual phases. The separation of Pr and Nd in the present work is just an example. This strategy could also be used to enhance the separation efficiency of other molecules or ions with extreme similar physical-chemical properties. In conclusion, a novel external push-pull extraction system composed of P507-organic phase, ionic liquid-rich phase and NaNO The present study suggests a novel efficient method to separate Pr from Nd based on the “external push-pull effect”. This strategy also exhibits unprecedented potential in the future's efficient separation of total REEs and other target components with similar properties.
