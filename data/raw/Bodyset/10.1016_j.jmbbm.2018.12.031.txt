Bone derives its mechanical strength from the complex arrangement of collagen fibrils (type-I primarily) reinforced with hydroxy-apatite (HAp) mineral crystals in extra- and intra-fibrillar compartments. This study demonstrates a novel approach to obtain organic matrix of bone through its demineralization as well as mechanically characterize it at small length scales using static and dynamic indentation techniques. Sample surface preparation protocol used in the present work maintained the surface integrity of demineralized bone samples which resulted sample surface of roughness (RMS) magnitude of approximately 14 nm (averaged over 1 × 1 μm2 ﻿area duly verified by atomic force microscope (AFM)). Elemental composition analysis via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (for probed depth upto 2 μm) confirmed the complete removal of HAp mineral from bone samples during their demineralization using EDTA leaving collagen molecule assemblies unaffected as represented by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging. The modulus magnitudes of organic matrix obtained using from quasistatic as well as dynamic indentations (at constant frequency of 30 Hz) as

                     500 nm value which probed from few collagen fibrils to next level of hierarchy i.e. collagen fibers. These findings are very useful to accurately determine the elastic and visco-elastic response of organic matrices of mineralized tissues for various applications including tissue engineering, bio-mimetics, etc.Mineralized tissues are composed of organic matrix of collagen protein which is reinforced by hydroxy-apatite (HAp) mineral. The organic matrix carries HAp mineral in two distinguished spaces: a) intra-fibrillar i.e. within the collagen fibrils, preferentially in the gap zone between collagen molecules and, b) extra-fibrillar i.e. on the surface of the collagen fibril ( For microscopic mechanical properties ( The mechanical behavior of bone tissue has also been reported to depend on the rate of its deformation ( Nowadays, nanoindentation technique is increasingly used to assess the mechanical properties of the hard and soft tissues at small length scales ( Demineralization (or decalcification) of hard tissues is done via dissolving the calcium present in the bone using strong acids, weak acids or chelating agents. Strong acids such as hydrochloric or nitric acid at concentrations up to 10 Hence, in order to understand physical behavior of complex material like bone which is primarily dictated by interaction of collagen protein with HAp crystals, it would be very useful to know the mechanical response organic matrix of bone which is obtained by gently dissolving its mineral content. As mentioned in previous para, organic matrix obtained through EDTA treatment of bone is expected to result its undamaged native structure, thus making it best candidate for studying organic content's contribution on mechanical behavior of bone. Limited by sample surface roughness, using ultra sharp-tip in indentation experiments with increasing indentation depths may facilitate probing across hierarchy levels which would start with very small probed volumes at low indentation depths while reaching comparatively larger volumes for deeper indentations. Thus, probing hierarchy materials at smaller indentation depths reflects mechanical properties of collagen fibrils (which has diameters upto 400 nm) whereas upto 2 μm deep indentations may elucidate their assembled form making collagen fibers (next hierarchy level of bone). With no such report in available literature on the physical behavior of organic matrix of demineralized bone, keeping in mind the importance of mechanical behavior of organic matrix of bone along with the contribution of surface roughness towards precise measurements particularly through instrumented nanoindentation, the following objectives have been fulfilled in our study To prepare the surface of demineralized samples with high finish, suitable for making shallow as well as deep indentations and quantify roughness To understand the influence of demineralization protocol on collagen assemblies and elastic behavior of organic matrix To estimate the static and time dependent properties mechanical properties of organic matrix of bone obtained via its demineralization We hypothesize that (a) the demineralization protocol dissolves HAp crystals in calcified tissues without significantly affecting the sub-micron structure of organic matrix (b) as the maximum indentation load magnitude increases in nanoindentation method, the values of obtained mechanical properties of organic matrix of bone would depend on indentation depth because of piercing across structural hierarchy levels and would finally converge to a single composite value because of decrease in the influence of surface roughness, and (c) as dynamic indentation involves higher loading rates as compared to quasistatic indentation method, the higher average modulus values of bone obtained from dynamic indentations is not solely result of HAP-collagen interactions but also contributed by strain rate dependent of mechanical properties of organic matrix of bone. For making a systematic study, we followed certain steps including sample preparation, composition measurement, quantifying effect of EDTA treatment on collagen packing and nanomechanical characterization which are discussed in the subsections below. Bovine bone samples obtained from the metacarpal of approximately nine years have been investigated in the present study. As shown in For composition analysis through scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6610LV), samples were coated with a few nm thick Pt for imaging samples surface in order to identify different locations for investigation. The working distance was kept as 20 mm, the sample plane was oriented perpendicular to electron beam incidence, and a 15 kV accelerating voltage was employed with a 64 μA operating current. Contrast and brightness levels were adjusted and held so that electron image would appear optimally for the sample using Backscattered Electron (BSE) detection. To determine that whether the mineral phase was removed during demineralization of bone samples or not, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to assess the presence of mineral elements (up to a few microns depth) on the undemineralized as well as demineralized bone sample surface ( Leica SP8 multi-photon microscope (upright) was used to see whether EDTA treatment has considerable influence on the assemblies of collagen molecules resulting higher order structures like collagen fibrils or collagen fibers. We employed non-invasive method of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging using multi-photon microscope which is highly sensitive to packing of collagen fibrils with larger diameter collagen fibrils scattering more forward (transmitted) signal whereas smaller diameter fibrils providing mostly backward (reflected) signal ( Instrumented Nanoindenter (Hysitron TI-950) system ( Two types of indentation experiments i.e. quasistatic and dynamic, have been performed in the present study which are discussed in the following subsections. In a quasistatic indentation test, the reduced modulus ( The contact hardness ( In the quasistatic indentation, multiple load as well as single load indentation experiments were performed on five demineralized bone samples. In each multiple load indentation experiment, a total of six tests was performed at different locations on the sample surface. Each of these indentation tests comprised of sequential load/unload cycles at increasing maximum loads, with a final maximum load of 1000 μN which was selected to keep indentation depth below 2 μm thus ensuring probing of completely demineralized material duly verified through EDX investigation. The variation of indentation load with time for each single test in a multiple load indentation experiment is shown in To compare the results obtained from multiple load indentation experiments, single load indentation experiments were also performed on each sample with constant maximum load of 1000 μN. Similar to the tests performed in each multiple load indentation experiment, single load indentation tests were executed at six different locations on the sample surface. The variation of indentation load magnitude with time in a single load indentation test is shown in Dynamic indentation involves ramp load profile which superimposes increasing amplitude of the oscillatory load of constant frequency on the linearly increasing static indentation load value. Thus, ramp load profile in dynamic indentation experiments allows the testing of samples at various indentation depths. Dynamic indentation experiments characterize the mechanical behavior of material in terms of its storage modulus ( The storage modulus ( Single frequency ramp load indentation tests known as “ramp load” indentation tests, were performed in the dynamic indentation experiment to investigate the influence of strain rate on the mechanical properties of bone sample. For a particular test in a dynamic indentation experiment, the variation of static indentation load magnitude with time is shown in The results obtained from experiments in the present study are classified into following subsections. The surface roughness (RMS) of magnitude In order to predict the response of EDTA treatment on the collagen molecular assemblies, SHG intensity measurements were made in the forward and backward directions in the present work. A comparison of total SHG intensity magnitude of fascicles at different time points during EDTA treatment, in the forward as well as backward directions is shown in the For nanomechanical characterization during EDTA treatment, single load indentation experiments were performed on five samples to determine their mechanical properties like elastic modulus and contact hardness. The effect of EDTA treatment for different durations on elastic modulus and contact hardness is shown in For maximum indentation load of magnitude 1000 μN in single load indentation experiments as well as multiple load indentation experiments, L-D curves for single test in a multiple load and single load indentation experiment on the demineralized bone sample are shown in The dynamic mechanical properties of demineralized bone samples were measured by using ramp load indentation experiments at 30 Hz frequency. For a particular ramp load indentation experiment consisting of five tests on each sample, the storage and loss modulus magnitudes as a function of indentation load magnitude are shown in As shown in the It has been observed that there is considerable influence of EDTA treatment exposure time on nanomechanical properties of bone samples (as shown in Taking into consideration in-homogeneities in the samples arising from ‘size dependent hierarchy’, we assumed much higher indentation depth to surface roughness ratios of On the basis of quasistatic indentation experiments conducted in the present work, it can be concluded that the average magnitude of reduced modulus for the multiple load indentation experiments is approximately 5 Similar to that of observed in quasistatic indentation experiments, in each dynamic indentation experiment beyond 250 μN of indentation load, storage and loss modulus magnitudes converge to a single value, as shown in The average storage and loss modulus magnitudes for demineralized bone samples (for whole range of indention loads) were used to estimate tan The protocol adopted for preparation of organic matrix samples via demineralization of bone produced very low surface roughness samples suitable for probing few collagen fibrils to larger assemblies of collagen fibrils forming collagen fibers. Demineralization of bone samples done via EDTA treatment for 60 min has been found to remove completely the mineral content present in bone sample surface to expose its organic matrix without affecting collagen assemblies forming the matrix at least up to 2 μm. Keeping in mind the influence of the surface roughness, reduced modulus and contact hardness of organic matrix were found to lie between 2.6 Authors are grateful to
