This paper explores the effects of cone tip roughness factor, soil in situ stress ratio and strength non-homogeneity on cone tip resistance in three-layer clay deposits, aiming at presenting a general CPT data interpretation framework to extract soil layered profiles and strengths. Large deformation finite element (LDFE) analysis has been carried out, simulating continuous penetration of the standard cone penetrometer from the seabed surface, with the consideration of cone tip roughness factor, in situ stress ratio and soil strength non-homogeneity within a practical range. In the LDFE analyses, a thin relatively stiff or soft clay layer was interbedded in a uniform or NC clay deposit, with various strength ratios between two successive layers and thickness ratios of the thin layer to the cone diameter explored.
                  The results have shown that the noted factors have significant influence on net cone penetration resistance in stratified deposits. These influences in the layered deposits were found to be similar in magnitude to those on the cone limiting resistance in a single clay layer, leading to the resultant influence on a thin layer correction factor for cone penetration resistance minimal. This was confirmed by the evidence of the evolving soil flow mechanisms around the cone tip. Therefore, the design charts and formulas developed for a smooth cone in uniform three-layer soils are applicable for delineating layer boundaries and interpreting the undrained shear strength of each identified layer for a partially rough cone in three-layer non-homogeneous clay deposits. However, the cone tip roughness factor was shown to have an influence in the layer boundary identification, especially for the cone penetration from a stiff layer to a soft layer.The relentless rise in world energy consumption has led to hydrocarbon exploration in coastal and offshore areas in unexplored and undeveloped regions. The structures required for the offshore exploration need strong foundations. Understanding the soil characteristics and their geological settings on the seabed is crucial to offshore foundation design. Cone penetration test (CPT) is a common site investigation tool to provide continuous soil strength profiles without soil sample coring and laboratory tests. Offshore soils are exhibiting complex soil conditions due to the geological history of the seabed. In emerging provinces and fields, highly layered deposits are prevalent, where accurate identification of layer boundaries and strength of each identified layer are critical for economic and safer designs of foundations and anchoring systems of offshore structures. For site investigations, the need to rely more on The standard field cone penetrometer is cylindrical in shape with a conical tip that has a base area of 10 where A large number of investigations have been carried out on cone penetration response in single layer clay with uniform undrained shear strength ( Note, The effect of natural soil layering on cone penetration response (and hence delineation of interfaces between soil layers and interpreting actual undrained shear strength) has attracted relatively less attention, and mostly limited to sediments with either surface or interbedded sand layer. Investigations through numerical modeling have been conducted by For stratified clay deposits, recently, Where a thin soil layer is interbedded in a soil deposit, the cone penetration depth may not be sufficient to mobilize its full resistance in that layer. Thus a correction factor is needed to interpret actual strength of the thin layer. Following  An extensive parametric study was also conducted later by By combining the results of the standard smooth cone penetration in soft-stiff-soft clays and stiff-soft-stiff clays ( Overall in all the previous studies for CPT in layered clay deposits, cone tip roughness factor This paper describes the results from LDFE analyses undertaken to provide insight into the effects of cone tip roughness factor A cylindrical cone penetrometer penetrating into both soft-stiff-soft and stiff-soft-stiff three-layer clay deposits were analyzed. The soil parameters were selected based on an extensive survey on existing offshore geotechnical characterization reports. The three-layer geometries considered here are commonly encountered in the Gulf of Thailand and Sunda Shelf, including Java Sea, as reported by Due to continuous deep penetration of the cone penetrometer, LDFE analyses were performed using the RITSS (Remeshing and Interpolation Technique with Small Strain; The soil domain is axisymmetric with 100 The soil is modelled as a linear elastic-perfectly plastic material obeying a Tresca yield criterion. Considering the relatively fast penetration of the field cone penetrometer (20 To examine the effect of cone tip roughness factor on the resulting penetration resistance in soft-stiff-soft clays, two groups (Groups AI and AII; In   In summary, the framework proposed by The analyses for  In summary, the updates proposed in the previous section for a partially rough cone ( In order to propose a general relationship between ∆ In addition, in the above sections, the thickness of the 2nd layer has been considered as > In terms of strength interpretation To explore the effect of the  To examine the effect of the Also, in general the soil flow mechanisms at corresponding depths relative to the thicknesses of the layers are very similar, comparing to those for  In summary, the effect of A similar investigation was also carried out for cone penetration in a layered soil with a soft layer interbedded in an NC clay. The  In summary, the effect of In previous studies, except for exploring the effect of ∆, the three-layer soil profiles consist of uniform clays all through the three layers. In the following sub-sections, the performance of the standard cone penetrometer in a thin layer (either strong or soft) sandwiched in a backbone NC clay deposit is investigated.   In summary, the formulas and equations established for uniform clays are applicable for interpreting cone penetrometer (with fully smooth tip) data in NC clay deposits with an interbedded uniform clay layer.
