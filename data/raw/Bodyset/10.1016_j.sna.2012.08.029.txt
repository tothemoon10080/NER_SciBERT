This paper presents a comprehensive study of the effect of polarization voltage on the measured mechanical Quality (Q) factor of a multiple-beam tuning-fork gyroscope. An experimental study is conducted to examine the effect of different variables in the experiment on the measured Q of the gyroscope. The experimental data show that the Q drops significantly with polarization voltage, while independent of ac drive voltage and feedback resistance. To identify the reason behind the Q drop with polarization voltage, the two loss mechanisms, thermoelastic damping and anchor loss, in the device are analyzed. Using a numerical model of thermoelastic damping capable of taking prestress into account, polarization voltage is found to have a negligible effect on the Q of the gyroscope. Due to the asymmetry of the fabricated devices resulting from fabrication variations, anchor loss is identified as the cause of the Q drop with polarization voltage. Based on the experimental data and related elastic wave theories, an analytical model of anchor loss is proposed to take polarization voltage into account.Owing to some inherent advantages, electrostatic tuning-fork gyroscopes in various derived forms have been developed for performance improvement in recent years The A thorough numerical and experimental study has previously been conducted on anchor loss and thermoelastic damping in a similar MB-TFG This paper is aimed to identify the cause of the  Under the assumption that the whole device is perfectly symmetric along the central line, the drive-mode of the MB-TFG can be modeled as two identical spring-damper-mass mechanical systems mechanically connected to the anchor, as illustrated in Due to the polarization voltage, each proof mass is subjected to a constant electrostatic force, Under this constant force, each proof mass experiences a static displacement: Consequently, the whole structure is in a prestressed condition.  In the experimental setup, there are three adjustable variables that might affect the measured With the other two variables ( To examine whether the ac drive voltage level affects the The motional resistance, According to the design parameters and measured Owing to fabrication variations, unpredictable asymmetry in the structure and the comb-drive electrodes is expected in a fabricated MB-TFG. In an attempt to quantify the asymmetry of a fabricated device, the frequency response of Devices #1 and #2 in As mentioned earlier, polarization voltage applied to the tuning-fork structure translates to a static force acting on each proof mass, putting the structure into a prestressed condition. According to the theory of thermoelasticity Since the comb fingers attached to each proof mass do not experience deformation but solely translation, they are included in the proof mass in the model to account for their mass. Corresponding to polarization voltage, the equivalent pressure acting on each proof mass is calculated as: The numerical model of thermoelastic damping in the tuning-fork structure is comprised of the following three sequential simulations and two postprocessing steps:       After thermoelastic damping is ruled out, anchor loss becomes the cause of the The asymmetry in the tuning-fork structure is expressed as a net stiffness difference, Δ It should be pointed out that as compared with the tuning-fork gyroscope in The asymmetry in the comb-drive electrodes is expressed as a net static force, Δ As compared to the static force from one comb-drive transducer with the same polarization voltage, Following the above two assumptions, the difference in vibration amplitude between the two proof masses is negligible. Then, the time-harmonic vibrations in each proof mass of the MB-TFG is assumed to be the same: Based on the last assumption, the stored maximum vibration energy in the whole device can be written as: The amplitude of the net time-harmonic reaction force at the anchor is: This net time-harmonic reaction force excites elastic wave propagation in the substrate and carries away part of the vibration energy in the device, thus giving rise to anchor loss. The vibration displacement amplitude, Then, according to the definition of mechanical quality factor, the Accordingly, the Now, we examine how polarization voltage possibly affects all the parameters in the expression for Since the effect of polarization voltage on the device parameters fails to account for the Therefore, the  In the analytical model of anchor loss, instead of a quantitative relation, a qualitative relation is established between the As proven in The asymmetry, Δ In summary, the analytical model of anchor loss includes the two unknown parameters: the asymmetry of the device, Δ The effect of polarization voltage on the measured The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support from
