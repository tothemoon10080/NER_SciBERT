The aim of this chapter is to discuss relationships between mineral characteristics and plot ability. Information about the influence of mineral characteristics on mineral processing is essential when conducting research on recoveries. This chapter determines the relationship between chalcopyrite liberation and the kinetics of chalopyrite flotation by analyzing suites of samples from laboratory tests and from copper cleaner circuits in a commercial concentrator. It determines the reasons for low pentlandite recovery from a serpentinized ultramafic nickel ore by studying the relationship between the flotation behaviors of pentlandite and the serpentine content in the ore. It uses a combination of mineralogical and mineral processing techniques to determine the behavior of pentlandite in the presence of serpentine. This chapter integrates the results, and establishes a sound base for selecting reagents that produced a major improvement in pentlandite recovery.
