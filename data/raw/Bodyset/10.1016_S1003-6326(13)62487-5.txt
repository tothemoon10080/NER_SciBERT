The method of Random Forest (RF) was used to classify whether rockburst will happen and the intensity of rockburst in the underground rock projects. Some main control factors of rockburst, such as the values of in-situ stresses, uniaxial compressive strength and tensile strength of rock, and the elastic energy index of rock, were selected in the analysis. The traditional indicators were summarized and divided into indexes I and II. Random Forest model and criterion were obtained through training 36 sets of rockburst samples which come from underground rock projects in domestic and abroad. Another 10 samples were tested and evaluated with the model. The evaluated results agree well with the practical records. Comparing the results of support vector machine (SVM) method, and artificial neural network (ANN) method with random forest method, the corresponding misjudgment ratios are 10%, 20%, and 0, respectively. The misjudgment ratio using index I is smaller than that using index II. It is suggested that using the index I and RF model can accurately classify rockburst grade.
