Reciprocating compression machinery is the primary source of compressed air in the industry. Undiagnosed faults in the machinery’s components produce a high rate of unplanned stoppage of production processes that can even result in catastrophic consequences. Fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors requires complex and time-consuming feature-extraction processes because typical fault diagnosers cannot deal directly with raw signals. In this paper, we streamline the deep learning and optimization algorithms for effective fault diagnosis on these machines. The proposed approach iteratively trains a group of long short-term memory (LSTM) models from a time-series representation of the vibration signals collected from a compressor. The hyperparameter search is guided by a Bayesian approach bounding the search space in each iteration. Our approach is applied to diagnose failures in intake/discharge valves on double-stage machinery. The fault-recognition accuracy of the best model reaches 93% after statistical selection between a group of candidate models. Additionally, a comparison with classical approaches, state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches, and the LSTM-based model shows a remarkable improvement in performance by using the proposed approach.Compressor is one of the most popular machines in the industry because of its cleanliness, availability, and ease of use To address the above issue, data-driven methods have been developed to detect and diagnose the condition of compressors and their valves. These methods use the traditional machine learning methodology consisting of (i) feature extraction; (ii) feature selection; and (iii) pattern classification. Addressing feature extraction from vibration signals, In recent years, the recurrent architecture of the LSTM model has been used as a natural structure for the automatic features extraction of time-series. For example in Due to the above, another significant and little-studied issue in Prognostics and Health Management tasks based on data-driven techniques is hyperparameter optimization In view of the three problems identified above, we combine different stages for the optimized building of an LSTM-based fault diagnosis model using vibration signals for a reciprocating compressor. Firstly, vibration signal-acquisition is performed. Preprocessing is then carried out by calculating well known condition indicators over a short window through the time domain, resulting in a time-series set representing the raw vibration signal with less resolution than initially. This approach differs from previous works, which usually lose the time-domain interpretation and use costly computational feature-extraction techniques. The resulting time-series are used to build a LSTM-based classifier, where the hyperparameter searching is accomplished by BO. Finally, the capabilities of the BO-based process and LSTM model are evaluated over test vibration signals with different fault modes passing through the preprocessing stage. The incidence of the preprocessing parameters is evaluated through a comparison of the best-built models being improved by a fine-tuning stage using BO. Our proposal improves on the reported LSTM-based works in three ways: i) the model complexity is reduced by including of a simple preprocessing stage without the loss of temporal dependency; ii) the use of a new BO approach to optimize the LSTM hyperparameters; and iii) the fault diagnosis of 17 fault conditions on a reciprocating compressor, by combining a single sensor, simple signal preprocessing, and a LSTM model with BO. The results show the LSTM model with improved hyperparameters is suitable for valve-fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors. Our approach also allows for a robust model-building process that is independent of the preprocessing parameter variations. Comparison with classical approaches based on random forest, classification tree, and K-nearest neighbors classifiers using the same condition indicators extracted from raw signals and state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches shows our method’s clear superiority. This paper is organized as follows. The recurrent neural network (RNN) The vector In the training stage of RNN, the sets of weights The LSTM neural network The vector The previous terms can be used to build a deep learning model, where a set of hidden layers BO methods Let Initialize the Obtain a new hyperparameter set to be explored by solving: Evaluate Add the result to the knowledge base: Estimate a new Repeat from 2 until reaching the maximum number of iterations. The function The negative expected improvement (NEI) is typically used for the function Given a Let Compute For Extract the selected piece of signal to be processed, For Assign the The next preprocessing task is the scaling to a normal standard distribution assumption of the data, of each low rate signal Compute the empirical mean Scale each dimension in the Finally, the training set size is known to have a vital role in building deep learning models, but this size is limited for the experimental burden in the acquisition stage. However, in our case study, the compression cycle time usually is much less than the signal length. Taking advantage of this fact, we propose the next procedure to increase the number of signals in each normalized dataset: Let For The subsignal set Store the subsignal set Each signal in the sets obtained by preprocessing pass through the LSTM model according to the architecture shown in Let Typically, the previous optimization problem has been solved by a manual trial/error procedure, but due to the high dependence on the prior knowledge of the designer its application cannot be generalized. Another approach is to avoid the optimization problem resolution using hyperparameter configurations that have worked well enough for other diagnostic tasks; however, it assumes the sharing of the modeled processes properties, and there are no guarantees about the validity of this assumption. A more systematic method is grid search or full factorial method, which solve the problem by the exhaustive evaluation of The function From The previously detailed fault diagnosis model building through the hyperparameter optimization process proceeds according to Extract the condition indicators through the time domain by the procedure detailed in Perform the hyperparameter optimization iteratively according to the process detailed in Evaluate the trained LSTM using the Repeat from step 2 for 20 iterations experimentally determined as enough for the convergence of the optimization process Choose the Finally, the performance of the resulting         The experiments were performed on the test bed shown in The reciprocating compressor had two compression stages shown in The measurements were taken under a constant motor rotation frequency of 57.7 Hz, resulting in a crankshaft rotation frequency of 12.8 Hz. Therefore, the total compression cycle consumes approximately 0.156  A total of 60 sets of experiments applying the proposed method were performed (6 In all the experiments, the Adam-based LSTM training stage for each configuration of preprocessing parameters was set at 200 iterations, and the model in the iteration with the minimum error in this interval was obtained. For further evaluation of our method, a comparison with classical approaches and deep learning approaches based on the next models was developed, with the detailed configuration and/or optimization:        The procedure to obtain the datasets for RF, CART, and KNN was as follows: Split the original dataset of 255 signals into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Training set size: 179 signals Testing set size: 76 signals For each signal in the above sets, compute the 11 condition indicators proposed in In the next, the experimental results are presented. Concretely, an evaluation of the incidence of the preprocessing parameters is introduced to choose the optimal values. A statistical evaluation of the difference between the models with the highest accuracy is also performed. Finally, the comparison results of our method and the other ones in The effects on the performance of To perform a more exhaustive model comparison, the five best hyperparameter sets, shown in A comparison between the fine-tuned models built from the hyperparameters in  Finally, the From the reciprocating compressor diagnosis shown in The last column of In this work, an approach for creating and optimizing a deep learning-based fault-diagnosis model for valves in reciprocating compressors is proposed. After data acquisition, a low-resolution representation of the vibration signal is proposed to reduce the computational load to maintain the temporal interpretation. In the next stage, the resulting time series are used to train an LSTM model, using a Bayesian optimization method for hyperparameter searching. This approach aims to optimally discover the best hyperparameter set based on accumulative evidence obtained from an iterative process. The experimental results and application of the proposed approach prompt the following observations: The use of the LSTM model together with a low-resolution representation of a vibration signal is suitable to capture the temporal patterns that allow a good performance in the diagnosis task. It can be seen in Some hyperparameter spaces have similar landscapes in their near-to-optimal zone, independent of the preprocessing parameters. This is shown in The rapid convergence of the LSTM model in a limited number of iterations in the BO stage is not evidence of the best model in the test set.
