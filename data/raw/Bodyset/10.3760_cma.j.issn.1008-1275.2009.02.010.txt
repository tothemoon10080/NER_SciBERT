To explore the treatment methods and outcome of posterior wall fractures of the acetabulum.
               
                  Methods
                  The data of 31 patients (25 males and 6 females, aged 19-59 years, mean: 40.5 years) with posterior wall fractures of the acetabulum hospitalized in our department from 2002 to 2006 were analyzed retrospectively in this study. The types of fractures, number of fragments, combined dislocations, and sciatic nerve function were documented before admission. All the fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Based on the fracture type and site, either screws alone or reconstructive plates were used. The patients were immobilized for an average of 12 weeks before partial weight bearing was permitted. After follow-up for 12-70 months (43.6 months on average), modified Merle d'Aubigne score was adopted to evaluate the outcomes of the operations.
               
                  Results
                  The percentages of the excellent, good, fair and poor results were 48.4%, 41.9%, 6.5%, and 3.3%, respectively, with a good to excellent rate of 90.2%. Idiopathic sciatic nerve injury occurred in only one case.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The sciatic nerve should be routinely exposed and protected during the surgery. The type of fixation should be based on the fracture type and site. Prolonged immobilization may be helpful in improving the final outcomes.
