Bulk-type (Ti0.65Fe0.35)100−xGax (x=0, 2, 4at.%) ultrafine composites with high strength and plasticity have been prepared. The composites have a hypereutectic microstructure with primary FeTi phase and (β-Ti+FeTi) eutectic matrix. The composites exhibit high fracture strength of 2290–2766MPa and large plasticity of 4.8–6.5% under compression. Refinement of eutectic structure and control of relative areal fraction of the constituent phases are the crucial factors in determining the mechanical properties.In recent time, nanocrystalline metals and alloys Master alloys with nominal composition of (Ti  The SEM images of overall microstructures obtained from the as-cast rods are illustrated in In order to reveal the mechanical behavior (strength/work hardening) of the alloys, compression test has been carried out. Fracture surface analysis indicated that mainly cleavage fracture occurred in the primary dendrites, while ductile fracture occurred in the ultrafine eutectic matrix. SEM images obtained from the fracture surface of the (Ti Thus, in the hypereutectic Ti–Fe–Ga ultrafine composites, the improved mechanical properties can be obtained by the composite structure, where the intermetallic FeTi phase is responsible for the high strength, while the β-Ti solid solution (or nano/ultrafine eutectic matrix) enables plastic deformation of the samples. One can notice ( Furthermore, as shown in In the present study, Ti–Fe–Ga ultrafine composites with high strength and large plasticity have been obtained by copper mold casting. The ultrafine composites exhibit an excellent combination of high strength of 2290–2766 This work was supported by DAPA and ADD, and also supported by the Global Research Laboratory program of Korea Ministry of Science and Technology.
