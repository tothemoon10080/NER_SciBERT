To in situ monitor a solid/liquid interface to control metal qualities, the paper analysis blind models of the ultrasonic propagation in the solidifying molten metal with a solid/liquid interface in the Bridgman type furnace, and a mathematical calculation model of blind zone with different source locations and surface concavities is built. The study points out that the blind zone I is caused by ray bending in the interface edge, and the blind zone II is caused by totally reflection which is related with initial ray angle, critical refraction angle of solid/liquid media. A serial of simulation experiments are operated on the base of the model, and numerical computation results coincide with model calculated results very well. Therefore, receiver should locate beyond these blind zones in the right boundary to obtain time of flight data which is used to reconstruct the solid/liquid interface.Metal properties are strongly dependent upon microstructures produced during the metal solidification, and the solidified metal must suffer heat treatment to alter structures when microstructures are not ideal, therefore, solidification is an important link to obtain wanted metal properties. It is commonly held that the interface between the solid and liquid phase during unidirectional solidification affects metal qualities Currently, two ultrasonic approaches are commonly applied to monitor a solid/liquid interface The other alternative approach is time-of-flight (TOF) method This paper is sought to model a blind zone of ultrasonic wave when it propagates through a solidifying molten metal, and find out relationships among blind zone, shape of the surface and location of ultrasonic source, then, minimize blind zone effect to realize real-time monitor solid/liquid interface to carry out closed loop feedback control of metal qualities. In the first part, the paper mainly discusses the mathematical model of blind zone with different surface shapes and source positions; the second part, the paper simulates all models above mentioned and compares results with mathematical models; the last part, the paper summaries results of mathematical model and simulation, and proposes better approaches to real-time monitor solid/liquid interface. Currently, Bridgman-type technology is the main method to research metal unidirectional solidification and blind zone appears only in the concave interface that molten liquid is above and solidified metal is blow according to Queheillalt and Wadley The ultrasonic source, which can be moved along the Previous research reported that the concave interface is a spherical cap and the center of the curvature on the Location of the ultrasonic source directly affects the velocity of initial ray and refraction at the interface, the blind zone would be different If the source point In the figure, ray path By geometrical relation, angle An arbitrary ray path When the largest angle In Define the slope of line So, line  To simple model, we assume source point emits a initial ray path The point on the interface is defined by the equation for a circle with a radius From Eqs. It is obvious that two solved points actually are point Solving point coordination, the blind zone II is determined, therefore, the receiver must locate beyond this zone to receive TOF signal.  Refraction ray path and intersection point Then the blind zone and the receiver location can be obtained by ray paths. If the prescribed source point locates in the solid, all ray paths intersecting with the interface can travel in the solid as refraction angle in the liquid smaller than initial angle in the solid, simultaneously, they are bent and convergent. As pictured in According to Eqs. Refraction ray angle at the point The equation for the line Blind zone II surrounded by the line In the left interface edge, ray path Blind zone I is surrounded by the line The simulation model is constructed based on According to Huygens’s law, each particle on the interface which is active by a wavefront can be thought to be a source of a secondary source and could emit rays in all directions, however, its strength is too small. So we ignore the effect of the secondary source and define that when the amplitude of the signal is smaller than 0.0055  When interface concavity Blind zone’s scale in the simulation and mathematical model are compared in Based on Snell’s law and difference of ultrasonic velocity in solid and liquid, a mathematical model about the blind zone when the wave propagates in the Bridgman type furnace is constructed to ensure that the receiver can receive wave signal to reconstruct the solid/liquid interface. In the model, the blind zone depends on the source location and interface concavity, and the excellent model is the model pictured in Financial supports by a
