Acidic proteins of similar character have been implicated in mineral deposition in vertebrate bones and teeth and invertebrate tissues such as shells, spicules and teeth. To explore the relationships between the vertebrate and invertebrate proteins, we have focused on the mineral-related proteins of the sea urchin teeth
