The co-precipitation of arsenate (As(V)) with Fe(III)-precipitates is of great importance in water treatment and critically affects the fate of As in environmental systems. We studied the effects of dissolved phosphate (P; 0-1 mM), silicate (Si; 0 or 0.5 mM) and Ca (0, 0.5 and 4 mM) on the sequestration of 7 μM As(V) by Fe(III)-precipitates formed by the oxidation of 0.5 mM Fe(II) in aerated bicarbonate-buffered solutions with an initial pH of 7.0 as well as the retention or release of As(V) after precipitate aging for 30 d at 40 °C. Dissolved As(V) concentrations in fresh precipitate suspensions greatly varied as a function of the initial dissolved P/Fe ratio ((P/Fe)init) and the concentrations of Ca and Si. Limited As(V) removal was observed at (P/Fe)init that exceeded the critical ratio (P/Fe)crit above which exclusively (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate forms. Effective As(V) removal was observed at (P/Fe)init < (P/Fe)crit, where initial formation of (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate is followed by the formation of Si-ferrihydrite in Si-containing electrolytes and of poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite and hydrous ferric oxide in the Si-free electrolytes. The retention of As(V) and P by fresh Fe(III)-precipitates was most effective in systems containing both Ca and Si. In the Si- and Ca-free electrolytes at (P/Fe)init of ∼0.2–0.6, the rapid onset of precipitate aging with conversion of Fe(III)-phosphate to ferrihydrite resulted in a substantial remobilization of As(V) (up to 55% of initially precipitated As(V)). Ca reduced As remobilization during aging by stabilizing Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate and promoting Ca-phosphate formation, and Si by stabilizing Si-ferrihydrite against transformation. Consequently, also after aging, the lowest dissolved As(V) and P fractions were observed in precipitate suspensions containing both Ca and Si.general precipitation of (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate structural effect of Ca sequential precipitate formation (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate until P depletion subsequently structural effect of Si Na 0.52 ± 0.01 Fe(III)-phosphate Fe(III)-phosphate ( P-rich ferrihydrite poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite Na + Si 0.53 ± 0.01 Fe(III)-phosphate Fe(III)-phosphate ( Si-rich ferrihydrite Ca 0.85 ± 0.03 Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate ( P-rich ferrihydrite poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite Ca + Si 0.87 ± 0.03 Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate ( Si-rich ferrihydrite general dissolved P and structural Ca inhibit transformation of (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate transformation of (Ca-)Fe(III)-phosphate Ca inhibits Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate transformation Si inhibits ferrihydrite transformation Na Fe(III)-phosphate Fe(III)-phosphate P-rich ferrihydrite poorly-crystalline lepidocrocite Na + Si Fe(III)-phosphate Fe(III)-phosphate Si- and P-containing ferrihydrite Ca Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate (  poorly crystalline lepidocrocite Ca + Si Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate Ca-Fe(III)-phosphate ( Si- and P-containing ferrihydrite Arsenic (As) occurs ubiquitously in soils, sediments and natural water. Owing to the high chronic toxicity of As, elevated As concentrations of geogenic or anthropogenic origin pose a serious threat to human health, especially via the consumption of As-containing drinking water and food. More than 100 million people worldwide rely on groundwater with toxic levels of geogenic As as drinking water resource ( The environmental fate and impact of As is tightly coupled to the cycling of Fe. Under anoxic conditions in soils and aquifers, the reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides with adsorbed As and phosphate (P) and the reduction of strongly sorbing arsenate (As(V)) to less strongly sorbing arsenite (As(III)) result in elevated concentrations of dissolved As(III) and Fe(II) in soil porewater or groundwater ( The uptake of As by freshly formed Fe(III)-precipitates depends on the presence or absence of the co-precipitating solutes P and Si and of the major cation Ca ( The aging of fresh Fe(III)-precipitates may result in structural transformations such as increasing polymerization and crystallization that can be associated with a loss of sorption capacity and consequently oxyanion release ( In an extensive experiment on the formation of Fe(III)-precipitates via Fe(II) oxidation at near-neutral pH and the transformation of the fresh precipitates during aging, we characterized fresh and aged Fe(III)-precipitates and identified the effects of P, Si and Ca on precipitate structure, composition and aging ( The present study is based on our previous work on the effects of P, Si and Ca on the structure of fresh Fe(III)-precipitates, their transformation after 30 days of aging, and consequences for P retention ( Fresh and aged Fe(III)-precipitate suspensions were prepared from six background electrolytes (Na, Ca, low Ca, Mg, Na + Si and Ca + Si) at twelve P concentrations as described previously ( The background electrolytes were prepared by dissolving 8 mM NaHCO At (P/Fe) For the determination of the concentrations of Fe, P, As, Si, Na, Ca and Mg in the unfiltered and filtered fresh and aged suspensions, the samples were acidified (HNO The amounts of As, P and Fe in the precipitates (As A kinetic adsorption/co-precipitation model has been formulated by (  This model was used to describe residual dissolved As(V) and P in the fresh precipitate suspensions based on total initial concentrations of Fe, As(V), P and Si. For this purpose, the model was set up in PhreeqC ( The dissolved fractions of As in the fresh suspensions as a function of (P/Fe) At (P/Fe) At intermediate (P/Fe) In general, residual dissolved As(V) and P fractions in fresh suspensions exhibited similar trends ( In At high (P/Fe) At intermediate (P/Fe) At low (P/Fe) During aging, the pH of the suspensions increased from pH 7.0 to pH 7.9 ± 0.3, due to CO To monitor the time-dependence of As(V) and P remobilization during aging, time resolved experiments were conducted at (P/Fe) Interestingly, the dissolved fractions of As(V) and P in the Ca electrolyte initially increased due to remobilization, but started to decrease again after ∼21 and ∼10 days, respectively. We attribute these trends to the precipitation of Ca-phosphate and Ca-carbonate (as indicated by trends in dissolved Ca) and co-precipitation of As(V) and P. In the Ca + Si electrolyte, the slow increase in dissolved As(V) and P may be due to concomitant oxyanion release from slowly transforming Fe(III)-precipitates and co-precipitation with Ca. The interplay between the aging of the Fe(III)-precipitates and related remobilization of As(V) and P and the concomitant formation of Ca-phases that may re-sequester released As(V) and P may have important environmental implications and warrants further study. In a study on the removal of As(III) and As(V) by co-oxidation and co-precipitation with Fe(II) in synthetic Bangladesh groundwater (SBGW), Model parameters from a first fit with a single site capacity and a single set of sorption coefficients for all treatments were comparable to parameters reported by Because the model parameters were refined based on residual dissolved concentrations on a linear scale, the fits were mainly sensitive to treatments with high residual dissolved P and As(V) fractions, i.e., treatments at high (P/Fe) At (P/Fe) To obtain an adequate description of dissolved As(V) and P concentrations over wide ranges in solution concentrations on a logarithmic scale, a multi-component model accounting for the formation of different phases with different sorption site concentration and sorption affinities would be required. In addition to oxyanion uptake by different Fe(III)-precipitate types and the influence of cations, such a kinetic model would also have to account for Fe(III)-precipitate transformation processes and concomitant oxyanion release, Ca-phosphate and Ca-carbonate precipitation, and related As(V) and P re-precipitation. In Although the synthetic groundwater used by The comparison of the residual dissolved As in experiments with As(III) and As(V) from This study showed how variations in solution chemistry affect As(V) sequestration by fresh Fe(III)-precipitates and how precipitate transformation during aging promotes As(V) re-solubilization. In Compared to average and median concentrations of Fe (3.4 and 1.1 mg/L; n ∼3500) and P (0.7 and 0.3 mg/L) in groundwaters from Bangladesh, the Fe (28 mg/L) and P (0.7–31 mg/L) concentrations in our experiments were rather high. The median and 5–95 percentile range of the P/Fe ratio (0.25 and 0.02–5) of these groundwaters, on the other hand, which is of critical importance in As removal ( High P/Fe ratios that are frequently found in Bengali groundwaters pose special difficulties for As removal ( During the aging of the precipitate suspensions for 30 days at 40 °C, dissolved As(V) concentrations in (nearly) all treatments remained stable or increased to levels above the WHO guideline value ( The results from this study are not only of importance with respect to Fe-based As(V) removal from drinking water, but also contribute to a better understanding of As dynamics in agricultural fields and especially rice paddies irrigated with As-rich groundwater. In these systems, Fe(III)-precipitate formation and transformation not only impact the introduction of As into the soils ( This study reveals how Si, P and Ca, via their effects on Fe(III)-precipitate structure and ion co-sorption, critically influence the uptake of As(V) by fresh and aged Fe(III)-precipitates. Variations in the extent of As(V) sequestration can be rationalized in terms of competitive oxyanion uptake and the structural diversity of the precipitating Fe(III)-solids. The results highlight the important roles of Ca and Si in promoting As(V) removal by fresh precipitates and As(V) retention during precipitate aging and indicate that results from studies in simplified Na-electrolytes must be considered with care with respect to their transferability to natural waters containing Ca and Si. A simple single-phase sorption model is adequate to describe residual dissolved As(V) in fresh suspensions under conditions where saturation of the oxyanion uptake capacity limits removal. To describe the solubility of As(V) and other oxyanions under conditions where the sorption capacity of the Fe(III)-precipitates is not reached, a more complex kinetic modeling approach would be required that accounts for the structural diversity of fresh precipitates, their transformation over time, and the concomitant formation of Ca-phases.
