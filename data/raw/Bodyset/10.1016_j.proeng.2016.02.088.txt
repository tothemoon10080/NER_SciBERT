In addition to the macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphate and potassium), micronutrients such as zinc, copper, cobalt and secondary elements for instance magnesium represent a major factors of crop growth and development. Beet, lettuce, onion, spinach, sunflower and tomato have relatively high copper requirements.
                  Zinc plays a significant role in the auxins metabolism witch is well known as plant growth substances. Copper is necessary for photosynthesis process, as demonstrated by several authors. Concerning cobalt, this element has positive effect on the production of secondary metabolites. Managem group (Morocco) provides compounds containing divalent ions (Zn2+; Cu2+; Co2+; Mg2+) for the fertilizer industry.
                  The Nano sized zinc oxide (50-200nm; ZnO (%) â‰¥ 95%) with higher specific surface area. Its reactivity affect considerably zinc solubility, diffusion in soil and hence Zn availability to plants.
                  Magnesium, Copper and Cobalt in form of sulfates could be synthesized with high purity at the solid and liquid forms. The chemical and physical characteristics of Managem products give them a good competitiveness in the fertilizer market.
