Six SnO2–TiO2 tandem semiconductor samples were prepared by spray pyrolysis deposition using different precursor compositions and deposition temperatures. By tailoring the indium doped tin oxide layer (morphology, crystallinity) the tandem properties can be modified according to the targeted application, insuring enhanced charge separation, higher photosensitivity and reduced recombination. On the SnO2 layer, the TiO2 growth was proved to be almost twice faster when starting from halide precursor, compared to organo-metallic ones, at a fixed deposition temperature (400°C). The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle, reflectance, current density–voltage (J–V) and photocurrent measurements. The photocatalytic efficiency of the tandem systems was tested on methylene blue reference solutions and was evaluated based on the variations in the organic carbon and total nitrogen content. The result were compared with bleaching measurements, showing that mineralization could be reached up to 90% and carbon removal is more efficient compared with nitrogen compounds.Research and use of photosensitive materials have considerably increased in recent years and replacing mono-component structures It was previously shown that obtaining bi- A problem related with the optoelectronic applications is that many wide band gap semiconductor oxides are reported to be deposited on commercial conductive glass substrates which limit the flexibility in choosing the morphology because the properties of the further deposited oxides strongly depend on the bottom layer. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to presents an alternative, by developing conductive tin oxide-based substrates with controlled properties that can be tuned according to the prerequisites for the next deposited layer. The paper presents kinetics studies related to the nucleation and growth processes in relation with the precursor composition and the number of deposition sequences. The interface control in the tandem systems allows adding new functionalities to the existing semiconductors by altering the structure, composition, and particle/grain size with direct consequences on the investigated application as photosensitive semiconductor materials. Further on, the aim is to demonstrate the photocatalytic properties of the tandem systems, and outlines the influence of the crystalline structure, morphology and surface energy on the energy levels, electrical- and photo-conductivity.
