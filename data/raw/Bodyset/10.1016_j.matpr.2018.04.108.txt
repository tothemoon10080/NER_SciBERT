Silicate minerals are the most common rock-formingminerals andmakeupto approximately 90 percent of theEarth’s crust. Silica tetrahedra made up of silicon and oxygen form chains, sheets, and frameworks, and bond with other cations to form silicate minerals. India does not have soluble deposits of potassium-bearing ore and therefore country depends heavily on imports.However, India possesses vast resources of silicate minerals in the form of Mica, Feldspar, and Glauconite. These minerals are mainly found in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand. These rocks are basically a group of aluminosilicate of potassium, sodium, and calcium (SiO2%: 52-60, Al2O3%: 15-20, K2O%: 5-12, Fe2O3%: 5-9, MgO%: 1-2, Na2O%: ∼1). In this work, an attempt has been made to extract potassium in the form of soluble salts using different routes such as acid leaching, thermal treatment followed by leaching, and mechanical activation. These different treatments are performed to increase potassium availability/solubility attributed to the modifications in mineral structure and exchange reactions of the suitable ions in the system. Using different treatments it is possible to recover up to 85% K values from mica sample.
