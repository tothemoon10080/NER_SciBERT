The measurement of the moisture content of materials is a key control parameter in a very wide range of industrial processes. A low frequency (1 GHz) microwave transmission technique has been developed for the on-line analysis of moisture in thick beds of high moisture materials. The technique has been successfully applied to the analysis of black coal, brown coal and iron ore in the laboratory. An industry prototype low frequency moisture analyser has been developed and trialed at an Australian coal export facility.
