The comprehensive utilization of oil shale is a new promising technology achieving high utilization-factors for both oil shale’s chemical and energy potentials, and avoiding serious environmental impacts. For this technology, it is an urgent issue how to obtain shale oil with a high yield and as well as treat shale char efficiently and economically. In this present work, retorting experiments of three type I oil shales were performed using an aluminum retort, and the effect of retorting temperature, residence time, particle size and heating rate on the yield of shale oil was studied at low retorting temperatures ranging from 400°C to 520°C, respectively, at which shale char obtained has good combustion properties. The experimental data show that an increase in the retorting temperature, the residence time and the heating time has positive significant effect on improving the yield of shale oil, and a middle particle size is helpful for increasing the oil yield as well. The grey system method was applied to evaluate the effect of retorting factors on the yield of shale oil, showing that the retorting temperature is the most marked factor influencing the yield of shale oil.The fossil fuels—coal, petroleum and natural gas—have been the primary suppliers of reliable, low-cost energy in China for many years. The current decreasing availability of these conventional energy sources, combined with the corresponding growth in their price, have placed great pressure on China’s energy supplies; in response, facilities for the technical development of diverse, clean energy generation have become available. Oil shale, a fine-grained sedimentary rock with organic matter called kerogen, is rich and widespread in the world USA, Russia, Estonia, Brazil, and China have developed several oil shale retorting technologies, such as Kiviter retort of Estonia, Petrosix retort of Brazil, Fushun-type retort of China, available for retorting oil shale to produce shale oil. However, shale char, formed in these retorting processes, is a harmful waste containing several toxic compounds, such as water-soluble phenols, sulphide sulphur, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon For the oil shale comprehensive utilization technology, it is an urgent issue how to obtain shale oil with a high yield and as well as treat shale char efficiently and economically using the CFB furnace. On the basis of the conventional retorting technology of oil shale, most previous work Three representative type I oil shale samples used in this work were obtained from Dachengzi mine, Gonglangtou mine and Gonghe mine located in Huadian city, China. Their analyzes are given in An experimental retorting system of oil shale is presented in In the present study, the studied retorting factors involved in retorting temperature, residence time, heating rate and particle size, and the effect of each retorting factor on the yield of shale oil was explored keeping the others constant. The experimental retorting conditions were given in Different from the standardized Fischer assay method of oil shale in the retorting temperature and heating process, the National Standards of China (SH/T 0508-92) recommends the following condition for determining the grade of an oil shale in the shale oil content: retorting temperature of 520 Through many observations, for Dachengzi oil shale, it was not until ∼415   From this work, the retorting process of oil shale may be described by and large: (1) room temperature Grey system theory provides a useful approach to deal with the problems of limited and superficial ruleless data processing, so as to search for primary relationships among the factors and determine important factors that significantly influence some defined objectives According to the grey system method The reference sequence is: And then, a grey relational coefficient matrix [ The comprehensive utilization of oil shale is a promising technology achieving high utilization-factors for both oil shale’s chemical and energy potentials, and avoiding serious environmental impacts. For the utilization technology of oil shale, it is an important problem how to obtain shale oil with a high yield and as well as treat shale char efficiently and economically. Thus, the yield of shale oil of three oil shales obtained from Huadian city was measured using an aluminum retort, and the effects of retorting temperature, residence time, particle size and heating rate on the oil yield of the oil shale with the highest oil yield were studied at retorting temperatures from 400 The yield of shale oil obviously increases with increasing the retorting temperature and was formed mainly at temperatures ranging from 415 The yield of shale oil can increase to above 80% by prolonging the residence time to 60 Either increase or decrease of particle size will easily result in secondary decomposition of shale oil and then decrease the yield of shale oil. So, a middle particle size is helpful for increasing the yield of shale oil. The experimental result of increasing yield of shale oil with increasing average heating rate to 10 The grey system method was applied to evaluate the effect of retorting factors on the yield of shale oil, showing that the retorting temperature is the most marked factor influencing the yield of shale oil.
