The effects of H3PO4 on the compressive strength of block CaO, phase composition and morphology of calcined carbide slag were investigated. The results indicated that block CaO could be prepared from carbide slag through molding and calcination. H3PO4 had a promotive effect on the compressive strength of block CaO, which reached the maximum value at 3.2MPa with a H3PO4 content of 4%. Meanwhile, the compressive strength of block CaO increased with an increase of molding pressure. Moreover, the P-containing phase in carbide slag shifted from hydro-phosphate to phosphate after calcination. The close connection on the surface of particles was enhanced by the formation of phosphate.During the production of acetylene gas, carbide slag is generated from the process of calcium carbide (CaC At present, carbide slag has been utilized in many fields, such as inorganic material preparation ( As mentioned above, the preparation of block CaO with high strength was a key problem for generating CaC H In this work, block CaO was successfully prepared from carbide slag to manufacture CaC H The carbide slag powders were homogenously mixed with mixtures of H Mechanical strength of the calcined carbide slag was evaluated in compressive strength. The specimens were crushed using a compression testing machine (FR, Farui Company, Shanghai) at a 30 The phase composition of the products was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using D/MPax-2400 Multicrystal Diffractometer (X'Pert PRO MPD, Holland) with a Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10° to 90°. To determine the formation temperature of CaO, weight loss of the carbide slag was evaluated using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) (ZPR-2Y, China) from room temperature to 1000 The decomposition property of the carbide slag with H According to the TG curves, the three stages of weight losses are obviously observed in the decomposition process. Stage 1 is from 100 The results from the weight loss curves show that the decomposition trends of carbide slag with different H As shown in   In order to study the state of P in carbide slag before and after calcination, 30% H Compared with the XRD pattern of Ca(OH) The morphologies of carbide slag before and after calcination are shown in  Results showed that the compressive strength of block CaO increased with the increase in H The authors are grateful to appreciate the financial support by the
