The phase transitions of the main substances in Bayer red mud in high caustic sodium aluminate solutions were studied. Without addition of lime, cancrinite was not found to transform to CaNaHSiO4 even with 16wt.% CaO present in the original residue up to 270°C. However, this transition was verified to be a fast reaction which was completed in just 10min with the temperature higher than 240°C after adding lime, thus enabling the extraction of Al2O3 from the red mud. Whether additional CaO was supplemented or not, the isomorphous substitution of Fe to Al atoms occurred in hydrated andradite as long as the temperature was more than 240°C, providing another way to extract Al2O3 from Bayer red mud. Accordingly the A/S (weight ratio of solid Al2O3 to SiO2) of red mud would reduce to 0.134 after the complete transition from Ca2.93Al1.97Si0.64O2.56(OH)9.44 to Ca3(Fe0.87Al0.13)2(SiO4)1.65(OH)5.4 in our study, assuming no other Al or Si containing phases. Furthermore, the addition of CaNaHSiO4 seed was confirmed to accelerate both the transition of cancrinite to CaNaHSiO4 and the reaction of isomorphous substitution in the andradite.Alumina is an important basic raw material for national economic development, and the alumina industry in China has developed rapidly in the last ten years ( The treatment and utilization of huge red mud wastes have been a major challenge for the alumina industry throughout the world ( Several processes have been developed in order to reduce the loss of Al The phase transition behaviors of the Na In this paper, the phase transition processes have been investigated for Chinese Bayer red mud reacted in high caustic and high The reaction of red mud in high caustic and high The 150 The Bayer red mud, whose composition is listed in The Coalmine Alumina Co. digests the local diasporic bauxite at 265 The concentrations of Al The Al The Na The absolute amount of the water introduced with the red mud was increasing and thus the Na According to the phase analysis in However, the phase transitions were significant when the reaction temperature was increased to 240 It is reported that in typical spent Bayer liquors, the equilibrium solubilities of the three sodium aluminosilicates decrease in the sequence of zeolite, sodalite and cancrinite, and inversely the thermodynamic stability increases in the same sequence ( The reaction kinetics of Al The results of Al The XRD analysis shown in At 240 The transformation from cancrinite to NaCaHSiO It was found that there was scaling on the heating pipes of the slurry in the former pilot experiments for extracting Al As shown in The characteristic peak of katoite at 2θ of 39.9° became very weak after reacting for 20 The particles of the unreacted Bayer red mud irregularly agglomerate with each other, as seen in The analysis of the morphology and the surface composition of the milled scales are shown in In The phase transition behaviors of Bayer red mud in high caustic and high Crystals of CaNaHSiO We acknowledge the financial support from the
