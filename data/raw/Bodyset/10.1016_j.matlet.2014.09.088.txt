An effective biomimetic method for preparation of hydroxyapatite/graphene oxide (HA/GO) hybrid coating on AZ91 magnesium alloy was firstly proposed. AZ91 Mg alloy was first dip coated by GO, which was further used as matrix substrate for biomimetic mineralization of hydroxyapatite (HA) in modified simulated body fluid (m-SBF). It has been found that GO greatly promotes nucleation and crystallization for rapid HA growth, forming uniform and dense HA/GO hybrid coating comprised by flake-like HA crystals with high Ca/P ratio (1.65). Meanwhile, the as-formed HA/GO bio-coating could dramatically improve the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys. The corrosion current density of treated Mg alloys was decreased by one order of magnitude as compared to untreated one. Furthermore the effects of various experimental parameters toward the growth of the HA/GO coating on Mg alloys were also investigated.Recently magnesium alloys as implant scaffold and tissue biomaterials for potential bone replacement and regeneration have received increasing attentions In this letter a biomimetic method involved of GO to prepare uniform and bioactive HA/GO hybrid crystal coating on Mg alloys was first present. Experimental parameter effects (e.g. growth time, pH and Ca The AZ91 alloy (Mg–9Al–0.7Zn, wt.%) specimens were cut into 15  The FTIR spectrum of GO, various HA and GO/HA coating is displayed in   An effective biomimetic method involved of GO as nucleation centre to prepare homogeneous biocompatible coating on AZ91 has been proposed. GO greatly promotes the nucleation and biomineralization for HA and even at very short time (6 The research was financially supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
