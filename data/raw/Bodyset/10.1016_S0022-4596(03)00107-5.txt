The characterization and luminescence properties of nanostructured Gd2O3:Eu3+ phosphors synthesized by a sol-lyophilization process are presented. After preparation of gadolinium-based sols from gadolinium nitrate and ammonium hydroxide, the so-prepared sols were freeze dried at −10°C and calcinated at different temperatures. For temperatures lower than 1300K, highly crystalline samples with the cubic structure can be obtained without concomitant grain growth of the particles (<50nm). The luminescence spectra contain all possible transitions of Eu3+ with C
