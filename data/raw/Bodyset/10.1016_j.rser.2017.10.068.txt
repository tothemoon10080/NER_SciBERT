Since appliances consume a large fraction of the residential final energy consumption, analysing the impact and trends in penetration and ownership of appliances are targets of interest to researchers, companies and policy makers. However, there is a lack of published data based on the study of appliance penetration or ownership comparing different countries trends and assessing different appliances families. The data is usually found in percentages related to energy use or other factors, or in national directive documents written in local languages. The main aim of this paper is to analyse the trends in appliances penetration and/or ownership in the residential buildings sector providing access to the data of ten countries representing different world areas, and 20 appliances which fell into three distinct appliance categories (white goods, brown goods and small appliances), in a comparable framework. Penetration data is given for Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Spain, UK, and USA; and ownership data for Australia, China, Hungary, Japan and USA.In the next decades, the energy consumption of residential sector will rise due to the proliferation of equipment types used and their increased ownership and use. The 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) In 2010 buildings accounted for 32% of total global final energy consumption (24% for residential and 8% for commercial) Understanding of how and why appliances have increased its penetration in residential buildings sector is substantially important to evaluate the changes in social customs, human habits and generational changes over time. This paper is focused to analyse the appliances penetration and ownership in residential sector for developed countries, part of the organisation for economic co-operation and development, in the period from 1970 to 2010. The structure of the paper is as follows; The authors have assessed a brief state of the art basing the search for papers on ownership and penetration of household appliances all over the world. The 21 papers found in the literature review are shown in From the literature review the authors concluded that it is difficult to find data on appliance penetration or ownership for different countries and large amount of appliance from different categories. Furthermore, data found is usually related to studies that present values in percentages of the energy use or of other factors. In these studies, data normally shows ownership of appliances collected via questionnaire in a statistically representative sample in a given city or part of the country (like south-east). Such as in Lyons et al. Overall, the main outcomes found in the literature review are listed below: United Kingdom and United States are the countries that have more studies on the penetration, ownership, and consumption of household appliances. There is a lack of studies assessing the penetration or ownership of household appliances in a large sample of countries and appliances categories. Most of the studies published are focused in the latest 90 The most studied appliances are: refrigerators, television, freezers, washing machine, clothes dryer, dishwasher, and microwave. The less studied appliances and not included in the studies are: lighting, air conditioner, small appliances such as hair dryer, shaver or fan, and new appliances such as tablet, smart phone, laptop, and music player. Most of the studies relate the appliances penetration to other parameters such as energy consumption, type of household, water usage, CO Most of the studies shows ownership and not penetration and interestingly do not distinguish between both data. This paper is intended to complement the data presented in the literature review and to provide more information that might be helpful to politicians and researchers on the topic. The aim of this paper is to report and show the trends in appliance penetration and/or ownership in residential buildings for different countries of the world, representing different world regions. More specifically, the objectives are: To search in data bases sort by country, appliances type, and year. Evaluating the feasibility of the search and how easy is to collect data and analysing it. To maximize the data collected and the number of appliances under study. Trying to cover a large set of appliance and sample of countries. To classify the data collected for each country following the appliances type classification (see Section 2.3) and ownership/penetration data. To analyse the data collected from 1970 to 2010 by means of graphing the data collected in three different graphs for the three appliances categories. To provide new data in the topic and show trends useful for other researchers to use in their studies. To compare and examine the appliances ownership or/and penetration to residential energy consumption per capita, electricity consumption per capita and GDP per capita. In this section the methodology followed, sources accessed, countries, and appliances included in the study are presented. In the present paper appliances are split into three groups. The first one, white and goods, includes the appliances intended to cover basic needs such as washing machines, refrigerators or freezers, cloth dryers, dishwashers, etc. Brown good, which is the second group, includes the appliances aimed to fulfil secondary society needs from a technologic point of view; such appliances are normally used for leisure. A sample of appliances within this group are TVs, computers, DVDs, cameras, videogames, etc. Also, new appliances as tablets, smartphones, music players, GPS, etc. are included in this group. Such new appeared appliances are increasing considerably their impact because they respond to the new nexus between society networks and social media. The last group includes small appliances commonly used in households for housework and personal cleanliness. Irons, coffee makers, microwaves, mixers, hair dryers, fans, etc. are common examples of small appliances. The countries considered in this case of study are part of the OECD, the countries and the reasons to add them in the set of countries are specified in this section. Spain, France, Austria, Denmark, UK, and Hungary were considered to represent South, North, and East Europe areas, respectively. To compare the different climate zones in Europe as well as strong economies to countries in current economic growth. All the countries listed above except Hungary, which present ownership data, present penetration data (See USA was included in this study due to its worldwide importance and its high residential buildings consumption, partially due to appliance ownership, and comparable to that from the whole Europe. For USA, ownership and penetration was retrieved (See Interestingly, the cases of study registered in Asiatic countries are more difficult to compare due to their strong diversity and because the data is segmented and difficult to access. However, Japan and China were selected to represent the emerging economies in Asia Japan is a remarkable case within the first line of technology deployment since decades while China is an emergent country where the appliance ownership has increased considerably during the last decades. Ownership data is presented for Japan and China as shown in Australia is a peculiar case because of its remarkable singularities such as low population density within a huge country and because it is part of the OCDE although it is located in a very different climate zone compared to the rest of the OCDE countries. For Australia, penetration and ownership data is assessed (see In the present section, the data sources of the different countries considered are listed. Most of the data gathered was found in the statistical institutions of their respective countries either in the website or in the yearbooks published by the national institution. In some cases such as Hungary, Japan and China the data was difficult to access or only found in national libraries. The sources consulted as well as the data format and collection is detailed as follows:           Since the data collected was distributed along the difference statistical websites and yearbooks, the years under study and the appliances considered are different for each country. For comparison purposes, the authors intended to unify the data comparing the same appliances and similar periods of time. To clarify the data collection methodology the periods of data that were found for each country and appliance are listed in In this section, the data is graphed differentiating in between white goods, brown goods and small appliances. The data collected is divided into penetration data and ownership data following The penetration of brown goods increased dramatically in Austria (see The growth in appliance penetration in Austria followed a higher rate than the residential energy and electricity consumption per capita, but at the same rate as GDP per capita as it is shown in Denmark showed a steep growth in brown goods in the 90 White goods data from Denmark are presented for refrigerators (from 32% in 1990 to 97% in 2010), freezers (from 29% in 1990 to 89% in 2010), fridge-freezers (from 17% in 1990 to 72% in 2010), washing machines (from 70% in 1990 to 82% in 2010), clothes dryers (from 24% in 1990 to 54% in 2010), and dishwashers (from 29% in 1990 to 69% in 2010). Differently from the previous case, the stagnation is not reached for any of the white goods, not even for refrigerators. If the increment keeps constant, the refrigerator stagnation will be reached in the next decades. Following a trend representative from developed countries, domestic electrical appliance penetration in Denmark grew at a high rate, however, residential energy and electricity consumption per capita has not followed the dramatic increase in their penetration between 1990 and 2010 ( Most of the available data presented in this paper for France ( Data on penetration of brown and white goods in Spain show no big growth since 2000 ( In comparison to Denmark or Austria, colder countries than Spain, the ownership of clothes dryer is really low. Just 5% of the household had a clothes dryer in 2005, this percentage grew up to 10% in 2010. Therefore, the tendency in Spain is to gradually increase the presence of clothes dryers at home. In Spain, the increase in white appliance penetration had a very similar trend to energy consumption per capita between 2000 and 2012, and brown goods to the trend of electricity consumption per capita. However, GDP per capita grew at higher trend ( White goods penetration such as dishwashers and washing machines in UK did grow from 72% in 1975 to 93% in 2000 ( Data on appliance penetration for Australia is presented since 1994–2005 in Data for appliance ownership in Australia is only available for white goods; refrigerators and freezers. Freezers ownership between 1995 and 2005 ( Regarding brown goods, TV penetration has reached full saturation in USA already in the early 90's, similarly to the previous cases under study. Mobile phones, desktop PCs and laptops show similar growth tends at different levels (53% to 76%, 50–68%, and 13–24%, respectively). Finally, video recorders and DVD players penetration had values at around 90% in 2000, decreasing from this point and reaching only 4% in 2009. Small appliance penetration showed stagnation or small increase for ovens (average 92%), microwave ovens (from 84% to 96%), ceiling fans (from 53% to 72%), coffee makers (61% to 72%), and toasters (from 30% to 42%). The same trend can be found for white goods, refrigerators (99%), washing machines (77% to 82%), clothes dryers (71% to 79%), air conditioners (68% to 82%), dish washers (45% to 59%), and freezers (34% to 30%) between 1993 and 2009. On the other hand, ownership data for USA in the period 2009–2010 is shown in   On the contrary, computers at home have not reached saturation yet, but the number of computers per USA household is still increasing. Following this trend, the stagnation is expected to be reached in the next decades. In 1997, 6% of USA had at least one computer and 27% had two or more, while in 2009 already 33% households had at least one computer and 43% two or more. The number of electronic devices by household in USA in 2009 is shown in Chinese households achieved a remarkable increase in households’ electric good ownership over the past few decades. For instance, it reached stagnation of television ownership in 2004 at 133.4%, coming up from as low as 0.59% in 1981. Fans started saturating at 167% in 1995, from 42.6% in 1981 (   This paper compiles for the first time data on appliance penetration and ownership in different countries of the world. The main purpose of the paper is not to evaluate or interpret the data, but to show trends for other researchers to use in their studies. Such information serves as the basis for relevant modelling work, policy preparatory work and other research. The main conclusion of the paper is that this data is very difficult to find and compile, most of it is available at national statistics at local language. Moreover, either penetration or ownership data is found for each country; in this paper both data is only presented for Australia (quite limited for ownership) and USA. The objectives stated at the beginning of the paper were met along this work as follows: The data was search in data bases sort by country, appliances type and year. The feasibility of the data collected from the countries (from which data was found) was evaluated. The data was collected for 33 appliances and 10 countries in the period from 1970 to 2010. The data collected was classified following the appliances type classification (see section 2.3) and ownership/penetration data. The data collected was analysed and compared to residential energy consumption per capita, electricity consumption per capita and GDP per capita. The work is partially funded by the
