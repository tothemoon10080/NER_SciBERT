This study reports on the preparation of molybdenum silicide powders from MoO3-SiO2-Mg powder blends with a two-step process of mechanochemical synthesis and selective acid leaching. Mechanochemical synthesis was carried out at a short duration of 1h using a high-energy ball mill. Subsequently, mechanochemically synthesized powders were eliminated from the unwanted Mg-based by-products by HCl leaching. Excess amounts of reactants were utilized with the intention of eliminating Mo phase and their effects were investigated on the yielded products. Phase and microstructural characterizations of the powder products were performed using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), particle size analyzer (PSA) and scanning electron microscope/enery dispersive X-ray spectrometer (SEM/EDX). Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) and crystallite size calculations were also conducted on the mechanochemically synthesized and leached powders using the Bruker AXS TOPAS software. All the leached powders consisted of α-MoSi2, β-MoSi2, Mo5Si3 and Mo phases. However, in case of using 80wt.% excess amount of Mg, the occurrence of Mo phase was inhibited and powders containing dominant α-MoSi2 (~73wt.%), β-MoSi2 (~11wt.%) and Mo5Si3 (~16wt.%) phases were obtained with an average crystallite size of about 70nm.Silicide-based materials have been attracting great interest for years due to their unique properties such as high-temperature oxidation stability, high-temperature strength, thermal and electrical properties Up to now, molybdenum silicides have been synthesized by several diverse production methods such as conventional arc-melting, casting, powder pressing-sintering, hot pressing, self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), reaction bonding, infiltration and mechanical alloying Kang and Yin Generally, direct synthesis of intermetallic compounds from elemental powders such as molybdenum silicides requires long ball milling durations In the present work, mechanochemical synthesis investigations of molybdenum silicide powders from MoO Molybdenum oxide (MoO Stoichiometric and excess amounts of initial powder batches were weighed (7 Powder blends were subjected to high-energy ball milling using a SPEX™ 8000D Mixer/Mill (1200 Selective HCl (Merck™, 37%) leaching was applied to the 1 The crystalline phases of the as-blended, milled and purified powders were identified using a Bruker™ D8 Advanced Series X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with CuK     Quantitative phase analysis results of the mechanochemically synthesized and leached samples are given in  Kang and Yin Molybdenum silicide phases were successfully prepared by mechanochemical synthesis and selective acid leaching from their oxides with a reducing agent.
