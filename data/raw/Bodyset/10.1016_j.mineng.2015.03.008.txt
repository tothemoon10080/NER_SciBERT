This communication revisits previously reported results on froth depth profiling along a rougher flotation bank. The optimization problem is reformulated as to maximize the overall bank Cu recovery subject to a lower bound constraint on the overall Cu concentrate grade. This formulation differs from that originally proposed in Maldonado et al. (2007) where the sum of the squared Cu tailing grade of each cell group was minimized for a given target bank Cu concentrate grade. A semi-empirical steady-state mathematical model of a bank of cells previously validated using industrial flotation data from Los Pelambres mine in Chile was used to simulate the process. In order to improve resolution a genetic algorithm was implemented to search for the optimal froth depth profile as opposed to the discrete dynamic programming technique originally implemented. Results show that optimal froth depth profiling resulting from solving the reformulated optimization problem produces an increase in the overall bank recovery for a given target Cu concentrate grade compared to that obtained when solving the original formulation. Moreover, the resulting optimal mass-pull profile tends to be more balance in the first cells which partially agrees with recent observations.Flotation banks also known as rows or lines are serial arrangement of cells where the tail stream of one cell is the feed stream to the next cell down the bank. Bank optimization consists of selecting the best operating conditions in each flotation cell such that the overall bank metallurgical performance is optimized. Bank optimization has received increasing attention as flotation stages such as roughing, cleaning and scavenging are all made up of bank of cells and their optimization is therefore an important step toward the optimization of a whole flotation plant. In addition, optimization of the roughing stage is particularly important as this stage is commonly encountered in an open circuit configuration, i.e., rougher tails being reported to the final tailing, therefore any performance losses at this stage cannot be compensated elsewhere. Moreover, current trend of having short banks of larger cells demands for better operational practices as any poor performance in any of these large cells will have a significant detrimental effect on the overall bank performance. Several strategies have been devised to improve bank performance such as: gas profiling ( A static model of a bank of nine self-aerated Wemco 4500 ft Advances on computer technology have allowed the application of new optimization algorithms. Genetic algorithm (GA) is a meta-heuristic technique inspired by the Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection and uses a direct analogy of its mechanisms such as selection, reproduction, crossover and mutation. GA technique is a population based approach that provides best population of parameters after every generation based on a predefined objective function (            During simulations, feedrate was set to 1252 tonnes per hour (dry solids) at 39% solids by weight and Cu and Fe feed grades were set to 1.03% and 2.12% respectively.   From    In the original article of The problem of optimizing the operation of a bank of flotation cells using froth depth profiling has been revisited. The optimization problem has been recast as to maximizing the overall Cu bank recovery while satisfying a lower bound constraint on the overall Cu concentrate grade. The optimal froth depth to each cell group was determined using a genetic algorithm search method implemented in MatLab Optimization Toolbox. Results show that a U-shape froth depth profile, i.e., initially decreasing froth depth to subsequently increasing froth depth profile down the bank, turned out to be optimal in the sense of maximizing recovery while respecting a minimum concentrate grade. This optimal profile also provides a more balanced mass-pull profile which partially agrees with recent reports. The authors gratefully acknowledge discussion with Dr. James A.
