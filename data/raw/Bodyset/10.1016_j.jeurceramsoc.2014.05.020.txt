(Zr, Hf)B2–SiC nanostructured composites were fabricated by high energy ball milling and reactive spark plasma sintering (RSPS) of HfB2, ZrSi2, B4C and C. Highly dense composites with homogeneously intermixed ultra-fine (Zr, Hf)B2 and SiC grains (100–300nm) were obtained after RSPS at 1600°C for 10min. The densification was promoted by high energy ball milling and ZrSi2 additive. The additives were almost completely transformed into ZrB2 and SiC during densification. The improvement of flexural strength and fracture toughness (641MPa and 5.36MPam1/2, respectively) was achieved. The relationships between the ultra-fine microstructure and mechanical properties were discussed.Hafnium diboride (HfB The uniform mixing and ultra-fine comminution of starting powders down to 10 Synthesized HfB Raw powders were ball-milled for 2 The bulk densities of sintered samples were measured using Archimedes’ method. The theoretical density of the composites obtained by the rule of mixture was 7.69 The microstructure and phase fraction of sintered specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F, Tokyo, Japan) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, D/MAX 2200, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation. The TEM specimens were thinned by the focused ion beam technique (FIB, Helios Nanolab, FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), and were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (spot diameter: 1.0   The lattice parameters of different diboride phases before and after sintering were summarized in Although the calculated relative density of the sintered specimen indicated the presence of pores (R.D.: 98.3%), TEM observations revealed a highly dense microstructure consisting of nano- to submicrometer-sized grains ( An EDS spectrum of the (Zr, Hf)B The hardness and Young's modulus ( The Young's modulus ( In order to clarify the effects of the nanostructure on the fracture toughness of the composites, the propagation path of cracks and the fractured surface of the specimen were observed using SEM ( High-energy ball milling promoted the fabrication of ultra-fine HfB
