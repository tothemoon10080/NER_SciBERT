The reduction of iron ions concentration from copper electrowinning electrolyte solution in copper solvent extraction and electrowinning process, is important to maintain good current efficiency. In this study both chemical precipitation (hydroxide and jarosite) and ion exchange methods were investigated using industrial copper raffinate and electrowinning solutions from Sarcheshmeh copper complex, Iran. Batch precipitation and adsorption tests were initially performed before, a fixed bed column was investigated for iron removal by ion exchange. Batch results indicated that with increasing the pH and dilution, improved the iron removal by chemical precipitation methods. Hydroxide and jarosite precipitations were performed efficiently at pHs of 3 and 2 and temperatures of 70°C and 95°C respectively. The iron removal efficiency was greater with jarosite precipitation (∼70%) compared to hydroxide (∼20%) for a particular pH (2). Diluting by 50% increased the removal efficiency up to 150%. Ion exchange results indicated that pH and dilution did not have a significant effect on the efficiency with this method and it practically performed at ambient temperatures. The batch equilibrium and kinetics experiments were performed with Purolite S957 resin and the results showed that the Sips isotherm (the maximum adsorption capacity was 42mg/g) and both the pseudo-nth order (kad

                      and n=0.12) were able to predict the equilibrium and kinetics data. In the fixed bed column experiments, the effects of parameters such as the volumetric flow rate and bed height on the breakthrough curves were studied. The iron removal efficiency for the industrial solution which included impurities was less than for synthetic solutions. The results showed that the resin selectively removed the iron ions but did not decrease the copper concentration and used resin was completely regenerated by hydrochloric acid (the amount of 5mL/g of resin and concentration of 30wt%) over several regeneration did not significantly alter the sorption capacity. Finally, a mathematical model based on chemical sorption was used to predict the experimental breakthrough curves data and results showed this model accurately predicted the experimental breakthrough curves. Overall, ion exchange was more efficient at iron removal than chemical precipitation.The effect of iron in copper electrowinning solution in hydrometallurgy SX-EW processing is well known. If the iron concentration in copper electrowinning solution increases, it reduces the current efficiency, increases the energy consumption and changes the surface morphology of cathodic copper, and these effects are intensified by increasing the flow rate of the solution ( Depending on the solution pH and temperature, iron can be precipitated in many hydroxide forms. The main reactions are given in Hydroxide precipitation is performed by adding reagents such as lime or sodium hydroxide to solutions to precipitate the iron ions as iron hydroxide but a higher pH is required if the iron is in the ferrous state. A pH of 3.5 is sufficient to precipitate iron in the ferric state ( Previous investigations showed that, due to the very acidic nature of copper electrolyte solutions, only chelating resins with phosphonic groups were suitable for removing iron ions from these solutions ( The most important advantage of resin is the high degree of selectivity in the adsorption of iron and its capability of complete regeneration ( This study focused on reducing the concentration of iron from real solutions from the Sarcheshmeh copper complex, Iran. The performance of chemical precipitation (hydroxide and jarosite) and ion exchange methods were investigated. The hydroxide and jarosite precipitation experiments were performed on industrial raffinate solutions which have high iron and low copper concentration, whereas the ion exchange experiments were performed on electrowinning solutions. The main objectives of this study were: (1) study of hydroxide and jarosite precipitation methods to remove iron from copper raffinate solution in a batch experiment and investigate the effects of temperature, pH and dilution, (2) determination of the kinetics and equilibrium sorption models of iron uptake experimentally with Purolite S957 resin, (3) obtain breakthrough curves for the sorption of iron ions in a fixed bed column and investigate the effect of bed height and feed flow rate on these curves, (4) investigate the regeneration of used resins and determine the effect of the quantity and concentration of regeneration agent on it and (5) develop a numerical model to describe the fixed bed sorption breakthrough curves. Purolite S957 ion exchange resin was used in this study to remove iron ions from electrowinning solution. Purolite S957 is a chelating resin consisting of the macroporous polystyrene cross-linked divinyl benzene network with sulfonic and phosphonic acid functional groups. Before each experiment, the resin was soaked in double distilled water for 15 The surface area of Purolite S957 resin was measured at a liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 The solutions were industrial copper raffinate and electrowinning solutions, which were supplied from Sarcheshmeh copper complex raffinate and electrowinning lines. Some of their properties are listed in To investigate the hydroxide or jarosite precipitation, batch experiments were performed with a magnetic stirrer at 150 Equilibrium sorption experiments were done in a set of glass flasks containing 50 Kinetics sorption experiments were studied by adding 10  Fixed bed resin sorption experiments were performed at room temperature using a glass column with an internal diameter of 15 Before each fixed bed experiment, resin bed was washed with at least 5 bed volume (BV) of deionized water and then by 2 BV of diluted sulfuric acid solution. By doing this, the impurities in resin network decreased and the sorption capacity of resin increased. In obtained breakthrough curves, the column efficiency (the percentage of inlet iron ions that was adsorbed by resin before its saturation) was calculated according to the following equation ( In fixed bed ion exchange or sorption processes, breakthrough curves are very important, because they provide the basic information about the design of the system. The experimental method to provide this curves is direct and exact, but this method is time-consuming, costly and greatly depends on the experimental conditions. Conversely, mathematical modelling does not need costly apparatus and is able to predict breakthrough curves in various conditions ( According to The column was filled with homogenous packing. The hydrodynamic behavior of the liquid phase could be described by the axial dispersion model. The most suitable isotherm model to predict the equilibrium data was Sips. Velocity, temperature and other properties of solution were constant along the bed. The size of adsorbent pellets was the same and it was distributed uniformly through the bed. The mass balance equation and the boundary conditions of the liquid phase in the column for iron ions are given by Eqs. The mass balance equation in the solid phase, resin, is as follows: The effect of temperature on neutralization was investigated by experiments using undiluted raffinate solution at various temperatures (35, 70, 85 and 90 In industry, dilution of solutions is undesirable as it lowers the acidity and copper concentration. This study evaluated dilution on chemical precipitation. To study the effect of the dilution on hydroxide precipitation, experiments were carried out using industrial raffinate solution at different percentages of dilution (0, 25 and 50%) and levels of pH (2, 2.5 and 3) at a constant temperature of around 70 Three different precipitation agents calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide were used at different levels of pH (2, 2.5 and 3) at a constant temperature (70 To investigate the effect of pH and dilution percentage on precipitation of iron ions by the jarosite method, experiments at two pHs (1.5 and 2) and dilution percentage of 0 and 50% were studied at a temperature of 95 To determine the isotherm models for iron adsorption by ion exchange resin, Purolite S957, experiments were performed and data fitted by Langmuir, Freundlich, and Sips models. Parameters of these models were determined by fitting their equations with experimental data using curve fitting toolbox of MATLAB software and results are given in Experiments were carried out to determine the rate at which the iron was adsorbed from solution by ion exchange and data were fitted to pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, pseudo-nth order, and LF kinetics models. The results of the fitting are provided in According to the results, the iron loading by resin achieved an equilibrium state in 30 The performance of the resin in relation to the sulfuric acid concentration was investigated with 1.5 In the previous section we found chemical precipitation (hydroxide and jarosite methods) was dramatically affected by pH where the iron removal reduced from 70% at pH 3 to 20% at pH 1.5. The ion exchange method was less affected (<5%) but will avoid the need for neutralisation and therefore the acid in solution is preserved which reduces the expense of the process. As well, hydroxide and jarosite precipitation was performed at elevated temperature (>70 Experiments were conducted with different quantities of fresh resin (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 Dilution affected both chemical precipitations (hydroxide and jarosite). The impact of dilution was further tested with industrial electrowinning solution on the performance of the ion exchange resin. Samples containing 50 Based on discussions in the previous sections, ion exchange outperformed hydroxide and jarosite precipitation methods. As well, hydroxide and jarosite precipitation methods produced a lot of solid precipitates, conversely, ion exchange method did not. It can process the original solution efficiently at ambient temperature and can be more easily performed in continuous reactors like fixed bed. In the next section, the results of fixed bed studies for iron removal from an electrowinning solution are given. Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of bed height and flow rate on breakthrough curves of fixed bed sorption by operating the column at different bed heights and various flow rates. For each experimental breakthrough curve, the column efficiency (see Eq. It is important that in iron removal from copper electrowinning solution, the uptake of copper by adsorber be negligible. In this study, the copper concentration was measured in the samples that were obtained in some fixed bed adsorption experiments and the copper uptake by the resin was calculated. The results are given in Industrial electrowinning solution contains many impurities (see To study the regeneration process, the volume of hydrochloric acid was added at different quantities (10, 25, 50 and 75 A sample containing 5 The concentration of Cl A mathematical model that described the process of fixed bed sorption was used to predict the experimental breakthrough curves data. This study investigated chemical precipitation (hydroxide and jarosite) and a chelating ion exchange resin (Purolite S957) to reduce the iron concentration from industrial copper raffinate and electrowinning solutions through batch experimentation. The reduction of iron from electrowinning solution was also investigated in a fixed bed column with the ion exchange resin. According to the results, iron removal efficiency increased with increasing pH and dilution with hydroxide and jarosite precipitation at temperatures above 70 The authors acknowledge the Sarcheshmeh copper complex, Iran in allowing them to use their solutions.
