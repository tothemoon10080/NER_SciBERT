The effectiveness of thermal treatment is explored to remove mercury from contaminated soils and concretes from an area contaminated during the mining and metallurgical treatment of cinnabar (HgS). The leachability of the metal from the roasted material is reduced, thus permitting its disposal in a sanitary landfill requiring only a low degree of environmental protection.
