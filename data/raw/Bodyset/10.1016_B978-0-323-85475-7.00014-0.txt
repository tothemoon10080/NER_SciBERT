Injuries to the musculoskeletal system don’t occur in a random fashion: only a limited number of presentations can be seen. Indeed, under the influence of primary forces, skeletal tissues will behave in predictable ways: each force (cause) produces injuries with specific features (consequence). It is therefore possible to determine the nature of the injuring force by the analysis of the fracture characteristics (orientation, location) or the fragment displacement. For instance, the orientation of fracture line (transverse, oblique or spiral) in long bones corresponds to a particular injuring force (traction, compression, torsion).
               The imaging findings encountered for a particular mechanism of injury form a traumatic pattern. Its identification allows the understanding of the trauma circumstances, the exhaustive depiction of damages and the detection of concurrent injuries.Diaphysis (shaft) Metaphysis Physis (growth plate) Epiphysis Intra-articular Extra-articular Complete/incomplete Simple/comminutive Transverse (or axial) Oblique Spiral Butterfly fractures Displacement: anterior, posterior, lateral or medial Length discrepancy: overlapping (bayonet deformity) with shortening, or distraction with lengthening Rotation, relative to the distal fragment (medial or lateral) Angulation Dislocation Diastasis Impaction Transverse: tendon/ligament avulsion, or direct blow Oblique: compression Spiral: torsion Soft tissue swelling Fat pad displacement Joint effusion Introduction Mechanisms of injury Direct versus indirect injuries Forces Patterns of injury Concept of pattern Joint injury Particular forms of fractures Terminology References Despite its 206 bones interconnected by over a dozen different types of joints, the skeletal system has a relatively simple and rigid architecture. The vast majority of skeletal regions, this organization only allows limited motion and amplitude under physiologic loads [ Trauma of the skeletal system results from [ motions above normal physiologic ranges loads over physiologic resistance Therefore, injuries to the musculoskeletal system don’t occur randomly: only a limited number of presentations can be seen [ As if you were watching a movie back from the end, it is possible to determine the nature of the injuring forces by the analysis of the fracture characteristics (orientation, location) As most traumatic injuries obey to biomechanical rules with reproducible results, several systematizations (or classification) of fracture can be proposed A direct injury is caused by an external blow or force with damages occuring at the site of impact, for examples ( crush injury stabs collision impact during fall In an indirect injury, damages occur some distance from the initial impact site, for example ( shoulder dislocation after an impact of the arm (fall on an outstretched hand) elbow dislocation after a fall on an outstretched hand hip fracture during a dashboard injury (impact of the knee against the dashboard in a frontal car accident) femoral fracture after a fall from height with reception on the foot Four basic forces can be applied to the tissues ( compression (and shearing) tension (or traction) torsion (or rotation) bending The anatomic configuration explains why certain structures resist to a certain type of force (compression, torsion, etc.) but are highly vulnerable to another. For example, the ankle joint can resist significant axial load but cannot adapt to talar rotation. Compression forces applied at the extremity of a long bone classically induce an oblique fracture ( Indeed, as the bone is weaker in shear than in axial compression, the cortical bone will fail by shear with a diagonal slippage of a fragment ( With higher loads, fragmentation and comminution can be seen, especially at the level of the weaker metaphyseal ends of a long bone ( In flat bones, such as vertebras, mild compression induces a transverse fracture line while severe compression results in a sagittal fracture line ( If the mechanism is direct, such as a blow, compressive forces are applied perpendicularly to the long axis of the bone with a resulting transverse line ( In the immature skeleton, compression injuries result in a particular form of fracture, called torus (or buckle) with a coronal widening of the physo-metaphyseal junction ( Rotational forces typically induce spiral fracture lines that are oblique in two different planes [ Tensile forces lead to a transverse fracture ( The usual appearance of a tensile fracture is an avulsion fracture, at the level of the tendon or ligament insertion, which can be pinpoint or involve larger fragment [ As the bone is weaker in tension than in compression, failure commonly occurs in the particular area of the bone where the force is applied Bending forces combine compressive force on one cortical of the bone and tensile force on the other [ In adults, the special presentation is the “butterfly fragment” that combines a transverse fracture line (compression) on one cortical with comminution on the other ( On an immature bone (pediatric population), bending induces plastic deformation ( A pattern represents the imaging features that can be encountered for a given mechanism of injury [ For a given pattern, damages ( In case of discrepancies between expected and observed findings, two scenarios can be evocated ( there are occult injuries (bony or ligamentous), non-radiographically visible the mechanism of injury is not the right one When an articulation is involved, a pivot can be created: tensile and compression injuries coexist at each opposite side of the joint. For example, a varus force applied to the ankle leads to an oblique compression fracture of the malleolus on the medial aspect and an avulsion ligament tear on the lateral aspect ( The pivot concept can apply for spinal trauma as well: the posterior facets can be the pivot with compression of the vertebral body ( Fractures eventually resulting from accumulated microtraumas, and they can present as: fatigue fractures resulting of abnormal stress (high level sports, high-intensity activities) on a normal bone ( insufficiency fractures resulting of normal stress on a mechanically weakened bone (osteoporosis, osteomalacia, etc.) ( Stress fractures are usually incomplete fractures, either unicortical or strictly trabecular without any cortical interruption Pathological fractures are fractures that happen on a bone previously weakened by an osteolytic process (infection, neoplasms) [ Fractures can take place even in the absence of significant trauma. Some fractures (or dislocations) occur with so diffuse and severe soft tissue damages, especially of vascular or neural by standing structures, that they are considered as traumatic amputation ( (
