The high voltage spinel form of LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) with a particle size ∼10–40nm has been synthesized for the first time using high energy mechanical milling (HEMM) followed by low temperature thermal treatments using Li2O, MnO2 and NiO as the starting precursors. The nanostructured LMNO cathode, synthesized by the simple, but effective HEMM process followed by thermal treatments to refine the structure in the temperature range ∼573–1073K, exhibits a reversible capacity ∼120–110mAh/g when cycled at a rate of ∼20mA/g in the potential window ∼3.6–5.1V. The electrochemical results are comparable to capacity values reported in the literature for LMNO derived using various other methods suggesting the efficacy of HEMM as an attractive and viable alternative approach for synthesizing battery grade high voltage spinel phase, LMNO.There is a great demand for low cost high energy density electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices to transition from the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology that is currently in place to enable the realization of plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and the much desired all-electric vehicles (EVs) Currently LiCoO In order to overcome these obstacles, much research has been conducted to minimize/suppress the JT distortion primarily by the addition of transition metals to substitute for Mn on the Mn site in the lattice of LiMn Various synthetic strategies combining a combination of different procedures, involving wet chemistry, solid state reaction, sol–gel methods, template synthesis, Pechini method, etc., have been developed to synthesize battery grade LMNO Mixture of elemental powders of Li The milled and heat treated powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the Philips PW1830 system employing the CuK Electrochemical characteristics were analyzed from electrodes that were prepared by mixing 80  The crystallite size of LMNO obtained after 20 In order to study the electrochemical activity of the synthesized LMNO for potential use as a Li-ion cathode, the electrochemical behavior and performance study of the synthesized LMNO has been carried out.  In order to study the rate capability, the LMNO synthesized at ∼873 In the present study, a high energy mechano chemical milling (HEMM) process utilizing the respective pure metal oxides Li The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the
