This paper reviews the hydrodynamic design of self-aerating flotation machines. The important criteria relating to mixing, solids suspension, air transfer, and power are discussed. Data are presented for all the standard sizes of WEMCO brand machines, showing the continuing use of hydrodynamic criteria in the design of those machines. In particular, the design criteria for the recent, very large machines are discussed.
