Set in the beautiful surrounds of Falmouth, “quality endures” is what comes to mind for this conference. Despite the common misperception that only large conferences deliver value, When I opened this conference, I spoke of the volatility of the nickel market, and the recent successful diversification with pig nickel; and how this meant we had to rise to the challenge as mineral processing engineers to develop more efficient, flexible processes that would enable the industry to sustainably handle uncertain future markets. When I closed the conference two days later, I certainly was encouraged by what I had seen. The proceedings were an interesting and relevant mix of extractive and mineral processing disciplines, with some valuable new items from the environmental discipline. The laterite papers certainly had some progress to report for both hydro- and pyro-applications. Chris Harris, of Queens University, Canada, made an excellent contribution to the laterite pyrometallurgical programme with his work on the selective reduction and sulphidisation of nickel laterites. The news from Haceteppe University, Turkey, of a limonitic laterite orebody that appears amenable to atmospheric leaching is very significant. The sulphide programme was capably represented by Dr. Jacques Eksteen, of Lonmin, who presented no less than four excellent extractive papers in a row on the Friday morning. “ In closing, I thank the authors and co-authors for their contributions, the delegates for their attention and interesting discussion, Xstrata Process Support for their sponsorship, and MEI for convening this useful conference with such focus.
