A small addition of boron (B) changes the morphology of the α-Ti laths in as-sintered Ti–6Al–4V and Ti–10V–2Fe–3Al to near equiaxed α-Ti grains and increases the number density of the resulting α-Ti grains by up to six folds. TiB forms at about 700°C during heating to the isothermal sintering temperature and more than 90% of the TiB particles were found inside the α-Ti grains. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to identify the orientation relationships (ORs) between the TiB and α-Ti phases. Their exact ORs are affected by both the chemistry of the alloy and the processing conditions. The modification of the α-Ti laths and the substantial increase in the number density of the α-Ti grains are attributed to the enhanced heterogeneous nucleation of α-Ti on TiB due to the identified specific ORs and excellent lattice matches between these two phases. In addition, there exists a unique peritectoid reaction between β-Ti and TiB during the subsequent cooling after isothermal sintering by which β-Ti+TiB→α-Ti, which may have contributed to the enhanced heterogeneous nucleation of α-Ti on TiB.A small addition of elemental boron (B) or borides refines the microstructure of as-sintered commercially pure Ti (CP-Ti) and Ti alloys and modifies the morphology of the α-Ti phase In α-β or near β Ti alloys, the morphology of the α-Ti phase exerts an important influence on the ductility of the alloy, where equiaxed or globular α-Ti grains are in favour of acicular α-Ti grains The powder materials used are summarized in The microstructure of each etched sample was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model JEOL 6460L, Japan). The average prior-β grain size was measured from 500  A detailed quantitative analysis of the as-sintered microstructures versus the addition of B is shown in Ti and B may form different types of borides including TiB, Ti  For CP–Ti–0.3B: (1 For Ti–6Al–4V–0.3B: (0 For Ti–10 These ORs differ from those reported previously in as-cast B-containing Ti materials and PM Ti–TiB MMCs   The lattice parameters of TiB (orthorhombic) are The preferred ORs identified in conjunction with the excellent lattice matches support the argument that crystallographically, TiB is a potent heterogeneous nucleant for α-Ti. The peritectoid reaction offers an ideal mechanism by which the α-Ti phase nucleates on the TiB particles. In principle, those TiB particles that form during heating above 700 In summary, a small addition of boron changes the morphology of the α-Ti laths in as-sintered Ti–6Al–4V and Ti–10 This work was funded by the
