The haemocompatibility of Ti–3Zr–2Sn–3Mo–25Nb biomedical alloy was studied after surface heparinization. A layer of sol–gel TiO2 films was applied on the alloy samples followed by active treatment in the bio-functionalized solution for introducing the OH− and NH−
                     2 groups, and then the heparin was immobilized on the active TiO2 films through the electrostatic self assembly technology. It is shown that the heparinized films are mainly composed of anatase and rutile with smooth and dense surface. In vitro blood compatibility was evaluated by haemolysis test, clotting time and platelet adhesion behavior tests. The results show that the haemocompatibility of the alloy could be significantly improved by surface heparinization.
