Better understanding of the gelation properties of surimi proteins could yield a short cut to improve quality control. Two methods (punch and torsion) have been well described in the Codex Code for Frozen Surimi (FAO/WHO) developed by the US and Japanese governments. The Codex Code recommends buyers and sellers to select either method based on their needs. However, each method contains specific pros and cons. This paper will review the two Codex methods and point out their pros and cons, respectively based on experimental data. In addition, a method for gel preparation and texture analysis for better quality control will be suggested.
                  Empirical punch test is widely used around the world and provides convenience and simplicity to the user, while its data are specific to the individual machine. Fundamental torsion test is widely used in the US major meat and surimi seafood manufacturers. However, it is time consuming and the maintenance of an exact diameter is extremely difficult. A new gel preparation method using a mold was investigated, which provides significant time saving and convenience while maintaining the accuracy of the torsion method.
                  In addition, there is a significant discrepancy between the conventional gel cooking method and commercial crabstick manufacturing for their different heating rates. New cooking methods, to address this discrepancy, will be discussed in this presentation as well.
