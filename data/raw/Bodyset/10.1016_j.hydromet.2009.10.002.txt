In this investigation, pressure leaching experiments were carried out in H2SO4–FeSO4–O2 and H2SO4–O2 media to clarify the role of iron in the leaching of white metal produced in a Teniente Converter reactor. The dissolution rate of copper was studied in the range of 80 to 150°C, using oxygen partial pressure from 203 to 1013kPa. The results on the dissolution of white metal in H2SO4–O2 and H2SO4–FeSO4–O2 media indicated that white metal leaches in two stages and iron in the leaching solution affects drastically the rate in the range of 80 to 150°C. In the presence of iron at temperatures below the melting point of elemental sulfur, the leaching rate, particularly the rate of the second stage increases drastically as compared to the case in the absence of iron. The rate increase is due the indirect leaching mechanism involving Fe3+ ions, which leach the white metal at a faster rate than O2.
                  The kinetics of copper dissolution from white metal was analyzed and activation energies for the two-stage leaching of white metal in H2SO4–FeSO4–O2 medium were calculated as 76kJ/mol and 32kJ/mol for the first and second stages, respectively.Copper is generally produced from sulfide concentrates by pyrometallurgy using the conventional smelting and converting technology. In the smelting of copper concentrates in Teniente Converters (TC), a high grade matte (white metal) is produced ( Regarding the leaching of white metal, Recently White metal can be considered as a mixture of Cu As already mentioned, experimental evidence indicates that the leaching behavior of white metal is similar to the leaching of natural chalcocite mineral; this means that the white metal will dissolve in two stages with the formation of covellite as an intermediate product. For the leaching in H Stage 1: Stage 2: For elemental sulfur production For sulfate production The production of elemental sulfur or sulfate in the second stage of reaction depends on the experimental conditions of the leaching. Particularly, high temperatures favor the formation of sulfate instead of elemental sulfur ( When the leaching is carried out using H Stage 1: Stage 2: As indicated above, these reactions are coupled with the re-oxidation of the Fe The rate of oxidation of Fe This paper discusses the experimental results on the pressure leaching of white metal in both H The leaching tests were carried out using white metal (low in iron) produced in a TC reactor in El Teniente Division of CODELCO—Chile. The granulated white metal sample received from El Teniente, was ground and sieved to produce various size fractions. The experimental work was carried out using the size fraction − The leaching experiments were carried out in a 1.5-L Parr titanium autoclave. This reactor was equipped with a heating system with PID temperature controller, a variable speed stirrer with two axial impellers mounted in a single shaft and an internal cooling coil. The operational procedure for a typical experiment consisted of charging the autoclave with 1 The experimental work was designed to study the effect of iron content of the leaching solution on the rate of copper dissolution from white metal. Thus, in most cases the results obtained when leaching using H Preliminary leaching experiments were carried out to determine the conditions where iron remains in the solution to assist with the oxidation of the white metal. In those experiments, the concentration of sulfuric acid of a solution containing 2 The effect of stirring speed on the dissolution of white metal was studied varying from 200 to 1000 Since the white metal contained only 1.8% iron by weight, the amount of iron that could be dissolved from leaching 3 In order to verify the above statement, the kinetic equation proposed by To study the effect of temperature on the dissolution of copper from white metal, experiments were conducted in the range of 80 to 150  In contrast, in leaching of the white metal with H Below the melting point of sulfur, the rate of copper dissolution in the presence of iron is appreciably faster than the observed rates in the absence of iron ions, particularly, the rate of the second stage of reaction, as shown in At temperatures above 120 It should be pointed out that the inhibition of the leaching by molten elemental sulfur could be minimized through the addition of sulfur dispersing agents in the solution, as it has been done in the medium temperature leaching of chalcopyrite concentrates (  In both cases, there was a significant increase in the rate of copper dissolution when the partial pressure of oxygen was raised from 203 to 1013 The solid residues from leaching in some cases were analyzed for elemental sulfur by extraction with CS We can observe in The rate constants for the first and second stages of reaction in both leaching media were determined by using a kinetic model, which was used formerly for the leaching of white metal in H Where The values of the kinetic constants were determined by minimizing the root mean square deviation, Where In H From the data in  The results from the pressure leaching experiments of white metal in H In the presence of iron at temperatures below the melting point of elemental sulfur, the leaching rate, particularly the rate of the second stage increases drastically as compared to the case in the absence of iron. The rate increase is due to the indirect leaching mechanism involving Fe At temperatures higher than the melting point of elemental sulfur (119 The kinetics of copper dissolution from white metal was determined by using a model that considers the two stages of reaction to occur simultaneously and assumes uniform internal reaction with chemical reaction control for both stages.
