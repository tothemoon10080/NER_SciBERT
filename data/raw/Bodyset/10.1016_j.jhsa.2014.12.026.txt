Purpose
                  To assess the results of olecranon fractures with an intra-articular sagittal plane fracture managed by orthogonal fixation constructs.
               
                  Methods
                  A retrospective chart review was performed and 14 proximal ulna fractures with intra-articular comminution resulting in separate medial and lateral fragments were identified. All fractures were classified according to the Schatzker, Mayo, and AO classification systems. Postoperative functional assessment, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) score, time to union, and complications were recorded.
               
                  Results
                  Eleven patients were treated with both dorsal and lateral plates. Three patients were managed with a single dorsal plate and cerclage wires. All fractures healed. Mean length of follow-up was 15 months (range, 4–72 mo). Mean range of motion at final follow-up was a flexion-extension arc of 24° to 129° with 89° and 79° of pronation and supination, respectively. The most common complication was symptomatic hardware, leading to removal of hardware in 5 of 14 (36%) patients. Average postoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was 7. Two patients developed heterotopic ossification and 1 patient required a local pedicled flap for soft-tissue coverage.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Identification of this subset of fractures is critical to successful management. A supplemental lateral plate or cerclage wires can successfully manage these difficult fractures and achieve good outcomes.
