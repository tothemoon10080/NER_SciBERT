This paper contains data and supporting information of and complementary to the research article entitled “Effect of jar shape on high-energy planetary ball milling efficiency: simulations and experiments” (Broseghini et al.,) [1]. Calcium fluoride (CaF2) was ground using two jars of different shape (cylindrical and half-moon) installed on a planetary ball-mill, exploring different operating conditions (jar-to-plate angular velocity ratio and milling time). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and X-Ray Powder Diffraction data (XRPD) were collected to assess the effect of milling conditions on the end-product crystallite size. Due to the inhomogeneity of the end product, the Whole Powder Pattern Model (WPPM, (Scardi, 2008) [2]) analysis of XRPD data required the hypothesis of a bimodal distribution of sizes – respectively ground (fine fraction) and less-to-not ground (coarse fraction) – confirmed by SEM images and suggested by the previous literature (Abdellatief et al., 2013) [3,4]. Predominance of fine fraction clearly indicates optimal milling conditions.  The planetary ball-milling process is ubiquitous in the production of nanostructured materials and modification of their properties. The choice of optimal operating conditions defines end product characteristics. Data reported in this manuscript guide the understanding of the effect of two milling parameters (jar-to-plate angular velocity ratio and milling time) on the dimensional characteristics of the end product. The assessment of the milling behavior ( XRPD raw data could be modeled with different approaches and/or used to extract more information on    Calcium fluoride (CaF Samples were milled in a Fritsch Pulverisette 4 (P4) planetary ball-mill under different operative conditions (jar-to-plate angular velocity ratio and milling time). Twelve balls were inserted in a cylindrical and in a half-moon jar (physical and geometrical properties reported in An ESEM FEI XL 30 was employed to acquire SEM images while XRPD data were collected using a Rigaku PMG/VH diffractometer according to the procedure reported in WPPM analyses The present work was partly supported by Transparency data associated with this article can be found in the online version at  Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
