We investigated the residual stress of SiO2 film using a beam bending method. The effects of deposition parameters such as Si precursor, growth temperature, N2O flow rate and RF power on the residual stress and growth characteristics of SiO2 film were estimated. As the growth temperature increased, residual stress of SiO2 film with HMDS decreased from –235 to –120 MPa while the residual stress of SiO2 with SiH4 showed the opposite trend. As the flow rate of N2O increased, the residual stress of SiO2 film with HMDS changed from –493 to 48 MPa. As RF power increased, the residual stress of SiO2 film with HMDS changed from 153 to −16 MPa. Residual stress of SiO2 film with HMDS was lower than that of the SiO2 film with SiH4.SiO We investigated the residual stress of SiO Silicon oxide films were deposited on Si (100) substrates using PECVD where a resistively heated substrate was employed. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) or SiH The film thickness is measured with an α-step, or ellipsometry. The etch rates were measured with 6:1 BOE at room temperature. The index of refraction was measured by ellipsometry of which the monochromatic wavelength was 632.8 nm and the angle of incidence was 70.00°.
