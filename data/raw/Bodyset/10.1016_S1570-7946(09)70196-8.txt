The present work uses a MILP model to optimise the design and operation of a generic recovery network for industrial polluted waste. The design is subjected to both economic and environmental targets, the latter being modelled based on the eco-indicator 99 method that aggregates the environmental assessment on a single index, the eco-indicator. The network's optimal structure and operation is investigated with an example involving three types of entities (producers, transformers and clients) interconnected by two types of road transport that originate a high dimension superstructure. Results are presented for the two most extreme conditions — maximization of profit under no environmental restrictions and, conversely, the minimization of the eco-indicator under no profit restrictions — as well as for some intermediate scenarios. Subsequently, an analysis on the damage weights sensitivity is undertaken.
                  It is shown that for the recovery network of polluted waste, even for the most adverse conditions, an acceptable environmental performance can be obtained and also that, more importantly, close-to-green scenarios can be reached at the expense of very small losses in profit.
