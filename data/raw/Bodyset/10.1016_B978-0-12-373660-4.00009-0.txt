This chapter highlights centrifugation and decantation (sedimentation, settling, flotation) processes that separates the heterogeneous mixtures of phases which differ from each other in their density. The physical principles governing these processes are the same. Decantation occurs under the effect of Earth's gravity. In the case of centrifugation, accelerated separation is made possible by the effect of centrifugal forces, which may be many times stronger than Earth's gravity. Centrifugation and decantation may be used to separate solid particles from a liquid or two immiscible liquids of different densities from each other, or both. Centrifugal separation is achieved not only with centrifuges but also in any system where a rotational movement is imparted to the mixture. One of the devices for centrifugal separation without a mechanical centrifuge is the cyclone, discussed briefly at the end of the discussion. However, the major part of the presents chapter deal only with mechanical centrifugation and centrifuges. Centrifuges are relatively expensive machines, both in capital expenditure and in the cost of operation (energy consumption, wear of rapidly moving parts, need for sturdy construction capable of resisting the very high forces and pressures). Notwithstanding their cost, centrifuges are used extensively in industry.

Notwithstanding their cost, centrifuges are used extensively in industry. Following are a few of the many applications of mechanical centrifugation in the food industry:        As stated above, centrifugation is a process of ‘accelerated decantation’. It is therefore advantageous to analyze first the process of ‘natural’ decantation in the field of earth's gravity. The following discussion deals with the critical conditions for the separation of Consider the continuous settling tank shown in Being heavier than the liquid, the particle sinks at a velocity u (m.s Let V (m It follows that the maximum flow rate that can satisfy the condition in Assuming that the particles are spherical and that Stoke's law applies, the terminal sinking velocity u is given by: Substitution in d ρ μ=viscosity of the liquid, Pa.s g=acceleration due to gravity, m.s  The ‘tabling process’ is a traditional rural method for the separation of starch from its suspensions in water. The slurry is fed to a long horizontal settling tank (a table). Starch granules settle to the bottom and the clear supernatant flows out over a weir at the opposite end of the table. If the table is 1.6 The average settling velocity of the starch is: The minimal cross-section area of the table is found from The minimal length is then: Imagine that the settling tank in Consider a particle at distance r The gravity acceleration g is replaced by the centrifugal acceleration ω Since the axial acceleration is not constant, the velocity of radial displacement varies with the distance r from the axis of rotation. The minimum residence time for retention t is obtained by integration of The particle is retained if its residence time in the centrifuge is at least equal to t. Denoting by V the volume of the liquid mass between r L=length (height) of the active volume, m. The The theoretical equivalent area Σ is a useful concept for the characterization of centrifuges, because it depends only on the geometry of the machine (L, r  A laboratory procedure specifies centrifugation of a liquid ‘at 10 The centrifugal acceleration a is to be equal to 10 In a tubular centrifuge, the feed is introduced at a distance of 0.03  r d  Substituting the data we find: Q If the feed rate is increased above Q Given a tubular centrifuge with a theoretical equivalent area Σ=1000 Comparing Substituting the data, we obtain: The diameter of the largest particle in the supernatant will be 14 The separation capacity of the simple settling tank of Now imagine the same transformation of rotation and flipping, which was operated on the settling tank. The resulting configuration is that of a rotating bowl with conical dishes (discs) in it ( Applying the same reasoning as for the tubular centrifuge, an expression can be derived for the maximum flow rate permissible, if all particles with diameter d or larger have to be separated. This expression is given in α=basis angle of the conical dish N=number of dishes. It follows that the theoretical equivalent area Σ of the disc-bowl centrifuge is: The separation of two immiscible liquids that differ in their density is governed by the same principles as the density-driven solid–liquid separation. The continuous discharge of the two phases from the settling tank or the centrifuge, however, requires special consideration. Ideally, separation is complete when a sharp front of separation, or interface, forms between the two liquid phases. The separation front will be in stable equilibrium if the hydrostatic pressures of the two phases at the interface are equal. This requirement determines the location of the interface and hence that of the outlets for the heavy and light phases in the settling tank or the centrifuge. Consider liquid–liquid separation in a gravity settling tank, as shown in Separation of the phases is complete and a sharp interface forms at a distance from the inlet. The condition for hydrostatic equilibrium is given in h=distance from an arbitrary line of reference ρ=density i, H, L=indices for interface, heavy phase, light phase respectively. Now imagine that the line of reference becomes an axis of rotation and the entire system is flipped 90°, so that the axis of rotation becomes vertical. We now have a tubular centrifuge for liquid–liquid separation but, before we can apply the equilibrium condition to the centrifuge, we need an expression for the pressure exerted by a rotating mass of fluid on its envelope, taking into consideration that this pressure is now due to centrifugal forces and not to gravity. Consider a hollow cylinder of liquid and in it an annular element of thickness dr ( The incremental contribution of this element to the pressure is: Integration between r Applying In a given centrifuge, r A basket centrifuge with solid walls, 0.6 The pressure on the wall is given by The inner radius of the annular water mass is calculated from its volume: This is a very high pressure indeed, justifying the strong construction required. Centrifuges may be classified by function or by structure ( This is the simplest type of mechanical centrifuge ( As explained in In centrifuges with a  Therefore, the sludge must be sufficiently thick to provide the controlled flow through the nozzle without completely plugging it. Interchangeable nozzles with different hole diameters serve to adjust the centrifuge according to the solids content of the feed.  Decanter centrifuges have a variety of uses. They are primarily clarifiers, suitable for treating suspensions with very high content of solids (40–60%). Basically, decanter centrifuges consist of a solid-wall horizontal bowl with a cylindrical zone and a conical zone ( The main part of a basket centrifuge consists of a cylindrical chamber spinning rapidly about a vertical, horizontal or inclined axis. If the cylinder has a perforated wall, the centrifuge acts as a filter, with the centrifugal force pushing the liquor through the perforations (see Cyclones ( Essentially, cyclones are centrifugal separators without mechanical moving parts. The field of centrifugal forces is created by the flow pattern of the suspension itself. Due to the tangential direction of the entrance, a rotational movement is imparted to the feed, thus giving rise to centrifugal forces. Under the effect of these forces, the solid particles are accelerated radially in the direction of the wall and they quickly reach their settling velocity. Under the combined effect of the rotational movement and gravity, the particles spiral down to the bottom of the cone and are usually discharged through a rotary valve. The solid-free gas spirals upward and is discharged through the exit pipe. Cyclone efficiency is defined as the mass fraction of solid particles of a given size retained in the cyclone. Obviously, cyclone efficiency is higher for larger particles (
