Single-phase TiC was rapidly synthesized by self-propagation high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction of TiH2–C powder blends without preliminary dehydrogenation. TiH2 resulted in lower ignition temperature, finer TiC particles and lower impurity contents than Ti. In addition, the mechanical properties of bulk TiC material made from TiH2–C were significantly improved. These were closely related to dehydrogenation of TiH2 during the ignition of SHS.Advanced titanium carbide (TiC) possesses many desirable properties such as high hardness and modulus, low density, high melting temperature and excellent corrosion resistance A long annealing time necessary for preliminarily removing the H in TiH The objectives of the present work are to explore the possibility of synthesizing TiC by the SHS reaction from a TiH Commercial powders of TiH Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Model Netzsch 409CD) was used to study the reaction mechanism by heating the powder mixtures to 1300   In order to understand the reaction mechanism, DSC experiments are performed on TiH TiH TiH Ti–C: only an endothermic peak appears at 880 The release of H in TiH The thermodynamic calculation results indicate that the enthalpy at room temperature for the reaction between TiH Merely heating TiH In addition to impurity contents, Single-phase TiC was rapidly synthesized by SHS reaction of TiH
