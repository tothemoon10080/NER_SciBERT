Boron suboxide (B6O) powder was synthesized at temperatures of about 1400°C from the reaction of amorphous boron powder with boric acid. The synthesized B6O powders were hot pressed at temperatures up to 1900°C and at pressures of 50MPa. Additionally to pure B6O materials, composites with aluminium were prepared. The microstructure and properties of the sintered compacts were investigated. The addition of aluminium in the composites results in the formation of an additional aluminium borate phase. The composites showed a similar hardness (∼30GPa) as the pure B6O samples but increased fracture toughness (∼3.5MPam1/2).The first laboratory synthesis of diamond triggered extensive efforts to develop materials with a combination of properties approaching or even improving on those of diamond. The best known of these materials is cubic boron nitride (cBN). It is also known that boron rich compounds provide good candidates for this type of materials. They give rise to a large family of refractory materials with unique crystal structures and a range of interesting physical and chemical properties related to their short interatomic bond lengths and their strong covalent bonds The synthesis of boron suboxide (B Recently, a microhardness of 45 Two types of B To quantify the amount of aluminium on the B The synthesized B The synthesized B The elastic constants of hot pressed pure B The procedure in naming the hot pressed (sintered) B Pure B The coated B The peak at about 2  The elastic constants of the hot pressed B The hardness and the fracture toughness of the materials are given in A laboratory synthesized B We would like to acknowledge Prof. J.
