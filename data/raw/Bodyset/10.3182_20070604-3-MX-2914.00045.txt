The moss Physcomitrella patens has been introduced in the last years as a novel platform for the expression of complex heterologous proteins. For this purpose, strict control of the plant cell culture in bioreactor is required. Recombinant mosses are cultured as filamentous protonemal tissue and therefore, a description of the morphology and development is compulsory. The homogeneity of the biosuspension could be improved in tubular photo bioreactors by means of image analysis supported cell disruption. Algorithms for the quantification of shape parameters and the detection of gametophores have been adapted and evaluated on submerse moss cultures.
