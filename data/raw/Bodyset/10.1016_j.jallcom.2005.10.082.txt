The microstructural characteristics of nanocrystalline W–Cu powder mixture were investigated as functions of annealing temperature. Open pores were observed after an annealing treatment at 300°C, indicating that the pores that had entrapped as-milled powder opened. As the annealing temperature increased, the mean pore size increased and the pore size distribution broadened. The powder mixtures annealed above 500°C showed significant differences in pore size distribution, powder density, and specific surface area. The changes in the powder characteristics were explained by Cu segregation and W grain growth due to the liquid-like behavior of Cu.W–Cu composites have been widely used for heavy-duty electronic contacts and heat sink materials for high-power microelectronic devices because of the high electrical conductivity of Cu and the high arc erosion of W Recently, some attempts have been made to obtain nanocrystalline W–Cu composite powders by high-energy ball milling and hydrogen reduction of ball-milled oxide powders Motivated by an interest in the dependence of the microstructural evolution of W–Cu composite powders on milling time, we investigated the change in pore characteristics of ball-milled powder mixtures The nanocrystalline W–Cu composite powders containing 30 The average crystalline size of ball-milled powders was determined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and the Scherrer formula  The pore size distribution for W–Cu powder mixtures ball-milled for 50  The specific surface area of ball-milled W–Cu powder mixtures as a function of annealing temperature is plotted in To analyze the changes in the powder density and specific surface area with annealing temperature, the SEM morphology of nanocrystalline W–Cu composite powder was observed, as shown in The W crystalline size remained nearly constant up to 600 This work was supported by Hanyang University, Republic of Korea, made in the program year of 2003.
