A new continuum constitutive theory is developed and implemented for study of polycrystalline brittle solids subjected to possibly large stress and finite deformation. The general theory accounts for elastic anisotropy, nonlinear elasticity (via higher-order elastic constants), thermoelastic coupling, and various inelastic deformation mechanisms, including, but not restricted to, fracture, pore crushing, bulking, and stress-induced amorphization. The internal energy function depends on a logarithmic measure of material strain, entropy, and internal state variables accounting for defect accumulation, for example effects of micro-cracks on the tangent stiffness of the solid. The theory is applied towards a study of dynamic compression of boron carbide ceramic. Solutions to a planar impact problem are investigated for isotropic and anisotropic, i.e., textured, polycrystals. For the isotropic case, an implementation of the theory containing only two fitting parameters whereby conjugate thermodynamic forces provide evolution laws for damage and granular flow provides close agreement with Hugoniot data. Poled boron carbide polycrystals shocked along the c-axis are predicted to demonstrate higher peak shear stress, but reduced ductility, relative to isotropic polycrystals. Amorphization associated with nonlinear elastic instability is predicted to occur at smaller volumetric compression in poled boron carbide than its isotropic counterpart, which could further reduce relative ductility and strength of the former.An understanding of the dynamic response of ceramics, rocks, and minerals is of importance to numerous applications in geophysics, mechanical engineering, and structural engineering. For example, models of the high rate response of ceramics are used in design and assessment of protection systems in military/defense applications, and models of the high pressure and impact response of rock are used to describe certain mining operations and to infer information regarding planetary collisions. Systematic experimental studies of the mechanics of such brittle solids subjected to high pressure loading have been undertaken since the middle of the previous century ( A brief discussion of some prior micromechanically inspired macroscale models for brittle polycrystals is given here; a complete review of the vast literature on this subject is outside the scope of the present article. In some cases, a viscoplastic theory is used throughout the analysis to address straining associated with distributions of cracks and voids ( Recent work has evaluated various nonlinear elastic potentials for use in modeling the shock response of strong solids. In This paper is outlined as follows. A new constitutive theory is described in Section A general continuum theory for the nonlinear anisotropic response of brittle materials is described next. The constitutive description accounts for thermoelasticity and inelasticity, significantly extending a model for strong single crystals developed in The motion of material point      Applying the polar decomposition to thermoelastic deformation results in Considered in what follows next are relations for continuous bodies, in the absence of discontinuities; jump conditions associated with shock waves will be considered later. Let It proves useful to formulate constitutive laws in the locally relaxed intermediate configuration of the body which serves as the reference state for instantaneous thermoelastic response ( Denote by Consider an isentropic thermoelastic process ( Henceforth, an internal energy-based theory is implemented for use in shock physics applications. The dependence of internal energy From The general framework of Section Under conditions of impact loading, the framework of Section Regime I, elastic response, effectively no effect of damage on the observed response, material retains its initial anisotropy, if present. Regime II, fracture response, local fractures degrade the effective elastic moduli, material proceeds to lose any initial anisotropy, if present. Regime III, granular response, crack percolation results in comminuted particulate material with fully degraded moduli, material consists of particles of numerous random orientations and is now effectively isotropic. When subjected to impact loadings of increasing longitudinal shock stress The three-regime constitutive model for dynamic compression and failure of brittle solids is based primarily on physical observation rather than pure speculation. The three regimes (elastic, fracturing, and comminuted) shown in The kinematic description of Section Further discussion is in order to clarify the meaning of inelastic deformation terms entering Though not necessary, dimensionless scalar damage measure Porosity The present application focuses on brittle solids in which dislocation motion and twinning deformations are negligible, and for which contributions of dislocation line energy and twin boundary surface energy to thermodynamic potentials do not change under shock loading; such an assumption appears reasonable for brittle boron carbide and quartz, but less so for alumina, for example, since twinning and slip have been observed in the latter ( Consolidating the above simplifying assumptions, the following ansatzes arise: The model invokes one of two transition criteria from Regime I to Regime II at the HEL, where Nominally, Specializing Regime II transitions to Regime III when Consider a material whose physical properties in the ambient state – initial mass density, elastic constants, Grüneisen constant(s), and specific heat – are known from standard measurments. The present model then requires knowledge of the following constants: A solution to the planar impact problem in Regime I, applicable only for shocks parallel to pure mode directions (i.e., no transverse wave propagation), can be obtained analytically following a derivation in A shock wave is treated as a propagating surface across which there may exist jump discontinuities in mass density, particle velocity, strain, stress, entropy, temperature, and internal energy. Considered here are 1-D (i.e, planar or longitudinal) shocks. Quantities associated with material ahead of the shock are labeled with superscript +, behind with superscript In Regime I (no porosity, In Regimes II and III, the material has undergone damage and possible inelastic deformation, and the governing equations and closed-form analytical solution of Section Consider a continuous and initially homogeneous slab of material through which a planar shock (plastic wave) moves, in the For application of the model in Section First consider Regime II, wherein deformation is thermoelastic and Now consider Regime III, wherein deformation is no longer purely thermoelastic. The full decomposition in The constitutive model and planar shock solutions described in Sections Single crystals of boron carbide (nominally B Properties entering the constitutive model are listed in Elastic constants for the anisotropic polycrystal are obtained from consideration of those of the polar CBC polytype ( Essential parameters for evolution of damage (micro-cracking), inelastic deformation, and porosity are obtained as follows. Parameter Model predictions for the fully dense, isotropic polycrystalline material are compared with experimental plate impact data ( Values of volumetric compression, longitudinal stress, and shear stress are listed for reference in Effects of porosity change Model results for anisotropic and isotropic boron carbide polycrystals are compared in Effects of allowing nonlinear elastic (in) stability to influence failure of the material are explored in The model implemented herein for shock compression of isotropic boron carbide includes only two essential fitting parameters: Performance of a ceramic material in applications requiring resistance to dynamic penetration can be quantified by considering the material’s shear strength ( Values of all quantities in Although quantitative validation of the present shock results for the poled ceramic is not possible in the aforementioned absence of data, some comparison can be made with available results of indentation experiments ( Characterization, often via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), of zones of amorphous material in boron carbide– whether induced by static or dynamic indentation ( An expectation that the present polycrystal model with a maximum resolution (minimum element size) on the order of tens of microns could reproduce amorphous zones of nm dimensions observed in experiments would be physically unrealistic. Such an expectation would be analogous to expect a macroscopic (e.g., Mises-type) continuum plasticity model to resolve individual dislocations and stacking faults, or to expect a macroscopic continuum damage mechanics theory (e.g., Quantitative comparisons of model and experiment proceed as follows. For static (isotropic Applying the present theoretical model for nonlinear elasticity with thermodynamic criteria for failure and amorphization of Section Results – experimental and modeling – are compared in The following trends evident from For the isotropic polycrystal, minimum transition stresses For the anisotropic polycrystal, in model results and static indentation experiments, the transition stress is lower for compression along the poling direction than for compression along the transverse direction, i.e., amorphization is more likely for compression along [0 A new constitutive model has been developed to describe the thermomechanical response of brittle solids such as ceramics, rocks, and minerals. Novel features of the present theory include simultaneous consideration of finite deformation, nonlinear anisotropic elasticity, shear-induced dilatation, and possible localization-enhanced failure associated with intrinsic elastic instability. Governing equations and thermodynamic derivations have been framed in the locally relaxed (generally anholonomic) intermediate configuration of the body, which serves as the evolving reference state for instantaneous thermoelastic response. Motivated by thermodynamic arguments, the general framework has been specialized to address elastic–plastic shock loading along pure mode directions. Shock loading takes the material through up to three regimes: elastic (Regime I), fracturing (Regime II), and comminuted/granular flow (Regime III). Emphasis on thermodynamic consistency and simplicity results in a model with a minimum of two fitting parameters associated with degradation of the material’s integrity and shear strength in Regimes II and III. Generalization of the model for solution of problems with more complex boundary conditions, for example as may be approached using finite element methods, remains a priority for future work. The model and its method of solution for planar shocks has been applied to study the dynamic response of polycrystalline boron carbide ceramic. Results for the isotropic material and for a poled anisotropic material (shocked along the axis of transverse isotropy) have been compared. Key results are summarized as follows. The two-parameter model demonstrates close agreement with plate impact data for longitudinal and shear stress in isotropic boron carbide. Incorporation of porosity in Regime III (which requires two additional nonzero parameters) leads to a pressure increase; porosity must remain small (
