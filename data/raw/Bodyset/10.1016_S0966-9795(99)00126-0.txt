The oxidation behaviour of two titanium aluminides of composition Ti–24Al–20Nb and Ti–24Al–27Nb were studied in oxygen in the range 1125–1325 K. The parabolic rate constants of the alloys in the present investigation were higher than that of titanium aluminides of lower Nb content [Ti–24Al–11Nb and Ti–24Al–15Nb (Roy TK, Balasubramaniam R, Ghosh A. Metall Mater Trans A 1996;27A:3993)]. The major constituent of the oxides was TiO2 while Nb2O5 and Al2O3 were the minor constituents. The formation of Nb2O5 as a separate phase is possibly related to the lower oxidation resistance of these alloys compared to titanium aluminides of lower Nb content.Titanium aluminides like Ti The Ti–24Al–20Nb and Ti–24Al–27Nb alloys were provided by the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory, Hyderabad, India as 15 On visual observation, the oxide scale exhibited layers with different colours. The oxide scale remained in contact with the substrate as long as it was in the furnace. However, soon after the samples (treated at 1225 K and above for 140 ks) were taken out of the furnace, part of the scale spalled off due to differential thermal contraction of the oxide and alloy substrate. A few weight gain versus time curves are presented in Using the Arrhenius equation It is known that high-temperature oxidation of ternary intermetallics is a complex process Variation of  Possible explanations for the decrease in oxidation resistance at high Nb content are addressed. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed that TiO The oxidation behaviour of Ti–24Al–20Nb and Ti–24Al–27Nb alloys in oxygen was studied in the range 1125–1325 K.
