This study proposes a tower inlet cover to improve the performance of the small natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT) under crosswind conditions. CFD analyses are performed on a small NDDCT with tower inlet covers of different lengths, and the CFD model is validated against experimental results. The air temperature, air pressure, air flow and heat flux fields are presented, and the thermal performance for each heat exchanger and the NDDCT are obtained using CFD simulations. The CFD simulation results show that the high-pressure zone around the tower side wall, formed by the crosswind, causes the decrease in air flow through the tower and the deterioration in tower performance with a crosswind. The tower inlet cover can improve the tower performance in crosswinds by increasing the air flow of the heat exchangers. Tower inlet covers with lengths of 1.5 m, 3 m and 4.5 m improve the tower heat load by 40–65%, 70–130% and 85–230%, respectively, when the crosswind increases from 4 m/s to 12 m/s.surface area of numerical cell (m constant inertial resistance factor constants in turbulent equations specific heat (J kg coefficient in turbulent viscosity source term for momentum equations turbulent kinetic energy source term due to buoyancy turbulent kinetic energy source term due to mean velocity gradients height (m) convective heat transfer coefficient (W m laminar, effective, turbulent thermal conductivity respectively (W m pressure loss coefficient turbulent kinetic energy (m natural draft dry cooling tower natural draft wet cooling tower Nusselt number laminar, turbulent Prandtl number, respectively (m) pressure (Pa) heat transfer rate (kW) heat flux (kW m modulus of the mean rate-of-strain tensor volumetric source term for variable quantity temperature (K) velocity components in x-, y-, z-direction (m s numerical cell volume (m velocity scalar (m s Cartesian co-ordinates permeability (m bulk thermal expansion coefficient (K turbulent kinetic energy dissipation (m scalar quantity ( diffusion coefficient for variable quantity density, mean density (kg m laminar, effective, turbulent viscosity, respectively (kg m turbulent Prandtl number for  crosswind condition dry cooling tower pure natural convection case radiator reference value inside or inlet, outside or outlet Cooling towers are commonly used in large thermal systems, such as industrial power generation units, refrigeration and air conditioning plants, chemical and petrochemical industries to dissipate process heat. Different types of cooling towers are distinguished from each other by different criteria. Cooling tower is either mechanical draft type or natural draft type based on the method used to move the air through the system For the mechanical draft cooling tower, many researchers have investigated the improvement method of its performance. Lemouari et al. Based on the different ways of heat transfer, the natural draft cooling tower could be divided into the natural draft wet cooling tower (NDWCT) and the natural draft dry cooling tower (NDDCT). In a NDWCT, heat is mainly transferred by latent heat transfer through water, which improves the performance of the cooling water system Although the NDDCT is the competitive option for a power plant located in arid places, it still faces two considerable challenges; specifically, the hot ambient temperature and crosswinds both have negative effects on cooling performance Small NDDCTs suffer more from crosswind impact than large NDDCTs. Lu et al. In this study, an inlet cover is proposed to improve the performance of small NDDCTs in crosswinds. CFD analyses of a small NDDCT with tower inlet covers of different lengths were performed. The CFD results presented in this paper provide guidance for small NDDCT design in the future. The commercial software Ansys/Fluent 15.0 The expressions of ϕ, Г The small NDDCT used by Li et al. The ‘ground’ in the CFD domain, the ‘wall’ in the tower and the tower inlet cover are set as the non-slip and zero heat flux ‘wall’ boundary. The top and leeward side of the domain is set as the ‘pressure outlet’ boundary. The inlet air temperature is set to the NDDCT’s design air temperature (303.15 K) Several ways of modelling heat exchangers in CFD can be found in open literature. The radiator model in Ansys/Fluent is used to calculate the performance of the air-cooled heat exchanger of the cooling tower where the heat transfer coefficient, For air flow pressure drop, the radiator model can simulate resistance to air flow in the direction normal to radiator face. However, it does not provide resistance in other two directions, i.e. velocity components parallel to radiator face. This will cause overestimation of the possibility of vertices occurring near the radiator, since real structure of fin tube heat exchanger bundles can prevent horizontal air flow, allowing air flow through heat exchanger only vertically. Therefore a porous media model is added to represent the pressure loss within the heat exchanger, leaving the radiator model to represent heat transfer only All 18 heat exchanger bundles are horizontally arranged inside the NDDCT The cooling tower and the heat exchanger bundles are discretised by the structured hexahedron mesh, adopting the ANSYS meshing sweep method. The mesh of the computation domain area is generated using the ANSYS meshing multi-zone method Lu et al. The mean tower outlet air velocity (v Lu et al. The CFD method used in this paper is also validated based on the full-scale tests on the same cooling tower Due to the central symmetry of configurations of heat exchangers and the NDDCT, the temperature, pressure, flow and heat flux fields exhibit central symmetry characteristics in the absence of a crosswind, as shown in         For heat exchanger #4 on the tower windward side, the sudden decrease of the air flow and heat flux under 2 m/s crosswind condition is because of the sudden appearance of the vortex at the bottom of the tower under crosswind conditions. With the increase of the crosswind, the direction of air flow reverses due to the vortex at the bottom of the tower; the air flow and heat flux increase as the crosswind increases from 4 m/s to 12 m/s. This is due to the growing impact of the vortex at the bottom of the tower with the increasing crosswind ( For heat exchangers #5, 6, 9 and 10, air flow and heat flux rise to their maximum values as the crosswind increases from 0 m/s to 4 m/s; the air flow and heat flux decease to their minimum values as the crosswind increases from 4 m/s to 8 m/s; and the air flow and heat flux again increase when the crosswind increases from 8 m/s to 12 m/s. For heat exchangers #7, 8, 11 and 12 arranged at the tower centre, the air flow and heat flux decrease continuously as the crosswind increases from 0 m/s to 6 m/s, and the air flow and heat flux remain approximately stable as the crosswind increases from 6 m/s to 12 m/s. For heat exchanges #13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 arranged on the tower windward side, the air flow and heat flux both decrease as the crosswind increases from 0 m/s to 2 m/s; and the vortex at the bottom of the tower reverses air flow direction as the crosswind increases from 2 m/s to 12 m/s, causing the air flow and heat flux to increase.   The tower performance with different crosswinds and different tower inlet covers is shown in Crosswind creates a high-pressure zone, which pushes the air at the NDDCT side wall into the tower inlet. This crosswind acts as a lid, making it difficult for air to enter the heat exchangers on the tower windward side because of the inertia effect even though the tower draft continues to suck air in. A negative pressure zone forms under the heat exchangers on the tower windward side, and a vortex forms at the bottom of the tower, leading to a decrease in air flow through the heat exchangers and a deterioration in tower performance. The tower inlet cover prevents the majority of the crosswind around the tower side wall from entering the tower inlet, reducing the negative impact of the high-pressure zone around the tower side wall on the tower performance. The air flow at the heat exchangers is increased, which significantly improves the heat flux of the heat exchangers except for those on the tower windward side. The thermal performance of the tower is also improved. When the crosswind increases from 4 m/s to 12 m/s, the 1.5 m tower inlet cover improves the tower heat load by 40–65%. The 3 m tower inlet cover improves the tower heat load by 70–130%, and the 4.5 m tower inlet cover improves the tower heat load by 85–230%. When the tower inlet cover length is 4.5 m, crosswind is no longer a factor leading to a deterioration in tower performance; in contrast, the cover increases the tower heat load and air flow considerably under crosswind conditions.
