Effects of various factors on zeta potential of air bubbles in aqueous solution were studied. It was found that the water pH, surfactants types and concentration, and water temperature had significant roles on the zeta potential of air bubbles. Increase of the water pH caused a great decrease (more negative) of the zeta potential of air bubbles. The types and concentration of surfactants were found not only affecting the intensity of the zeta potential but also determining the nature of bubble surface charges. In addition, the water temperature was also found have an obvious effect on the zeta potential of air bubbles.
