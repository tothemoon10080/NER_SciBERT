In heap bioleaching, metal is dissolved from ore by a percolating solution, catalysed by naturally occurring bacteria. Increased interest in the technology motivated the development of accurate models of such process in recent years. In contrast, the utilisation of such models for control has received limited attention, given their high mathematical complexity. This paper presents a low complexity model aimed as the basis for control design. The model parameters are estimated using least squares on data generated by a high complexity, experimentally validated model provided by BHP Billiton Innovation. Simulation results indicate significant potential of the approach.
