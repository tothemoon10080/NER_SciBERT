Abstract
                  Commercial Al-3Ti-1C and Al-5Ti-1B master alloys were added in order to refine the grains of Mg-Li-Al alloys. The effects of their addition levels on grain refinement of Mg-Li-Al cast alloy were investigated and the mechanism of the grain refinement was discussed. The results showed that the addition of Al-3Ti-1C master alloy reduced the grain size of LA141 cast alloy from 900 μm to 400 μm, while the addition of Al-5Ti-1B master alloy reduced the grain size of LA51 cast alloy from 500 μm to 240 μm. The grain refining mechanism was the heterogeneity nucleation of TiC and TiB2, because of less than 10% mismatches of TiC/β-Li and TiB2/α-Mg.Mg-Li alloy is one of the lightest magnesium alloys. It has lower Mg-Li alloy is chemically active, and so far, the cast ingot is often prepared by common mould casting because of no usable continuous casting equipment. Therefore, the Mg-Li alloy cast ingot has the large grain size, which will decrease its plasticity and strength. The addition of Al or Zn with higher level [ In this work, in order to develop new available master alloys to refine full BCC structure LA141 alloy and full HCP structure LA53 alloy, commercial Al-3Ti-1C and Al-5Ti-1B master alloys are added into LA141 and LA53, respectively. The microstructures are characterized by optical observation and the mechanism of grain refinement is discussed in detail. The alloys used in this work were commercial LA141 (13.5% Li, 1.2% Al and balance Mg, mass fraction) and LA53 (5.1% Li, 2.8% Al and balance Mg) alloys prepared in induction furnace under argon atmosphere. Al-5Ti-1B and Al-3Ti-1C master alloys were commercial. The alloys were melted in an induction furnace under argon atmosphere. Before being melted, the alloy was placed into a mild steel crucible together with the corresponding master alloy. Al-3Ti-1C was added into the LA141 alloy with the levels of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%, while 1.5% Al-5Ti-1B was added for LA53 alloy. After the alloy was melted, it was held at 650 °C for 10 min and then the alloy melt was put out from the crucible by means of argon drive and poured into a ferrous mould. For comparison, LA141 and LA53 alloys without master alloy were prepared under the same conditions. Each of the samples for optical observation was cut at the same position. These samples were ground, polished and then etched. The grains of each sample were examined using optical microscopy, and the average grain size at the centre of each sample was measured using the linear intercept method. The optical microstructures of the LA141 alloys without and with the additions of Al-3Ti-1C master alloy are shown in  The grain refinements of LA141 and LA53 were caused by the addition of Al-3Ti-1C or Al-5Ti-1B master on LA141 alloy. Meanwhile, according to the previous study [ When the addition of Al-3Ti-1C or Al-5Ti-1B was 1.5%, the content of Al in Al-3Ti-1C or Al-5Ti-1B was 1.2%-1.3%. In order to further clarify whether the content of Al in Al-3Ti-1C or Al-5Ti-1B has an effect on grain refinement of LA141 or LA53, the grain sizes of LA141 cast alloy without and with 1.2% Al addition were observed and compared, as shown in According to XRD PDF data [ Therefore, there are nine pairs of the potential matching planes of TiC/β-Li and TiB The close or near close packed atom rows in these matching planes can be found by simulating the atom arrangement. In the {110} Therefore, there are some crystallography orientation relationships (ORs) between β-Li and TiC and between α-Mg and TiB  Al-3Ti-1C master alloy is an effective grain refiner for the LA141 cast alloy with full BCC structure, and Al-5Ti-1B master alloy for LA53 cast alloy with full HCP structure as well. With the increase of the addition of Al-3Ti-1C master alloy, the grain size of LA141 cast alloy is reduced obviously, and the smallest grain size is 400 μm when the addition of Al-3Ti-1C master alloy is 1.5%. The grain size of LA53 cast alloy is reduced to 240 μm when the addition of Al-5Ti-1B master alloy is 1.5%. The Al content in the Al-3Ti-1C and Al-5Ti-1B master alloys has basically no grain refinement effect on β-Li and α-Mg matrix. The mechanism of grain refinement of LA141 and LA53 cast alloys is mainly heterogeneous nucleation effect of TiC and TiB
