In this work, a new class of mesoporous and sponge-like TUD-1 materials have been explored as the support matrix for immobilizing a functional polymer, polyethylenimine (PEI), to prepare molecular basket sorbents (MBS) for CO2 capture. The performance of TUD-1 based MBS has been evaluated in a fixed-bed flow system using a simulated flue gas. Effects of the pore properties, PEI loading amount and moisture on the sorption capacity were examined. Compared to the well-known SBA-15, the TUD-1 based nano-porous MBS showed not only a comparable gravimetric capacity (∼115mg-CO2/g-sorb), but also a significantly higher volumetric capacity (as high as 68mg-CO2/mL-sorb). Both the pore volume and pore size play a crucial role in determining the CO2 sorption capacity of the TUD-1 based MBS. Furthermore, the TUD-1 supported PEI samples exhibited faster CO2 sorption kinetics than SBA-15 based MBS, due likely to the improved CO2 diffusion constant which was estimated by Parabolic diffusion equation. The highest CO2 sorption capacity of 116mg-CO2/g-sorb was obtained with PEI loading of 50wt% at 75°C under dry conditions, which was further enhanced to 130mg-CO2/g-sorb in the presence of moisture (3vol%). The PEI/TUD-1 sorbent was tested for 45 sorption–desorption cycles, showing a good regenerability and cyclic stability. Because of its high CO2 sorption performance and commercial availability of the support, the TUD-1 based MBS could be promising for cost-effective capture of CO2 from flue gas.In the past few decades, the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere has rapidly increased due to anthropogenic CO In the recent years, many approaches including solid adsorption, liquid absorption with various new solvents, and membrane technologies have been explored and studied for CO In our previous studies, we have developed a series of novel solid sorbents called “molecular basket” sorbents (MBS) The objective of this study is to explore the use of commercially available TUD-1 mesoporous materials as a support of polymeric sorbents for CO Various TUD-1 mesoporous samples were supplied by the Lummus Technology and used as received for preparation of PEI/TUD-1 samples. The detailed pore properties of these TUD-1 samples were provided by the Lummus Technology and are listed in The PEI/TUD-1 samples were prepared by a wet impregnation method. Typically, about 4 A fixed-bed flow sorption system with gas flow controllers, sorption column, and an online gas chromatograph with TCD was built for evaluation of the sorbents. The sorption column consisted of a glass tube (50 The thermal stability of TUD-1 and PEI/TUD-1 samples was examined by using a TA Q600-SDT TGA-DSC thermal gravimeter. About 10 A series of TUD-1 based MBS samples were prepared by using different TUD-1 samples with 50 Over TUD-1(3A), TUD-1(3B), TUD-1(3C) based MBS samples ( It should also be highlighted that with the use of TUD-1 material as the support, a much higher packing density, mostly around 0.5–0.6  As shown above, the measured CO  Besides the sorption capacity, the sorption rate is another crucial parameter for practical applications, as it controls the cycle time for the CO In order to understand the faster sorption kinetics of TUD-1 based MBS over SBA-15 based MBS, the apparent diffusion constant was estimated by Parabolic diffusion equation, which is often used to indicate the diffusion-controlled phenomena and describe the kinetics of adsorption and desorption of ions in clay minerals and soils Over 50PEI1800/SBA-15, the calculated apparent diffusion constant was 1.38 In the supported amine sorbents, the accessible amine groups of PEI play an important role in CO Beside the sorption capacity, it is known that the cost is another important parameter determining the economic feasibility of a sorbent material for practical applications. It was reported that the cost of the supporting material of the amine-based sorbent counts for a large percentage of the total cost (70–90%) To assess the accessible amine sites, the amine efficiency which is defined as a molar ratio of the sorbed CO To confirm the change of CO It is important to identify the effect of moisture on the CO The breakthrough curves for CO Besides the high CO The thermal stability of PEI/TUD-1(29A) sorbents with different PEI loading amounts was also examined by TGA. TUD-1, a new class of mesoporous materials with high thermal and hydrothermal stability, three-dimensional sponge-like structure of random interconnecting pores and high surface area have been explored as the support of molecular basket sorbents for CO The PEI loading amount on TUD-1 support was optimized as 50 The current study shows that the TUD-1 materials are feasible to serve as potential supporting matrix of MBS for CO The authors gratefully acknowledge the partial financial support from the
