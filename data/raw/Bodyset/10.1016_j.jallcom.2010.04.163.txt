Maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) nano-particles were produced by an innovative one-step method at room temperature and characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunaure–Emmet–Teller analysis (BET), infrared spectrum (IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectra (EDS), and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). The average particle size of the maghemite was estimated to be 45 and 57nm, by SEM and PCS, respectively. The SEM image showed that the γ-Fe2O3 nano-particles were of approximately spherical shape and a size below 50nm.Nano-particles have become the focus of modern materials science because of their potential technological importance, which stems from their unique physical properties The synthesis procedure was as follows: FeCl The crystalline structure of the nano-particles was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, PHILIPS, X’ pert-MPD system) using Cu Kα ( X-ray diffraction patterns of a representative sample produced material are presented in where SEM image of γ-Fe The surfaces of γ-Fe A qualitative ranking of the magnetic susceptibility of the maghemite nano-particles has been demonstrated in a simple laboratory setup with a hand-held magnet as shown in From the results of this study, it can be pointed out that applying this innovative single step, wet chemical method, pure γ-Fe
