 The objectives in In Thus, for civil engineering, the rock only needs to be broken up sufficiently for the underground space to be created and for the rock to be removed. For mining engineering, the rock itself is required and the process of excavation is the first stage of comminution. For petroleum engineering, the main issues are drilling and maintaining open boreholes, and maximizing oil flow into the wellbores. This leads to different design approaches for civil and mining engineering, and special problems for petroleum engineering in weak rocks and at significant depths. The geometry of a civil engineering excavation is usually clearly defined and subject to definite constraints. There has to be a clear design with a  Rock can be excavated by explosives or by machines. With explosives ( Using a machine for excavation, say a bulldozer with a ripping attachment or a partial face or full-face tunnel boring machine (       The load at failure (b) To establish for how long a domestic 100-W light bulb has to be illuminated in order to expend the same amount of energy, we need to Notice that if the compression test is conducted at a strain rate of 5 (c) The specific energy is the energy required to pulverize the rock/unit volume   The difference in the specific energies calculated in A15.1 and in this answer, results from the losses that are incurred in blasting. In the compression test, we anticipate that most of the energy used for the test will be absorbed in specimen degradation but, in any case, the energy actually absorbed by the specimen was used for the calculation, i.e. the energy represented by the area beneath the complete stress–strain curve. For the blasting calculation, the total energy was used, and much of this energy will be lost in the form of gas pressure and stress wave dissipation.       The volume of rock cut by the TBM during the 1-m advance is 1 (ii) The calculation of specific energy should also include the component supplied by the TBM thrust, which we now include. At the new cutting rate, the same calculation procedure as above gives the specific energy due to the cutting torque as 10.19 (b) From the figures in the answer above, the energy input via the thrust is only 0.14/10.33      We would not have expected the specific energy for the three cases to be the same because different rock types and different systems of fracture development are involved. Thus, the term ‘specific energy’ should be suitably qualified to indicate the configuration and scale under which it is determined (which is similar to the tensile strength discussed in A6.9).          the blastholes must be parallel and locally coplanar in order to form a plane; the blastholes should be closely spaced (distance between them should not be more than 10 the blastholes should be lightly charged and the charges decoupled from the blasthole wall in order to avoid pulverizing the rock around the boreholes and to maximize the gas pressure effect; and the blastholes should be detonated simultaneously in order to maximize borehole interactions. If these requirements are followed, the pre-split blasting will usually be successful: in fact, the technique is remarkably robust and a successful pre-split face can be achieved even under difficult conditions. (b)         However, we need this energy value in terms of cubic metres of rock, rather than the unit mass of rock. Because the SGI value is 10 and we know that SGI This value is much lower than the 12.2 (b) The However, this                Strength Resistance to fracturing ( Sturdiness ( Elasticity ( Resistance to dynamic loading ( Hardness ( Deformability ( Resistance to breaking (  Fragility ( Integrity ( In their article, Latham and Lu Ping (1999) point out that their work is related to “uncontrollable factors governed by Note that parameters 3, 4, 5 and 7 are intact rock properties not directly related to failure, but are included because they characterize the quality of the rock. Parameter 6 is more strongly correlated with the failure properties, and parameters 1, 2 and 8 are direct measurements of rock strength. In terms of the pre-existing fracturing in the rock mass, parameters 9, 10 and 11 are indicators of the degree of fracturing present in the rock mass, but the only parameter explicitly representing the fracture failure properties is parameter 12, the Mohr–Coulomb values. In their article, Latham and Lu mention that “one can include more, such as the discontinuity orientation related to the face to be blasted…water content in the rock mass, joint aperture and various other parameters”. Let us consider then whether the following subjects — already discussed in this book — should be included in the The art in applying the engineering rock mechanics principles to rock engineering is to adopt a pragmatic approach by successfully capturing the essence of the problem without introducing unnecessary complications. The authors of the article have successfully achieved this.        The machine needs periods for scheduled maintenance, cutter replacements and repair. As time goes on, the cumulative effect will be to reduce the value of If the rock needs supporting, it may be necessary to stop the machine to allow roof and sidewall rock bolting and shotcreting to take place.  If a hard rock machine encounters water-bearing fractures, these will also cause delays. Moreover, the further one tunnels, the greater is the chance of encountering a fracture discharging more water than any previously intersected. ‘Unexpected events’ such as power cuts, broken conveyors, derailments and strikes by the work force will also contribute to a lowering of the    The three effects will always occur. Therefore, there will always be an EDZ around an excavation. The amount by which this zone of inevitable disturbance is further enlarged will depend on the excavation method. Thus, there is both an initial Two of the effects depend on the size of the excavation. Other factors remaining the same, the inward rock movement does depend on the excavation size: if the size is doubled, the magnitude of the inward rock movement will also tend to be doubled. Also, larger excavations in the same host rock will have larger amounts of water inflow. However,      Drill and blast excavation rates (using customary equipment, methods and materials) are unlikely to be significantly increased, because after decades of use the drill and blast technique has already been optimized. Given the cyclical nature of the drill and blast process, significant improvements are unlikely. In principle, TBM New methods of excavation are not likely to be introduced in practice. There has been considerable research over the years into alternative methods of fragmenting and removing the rock and, whilst many of these methods (e.g. flame cutting, electrical and magnetic disintegration, nuclear techniques) have advantages, they also have significant practical disadvantages. The increasing demands on surface space, greater environmental awareness, and the technical and safety-related advantages of using underground excavations have led to considerable use of underground space for civil engineering purposes as evidenced by the list below. Civil and military defence, nuclear shelters, aircraft hangers, emergency centres Conventional and nuclear power stations District heating Drinking water transportation and storage Dry docks Hot water storage Hydroelectric projects Living quarters Radioactive waste storage and disposal Rail transport and stations Refuse management and incineration Research facilities, particle accelerators, wind tunnels Road tunnels Shopping malls Sports, concert, theatre, religious and museum halls Storage of food, drink, documents, aggregates, minerals Storing petroleum products Storm water drainage and storage Waste water management and treatment plants There will be increasing underground excavation in the years ahead to supply society with further civil and mineral resources. The maximal excavation size depends on the type of rock mass. In this chapter, we have highlighted some of the key issues relating to the excavation of rock. The questions have tended to be descriptive and relatively simple in order to illustrate the principles. In engineering circumstances, rock excavation is a complex rock fragmentation process, highly dependent on the nature of the rock mass and the engineering techniques utilized. It is also critical to assess the excavatability of a rock mass and to tailor the excavation technique to the circumstances and the engineering objective. For example, if a TBM is purchased and subsequently found to be inadequate, a large amount of time and money may be lost. The complexity of the process is such that a great deal of work is still required in this field, involving a combination of theoretical, empirical and pragmatic approaches, all of which are enhanced by a thorough understanding of rock mechanics principles.
