Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)/hydroxyapatite(50/50) (PLGA/HA(50/50)) composite microspheres were fabricated and treated with a mixture of 0.25M NaOH aqueous solution and ethanol (v/v=1/1) at 37°C. The properties of untreated and treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were determined and compared. The results showed that the surface roughness, HA content and hydrophilicity of the treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres increased with treatment time. However, the treatment time should be kept within 2h in order to maintain the shape of the PLGA/HA(50/50) microspheres. At the same time, a degradation study showed that both the untreated and treated microspheres degraded gradually with time, with the treated microspheres degrading faster in the first 4weeks. The rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were prepared by solution dipping treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres. Mouse OCT-1 osteoblast-like cells were cultured on the untreated, treated and rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres and the cell affinity of the various microspheres was assessed and compared. It was found that the surface-treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres clearly promoted osteoblast attachment, proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity. It was considered that the hydrophilicity, osteoconductivity and surface roughness were increased by the increase in the HA component, which facilitated cell growth. Moreover, the rhBMP-2 loaded on the treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres could be slowly released and further enhanced osteoblast differentiation. The good cell affinity and enhanced osteogenic potential of the rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA composite microspheres indicate that they could be used as an injectable scaffold.Bone grafts, including autografts, allografts and xenografts, have been widely used for repairing bone defects originated from trauma, tumor resection, bone fractures, infections and skeletal abnormities Recently, the development of scaffolds for tissue engineering has focused on the design and fabrication of biomimetic scaffold materials that can interact with surrounding tissues by biomolecular recognition. Biomimetic material is designed to elicit specific cellular responses and directly form new tissue through some specific interaction. Hydroxyapatite (HA) (Ca Much attention has also been paid recently to composites of HA and synthetic polylactone-type biodegradable polymers, such as poly( Most polylactone/HA composite scaffolds have been fabricated into films, rods, plates, blocks and foam by the solvent evaporation method On the other hand, although it has been reported that HA can enhance osteoblast growth and differentiation, whether HA can induce bone formation by itself it still a matter of contention. Ono et al. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent bone inductors, which control osteogenesis. They play a crucial role in cell growth and differentiation in a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts The aim of this study was to develop a BMP-2-loaded polylactone/HA composite microsphere-type scaffold as an injectable bone tissue engineering scaffold. First, the PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were treated with a mixture of NaOH aqueous solution and ethanol. The morphology and properties of the treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and water uptake. At the same time, the degradation of untreated and treated microspheres was studied and compared. The treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were also combined with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Finally, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of cells on the rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were evaluated and compared with that on untreated PLGA/HA(50/50) and treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres using the mouse OCT-1 osteoblast-like cell as a model cell in vitro. Glycolide and lactide were purchased from Acros Chemica, N.V. and purified twice by recrystallization from ethyl acetate. Stannous octoate (Sigma, A.R.) was used without further purification. Ethyl acetate was dried by P PLGA (molar ratio of lactide/glycolide PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were fabricated by an emulsion–solvent evaporation method. Briefly, 200 In accordance with the previously reported method The untreated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres, and the PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres treated with the mixture of 0.25 After various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were dried and sputter-coated with gold, their surface morphology them was observed by SEM (Hitachi S-530, Japan) under an accelerating voltage of 5.0 The surface element content of the various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres was examined by EDS (Phoenix, USA). After various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were immersed in distilled water for 72 The weight-average molecular weight ( For the degradation study, 40.0 The molecular weight of PLGA in the degraded microspheres was measured by GPC. A 5 The rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were abbreviated as T2-PLGA/HA/BMP. A 10.0 OCT-1 osteoblast-like cells were derived from osteocalcin promoter-driven SV-40 T-antigen transgenic mouse calvarias For cell culture, 10.0 After OCT-1 cells had been cultured for 7 and 14 The distribution of OCT-1 cells on the various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres was observed after cell culture for 7 After the OCT-1 cells had been seeded on various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres and incubated for 6 Cell proliferation was similarly determined by counting the number of cells on various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres after culture for 1, 4 and 7 After OCT-1 cells had been cultured on various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres for 1, 4 and 7 PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres with OCT-1 cells were collected from the flask at various culture time intervals (3, 7, 10 and 14 ALP activity was determined by using disodium phenyl phosphate as the substrate at pH 10. Each reaction was initiated with disodium phenyl phosphate and allowed to proceed for 15 The data were expressed as means The surface topography structure of the PLGA/HA (50/50) composite microspheres before and after the alkali treatment was observed by SEM and are shown in The surface element content of the PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres before and after treatment was examined by EDS, as shown in The hydrophilicity of various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres was determined by water uptake, as shown in The effect of alkaline treatment time on the molecular weight of the PLGA component of PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres was examined by GPC, as shown in Mass loss of UT-PLGA/HA and T2-PLGA/HA, and of the molecular weight of the PLGA component in both of them, during degradation in vitro were measured and are summarized in T2-PLGA/HA possesses several advantages for loading rhBMP-2. First, the improved hydrophilicity of the treated PLGA/HA composite microspheres can permit more rhBMP-2 water solution to be completely absorbed and diffused into the microspheres, which would ensure that rhBMP-2 is evenly dispersed on the microspheres. Secondly, the richer HA on the surface of the treated microspheres has an inherent capacity to bind rhBM-2, because HA has a high binding affinity for proteins OCT-1 osteoblast-like cell was used as a model cell to be cultured on the UT-PLGA/HA, T1-PLGA/HA, T2-PLGA/HA and T2-PLGA/HA/BMP in vitro. The cell affinity of the four kinds of microspheres was identified and compared by measuring cell attachment, proliferation, morphology, distribution and expression of differentiated osteoblastic function (ALP) on the microspheres. The attachment efficiency of OCT-1 cells on various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres after 6 The OCT-1 cell numbers on various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres after cultured for different time are compared in The viability of OCT-1 cells on the various PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres was determined by MTT assay, which measured the activity of mitochondria dehydrogenase of living cells after culturing for 1, 4 and 7 The CLSM observation further confirmed the existence of viable OCT-1 cells on the surface of PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres after incubating for 7 The SEM photographs of OCT-1 cells incubated on the four kinds of PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres for 7 Connecting the results of the cell distribution and morphological observations with the results of the cell attachment, proliferation and viability revealed that the treated PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres were more favorable for OCT-1 cell attachment and growth than the UT-PLGA/HA. Moreover, cell attachment and growth on T2-PLGA/HA and T2-PLGA/HA/BMP were better than T1-PLGA/HA. It is considered that the improved cell attachment and growth by alkali treatment could be explained from two aspects – the surface topography and surface chemistry of the PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres. The surface topography may be an important factor affecting cell attachment and growth, with a rough surface being more favorable for cell attachment and growth The differentiated function of OCT-1 cells was evaluated by monitoring the ALP activity of the cells. ALP is a marker enzyme of OCT-1 cells and probably involves a mineralization process. As shown in High-magnification SEM micrographs of OCT-1 cells cultured for 2 Alkali treatment is an effective way to modify the surface of PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres. With increasing treatment time, the HA content of the surface, the roughness and the hydrophilicity of the PLGA/HA(50/50) microspheres all gradually increased. For the PLGA/HA(50/50) composite microspheres to maintain their regular shape, the alkali treatment time should be limited to within 2 rhBMP-2 could be loaded on the T2-PLGA/HA by a simple solution dipping method. The loaded rhBMP-2 could be slowly released from the T2-PLGA/HA/BMP in vitro and enhanced the differentiation of osteoblasts on the composite microspheres. rhBMP-2-loaded PLGA/HA composite microspheres, possessing good cell affinity and osteogenic potential, would make promising injectable scaffolds.
