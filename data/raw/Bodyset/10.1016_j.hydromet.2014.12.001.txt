Despite the success of reductive atmospheric acid leaching (RAAL) of limonitic nickel laterite ores in recent studies limited attempt has been made to apply this method to smectite/nontronite ores of different mineralogies. A comparative study of four smectite/nontronite ores in this study showed that the use of 700kgH2SO4/ton dry ore leaches only 74–86% Ni, 37–76% Co, 47–58% Fe and 24–66% Mn at 90°C from slurries of 20–35% (w/w) pulp density even after 10h, depending upon the mineralogy. These values increased to 90–97% Ni, 94–97% Co, 92–98% Mn and 72–85% Fe in the presence of Cu(II)/SO2. The first order dependence of initial fraction of iron, aluminium and nickel leached from a typical smectite ore in the first 0.5h on the initial acid concentration provides evidence for the involvement of hydrogen ions in the surface reaction. Low activation energy of 10kJ/mol based on the fraction of nickel leached in the first 0.5h indicates a diffusion controlled reaction. This is supported by the applicability of a shrinking core kinetic model for metal dissolution over the first 2h, with different apparent rate constants (kap) depending upon the iron oxide content, mineralogy and porosity. A log–log plot of kap for ores with high iron content as a function of acid concentration agrees reasonably well with the correlation already established for the leaching of nickel from limonitic laterite and manganese nodules. Thus, initial fast leaching can be related to the higher porosity and a rate controlling step which involves the diffusion of H+ through a thickening solid layer. The slow leaching at latter stages is a result of low remnant acid, thickening solid layer and changes in mineral composition.Processing of lateritic nickel ore through high pressure acid leaching (HPAL) is an established technology proven for extracting nickel from various lateritic ore bodies ( Studies have been reported on SO Although the oxidation of SO As shown in Nontronite is the iron(III) rich member of the smectite group of clay minerals with typical chemical composition of more than ~ The AAL system for nickel leaching from smectite ore was slow and less efficient due to the fact that the nickel was found mainly in the crystal structure of goethite (α-FeOOH), serpentine ((Mg,Al,Fe,Mn,Ni) Three smectite lateritic nickel ores from different mining locations in Western Australia identified as A, B, and C were used in this investigation for the purpose of comparing and contrasting the results with D ( Leaching experiments were carried out in a 2 A required amount of de-ionised (DI) water and sulphuric acid was transferred to the reactor and placed in the oil bath. Once the test temperature was attained inside the reactor, a calculated amount of dry ore was added.
