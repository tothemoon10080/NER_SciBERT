The paper presents a procedure of the determination of the fatigue energy characteristic diagram by using a controlled strain energy parameter which can be an alternative to the well-known stress and strain fatigue curves description of structural materials. The work contains the results of fatigue tests carried out in accordance with the procedure shown in the paper. Obtained test results were presented on diagrams and critically discussed.
