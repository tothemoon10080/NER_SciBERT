Homogeneous (unseeded) precipitation of magnesium carbonate hydrates by the reaction of MgCl2 with Na2CO3 in supersaturated solutions between 273 and 363 K was investigated. The compositions, morphologies and filtration characteristics of the precipitates were studied in detail. The magnesium carbonate hydrates obtained at 313 K and in the range of 343-363 K showed good morphologies and filtration characteristics. Magnesium oxides (MgO) with high purity (97.6%-99.4%) were obtained by calcining magnesium carbonate hydrates at 1073 K.
