On the basis of minimum entropy generation principle, a new formulation of the boundary value problems is proposed. Applying Euler–Lagrange variational formalism, a new mathematical form of heat conduction equation with additional heat source terms has been derived. To obtain a unique solution a special mathematical form of boundary conditions for 2D and 3D problems is required. As a result, entropy generation rate of the process can significantly be reduced, which leads to the decrease of the irreversibility ratio according to the Gouy–Stodola theorem. Minimization of entropy generation in heat conduction process is always possible by introducing additional heat sources.heat conduction coefficient (W/mK) heat flux (W/m intensity of internal heat source (W/m entropy flux (W/m entropy generation due to the process irreversibility (W/m absolute temperature (K) Cartesian coordinates ( local intensity of entropy generation rate (W/m global and global minimized intensity of entropy generation rate (W/K) transformed temperature (general function) domain, general notation Differential equations describing heat conduction processes are derived from the first law of thermodynamics. When heat conduction coefficient depends on temperature, Different formulation to the classical boundary-value problem described above is obtained when heat conduction equation is derived from the minimum entropy generation principle. According to the thermodynamics of irreversible processes Using variational calculus, this special function Consider one dimensional (1D) problem of heat conduction in plane wall with first kind boundary conditions, Local entropy generation is For boundary conditions of the first kind, Further calculations leads to the next confusing result that Explanation comes directly from The same results have been obtained by Bejan Numerical example for In the case when heat conduction coefficient depends on temperature, the problem is formulated in the following way:   Comparison of It is easy to show that Assuming frequently used dependence Assuming first kind boundary conditions, the solution of Local entropy generation rate For comparison, solution of the classical problem is Local entropy generation Direct comparison gives Relationship Using solution After integration, when relationship In similar way, internal entropy generation rate related to Finally, entropy exchange rate with external heat sources After calculations It is easy to show that global entropy generation rate of the process given by Consider 2D problem of heat conduction without internal heat sources for Global entropy generation rate is Second term describes intensity of the additional internal heat source  Solution of Function Local entropy generation rate is It depends on the selection of the arbitrary chosen constants To find minimum value of Solution of Sufficient condition the value of Physical interpretation of the solution constants Dimensionless temperature, internal heat sources intensity and entropy generation rate distributions are shown in For any boundary conditions, solution can easily be obtained by transformation   Boundary value problem formulated by Let us consider 3D boundary value problem of heat conduction in the cube for Minimization of the global entropy generation rate  Its solution is Local entropy generation rate is Minimum value All sufficient conditions Geometry of the problem is presented in The cable conducts electric current of density Entropy generation rate is Minimization of the integral First three terms of  Minimization of entropy generation in heat conduction processes is always possible by introducing additional internal heat sources. Most important conclusion derived from the presented theoretical considerations is directly connected with the solutions of the boundary value problems for solids with temperature dependent heat conduction coefficients. In such cases, additional internal heat sources can be arbitrarily chosen as positive or negative. It makes possible to extend practical applications presented in the literature by Bejan The results obtained in this paper can illustrate a practical aspect of the “Principle of Entropy Compensation” This work was supported by the Polish Scientific Committee (KBN) under the Grant No.4T08B02725.
