In a previous paper [Morrell, S. 2008a. A method for predicting the specific energy requirement of comminution circuits and assessing their energy utilisation efficiency. Minerals Engineering 21(3), 5–9] an approach was described which enabled the specific energy of tumbling mills such as Autogenous (AG), Semi-autogenous (SAG) and ball mills to be estimated from laboratory-derived ore characterisation data. The following paper extends this approach to encompass jaw, gyratory and cone crushers as well as High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR). The technique is applied to three different comminution circuits and their overall specific energies are compared. All of the calculations involved are described in detail in an appendix.Twenty years ago discussions about conventional comminution circuits would revolve around crushing-rod-ball or crushing-ball circuits and the work of In a previous paper ( The approach divides comminution equipment into three categories: Tumbling mills, e.g., AG, SAG, rod and ball mills. Conventional crushers, e.g., jaw, gyratory and cone. HPGRs. Tumbling mills are described using two hardness indices as described in the earlier paper ( For tumbling mills the two indices relate to “coarse” and “fine” ore properties plus an efficiency factor which represents the influence of a pebble crusher in AG/SAG mill circuits. “Coarse” in this case is defined as spanning the size range from a The work index covering grinding in tumbling mills of coarse sizes is labelled The general size reduction equation is as follows (      The total specific energy (       Clearly only the For coarse particle grinding in tumbling mills Eq.      For fine particle grinding Eq.           Note that the Bond ball work index test should be carried out with a closing screen size which gives a final product Eq.      Eq.      Implicit in the approach described in this paper is that the feed and product size distributions are parallel and linear in log–log space. Where they are not, corrections need to be made. By and large, such corrections are most likely to be necessary (or are large enough to be warranted) when evaluating circuits in which closed circuit secondary/tertiary crushing is followed by ball milling. This is because such crushing circuits tend to produce a product size distribution which is relatively steep when compared to the ball mill circuit cyclone overflow. This is illustrated in For closed circuit crushing the specific energy is: The difference between the two (Eqs. Note that in Eq. In AG/SAG-based circuits the need for It follows from the above arguments that in HPGR circuits, which are typically fed with material from closed circuit secondary crushers, a similar feed size distribution correction should also be applied. However, as the secondary crushing circuit uses a relatively small amount of energy compared to the rest of the circuit (as it crushes to a relatively coarse size) the magnitude of the size distribution correction is relatively small – much smaller than the error associated with the technique – and hence may be omitted in calculations. As mentioned in the previous section, laboratory experiments have been reported by various researchers in which the Bond ball work index of HPGR products is less than that of the feed. The amount of this reduction appears to vary with both material type and the pressing force used and has been attributed to the influence of micro-cracking. Observed reductions in the Bond ball work index have typically been in the range 0–10%. The equations used in this paper makes no specific allowance for the influence of micro-cracking. However, if HPGR products are available which can be used to conduct Bond ball work index tests on, then As stated in the previous section the values for The approach described in the previous sections was applied to 65 industrial scale tumbling mill circuits. The relevant data from these circuits were collected during surveys (audits) of the comminution circuits and included feedrates, power draws, as well as feed and product size distributions. Samples of fresh feed were also taken with which to conduct breakage tests. This was done by collecting all of the material from a section of the feed conveyor – typically a 1 Validation of Eq. No-load power tends to be relatively high in conventional crushers and hence net power is significantly lower than the motor input power. From examination of the 18 crusher data sets the motor input power was found to be on average 35% higher than the net power. Validation of Eq. The technique described in the previous sections provides the means to determine the overall specific energy requirements of a variety of circuit configurations as well as the component size reduction processes. By way of example three different circuits were evaluated using the breakage properties of an ore with reasonably average hardness values. The circuits in question are: SAG milling with a pebble recycle crusher followed by ball milling (SABC). Secondary crushing followed by HPGR followed by ball milling (HPGR/ball). Secondary/tertiary crushing followed by ball milling (Crush/ball). Details of the calculations for each circuit are given in the An approach has been formulated in which the specific energy requirements of comminution circuits containing conventional crushers, HPGRs and tumbling mills can be predicted. These predictions are based on simple equations and two simple laboratory tests which determine the breakage characteristics of the ore, i.e., the SMC Test A SMC Test SMC Test    Bond test (carried out with a 150  Three circuits are to be evaluated: SABC.
