In this work, we report synthesis and stability analysis of cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3) prepared through solid state and solution route methods for its application as a hole transport layer in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC). Phase formation, chemical stability and degradation mechanism of CsSnI3 were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. Optical band gap of the material was studied using UV–vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence studies. CsSnI3 synthesized through solid state route was used as a hole transport material (HTM) for dye sensitized solar cells with cell efficiency up to 3%. Temperature dependent excitonic emission studies shows that B-γ-CsSnI3 shows a linear increase in band gap with increasing temperature.CsSnI DSSC is a cheaper alternate for the conventional semiconductor solar cells, but durability of DSSC remains an issue due to the use of iodine based corrosive liquid electrolyte. To solve this problem and make DSSCs commercially viable several solid and semi-solid hole transport materials were used in lieu of corrosive liquid electrolytes The dissolution and recrystallization of CsSnI As a first steps towards solid state reaction synthesis of CsSnI CsSnI XRD analysis of CsSnI For estimation of optical band gap and phase stability of B-CsSnI It was found that PL maxima for B- HR-TEM analysis of powdered sample of B-  EDS analysis of B-CsSnI We explain the color changes and phase changes of B-CsSnI We studied the recrystallized phases of CsSnI XRD analysis as shown in Cross-sectional SEM and elemental mapping image of DSSCs using CsSnI One of the major attributes of CsSnI CsSnI Recent reports of using air stable Cs The authors acknowledge financial support from the
