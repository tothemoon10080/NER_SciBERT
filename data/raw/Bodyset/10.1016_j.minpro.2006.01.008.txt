The binary-coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with the modified jumping gene operator (NSGA-II-mJG) is used to obtain global optimal solutions of flotation circuits. Several single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems are solved using the interconnecting cell linkage parameters (fraction flow rates) and the mean cell residence times as the decision variables. In the single-objective problem, the overall recovery of the concentrate stream is maximized for a desired grade of the concentrate. Two two-objective optimization problems are then solved. In one, the number of non-linking streams and the overall recovery of the concentrate are maximized simultaneously. This gives several simple circuits in a systematic manner with only marginally lower recoveries. In the other two-objective optimization problem, the overall recovery of the concentrate is maximized while the total cell volume is minimized. A three-objective problem (maximization of the overall recovery of the concentrate, maximization of the number of non-linking streams and minimization of the total cell volume) is then solved. All the problems constrain the grade of the product to lie at a fixed value. Finally, a complex and computationally intensive four-objective optimization problem is solved. The solution of several practical optimization problems in this study helps develop useful insights into the optimal solutions.Optimal design of flotation plants depends on the quality of the raw ores and the desired final products and involves (i) the selection of appropriate flotation circuits, (ii) the sizing of the banks as well as the cell units, and (iii) fixing of the operating parameters. Optimal selection of flotation circuits means finding the interconnections of several banks of flotation cells with one or more recycle streams such that one obtains the best possible performance. Significant progress has been made in the optimization of flotation networks. These are summarized by The earlier paper of  In Eqs. Here, A general flotation circuit (involving four cells) is shown in In these two problems, the cell volumes (Eq. Several standard preliminary tests ( The SOO problem is first solved using NSGA-II-mJG. The best set of values of the several computational parameters (that gives the highest values of the recovery) is obtained by trial and error. These are given in The two-objective MOO-A problem described in the The following general observations can be made from the results (of all the 28 problems): There is only a single feed entry (always to the rougher cell) to the circuit, irrespective of the values of For given values of For a given number of cells and the quality of feed, an increase in We now analyze the simplified circuits shown in Some additional details of the Pareto solutions for the MOO-A problem for the three feeds are summarized in Qualitatively similar results are observed as the grade of the feed becomes even poorer (e.g., for grade Results for the MOO-B problem (minimum The After solving the relatively simple two-objective optimization problems and building up our insights as well as computational skills, we solved a very general, The elitist, binary-coded, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with the modified jumping gene operator, NSGA-II-mJG, is a powerful AI-based technique for obtaining global optimal solutions for flotation circuits. A few single-, two-, three- and four-objective optimization problems have been solved for different values of the input variables. Optimal solutions and Pareto sets are obtained for single and multi-objective optimization problems, respectively. The results obtained are consistent with intuitive expectations, but quantify them. Multi-objective optimization problems in which one objective is to maximize the number of non-linking streams give solutions having the most simplified circuits, even though they are associated with (marginally) lower values of the overall recovery. The Pareto solutions provide a set of several equally good (non-dominated) solutions to a decision maker from which one can select the preferred solution, using intuition/experience. mass flow rate of the density of the concentrate, kg m mass percent solids (loading) in the tailings density of the tailings, kg m density of water, kg m ith objective function grade of the (overall) concentrate stream, percent penalty parameters ( specific flotation rate constant of the total number of binaries in a chromosome number of binaries characterizing each decision variable number of cells in the circuit overall recovery of the concentrate stream, percent mass flow rate of total solids in the fresh feed, kg min mass flow rate of the number of species in the feed number of decision variables maximum number of generations number of chromosomes in the population crossover probability jumping gene probability mutation probability 11â€¦1 probability mass flow rate of the volume of the total volume of mass fraction of the valuable mineral in the mass fraction of the mass fraction of the fraction of concentrate outlet stream from cell fraction of tailings outlet stream from cell fraction of fresh feed going to cell residence time in cell density of water, kg m desired value feed gangue materials lower bound middling materials stream leaving the circuit (not recycled) upper bound valuable materials.
