Growth velocity in unidirectional solidification of succinonitrileâ€“2wt.% salol was systematically varied in a stepwise sequence. A gradual change in growth velocity showed definitive history-dependent dendrite spacing, while in the case of a large variation in growth velocity, the history effect did not exist. The present work shows that not only primary dendrite spacing but also microstructure evolution is history-dependent.
