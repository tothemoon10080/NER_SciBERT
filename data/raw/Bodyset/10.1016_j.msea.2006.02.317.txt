A hydrous oxide film for the application as dielectric film is synthesized by immersion of pure aluminum in hot water. From a Rutherford backscattering analysis, the ratio of aluminum to oxygen atoms was found to be 3:2 in the anodized aluminum oxide film, and 2:1 in the hydrous oxide layer. Anodization of the hydrous oxide layer was more effective for the transition of amorphous anodic oxides to the crystalline aluminum oxides.The dielectric film for aluminum electrolytic capacitors is fabricated by anodizing high purity aluminum foil for high voltage applications in boric acid solutions. The barrier-type oxide layer for the dielectric film is made up of amorphous or crystalline aluminum oxides For hydration and anodization treatments a sheet of aluminum (99.99 To investigate the effects of hydration temperature and time on the growth of hydrous oxide layer, hydration treatments were performed in hot de-ionized water at temperatures between 80 and 100 To observe the microstructure of these hydrous oxides, the RBS measurements were carried out and results are shown in The barrier-type alumina (Al The RBS spectrum also shows that the ratio of aluminum to oxygen atoms is found to be 2:1 for hydrous oxide layer, and 2:3 for anodic alumina layer. This ratio indicates that the hydrous and anodic oxide layers have an identical stoichiometry of AlOOH and Al During anodization of hydrated oxide layer formed in boiling water, Al The effects of hydrous oxide film on the formation and characteristics of anodic oxide layers have been investigated. For the hydrous oxides formed by hydration treatment the ratio of aluminum to oxygen atoms is found to be 2:1, which indicates an identical stoichiometry of AlOOH. And the crystalline phase of hydrous oxide was observed as the hydration temperature increases. It is also shown that the amount of consumed current for the hydrated aluminum during anodization is much less than that for non-hydrated aluminum, and the growth rate of anodic oxide layer is higher. The crystallinity of anodic alumina formed by anodization depends on anodic potential, and the anodic alumina layer transformed from amorphous structure into the crystalline Î³-Al
