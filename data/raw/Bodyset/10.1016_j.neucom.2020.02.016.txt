                      state estimation problem of Markov jump memristive neural networks with fading channels is concerned by virtue of the hidden Markov model approach. The measurement transmission between the sensor and the filter is completed through fading channels which are described by a modified Rice fading model. The objective of the paper is to design a memristive filter such that, in the presence of fading channels, the effect of external disturbances on the error system is attenuated at a certain level and quantified by the

By employing a mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, some sufficient conditions are obtained to determine the gain matrices of the filter. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the main results.Owing to the powerful modeling capability of Markov jump systems (MJSs) for power systems, aerospace systems, network control systems and so on, the studies of the stability analysis and the filter/controller design for MJSs have gained extensive attention from a number of scholars On the other hand, in electronic circuit theory, with the appearance of the physical implementation of the memristor manufactured by HP Lab Generally, the synchronization problem of a system is unnegligible In the work, we aim to tackle the  The notations used are listed as follows  First of all, The neuron activation function Neural networks are considered to be universal function approximators In order to represent the pinched hysteretic characteristic and the memory function of a memristor, the parameters in Through the above analyses, at any fixed time For Clearly, As we know, in wireless communication networks, the measurement In general, multi-path propagation and shadowing of obstacles are the main causes of fading effects reflected in the variation of the amplitude and phase of the transmitted signal The filter considered in this paper is shown as follows Let  If when ϖ( Given a scalar From the above definitions, the main problem considered in the work may be formulated as follows.
