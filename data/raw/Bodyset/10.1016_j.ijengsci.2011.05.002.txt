A general constitutive model of crushable granular materials is developed within the context of large deformations. The time evolution equations for breakage, inelastic porous compaction and dilation, and distortional deformations are coupled by a yield surface and restrictions are imposed to ensure that these inelastic processes are dissipative. Some of the most salient mechanisms of such materials are described, including: (1) stiffness dependent on the breakage (a variable index of grading), porosity, and pressure; (2) critical comminution pressure and isotropic hardening, also dependent on the breakage and porosity; (3) jamming transition between solid and gaseous states; (4) a dilation law that embodies competition between porous compaction (due to the rate of breakage) and bulking (porous dilation at positive pressure due to the rate of inelastic distortional deformation); and finally, (5) the non-unique critical state relation between stress and porosity, in terms of the loading history and grading changes.Brittle granular materials (such as sand, rockfill, and pharmaceutical powders) present critical mechanical phenomena that are beyond the reach of current constitutive models. In particular, their yielding depends on porosity and grain size distribution (gsd) ( Inability to capture these critical effects is an obvious weakness of current soil models. An alternative model of breakage mechanics was recently proposed ( The main objective of this section is to integrate ideas of the constitutive equations for large deformation of elastic–viscoplastic porous materials developed in Following the work in In general, the Cauchy stress In the model developed by Next, the evolution equation for In the following, a constitutive equation for pressure is proposed which depends on the volumetric strain Next, evolution equations for the porosity For solid states with compaction or dilation at positive pressure and with the grains in contact ( Following the work in Next, consider a rate-independent theory with a yield surface Here, the specific (per unit mass) strain energy Now, using standard methods the rate of material dissipation Next, it is assumed that the function In summary, for all states the rate of material dissipation is given by Here, an attempt is made to integrate the proposal of a yield surface based on breakage of a granular material discussed in Also, it is assumed that the value of  Here, the function Motivated by the work in Using The yield strength in The yield surface In order to motivate a functional form for Next, it is convenient to define an auxiliary parameter The expression (4.28) models competing effects of compaction [i.e. decrease in porosity at positive pressure modeled by the first two terms on the right-hand side of The nonlinear constitutive equations summarized in (4.15) and the yield surface (4.20) are functions of the variables First, use is made of (2.17) to rewrite the evolution equation For {ε For { In summary, the value of ρ is determined by (2.17b); These evolution equations require specification of initial values for (5.1) These evolution and constitutive equations depend on ten material constants. It is important to notice that only six parameters relate directly to the mechanical response of the material For gaseous states with For solid states with For isotropic compression with no distortion from a solid stress-free state with initial conditions Now, the response is elastic with constant { For monotonic loading to a larger value of As a specific example take Consider a material which was initially in a solid stress-free state described by For this example, the state Since the term in the Macaulay brackets in As a special case take The results in these  The model developed in this paper captures the salient mechanisms of dense crushable granular materials by combining the notions of porous compaction and dilation ( Stiffness dependence on current breakage, porosity, and current pressure. These relations agree well with the observations reported in the literature ( Critical comminution pressure and isotropic hardening during pure dilatation as in ( The jamming transition of the granular material ( A new evolution equation for porosity which embodies a competition between porous compaction (due to the rate of breakage) and bulking (porous dilation at positive pressure) due to the rate of inelastic distortional deformation. This evolution equation distinguishes between the shear responses of lightly to highly pressured sands, weak to strong grains, and poorly- to well- graded materials. The model demonstrates that non-unique steady-state relations for the pressure Finally, it is important to highlight that, unlike most constitutive models in geomechanics, the current model allows for large porosity changes associated with finite deformations, typical to scenarios with severe grain crushing under high pressures and/or large distortions towards steady-state shear failures. As discussed in Appendix A, the current model does not require the assumption, which is often used in soil mechanics, that solid deformations are neglected in obtaining a simplified relation between porosity and volumetric total or plastic strains.
