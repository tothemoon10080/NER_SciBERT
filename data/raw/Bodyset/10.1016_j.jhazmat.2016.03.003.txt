A complete mineralization of a textile dye widely used in the Chilean textile industry, acid yellow 42 (AY42), was studied. Degradation was carried out in an aqueous solution containing 100mgL−1 of total organic carbon (TOC) of dye using the advanced solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF) process in a lab-scale pilot plant consisting of a filter press cell, which contains a boron doped diamond electrode and an air diffusion cathode (BDD/air-diffusion cell), coupled with a solar photoreactor for treat 8L of wastewater during 270min of electrolysis.
                  The main results obtained during the degradation of the textile dye were that a complete transformation to CO2 depends directly on the applied current density, the concentration of Fe2+ used as catalyst, and the solar radiation intensity. The elimination of AY42 and its organic intermediates was due to hydroxyl radicals formed at the anode surface from water oxidation and in the bulk from Fenton’s reaction between electrogenerated H2O2 and added Fe2+. The application of solar radiation in the process (SPEF) yield higher current efficiencies and lower energy consumptions than electro-Fenton (EF) and electro-oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (E OH2O2) by the additional production of hydroxyl radicals from the photolysis of Fe(III) hydrated species and the photodecomposition of Fe(III) complexes with organic intermediates.
                  Moreover, some products and intermediates formed during mineralization of dye, such as inorganic ions, carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds were determined by photometric and chromatographic methods. An oxidation pathway is proposed for the complete conversion to CO2.Raw materials of plants and animals origin were used by ancient civilizations for dyeing clothes. With the passage of time and technology, the textile industry arose, using a large number and variety of synthetic dyes in its manufacturing processes. The main dyes used by this industry correspond to azo dyes, which represent 70% of the world's total dye production. Azo dyes have an azo group ( Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), which are defined as processes that use electricity to electro generate strong oxidizing agents, are presented as an excellent option for the degradation of these POPs, since they are capable of destroying a variety of them In the last years, methods based on the Fenton chemical reaction have emerged as an alternative in the group of EAOPs, such as electro-Fenton (EF), photoelectro-Fenton (PEF); and solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF), allowing the treatment of waste water containing organic pollutants EF is based on the continuous electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen reduction at a carbon cathode (graphite, carbon felt, air diffusion) The oxidizing power of H EF is more efficient than the classical chemical Fenton process because Reaction The PEF method, which is a method based on the Fenton reaction and characterized by the use of a UV irradiation source, accelerated the degradation rate compared with the EF process because the UV irradiation directly affects the contaminated solution to be treated (ii) photo decarboxylation of iron(III) complexes with intermediates carboxylic acids generated by the action of the hydroxyl radical on the organic pollutant, according to (5) The PEF process is limited by the high electrical energy requirements necessary for the use of the artificial UVA lamp working during the electrolysis time. A much more economic EAOP is solar photoelectro-Fenton (SPEF), since this method uses UV radiation coming directly from the sun, so it is presented as a clean, renewable and free alternative Our research group complements SPEF with electro-oxidation (EO) using a boron doped diamond (BDD) anode to favor the process of decontamination of water, as the organic contaminant may undergo two simultaneous oxidations Because Chile has enormous potential in terms of solar energy resources, particularly in the north and center of the country, is that the use of this clean and free resource becomes a necessity to apply to new technologies. For this reason, in this paper, the comparative results obtained for the degradation and mineralization of dye acid yellow 42 (AY42) content in 100 Acid yellow 42 (CAS number: 6375-55-9, C A volume of 8.0 The solar CPC photoreactor contained 8 borosilicate-glass tubes of 50.5 The SPEF process was carried out in 0.05 Galvanostatic electrolyses were performed with an MCP model M10-QD305 power supply, which also displayed the cell voltage. The pH was measured with a Hanna Instruments Model HI8424 pH-meter. During the electrolysis, samples were withdrawn at regular time intervals from the solution kept in the cell and then refrigerated until performing the analytical procedures. The decolorization of azo dye solutions was followed by the drop of absorbance at the wavelength maximum (λ The degree of mineralization was monitored from total organic carbon (TOC) determined with a Vario TOC Select (Elementar) analyzer. Reproducible TOC values with an accuracy of ±1% were always found injecting 500 For a better analysis of the viability of the SPEF treatment, energy consumption (EC) per unit volume was calculated from Eq. Aliquots were taken at different times of electrolysis to evaluate the decay of the dye concentration, which was analyzed on a liquid chromatography of high efficiency reverse phase (HPLC-RP) Waters 625 system coupled to a photodiode array detector (PAD) Waters 2996 using a Purospher RP-18, 5 um, 150 The aliphatic carboxylic acids obtained as final products were identified and quantified by ion-exclusion chromatography using a Waters 625Chromatograph with diode array detector 2966, fitted with a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX 87H, 30 Aromatic intermediates were detected by UHPLC–MS/MS UltiMate 3000. Solutions under different experimental conditions were electrolyzed at short and long electrolysis times. They were then mixed until 1000 Previous study showed the good ability of the BDD/ADC cell for H The Fe   The MCE values are shown in A key variable parameter affecting the oxidation ability of EAOPs is the applied The absorbance decay with electrolysis time for 283.75 The increase in decolorization at higher current densities is associated with raising the generation of hydroxyl radicals at the anode and a higher production of hydrogen peroxide at the cathode, which produces radicals by the Fenton reaction within the solution, thereby increasing the concentration of radicals capable of destroying the organic pollutant. In The fact that the highest current density (80 Besides, the relative amount of BDD( The presence of these oxidants in the solution may be the cause of behavior observed in The change in the concentration of AY42 was determined by HPLC, where AY42 exhibited a well-defined peak at a retention time (tr) of 3.3  Solutions of 283.75 It is well-known that the cleavage of the benzene ring of aromatics leads to short chain linear compounds like carboxylic acids that form Fe The mineralization of the initial N contained in a 239 In order to elucidate a possible mechanism of the Photoelectro-Fenton degradation of azo dye AY42, we attempted to identify the main reaction intermediates. The identification of aromatic intermediates was carried out by UHPLC–MS/MS. For the electrolysis of the dye, four possible structures associated with oxidation compounds were detected and compared with standard o commercial compounds, and they are shown with their masses in Based on the products detected in this work, a plausible mineralization pathway for the solar photoelectro-Fenton degradation of AY42 (compound 1) is given in On the other hand, the rupture of aromatic rings produces higher molecular weight acids like citric or maleic, and then those of lower molecular weight. These acids in turn are attacked by hydroxyl radicals, generating oxalic, oxamic and formic acids, which can react with the Fe It was determined that dye AY42 can be degraded and mineralized by SPEF in a pre-pilot plant using a BDD anode, air diffusion cathode, and exposing the solutions to sunlight. Thus complete discoloration, degradation and mineralization of an aqueous dye solution was achieved by applying a current density of 50 The intensity of solar radiation influences the rate of degradation and mineralization of the dye. The decay of the concentration of the dye follows pseudo-first-order kinetics, where apparent constants ( The authors thank the financial support of
