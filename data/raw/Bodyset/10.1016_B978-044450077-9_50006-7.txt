This chapter is designed to discuss volcanogenic base metal deposits in the Flin Flon-Snow Lake Areas, Manitoba, Canada. The volcanogenic base metal deposits in the Flin Flon-Snow Lake areas in Manitoba, Canada occur in Proterozoic greenstone rocks which have been metamorphosed to the greenschist facies. The Trout Lake and Stall Lake deposits are that of chalcopyrite-sphalerite, while the Callinan is a chalcopyrite-sphalerite-pyrite-pyrrhotite deposit. The Trout Lake deposit consists of a series of lenses. Each lens exhibits the typical zonation of volcanogenic massive sulfides, and is interpreted to represent an entire hydrothermal cycle. The ore types in the lenses progress from the hanging wall to the footwall in the general sequence: massive sphalerite, massive pyrite, chalcopyrite-sphalerite, and chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite. The ores were classified as massive sphalerite (MS), banded pyrite + sphalerite (BP+S), massive pyrite (MP), mixed/banded chalcopyrite + sphalerite (M/BC+S), sheared chalcopyrite + sphalerite (SC+S), massive chalcopyrite + pyrrhotite (MC+P), vein quartz and chalcopyrite (VQ+C), chalcopyrite stringers (CS), and disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite ores (DP-HZ). The Callinan ores are enriched in pyrite and pyrrhotite, and samples from the Callinan deposit were classified as pyrite, sheared pyrite, pyrrhotite, and sheared pyrrhotite ore types.
