This paper numerically examines the laminar forced convection of a water–Al2O3 nanofluid flowing through a horizontal microchannel. The middle section of the microchannel is heated with a constant and uniform heat flux. The middle section is also influenced by a transverse magnetic field with a uniform strength. The effects of pertinent parameters such as the Reynolds number (0≤Re≤1000), the solid volume fraction (0≤ϕ≤0.04) and the Hartmann number (0≤Ha≤100) on the flow and temperature fields and the heat transfer performance of the microchannel are examined against numerical predictions. The results show that the microchannel performs better heat transfers at higher values of the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers. For all values of the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers considered in this study, the average Nusselt number on the middle section surface of the microchannel increases as the solid volume fraction increases. The rate of this increase is considerably more at higher values of the Reynolds number and at lower values of the Hartmann number.area (m magnetic field strength experimental constant (Eq. specific heat (J diameter (m) gravitational acceleration (m microchannel height (m) microchannel height ( Hartmann number thermal conductivity (W microchannel length (m) microchannel length ( length of entry section (m) length of entry section ( length of middle section (m) length of middle section ( length of exit section (m) length of exit section ( Nusselt number local Nusselt number on the heated surface average Nusselt number along the heated surface fluid pressure (Pa) modified pressure pressure Peclet number Prandtl number Uniform heat flux (kw/m Reynolds number temperature (K) inlet flow temperature (K) velocity components in inlet flow velocity (m Brownian motion velocity (m velocity components Cartesian coordinates (m) coordinates ( thermal diffusivity solid volume fraction Boltzmann constant (J temperature dynamic viscosity (N kinematic viscosity, density (kg electrical conductivity (μS/cm) cold pure fluid maximum average minimum nanofluid outlet nanoparticle The recent development of automotive, aerospace and electronic technologies has been associated with a continuous reduction in the size of components and an increase in their power and heat generation. Effective cooling strategies are, therefore, required to maintain the safe and efficient operation of these components. Microchannels have been proven to have relatively higher heat dissipation capabilities than conventional heat removal devices because of their higher heat transfer surface area to fluid volume ratio In applications where a significant amount of heat needs to be removed from a very small surface, the coolant should have more effective heat transfer characteristics. Nanofluids have been proven to have high thermal conductivity and to be very stable The application of nanofluids in microchannels has generated considerable interest amongst researchers. Various models for the effective thermal conductivity of nanofluids have been used In some practical cases such as the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) generators, pumps, geothermal reservoirs, thermal insulators, electronic packages and micro-electronic devices, the flow of electrically conducting fluid through a channel occurs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding the flow behaviour and heat transfer mechanisms of channels that are cooled by electrically conducting fluids and are in the influence of a magnetic field. The common finding of every study has been that the fluid, which is under the influence of a magnetic field, experiences a Lorentz force. This force, in turn, affects the flow field and the heat transfer rate. Siegel The electrically conducting fluids, which are considered in all the above-mentioned studies, have low thermal conductivities. In situations where an enhanced heat transfer is desirable but the magnetic field weakens the convection flow field, the use of nanofluids is a potential solution. To the best knowledge of the authors, no studies that investigate the magnetic field effects on the forced convection of a nanofluid in microchannels have been reported in the literature. Hence, the present study numerically examines the heat transfer performance of a water–Al  The non-dimensional governing equations of continuity, momentum and energy are: In the above equations, the following non-dimensional parameters are used: The properties of the nanofluid can be defined based on the properties of water and Alumina: The effective dynamic viscosity of the nanofluid can be determined by the formula given by Brinkman The thermal diffusivity of the nanofluid is  In the definition of Peclet number, Brownian motion velocity of the nanoparticles is In the above-mentioned equations, The non-dimensional boundary conditions are: The non-dimensional governing Eqs.

At low Reynolds numbers, the flow immediately becomes hydrodynamically fully developed as enters the microchannel and flows into the middle and exist sections. The hydrodynamic entrance length in each section, however, increases as the Reynolds number increases. The flow also becomes thermally fully developed within the microchannel at low Reynolds numbers. This is not, however, the case at high Reynolds numbers. The horizontal velocity and the dimensionless temperature along the centreline of the microchannel are affected by variations in the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers. For any value of the Reynolds number, velocity and temperature decrease as the Hartmann number increases at the middle section. For all values of the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, changes are observed in the velocity and temperature profiles as the flow passes through the middle section due to the effects of the magnetic field and the heat flux applied in this section. The local and average Nusselt numbers on the middle section surface increase as the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers increase due to the higher velocity near the walls, which is associated with the stronger convective heat transfer. The rate of increase of the average Nusselt number and the rate of decrease of the maximum surface temperature on the middle section surface due to the increase of the Hartmann number becomes more considerable as the Reynolds number increases. Variations of the solid volume fraction result in changes to the dimensionless temperature along the centreline and the temperature profile at different cross-sections of the microchannel. For all values of the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, the average Nusselt number on the middle section increases as the solid volume fraction increases. The rate of this increase is more considerable at higher values of the Reynolds number and at lower values of the Hartmann number. For all values of the Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, the maximum surface temperature decreases as the solid volume fraction increases, indicating the microchannel's enhanced thermal performance.
