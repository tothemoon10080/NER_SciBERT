The Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model proposed by Haghtalab and Peyvandi, Fluid Phase Equilib., 281, 2009 is modified and extended to represent the excess Gibbs energy function of multicomponent electrolyte solutions. Using the experimental mean activity coefficient of aqueous binary electrolyte systems in the extensive domain of temperature and molality, the adjustable temperature dependent parameters are obtained for the several binary electrolyte systems. Furthermore, the osmotic coefficient and vapor pressure of some binary systems are predicted at the wide range of temperature and molality using the adjustable parameters. Having the binary interaction parameters, the solubility of electrolytes in ternary aqueous electrolyte solutions are predicted at 298K and the higher temperatures so that the phase diagram of the salt solubility are obtained for the several ternary aqueous-salt systems. The results of the solubility, osmotic coefficient and vapor pressure for the electrolyte systems demonstrate that the generalized Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model can be successfully applied for prediction of the thermodynamic properties of multicomponent electrolyte systems with very good accuracy.Electrolyte systems represent an important role in chemical, gas and petroleum industries such as natural gas treatment, extractive distillation, crystallization, desalination of water, hydrometallurgy, enhanced oil recovery, etc Consequently, using two-liquid theory, the local composition Gibbs energy functions have been developed so far that allows one to calculate the activity coefficient of electrolyte for prediction of the salt solubility in electrolyte solutions. In the last decades, the two-liquid theory have been widely used to develop the excess Gibbs function for binary single electrolyte systems such as Cruz Chen et al. developed the generalized E-NRTL model Jarentun et al. Messnaoui et al. Haghtalab and Peyvandi Although the E-UNIQUAC-NRF model Following the general approach of the electrolyte-local composition models, the excess Gibbs energy of a binary electrolyte solution includes the contribution of two terms as Following the UNIQUACL-NRF model Following the previous work Following the approach for a binary system, the molar excess internal energy for a multicomponent electrolyte system is obtained as On the other hand, for single solvent electrolyte systems the local area balances for existence of the three types of central cells in the solution are written as Applying Eq. Following the same approach as the binary system, the residual excess Gibbs energy is obtained as Consequently, by proper differentiation of Eq. For the combinatorial term, the Guggenheim's equation is used that it is identical to the same equation which is used in the UNIQUAC equation, but we use the effective mole fraction instead of the mole fraction as it was done in the previous version of the Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF equation For both binary and multicomponent electrolyte solutions, since the infinite dilution standard state is used for the Pitzer–Debye–Hückel term, thus, the short-range activity coefficient of ionic species should be normalized on the same basis so that the infinite dilution activity coefficients are presented as Using Eq. Finally, the mean ionic activity coefficient of any electrolyte in a binary system or a multicomponent solution is calculated as In the generalized Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model, we assume that the electrolytes are completely dissociated in the aqueous phase so that the binary interaction parameters among ionic and molecular species are used. Using this model for prediction of the salt solubility in multicomponent electrolyte system, we use only the binary interaction parameters of individual electrolytes which forming an electrolyte mixture. Thus for an electrolyte binary solution, the adjustable interaction parameters are expressed as It worth noting that in the modified Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model, the previous simplifications as To take into account temperature effect, a temperature dependent correlation for the interaction parameters, suggested by Clarke and Glew Eq.  Also as one can observe a comparison between the results of the present model with E-NRTL model is carried out as shown in To show the performance of the present model, the vapor pressure of the binary electrolyte systems are calculated through the vapor–liquid equilibrium calculation as follows The experimental and predicted vapor pressures for the aqueous binary solutions of calcium and sodium chloride at various temperatures are depicted and shown in For the prediction of the solubility of electrolytes in the ternary aqueous salt mixture, we use the generalized E-UNIQUAC-NRF activity coefficient Eq. ( To obtain the phase diagram of salt solubility, we calculate the invariant point in which two salts precipitate both together so that the two solid–liquid equilibrium equations for both salts are solved simultaneously as As shown in It can be seen that the method proposed here is capable for prediction of the salt solubility without needing to use any tertiary or new fitting parameters for the mixed electrolyte systems. One should note that the E-NRTL model requires the additional parameters such as the interaction energy parameters between the two different electrolytes that are estimated by fitting of solubility data in the mixed salts systems. The assumption The local composition E-UNIQUAC-NRF model, based on an ionic framework, was modified and extended for multicomponent electrolyte systems. This model is used for correlation of the mean activity coefficient of the binary aqueous electrolyte systems at the wide range of temperature and concentration so that the results were used for validation of the model for many types of electrolyte systems at 298.15  Debye–Hückel constant Gibbs energy function internal energy function molar excess internal energy energy interaction parameter ionic strength on mole fraction basis molality mass concentration of electrolyte in % molecular weight of water universal gas constant absolute temperature mole fraction effective mole fraction coordination number charge number of ionic species moles of species i volume parameter of species i surface parameter of species i number of experimental data activity coefficient stoichiometric number nonrandom factor interaction energy parameter between anion and cation interaction energy parameter between ion and solvent effective area fractions of i effective local area fractions of i around j effective volume fraction standard deviation of activity coefficient standard deviation of osmotic coefficient adjustable parameter of Electrolyte-UNIQUAC-NRF model coefficient of the adjustable parameter calculated experimental excess long-range short-range unsymmetrical convention infinite dilution reference state combinatorial residual anion cation ion water any compound mean The Excess Gibbs function and the activity coefficient equations for binary systems:
