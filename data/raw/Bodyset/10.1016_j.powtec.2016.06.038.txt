A facile method was designed to synthesize CaCO3 particles with spindle morphology and an average diameter of 300nm from CaCl2 and CO2-storage material (CO2SM), in which CO2SM was used as both CO3
                     2â€“ source and crystal modifier to prepare CaCO3 crystals. The effects of CO2SM concentration, Ca2+ concentration, and stirring time on crystallization behavior of CaCO3 were investigated. Except of the rapid production of CaCO3 particles, the filtered solution without CaCO3 precipitate could be reused to prepare CaCO3 particles with the additional CO2 and CaCl2. In addition, a self-assembly formation mechanism of vaterite CaCO3 particles also was proposed.The greenhouse gas CO Up to present, the main synthesis methods of CaCO In order to obtain uniform CaCO The analytical grade EDA was purchased from Tianjin Reagent Company. The analytical grade PEG with the average molecular weight of 300 (280 CaCO Morphologies of the synthesized CaCO The as-prepared CaCO In The XRD pattern (JCPDS 33-0268) of as-prepared CaCO Because the [Ca SEM and XRD were used to examine the as-prepared CaCO From In the XRD pattern of these CaCO Representative SEM images of the as-prepared CaCO It was found that the increase of stirring time had a significant influence on the growth and phase development of CaCO As shown in As shown in TEM images ( As shown in Additionally, the filtrate without CaCO Based on the reported transition and self-assemble mechanism of PEG or EDA and their derivates CaCO This work was supported by the
