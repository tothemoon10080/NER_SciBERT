To assess the potential for recovering zinc using a biotechnological approach, leaching of Moore cake using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans bacteria has been attempted. At laboratory scale a number of experiments were conducted at different pH values, different ratios of solid to leach-liquor, different temperatures etc. Shaking and percolation effects on leaching were also studied. Maximum zinc recovery was found to be about 40% in a percolation experiment.During production of primary zinc by the roast-leach electrolysis process, Moore cake is generated as leached residue, in which zinc is mostly associated with iron as zinc ferrite (ZnO·Fe Hindustan Zinc Limited, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, supplied the Moore cake sample of the following composition:  Due to the absence of leaching bacteria in the Moore cake, Initially six experimental sets were setup at pH 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0. In each set (in 250 ml conical flasks) 10 g of Moore cake and 100 ml of 9K media were taken. Five sets were inoculated with 5 ml of an active culture of Seven experiments were setup, in six sets as above 100 ml media and 5 ml active culture were added. In these sets, the amount of Moore cake added was 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 g respectively. One control set (without inocula) contained 10 g Moore cake and 100 ml media. All sets were incubated at 35 °C. The results are shown in Two experiments were setup to assess the effect of shaking on leaching. One set was with ratio 1:20 and the other was with ratio 1:10. Four experiments were setup, with 10 g Moore cake and 100 ml media in each. Out of the four, two were inoculated with 5 ml culture in each set and the other two were kept as control. Two sets, one control and one inoculated, were incubated at 50 °C, and the other two sets were incubated at 65 °C. This experiment was conducted in a 5000 ml bucket with small holes in the bottom. A fine cloth was spread over the holes to prevent the drainage of the solid material. 300 g of Moore cake were kept on the cloth and leaching was performed with 2000 ml lixiviant containing salts 1/10 of 9K media and 10 ml active culture of The optimum zinc recovery was produced at pH 1.2. In similar conditions of pH and temperature, the highest recovery of zinc i.e. 4.0/100 g was produced with a solid-leachant ratio of 1:100. With ratios 1:20 and 1:10 leaching was in the range of 2.6–2.9 g zinc/100 g. At higher temperatures, zinc recoveries with and without bacteria were almost the same, and bioleaching in the shaking experiments did not improve recoveries. In the percolation experiments, the total zinc leached in 28 days was 12.36 g from 300 g of Moore cake i.e. 4.12/100 g. At 35 °C and 1:10 solid–liquid ratio, zinc leached per 100 g of Moore cake without and with bacteria was 1.7 and 2.9 g respectively, showing that zinc recovery is improved using bacteria. Consumption of acid with bacteria was only 40% of that without bacteria. Recovery of zinc using The authors are indebted to the Director of CMRI for giving permission to publish this paper.
