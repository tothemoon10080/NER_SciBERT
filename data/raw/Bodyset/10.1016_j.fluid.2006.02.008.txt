A new semi-empirical hydration model (SEHM) for describing electrolyte solutions is proposed. The SEHM model combines the Pitzer–Debye–Ηückel theory with Schönert's stepwise hydration model and is able to fit accurately the activity coefficients of strong electrolyte solutions using only one regression parameter. Furthermore SEHM is able to provide accurate estimations of the solutions’ water mole fractions, which are verified by the model's ability to theoretically predict the solutions’ osmotic coefficients, without resorting to the Gibbs–Duhem equation.The Debye–Ηückel theory To overcome this problem, through the years, a number of semi-empirical models have been proposed (for reviews on these models the reader is referred to In this paper, a new semi-empirical hydration model (SEHM) is presented which is based on K.S. Pitzer's theoretical modification of the Debye–Hückel theory In a solvent like water, which has one of the highest dielectric constants found in liquid state, the effect of non-random orientation of the water molecules’ dipoles in the presence of electrical charge, is expected to be significant. In the vicinity of the ions, the water dipoles are so strongly oriented that they are practically attached to the ions, thus forming a hydration sphere (for a detailed accounting of the ionic hydration phenomenon the reader is referred to the work of Marcus Following Schönert work These assumptions lead to calculating the ionic activity coefficients by the summation of two terms The long range ionic interactions in this model are described with the Pitzer–Debye–Hückel theory The Pitzer–Debye–Hückel theory, although theoretically better, it still shares the same limitations as the Debye–Hückel theory. Both theories fail in concentrations higher than 0.1 Schönert's model assumes that, setting long range electrostatic effects aside, all species in the solution (free solvent and hydrated ions) mix ideally so that the chemical potential of any specie is given by: The hydration phenomena are approximated by a series of stepwise hydration equilibriums, with the So in this hydration scheme the The contribution of the hydration phenomenon to the activity coefficient of the ion Heyrovska Even in solutions of strong electrolytes where contact pairs are not formed, electrostatic ion pairs are excepted to be formed. These ion pairs alter the overall hydration in the solution, since new hydration spheres appear. A similar stepwise ligand binding equilibria could be assigned to describe this new hydration. However, it would be impossible to determine so many regression parameters (for a 1-1 electrolyte one would need 6) and bearing in mind the semi-empirical fashion by which the phenomenon is described, in this model steps I–III of For a strong electrolyte Respectively Eqs. So far Eqs. The ions can approach each other up to a distance defined by the radii of their hydration spheres. Since however, this model accounts for the overall electrolyte hydration, the average ionic hydration sphere is defined as shown in The radius of this average hydration sphere Since the exact description of the complex inner fundamental processes of an electrolyte solution are unknown, one chooses to describe it thermodynamically with logical and physical meaningful approximations that average the behaviour of the solution. Eqs. The novelty of this model, compared to other electrolyte models, is the fact that despite its theoretical simplifications, it is able to estimate the overall distribution of water molecules between the solvent state and the ionic hydration state and provide an accurate estimation of the mole fraction of the solvent. This can be verified through another experimentally determined quantity, the solution's osmotic coefficient The regression of both parameters ( The water mole fraction produced, was used in Eq. The results are given in Schönert's model was able to predict activity and osmotic coefficients using two ion-specific ( This model uses only one electrolyte parameter, which includes contributions from ion-specific interactions between a single ion and solvent molecules (ionic hydration) and electrolyte specific interactions between multiple ions and solvent molecules (hydrated ion pair formation). The original physical meaning of this parameter, as the maximum number of hydration sites, is now lost, and this is even more apparent in cases where The average ionic hydration numbers produced vary very little with concentration (for most salts For salts of Na The average distance of closest approach generally varies insignificantly (for most salts less then 0.3 The most interesting results of the SEHM model are those found in the cases of CaCl Whether or not this model (due to its simple assumptions) under- or over-estimates the position of this upper limit, the existence of this limit is irrefutable and provides a theoretical explanation for such extremely high activity coefficients ( To describe electrolyte solutions beyond these hydration upper limits either a new theory or a more detailed description of the hydration phenomena is needed. In the semi-empirical model context, this means that more than one regressed parameters are needed, if one wishes to describe electrolyte solutions with ionic strengths higher than 6 The next step in the development of the SEHM model is the formulation of appropriate mixing rules, in order for it to be used in solutions of multiple electrolytes. This mixing rules will be published subsequently, to be followed by the SEHM extrapolation to higher temperatures and SEHM application to weak electrolyte systems. molar concentration of specie solution's density the electronic charge hydration number of specie solution's ionic strength the Boltzmman's constant molal concentration of specie avogadro's constant electrical charge of the radius of specie molar gas constant absolute temperature molar volume of specie molecular weight of specie mole fraction of specie valance of the quantity referring to anion A quantity in molar concentration scale quantity referring to cation C quantity referring to the electrolyte CA quantity in molal concentration scale quantity referring to the solvent (water) mean ionic quantity hydrated quantity distance of closest approach the dielectric constant of the solution the vacuum permittivity solution's omotic coefficient activity coefficient of specie Debye–Hückel reciprocal length Grions of This work was carried out under the “HERAKLITUS” project which is co-funded by the European Social Fund (75%) and National Resources (25%). In the Debye–Hückel theory the reciprocal length is given by For an aqueous electrolyte solution, at Pitzer, in his model Eqs. To change from molal to molar concentration, the density of the solution ( Since the density of the solution is usually unknown the density of pure water is often used, and in some cases (like the Debye–Hückel theory) the assumption of a dilute solution is made, so that To avoid such simplifications, the use of ionic volume is once again proposed. One kilogram of pure water is contained in
