Small (∼0.03 g) weighed quantities of Na Experiments were conducted using 50 mL of 0.1 M NaClO From previous work, it was found that the sensitivity of the Au electrode can be increased in the presence of excess Cl In the presence of excess From previous work Raman studies were conducted semi-quantitatively to examine the two species formed with respect to However, the concentration of the free thiosulfate was not appreciably changed when the second species was formed with the addition of more sulfite. Moreover, upon the addition of sulfite to maintain molar concentration ratios [Na This result did not change with the total gold(I) concentration [Au(I)] Using these results to set up the speciation model, the stepwise formation constants log To further support the above results, the data from UV–Vis spectrophotometric experiments were analysed using SPECFIT Although the formation of Au(S With this increased stability, the possibility of forming crystalline salts of these two species was examined.
