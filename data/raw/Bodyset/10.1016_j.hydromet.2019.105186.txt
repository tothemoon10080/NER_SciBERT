The electrodeposition of zinc from an acidic sulphate bath was studied in the presence of nettle (Urtica dioica L.) extract at room temperature and with relative low zinc concentration. Different electrochemical measurements show that the nettle extract allows a reduction of hydrogen adsorption on steel and zinc and therefore a decrease in hydrogen evolution, due to the specific adsorption of molecules of the extract. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements reveal that the addition of nettle extract induces a very fine grain size with a random crystallographic orientation. Finally, the nettle extract constitutes an interesting and low cost additive for all processes based on zinc electrochemical reduction in acidic sulphate electrolytes.Electrochemical deposition of zinc is widely used for steel protection against corrosion, due to the sacrificial property of zinc, its low cost, its high availability from industrial waste and the easy implementation of the process. A large selection of organic additives have been studied both to improve the surface morphology of deposits (roughness, porosity, brightness, grain size) and the metallographic structure such as the grain size and the crystallographic orientation of zinc grains ( In the case of zinc electrodeposition, zinc ions are easily reduced with a relative low overpotential in acidic electrolytes. Consequently, without additives, the throwing power is relatively low and coarse crystalline grains of zinc with a rough surface are easily formed. Moreover, H In industrial applications, the common types of additives are gums, gelatins or glues which are composed by proteins and polysaccharides, and are generally under a cationic form in acidic media ( Currently, the research of less toxic, low-cost and available additives for electrodeposition process is an important challenge for zinc coating applications but also for zinc electrowinning from liquid waste. Especially, the zinc electrowinning from low zinc concentrated electrolytes at room temperature is challenging because of low current efficiency and bad quality of zinc deposit ( The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of nettle plant extract on the electrodeposition of zinc in acidic sulfate bath onto carbon steel. The nettle extract (noted NE) was obtained from Nettle ( The electrochemical measurements were performed without stirring in deaerated conditions, with a three-electrode cell, connected to an PGP 201 Potentiostat/Galvanostat and a frequency response analyzer (PGSTAT30), driven by a computer. In this configuration, the circular working electrode surface (active area: 2.835 cm The plating bath was made of 0.1 M Na The surface morphology of the deposits was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips FEI Quanta 200) and the preferred crystallographic orientation was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis (Expert Prof Panalytical MPD diffractometer). To determine the effect of NE on the hydrogen evolution reaction, voltammetric studies and impedance measurements were performed using the supporting electrolyte (0.1 M Na On steel, without NE in the supporting electrolyte, the cathodic polarization curve reveals two first broad cathodic peaks noted C1 and C2 in With NE, the cathodic curve shows a decrease in the cathodic current density of H The Nyquist plot drawn in During zinc electrodeposition, the steel surface is rapidly covered by zinc, and then the reduction of protons occurs on zinc surface. Thus, the effect of NE on the hydrogen evolution reaction was also characterized on zinc. As shown on Zinc electrodeposition was carried out in the plating bath containing the supporting electrolyte (0.1 M Na Depending on the potential scan rate, cathodic polarization current density values show that the electrochemical processes rely on the diffusion of H As illustrated in A relation between the cathodic peak current (i Where n is the number of electrons transferred, β is the cathodic charge transfer coefficient (β = 0.5 ( From the slope of the linear fit of the experimental data presented in In presence of nettle extract, the apparent diffusion coefficient of Zn On the contrary, the apparent diffusion coefficient of protons in electrolyte, close to 10 Without and with 1.5 g L In the presence of nettle extract, a significant modification in the zinc deposits morphology is observed ( The preferential growth direction of zinc grain without additive is confirmed by the XRD pattern displayed in On the opposite, the XRD patterns of zinc deposit obtained with NE shows three main diffraction peaks, corresponding to the (100), (101), (110) planes of zinc structure, and the disappearance of the (002) diffraction peak at the same time, indicating a random orientation of the zinc grains with c-axis parallel to the steel surface. This effect has already been observed with other organic molecules, and could be attributed to an increase in the surface energy of (00c) planes, compared to (ab0) planes because of the specific adsorption of molecules of nettle extract ( Throughout this study, the nettle ( The results show that the presence of nettle extract modifies both the electrochemical parameter of zinc electrodeposition, and the characteristic of the zinc deposit. From the electrochemical point of view, the cathodic current density of proton reduction significantly decreases in the presence of NE from a concentration of 1.5 g L The hypothesis of molecules adsorption on different sites on steel and zinc is also confirmed by the analysis of zinc coating. Indeed, in presence of nettle extract, the zinc deposit changes from a directed and coarse (00c) orientation without extract to a more random and finer (ab0) orientation with extract which is in good agreement with the SEM observations. The collection of molecules seems to favorably guide the electro crystallization of zinc in the exposed conditions. Further studies are in progress to characterize and develop the practical use of nettle extract in industrial cell at room temperature and in low zinc concentrated electrolyte.
