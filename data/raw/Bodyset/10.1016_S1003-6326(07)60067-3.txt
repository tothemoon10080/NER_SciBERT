An acidophilic, rod-shaped Gram-negative sulfur oxidizing strain BY-05 was isolated from an acid mine drainage of copper ore in Baiyin area, Gansu Province, China. Ultrastructural studies show that the isolate has a tuft of polar flagella and possesses sulfur granules with clear membrane adhering to the cell innermembrane. Physiological study shows that this isolate grows autotrophically and aerobically by oxidizing S0 and reduced inorganic sulfur compounds (S2O2-
                     3, S2O2-
                     4, S2- and ZnS) with the optimum growth at pH 3.5–4.0 and at the temperature range of 25–30 °C. The 16S rRNA gene sequence (DQ 423683) of strain BY-05 has 100% sequence similarity to that of Acidithiobacillus albertensis (DSM 14366). So it is identified and named as A. albertensis BY-05. Bioleaching experiments with this new strain show that it can play an important role in recovery of metals from chalcopyrite and sphalerite.
