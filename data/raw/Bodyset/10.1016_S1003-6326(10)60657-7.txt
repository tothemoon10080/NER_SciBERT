The effects of Z11 and AP407 collectors as well as AF65 and AF70 frothers were evaluated in the rougher flotation circuit of the Sungun copper concentrator plant using 24 full factorial design. Response functions were produced for both Cu grade and recovery and optimized within the experimental range. The optimum reagent dosages were found to be 12.01 g/t Z11, 11 g/t AP407, 3 g/t AF65 and 5 g/t AF70 to attain the maximum Cu grade (8.17%). The reagent dosages of 12 g/t Z11, 11 g/t AP407, 3 g/t AF65 and 15 g/t AF70 produced the maximum Cu recovery (86.44%). The collector distribution demonstrated that the distribution pattern of (32%, 32%, 20%, 16%) can produce the best recovery (87.75%) in comparison to other examined distribution patterns.
