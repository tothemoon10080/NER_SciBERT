The effectiveness and efficacy of flotation diminishes with the size of the particles. However, the kaolin industry is unique in successfully using flotation with fine particle size feed. Kaolin is valued as a white pigment and therefore the goal in kaolin flotation circuits is to remove the colored impurities to result in an acceptable brightness product. Kaolin flotation originated with a novel carrier flotation process and later on carrierless flotation techniques were developed. The surfactants that are utilized to impart selectivity are based on fatty acids. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the reagent schemes used in the kaolin industry, the understanding of which has been significantly aided by research work conducted in Prof. Somasundaran's lab.
