This paper reports how a multi-stage spark plasma sintering (SPS) schedule can be successfully adopted to consolidate ultrafine-grained ceramics with uniform and better mechanical properties than the widely studied single-stage SPS schedule. To date, a major concern in the materials community is that rapid heating and shorter holding in the single-stage SPS process causes inhomogeneous radial/axial temperature distribution, which is consistent with a number of computational studies. Our new approach to developing better ceramics is expected to address this concern. From the phenomenological point of view, the initial stage of SPS involves the activation of powder particle surfaces, while removing surface oxide layers in the case of non-oxide powders In order to prove our hypothesis that such a designed sintering cycle can lead to uniform densification and better mechanical properties, we carried out SPS experiments using a Dr. Sinter 515S apparatus (SPS, Syntex, Inc., Japan) on a model ceramic, Al The analysis of XRD spectra confirms the presence of only α-Al In order to explore possible explanations for uniform densification in the case of MSS, the dynamic changes in DC pulsed current during the entire sintering cycle were monitored and are plotted in It is generally observed in The measured hardness values for α-Al From the microstructural aspect, uniform densification as well as ultrafine grains in an otherwise homogeneous material is the key to achieving such an excellent set of material properties in the case of MSS ( From It needs to be stated categorically that the MSS approach, as designed in the present research, is characteristically different from previously published two-step sintering approaches It is widely recognized that reliable and successful applications of ceramics in various structural and biomedical applications are possible only if uniform microstructural and improved material properties can be ensured. In this perspective, the results of multi-stage SPS schedules are significant and it is claimed that such a technique can be adopted in a wide range of ceramic systems, which have particular applications requiring contact damage resistance and biocompatibility. Finally, it must be mentioned that the simplicity of the processing approach should enable us to develop dense ultrafine-grained materials with improved hardness and strength properties. With the commercial availability of nanoscale powders, it would be possible to restrict the uniform grain size below 100
