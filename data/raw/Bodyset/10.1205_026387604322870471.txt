The phase split that occurs almost inevitably at a T-junction can be utilized to effect partial phase separation. Previous experimental investigations have been confined to considering individual Tâ€“junctions. This paper considers the performance of a separating system consisting of two large diameter (0.127 m) T-junctions, and how the geometry of the system can be altered and the effects this has on the separation performance. Experiments monitored the separation capabilities of each junction, thus allowing the phase separation capabilities of different outlet combinations to be compared. Experiments were performed in both the semi-annular and stratified flow patterns at ambient temperature and pressure.
