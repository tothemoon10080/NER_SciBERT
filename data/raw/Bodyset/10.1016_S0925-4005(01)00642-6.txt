Fabrication of solid-state potentiometric CO2 sensor was simplified by using Li2CO3–Li3PO4–Al2O3 mixture for both a solid electrolyte and sensing electrode. LiMn2O4 was used as the reference electrode to improve an electrochemical stability of the sensor. The emf of the sensor showed a good accordance with theoretical Nernst slope (n=2) for CO2 gas concentration in the range of 100–10,000ppm above 350°C. The emf of the sensor was constant regardless of oxygen partial pressure at the high temperature above 5kPa. It however, a little depended on oxygen partial pressure as the pressure decreased below 5kPa. The oxygen-dependency of the sensor gradually disappeared as the operating temperature increased. The sensing behavior of CO2 sensor was affected by the presence of water vapor, but its effect was small comparing with other sensors. The CO2 sensor also showed superior long-term stability.The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in air has been gradually increased as carbon-contained fuels were continuously used. It is a well-known factor that this increase directly causes a global warming of the earth. Recently, various CO In this work, solid-state potentiometric CO The CO To improve the ionic conductivity of Li The emf-responses of sensor to CO    According to the equation (5), the emf of the sensor was depended on only CO The emf of the sensor showed a good accordance with theoretical Nernst slope ( The authors wish to acknowledge the financial support of the Korea Research Foundation made in the program year of 1997.
