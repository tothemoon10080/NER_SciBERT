This work presents the aging as well as deformation behavior of Al–5wt% Cu alloy, Al–10wt% Cu alloy (hypoeutectic alloys), as well as an innovative composite combination of the Al–5-wt% Cu alloy as the matrix and 5-wt% Cu powder as the reinforcement are considered. The hardness values for the above alloys and composite were find out as cast, homogenized, solutionized and artificial aging (T6) condition. Cold up setting experiments on cylindrical samples of investigating alloys and composite were carried out at aged (T6) condition for aspect ratios H/D=1.5 and H/D=1.0. The specimens were deformed up to 50% in compression between two flat platens for predicting the material flow at room temperatures. The deformation behavior was analyzed for hardness, radius of curvature of bulge, strength coefficient ‘k’ as well as the strain hardening exponent ‘n’ and also find the relation between the radius of curvature as well as hydrostatic stress, geometrical shape factor as well as the stress ratio parameters. The results shows that the hardness values of both the alloys and composite are increased with increasing percentage of deformation. The composite shows low radius of curvature in both aspect ratios as compared to both the alloys. Strength coefficient ‘k’ as well as the strain hardening exponent ‘n’ values are high for lower aspect ratio (H/D=1.0) as compared to high aspect ratio(H/D=1.5) for both alloys and composite and also the ‘k’ and ‘n’ values are high for composite as compared to both the alloys. Moreover, it is discovered that the radius of curvature of bulge follows a straight line relation with other parameters.
