In this study, pressure hydrochloric-acid selective leaching was used to leach Ni and Co from saprolitic laterite ore on the basis of potential–pH diagrams constructed for Fe–Si–Cl–H2O and Ni–Si–Cl–H2O systems. The leaching of Ni, Co, Mg, Mn, and Fe was investigated under various conditions. The results showed that the optimal output was obtained under the following conditions: leaching temperature of 150°C, HCl concentration of 350g/L, liquid to solid ratio (l/s) of 1.0, and leaching time of 90min. The saprolitic laterite and leached residue were characterized via X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectrometry, and mineral liberation analysis. The related acid leaching mechanism was analyzed based on the results, and the kinetics of the leaching process was discussed. The results of this study suggest that pressure hydrochloric-acid selective leaching is a viable method for efficiently leaching Ni from laterite ores.Nickel is a strategic metal that is primarily used to produce stainless steel and nonferrous alloys with high impact strength, high corrosion resistance, and other desirable electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties. Approximately 70% of the global land-based Ni is found in the form of laterite, which accounts for approximately 50% of the nickel produced worldwide ( Laterite ores can be classified into two: limonite and saprolite ( Given the drawbacks of pyrometallurgical processes mentioned above, hydrometallurgical processes have become increasingly attractive. Several leaching methods with different acids have been studied ( In this study, pressure hydrochloric-acid selective leaching was used to treat saprolitic laterite ore for extracting Ni and Co. A flowchart of the treatment process is shown in Raw laterite ore was acquired from Indonesia and vibration-milled, in which the percentage passing sieve number 200 was 90%. Chemical-content analysis indicated that this ore was a typical saprolitic laterite, containing 1.37 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the laterite was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert Pro MPD, Panalytical Co.; 40 The milled laterite ore was dried overnight in an oven at 105 To evaluate the leaching of metals, the filter-cake sample was dissolved and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Optima 5300DV, Perkin-Elmer). The leaching of a metal was calculated using the following formula: The ore was wet-sieved to achieve the appropriate size fraction. Large fractions were crushed, re-sieved, and combined with the smaller fractions, and a subsequent particle-size analysis indicated that the mean particle size of the laterite ore was 30.53 A mineral analysis of the laterite sample confirmed that goethite (containing Ni), saprolite (containing Ni), and quartz were the major mineral phases ( Potential–pH ( In the Ni–Si–Cl–H The effect of HCl concentration on the leaching of metals from laterite was investigated at a constant liquid to solid ratio (l/s) of 1.0 by adjusting the HCl concentration ( The effect of l/s (i.e., the ratio of the volume of the leaching agent, including HCl and H The effect of leaching temperature on the leaching of metals from the laterite ore was investigated. The leaching of metals gradually increased as the temperature was increased from 120 The leaching of Fe decreased with increasing temperature because the Fe precipitation rate increases with the decrease in the hematite precipitate solubility caused by increasing the temperature ( The effect of leaching time on the leaching of metals from the laterite sample was investigated. The leaching of Ni and Co reached 83.4 wt.% and 85.9 In summary, the optimal conditions for the leaching of saprolitic laterite, as determined from the experiments of pressure hydrochloric-acid selective leaching, are obtained as follows: HCl concentration of 350 The XRD data for the leached residues after leaching for different periods are shown in A blank test was performed with a HCl concentration of 0 The disappearance of the peaks corresponding to the stretching vibration of the Therefore, the mechanism of the leaching and hydrolysis of iron oxide could be determined. Fe extraction is initiated by the dissolution of goethite via Reaction The MLA results for different reaction times are shown in As shown in Different Ni leaching rates were obtained under different conditions, with the highest rate (92.9 In this study, to determine the reasons for the loss of Ni during pressure hydrochloric-acid leaching, the leached residues were analyzed using MLA ( As mentioned in The metal-dissolution kinetics was investigated for both the high-pressure sulfuric-acid leaching process and the atmospheric-pressure hydrochloric-acid leaching process ( This study examined the leaching of metals from saprolitic laterite ore through pressure hydrochloric-acid selective leaching. Mineralogical studies indicated that the saprolitic laterite used in this study contained goethite, saprolite, and quartz. The This work was financially supported by the
