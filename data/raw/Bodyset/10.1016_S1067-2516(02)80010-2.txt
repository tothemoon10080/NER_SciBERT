Injuries to the ankle tend to be some of the most common injuries seen in practice. Of these ankle injuries, fractures of the posteromedial process of the talus are often misdiagnosed as ankle sprains because of poor visualization on routine ankle radiographs. The examining physician must have a heightened awareness of this injury to accurately diagnose and treat this fracture. Proper treatment could help to lessen the possibility of post-traumatic arthritis to the ankle and subtalar joints. The authors present a case of a fracture of the posteromedial process of the talus, after a medial subtalar dislocation, treated with open reduction and internal fixation with bioabsorbable pins.
