                     a measured in this study were as high as 1s−1, suggesting that bio-heaps may not be oxygen mass transport limited. The findings have particular significance to acid rock drainage and bio-heap leaching.In heap bioleaching, beds of sulphide minerals are irrigated by leaching solution and aerated with air. Bio-oxidative action by bacteria on the sulphides results in metal release to the percolating solution. Because of their oxidative nature, all of the chemical reactions taking place in the heap cannot proceed at a rate faster than the rate of oxygen mass transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase. The rate of oxygen mass transfer within the heap is described by the relationships: An aerated, percolating column, charged with ore, is analogous to a packed bed tower reactor. Measurements of gas adsorption in packed towers date back six decades ( In the specific case of oxygen mass transport in an irrigated heap, however, The material used in this study consisted of screened barren gravel, sulphide ore agglomerates, and proxy gravel agglomerates. Oxygen consumption was measured by an adaptation of the sulfite oxidation method, commonly used for stirred tanks and fermentors ( Solid material was charged in 1 The change in sulfite concentration across the column was divided by the liquid residence time to give the rate of sulfite consumption. In turn, this gave the rate of oxygen consumption at each combination of irrigation rate, aeration rate, and temperature. Feed solution containing sulfite was de-aerated with nitrogen and maintained under an argon blanket to minimize oxidation prior to entering the test columns. Even so, some sulfite oxidation did occur, hence the need to measure sulfite concentration in the column feeds. Sulfite concentration in the feed was measured at the start and end of each test to correct for any pre-reacting sulfite. Test duration was based on at least three liquid residence times before sampling the column effluent. Oxygen consumption was verified by monitoring its concentration in the off-gas from the columns with a portable meter. The average of gas oxygen content in air feed and column off-gas was used to calculate Liquid retention times were measured by the dynamic weight of irrigating solution. The column and its supporting frame were placed on a balance while being irrigated at various flow rates. The column was allowed to equilibrate at each flow rate (at least three residence times) before noting the dynamic weight. This allowed calculation of liquid holdup and the corresponding liquid residence time for a given irrigation rate. Oxygen mass transport was first measured with rocks having discrete particle sizes. Barren gravel was screened at − In this study, tests were carried out at temperatures ranging from 5 Measurements of Note the large error bars shown in In heap leaching of sulphides, a common practice involves crushing the ore to pass a given top size screen, followed by agglomeration prior to stacking on a leach pad. In agglomeration, the fine particles form aggregates with each other and with coarser particles. This allows for higher permeability to air and better distribution of the percolating leaching solution. This study used gravel agglomerate beds as proxies to study oxygen transport as it would occur in a heap of agglomerated ore. Four size distributions of gravel were used for this purpose. These were agglomerated with water and acid, using a recipe of 4% total final moisture and 8 Oxygen transfer measurements were carried out at temperatures between 5 and 50 Results for the two agglomerates and the three agglomerate proxies were plotted against the Reynolds number and oxygen diffusivity in water, in the same manner as for the gravel monosizes. In the case of the agglomerates, the Reynolds number was taken as: The degree of This study's main objectives were to measure The Derivation of The ranges of aeration, irrigation, temperature, and particle sizes, tested in this study should cover the equivalent ranges of operating conditions used in bioleaching heaps.
