The oxidation induration and reduction swelling behavior of the chromium-bearing vanadium titanomagnetite pellets (CVTP) with B2O3 addition were investigated. Besides, the reduction swelling index (RSI) and compressive strength (CS) of the reduced CVTP were also examined using the simulated coke oven gas (COG). The results suggested that the CS of CVTP was increased from 2448 to 3819.2 N, while the porosity of CVTP was decreased from 14.86% to 10.03% with the increase in B2O3 addition amounts. Moreover, the B2O3 mainly existed in the forms of TiB0.024O2 and Fe3BO5 in both CVTP and the reduced CVTP. Specifically, the CS of the reduced CVTP was elevated from 901 to 956.2 N, while the RSI was reduced from 5.87% to 3.81% as the B2O3 addition amounts were increased. Taken together, B2O3 addition would facilitate the aggregation and diffusion of metallic iron particles, which contributed to reducing the formation of metal iron whiskers and weakening the reduction swelling behavior.
