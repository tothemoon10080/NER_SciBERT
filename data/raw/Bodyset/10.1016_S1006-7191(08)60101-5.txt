The thermal dissolved sulfuration technology is brought forward and performed based on the characteristic of low grade lead-zinc oxide ore in lanpin. Using sulfur as the sulphidizing agent in the experiment, the oxides in the sandstone and ignimbrite are changed into sulfides. The disproportionation reaction of sulfur in a solution is confirmed as 4S+3H2O=2S2−+S2O2−
                     3+6H+. The dynamics process is studied and the first-order reaction rate equation -1n(1-α)=k
                     t
                     t is obtained. The effects of the reactive products, stirring speed, dosage of sulfuration agent, value of pH and sulphidizing temperature on the sulfuration of oxide ore are investigated. The results indicate that the reactive apparent activation energy is 100.8 kJ/mol and the sulfuration ratio of lead-zinc oxide ore reaches 60% under the conditions of pH 5.9–7.5, the sulfuration temperature of 130 °C, sulfuration time of 180 min and the stirring speed of 800 r/min.
