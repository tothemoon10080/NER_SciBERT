In this work, Anatase/Rutile mixed-phase titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite powders prepared by sonochemical process which titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) were used as titanium precursor. The as-prepared powders were calcined at different temperature in range of 400 to 1000 째C. TiO2 phase ratio was evaluated by X-ray diffraction technique. Phase transformation of anatase to rutile phase in TiO2 powder was initially obtained by calcined sample at 600 째C. The complete rutile phase was completely occurred at calcination temperature at 800 째C. Photocatalytic activity by TiO2 photocatalysts was analyzed via the decolorization of Rhodamine B dye solution under LED white light irradiation. Anatase/Rutile composite with properly ratio in TiO2 photocatalyst calcined at 700 째C performed the highest photocatalytic activity due to the enhancement of charge transfer at mixed phase interface and the decrease of electron-hole pair recombination.
