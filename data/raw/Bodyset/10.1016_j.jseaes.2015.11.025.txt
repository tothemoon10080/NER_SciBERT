The Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project-hole 1 (WFSD-1) offers a unique opportunity for studying the faulting behavior and the thermal regime of the Longmen Shan fault zone (LMFZ), east margin of Tibetan Plateau. Thermal conductivity of fault rocks within main fault zone shows strong negative interrelations with the porosity, the gamma ray and the P-wave slowness, as well as a positive interrelation with the density. Here we attribute these correlations to the fractures and the rock-fluid reaction generated from the earthquake, which will increase the porosity, the radioactivity and the P-wave slowness as well as decrease the density and the thermal conductivity, synchronously. 15 continuous temperature profiles were summarized in this paper. Based on integrated studies of temperature variations and thermal gradients, local temperature anomalies were detected at three depth ranges of 480–510m, 580–610m and 625–755m, respectively. These anomalies seem to correspond to different fracture zones and may be attributed to fluid flow in the fractures. In addition, the non-uniform vertical distribution of these temperature anomalies was observed across the co-seismic slip surface at 589.2m. In the below ∼200m borehole depth, a prominent thermal anomaly zone was developed, implying more factures were generated in the footwall than the hanging wall during the Wenchuan earthquake. The heat flow ranges from 69mW/m2 to 72mW/m2 for different logs. The persistence of elevated heat flow in the LMFZ appears to rule out frictional heating on the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (YBF) as the source of the WFSD-1 value, but is probably related to the regional tectonic evolution.The May 2008, Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake produced two co-seismic surface ruptures of 270 The WFSD includes five boreholes distributed along the YBF and the GAF, ranging from 550 Up to now, using continuous coring and downhole wireline logging from the WFSD-1, the LMFZ has been extensively studied, such as studies of Principal Slip Zone (PSZ), thermal structure, shear stress, drilling mud gas, clay mineral and permeability ( The Longmen Shan fault zone (LMFZ) at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, adjacent to the Sichuan Basin ( Three mega-thrust faults, YBF, GAF and Wenchuan-Maoxian fault form the main LMFZ ( The WFSD-1 hole intersects through the boundary of the hanging wall of the upper Neoproterozoic Pengguan Complex and the footwall of the Triassic Xujiahe Fm. sedimentary rocks at a depth of ∼589 Most of the geophysical logging was conducted synchronously with the WFSD-1 drilling ( For a reliable determination of heat flow, a correction must be applied to obtain true equilibrium temperatures. Repeat temperature logs from a deep borehole that is still recovering from drilling disturbance allow its equilibrium temperatures to be constrained. It has been shown ( In this study, thermal conductivity measurements were performed for 121 core samples of 8–26 Besides the rock type, the thermal conductivity depends also on pressure, temperature, porosity, and water saturation ( The temperature gradient was calculated at depth intervals of 5 To compare with the thermal gradient determined from the temperature logs, we also calculated the thermal gradient using Fourier’s law and the estimated heat-flow at the bottom of the formation and the thermal conductivity measured on core samples ( The heat flow values at the WFSD-1 were calculated by multiplying temperature gradients from the estimated equilibrium temperatures with thermal conductivities. Both the measured thermal conductivities and the corrected thermal conductivities were used here, respectively ( Because some profiles do not extend throughout the study zone, or were lowered too fast, or were too short, only the best 15 profiles were used for the temperature logging analysis. These shifted profiles show almost the same pattern ( Three abnormal borehole temperature variations were detected respectively in the depth interval between 480–510 From the comparison of different temperature logs (  The collected core samples include different rock types of volcanic, diorite, cataclasite, fault breccia, siltstone and sandstone ( Except for the 400–480 The heat flow values with depth range from 25.9 to 113.8 The logging data, including natural gamma ray, P-wave slowness, porosity and density, were used to study the correlation between thermal conductivity and other physical properties in the WFSD-1. The original data of all physical properties were selected to be consistent with the data collection intervals of thermal conductivity, with depth intervals of 5 Because of high mud weight (1.6 A notable character exists in the correlation between the thermal conductivity and the natural gamma: there is a positive correlation of the data from the Pengguan Complex, whereas a strong negative correlation from the fault gouge layers, the fault cataclasite/breccia layers, and the Xujiahe Fm. ( The P-wave slowness has no correlation with thermal conductivity for both the wall rocks of the Pengguan Complex and the Xujiahe Fm., and has a weak negative correlation for the fault gouge and the breccia ( The thermal conductivities from the WFSD-1 show significant low anomalies in the main fault zone ( Abnormal variations in borehole temperature were detected in the depth intervals between 480 The large fluctuations in the temperature gradient were observed in the 400–480  The main abnormal variations in the temperature profiles and the large fluctuations in the temperature gradient are located in the ∼200 The vertical variation of the observed heat flow in the WFSD-1 is not monotonic, which is inconsistent with the general view that the heat flow should decrease with depth due to the contribution of radiogenic heat production ( The resultant values of 69–72  The elevated trend of the heat flow seems to cross over a distance of only tens of kilometers from the western Sichuan Basin to the LMFZ ( We summarized 15 repeat temperature logs and thermal conductivity measurements of drill cores from the WFSD-1. Three local anomalies were observed in the depth ranges of 480–510 In the layers of the fault gouge and the fault breccia/cataclasite within the main fault zone, a close correlation was found between the thermal conductivity and other geophysical properties such as the porosity, the density, the gamma ray, as well as the P-wave slowness. We attribute this strong correlation to the fractures generated during the earthquake, which will increase the porosity while decreasing the thermal conductivity, the density, the gamma ray, and the P-wave velocity, simultaneously. Yet the negative correlation between the thermal conductivity and the gamma ray in the fault gouge layers is due to the influx of radioactive elements caused by either partial melting or fluid circulation during the earthquake. The main heat flow anomalies occurred in 589–690 This work is financially supported by the
