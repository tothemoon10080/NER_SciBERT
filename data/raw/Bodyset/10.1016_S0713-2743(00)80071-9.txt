Several toxic high volume mineral wastes which are disposed of in Germany in underground facilities in former salt mines have been subjected to a variety of leaching tests (DEV S4, column elution test, cascade test) with respective geological solutions. The objective was to check the aptitude of these tests to predict the long term leaching behaviour in case of water intrusion into the salt mine. Most insight into the reaction pathway is gained by the cascade test in which solid-fluid ratios of 3 to 8 (kg/kg) can be reached which are representative of underground disposal facilities. As cost would render this test unacceptable as a compliance test, model calculation may bridge the gap since good agreement was observed with experimental data from cascade tests. Indispensable parameters are the elemental contents of the waste and their individual leaching rates which in many cases can be determined by single day elution tests such as the DEV S4.
