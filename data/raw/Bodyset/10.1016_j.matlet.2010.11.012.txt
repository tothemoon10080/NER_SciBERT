LiFePO4/C composite with network connections of nano-carbon wires was successfully prepared by using polyvinyl alcohol as carbon source. The composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopic, and its electrochemical performance was investigated by galvanostatic charge and discharge tests. The experimental results show that LiFePO4 grains are tightly connected by the network of nano-carbon wires. Moreover LiFePO4/C composite exhibits high capacity of 168mAhg−1 applied 15mAg−1 current density (C/10), excellent cyclic ability and rate capability. When 1500mAg−1 current density (10C) was applied, the high discharge capacity of 129mAhg−1 has been obtained at room temperature.Since the olivine structure LiFePO From the above reviews, one can understand that the preparation of LiFePO LiFePO The crystal structure and substance phase have been confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000) with Cu Kα radiation. The XRD data were obtained over an angular 2θ range from 15° to 45° with a step size of 0.02° and a constant counting time of 0.2 The prepared powders, acetylene black and polytetrafluorethylene were mixed homogeneously according to a weight ratio of 75:20:5. The mixture was rolled into a thin sheet with uniform thickness, from which pellets were cut as the cathode. In the experiments, the adopted three electrodes battery system consists of the cathode as working electrode, lithium foils as counter and reference electrodes, 1   The discharge curves of LiFePO LiFePO This work was supported by the
