Single Stellite 6 particle was selected as research unit, the impacting characteristic of the particles, deposited on medium carbon steel using supersonic laser deposition (SLD) was studied by the finite element method (FEM), such as the depth and width of the indentation, the temperature and the sizes of impacting particles, and the substrate temperature. Through extracting the coordinate values of the deposition unit, the depth and the width of indentation were obtained after the particle impacted the substrate. Then, the breadth depth ratio was used to analyze the effective range where the particles can be effectively deposited and fitted value. The result shows that the breadth depth ratio range where the particles can be effectively deposited is 1.3~1.5.
