Leaching behaviour of Langkawi black sand was carried out in this study for the recovery of titanium. In order to determine the maximum leaching condition various parameters like effect of leaching time, temperature, concentration of sulfuric acid, solid to liquid ratio and volume of hydrogen peroxide were studied. The experimental data revels that the optimum temperature and time were 80Â°C and 120min, respectively. In addition, 5M sulfuric acid, 2mL of hydrogen peroxide and solid liquid ratio of 0.032W/V showed the best leaching result.
