The oxidation of arsenic from As(III) to As(V) during copper electrorefining was studied. Experimental results showed that during copper electrorefining, the precipitation of impurities As, Sb and Bi in the electrolyte has strong relation with the oxidation. When As(III) and AsT were 5.00g/L and 10.00g/L respectively in the initial electrolyte, after copper electrolysis carried out with current density 235A/m2 at 65°C for 168h, the concentrations of Sb and Bi were decreased 35.0% and 18.2% respectively, while without As(III) in the initial electrolyte, under the same conditions, the concentrations of Sb and Bi weren't decreased but increased 12.5% and 9.1% respectively. It was found that the oxidation of arsenic from As(III) to As(V) plays an important role in the precipitation of impurities As, Sb and Bi in copper electrolyte as well, and the oxidation is applicable to the pseudo-first order kinetic model.During copper electrorefining, if no electrolyte was drawn out from the electrorefining circuit to be purified, the concentrations of impurities arsenic, antimony and bismuth will increase gradually in the electrolyte. Because the standard reduction potentials of Bi, Sb and As are very close to that of Cu, they may deposit on the cathode and affect the cathode quality badly. Therefore, the concentrations of Bi, Sb and As in copper electrolyte must be controlled. To control the impurity concentration in copper electrolyte, the conventional process is multistage electrolytic deposition ( It is well known that arsenic dissolves electrochemically from copper anodes as trivalent ions and then are oxidized to pentavalent ions by the air (O To study the oxidation of arsenic from As(III) to As(V), industrial and synthetic copper electrolytes were used. Sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide solution (30 The Sb(III) and Bi(III) added into the electrolytes were respectively prepared by dissolving Sb The copper starting sheet and industrial anode copper used in the experiments were taken from Daye Smelter. The anode was casted according to experimental demand, and its composition was listed in The composition of experimental samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Intrepid II XSP). The valence of the elements was determined by standard chemical methods ( Electrolysis using two industrial anode samples (103 The experiments were all carried out for 168 To investigate the effect of As(III) oxidation on copper electrolyte self‐purification during electrorefining, the 1# and 2# electrolytes listed in The composition of the anode slime formed in the 2# electrolyte was listed in Though As(V) plays an important role in the homogeneous precipitation of impurities As, Sb and Bi in copper electrolyte during copper electrorefining ( During copper electrorefining, the As(III) in copper electrolyte is gradually oxidized to As(V), and many factors affect As(III) oxidation, such as Cu During copper electrorefining, quantities of Cu It was well known that reaction-controlled process can be judged by the reaction temperature coefficient, which is the ratio of rate constants of a reaction at two different temperatures which differ by 10 In Moreover, it was confirmed that the change of As(III) concentration shown in During copper electrorefining, As(III) was gradually oxidized to As(V) in copper electrolyte. To maintain As(III) concentration constant in the electrolyte, the As(III) solution was continuously added into the electrolyte according to the oxidation rate of As(III). The 3# electrolyte listed in The composition of anode slime formed in the 3# electrolyte was shown in It has been well documented that Sb(V) plays a substantial role in the formation of floating slimes, and the quantity of floating slime increases with the increase of Sb(V) concentration in copper electrolyte (  Experimental results showed that the oxidation of arsenic from As(III) to As(V) plays an important role in copper electrolyte self-purification as well. When the initial copper electrolyte contains As The project was sponsored by the
