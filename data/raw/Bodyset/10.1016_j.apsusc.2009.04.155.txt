Two-step anodic oxidation of aluminum is generally employed to produce the ordered porous anodized alumina (PAA). Dissolving away (striping) the oxide film after the first anodizing step plays a key role in the final arrangement of nano-pores. In this work, different striping durations between 1 and 6h were applied to the sample that was initially anodized at a constant voltage of 40V at 17°C for 15h. The striping duration of 3h was realized as the optimum time for achieving the best ordering degree for the pores. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used during and at the end of the process to examine the cross section and finishing surface of the specimens. Linear-angular fast Fourier transform (LA-FFT), an in-house technique based on MATLAB software, was employed to assess the ordering degree of the anodized samples.Porous anodic alumina (PAA) film has recently attracted the attention of scientists because of its self-organizing nature of the vertical (cylindrical) pores in the form of hexagonal arrays, which provides controlled and narrow distribution of pore diameters and inter-pore distances in addition to the possibility of forming the pores with extremely high aspect ratio Electrochemical method, as a template-directed synthesis method, has been widely used in the fabrication of nanomaterials and nanostructures for many applications including quantum-dot arrays, magnetic materials, and photo-catalysts due to its interesting and useful features Despite the simplicity of the fabrication of AAO, processes that take place during porous-type anodizing in acidic electrolytes are complex There is a relationship between the evolution of the layer thickness and the surface brightness during the STP in a two-step anodizing practice. The thickness remains constant for a while and then drops to zero, at the same time, brightness increases The relationship between the thickness and the quality of the AAO films formed in the first step has been already established by the researchers Circular sheet samples of pure aluminum (99.95%, Merck) were degreased in acetone for 10 According to our previous experiments During all mentioned processes, electrochemical cell was maintained in a water bath (Lauda, RE 106) to keep temperature constant, typically within ±0.5 Linear-angular fast Fourier transform (LA-FFT), an in-house developed technique based on MATLAB software, was employed to assess the ordering degree of the anodized samples As a second step, in LA-FFT technique, points with magnitudes from 25 to 100% of maximum intensity of FFT images are selected and plotted in polar coordinate. Each line in this pattern is obtained by connecting each pair of FFT intensity magnitudes; and the angles are calculated with respect to the line connected two points, which have maximum intensity (pair of maximum FFT intensity magnitude). The mentioned pattern, which can be used to exhibit the symmetry in FFT images, is a processed FFT image with an experimental lower percentage threshold (for example 25%) to eliminate smaller domains, distorted regions on the boundary of domains and also small dusty areas from the images to give us a better view about the rotational distribution of smaller domains with respect to greatest domain (maximum intensity of FFT images). Derived from this method, the highest ordering of nano-pore, which corresponds to single domain, is signified as three lines or three groups of overlapped lines having the angles of 60° with respect to each other. On the contrary, as mentioned in the literature Considering the steps which are sequentially done in LA-FFT method, and also their mathematical concurrency, reasonable results are expected.   As mentioned in the literature   Linear FFT pattern images of In order to further support the ordering results from 2D-FFT images, angle histograms were plotted as According to 2D-FFT images ( An appropriate concave pattern of the first oxide layer on the aluminum substrate prior to second anodizing step, can lead to the formation of highly ordered AAO. This remaining periodic concave pattern can be attained by optimizing the stripping (STP) conditions. Excessive STP could damage the aluminum surface, while disturbing oxide layer would remain after too short STP time. In this work, the optimum STP duration for the anodizing conditions was found to be 3
