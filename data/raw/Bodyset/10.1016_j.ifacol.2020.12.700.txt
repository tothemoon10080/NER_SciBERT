Soft-sensor technique is often used to estimate key variables in industrial manufacturing, of which the commonly used approaches as the first-principle modeling and data-driven modeling both have their limitations. To take full advantage of the modeling methods and overcome the problems of unmodeled dynamics in industrial manufacturing, a grey-box modeling method combining the first-principle analysis with dynamic data-driven model is developed in this paper. In the framework of the presented grey-box model, the unmodeled dynamics in the first-principle model are obtained by the dynamic probabilistic latent variable model. On this basis, availability of models can be improved. Finally, the actual industrial data in the roller kiln of ternary cathode material manufacturing is used for simulation to verify the validity of the model. The results have practical guiding significance.
