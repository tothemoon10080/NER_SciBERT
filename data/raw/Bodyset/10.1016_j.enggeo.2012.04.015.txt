This paper deals with sandy aquifers. It explains how to use parameters of borehole samples, and data of mechanical tests performed in boreholes, to assess the in situ values of porosity. The concepts of maximum and minimum void ratios, e
                     max and e
                     min, are presented with the results of studies trying to predict their values. Predictive equations are proposed to link the values of e
                     max and e
                     min to that of the coefficient of uniformity C
                     U of the grain size distribution curve, and the roundness factor RF of solid particles. Once the values of e
                     max and e
                     min have been estimated, those of the in situ void ratio e and porosity n can be assessed from the data of in situ mechanical tests, for example split spoon tests. An example evaluation is presented for an unconfined sand aquifer, which was investigated using boreholes, field tests, laboratory tests, slug tests in monitoring wells, and a long-term pumping test.In thick sandy aquifers, which are investigated and sampled using boreholes, hydraulic conductivity This paper examines first the sampling quality issues for boreholes in sandy aquifers. Then, the concepts of maximum and minimum void ratios, The focus of the paper is sandy aquifer samples taken in boreholes. Problems related to sampling in tests pits are not covered in detail but are used here for comparisons. In this paper, the soil definition is that used for engineering or construction materials. It is not that used in soil science, which corresponds to “top soil” or “organic soil” in engineering. Therefore, the aquifer soils examined hereafter do not contain organic matter, and have a single porosity (no fissures or secondary porosity that may be due to weathering effects or biological intrusions). In order to assess the quality of any parameter such as the in situ porosity Selecting and using a drilling method, Performing in situ mechanical resistance tests, Selecting a sampling method and taking a soil sample, Conserving and transporting the soil sample, Preparing specimens for laboratory tests, Selecting appropriate testing methods and equipments, Performing correctly the tests and, Interpreting correctly the test data. This paper does not cover all the quality issues related to the eight steps above. It examines mainly those related to sampling sandy aquifers and interpreting both field and laboratory test data. Several geotechnical documents (e.g., Class-1 is for a sample in which no, or only slight disturbance, of the in situ soil structure has occurred during sampling. The water content and the void ratio of the soil correspond to those in situ. No change in constituents or in the chemical composition has occurred. Obtaining class-1 samples is only possible for clays without secondary porosity: it requires an appropriate non-destructive drilling technique and a thin wall piston sampler of 73 Class-5 is for grab, composite samples taken in tests pits or by auger. These sampling techniques can provide the main stratigraphy but not the detailed stratigraphy (at the decimetre or centimetre scale). The composite samples of non-cohesive soils can be used to obtain some average GSDC. Chunks of cohesive soils can be used to determine the Atterberg limits and the GSDC, but the evaluation of the in situ water content is questionable. The density index and the in situ soil density cannot be determined. The samples, if tested in the laboratory, do not provide exact values of the in situ permeability and mechanical parameters. Test pits are frequently used to assess sand and gravel deposits, especially those that will provide construction materials. Excavating, transporting and storing such soils in borrow pits involve many operations, which will have thoroughly mixed all layers and sub-layers at the end of the process (before using the material for construction) and thus, the GSDC of composite samples in test pits is deemed adequate. However, more detailed sampling is needed for environmental and ground water projects. The detailed stratigraphy in a test pit may be exposed by cleaning excavated faces and cutting the sediments with a stainless steel blade (shovel or trowel). The exposed detailed stratigraphy is mapped using geometric measurements and photographs. Each sub-layer can then be sampled to obtain its GSDC. Frequently, using meticulous hand excavation, a horizontal platform can be prepared for each sub-layer, which enables measuring the in situ density and water content using either a nuclear probe or an older mass-and-volume density measurement technique. In boreholes, only special techniques such as slow freezing (e.g., In sand deposits, a tube sampler incorporating a clear plastic liner can be used, for example with a hollow stem auger. This sampling tool is interesting because it provides continuous sampling with visual access to the sand sample. However, it does not provide class-1 or − In short, the remoulded sample quality makes it difficult to estimate the in situ porosity When the GSDC of a sand sample is known, can we know also its total porosity? Most of the time, in fact each time a disturbed sample is taken (classes 3–4–5), the answer is no, because the GSDC alone does not provide indication on how much the in situ soil has been compacted by either natural or man-made processes. From physics and soil mechanics, we know that the field porosity of sand is comprised between some minimum and maximum values. In the case of equal spheres, crystallography teaches that the simple cubic packing porosity is 25.95% whereas the hexagonal packing porosity is 47.64% ( Many disciplines, such as powder technology and civil engineering, have studied the range achieved by the porosity, because this is a key factor for transporting soils and grains, making high-performance cement-concrete and asphalt-concrete (e.g., The extreme values of porosity can be obtained using precise requirements and very detailed laboratory procedures to avoid known pitfalls such as container wall effect ( An estimate of the in situ porosity The first step is to verify that the sample GSDC is representative and thus reliable. Several criteria are used for quality assessment: recovery percentage close to 100%, verification that two layers have not been mixed during sampling, verification of the risk of migration of fines within the sample, etc. Guidance and practical tools for assessing the sample GSDC quality are given in To determine the extreme values taken by the porosity or the void ratio of a soil, several data must be collected on the GSDC and the geometric characteristics of solid particles. The grain sphericity is a measure of how close to a sphere the grain is. The grain roundness is the degree of smoothing due to abrasion of particles ( To facilitate the determination of both sphericity and roundness factor, With respect to porosity, Several disciplines have studied the maximum and minimum void ratios of non-cohesive soils (e.g., Some correlations exist between The charts of In Eq. Eqs. Considering previously available equations, Since they involve different parameters, Eqs. This can be done using penetration resistance data or mechanical test data, which will yield an estimate of Using the dry density, Several authors (  More recently, As a result, taking the most recent Eqs. All the required equations are now gathered for evaluating the in situ value of The Lachenaie unconfined aquifer consists of 3.1 to 3.6 The in situ void ratio Without calculation, the in situ The sand grains were sub-angular ( The sand sampled in excavations at the water table had water contents Therefore, the three methods provided similar in situ For the Lachenaie unconfined sand, using each GSDC and in situ Groundwater seepage is important for many geotechnical and environmental problems, especially groundwater contamination in aquifers and engineered facilities for solid or liquid waste storage. Seepage is directly related to the hydraulic conductivity This paper has shown how to assess the in situ porosity or void ratio of sand-and-gravel aquifers, using samples taken in boreholes. All studies agree that the usual sampling techniques for sand and gravel in boreholes never provide class-1 quality samples, but most often class-3 or ‐4 samples (class-2 is obtained using special drilling methods and the slow freezing technique). The porosity of most sand samples gives no indication of in situ porosity. In addition, drilling and sampling techniques modify in situ stresses and porosity: estimating the in situ porosity using in-hole geophysical tools is highly questionable. However, if a sample is classified as representative after a few verifications, its grain size distribution curve (GSDC) and the roundness factor Finally, when predicting the In addition, the predicted The correction for temperature can be done using Eq. This temperature correction, however, does not take into account the influence of salinity on water viscosity. The anisotropy correction is only that for homogenous samples. Natural soils, even the homogenous ones, are known to develop some anisotropic permeability during deposition and densification (e.g., For sandy soils, the The high values of The
