The objective of the research is to find solutions to reuse of end-of-life vehicles and household appliances (ELV and ELHA). On the basis of the working principle of shredders, the experimental shredding installation for Light Metal Scrap (LMS) was constructed. With the help of a photoelectrical microscope with 50 times magnifying power, the feature of LMS surface appearance, including surface scratches, was acquired before and after testing, respectively. Through analyses of experimental results, some general conclusions were reached which those small cracks, in the surface of LMS that are continually struck by Impacting tools, formed during manufacture, originate very severe concentrations of stress and strain; the concentrations of stress and strain induce stability loss, extension, connection, perforation of small cracks on the surface of LMS; after that single fragments (200mmx200mm) are torn off from the large plate-shaped of LMS. Under the guidance of analytical Study, damaging and shredding modes of LMS are investigated by using experiments. The successful investigation of shredding model of ELV and ELHA will build the models of their shredding process.
