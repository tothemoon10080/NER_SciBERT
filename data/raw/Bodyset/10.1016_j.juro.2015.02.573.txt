Air bubbles trapped in shockwave lithotripsy coupling gel may contribute to the decreased stone comminution efficacy of contemporary lithotripters compared to the original HM3. We have developed a novel wet coupling technique and evaluated its impact on stone comminution in an electromagnetic lithotripter. The shockwave source of a Modularis electromagnetic lithotripter was fitted with a custom-designed, open-ended bellow allowing direct water-skin contact while adhering to the patient with a suction seal. The standard coupling was also tested with ultrasound gel applied in a spiral and bolus method. In-vitro comminution was performed in a torso model using hard Begostone phantoms treated at E2.5 for 1000 shocks at 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency. Percent comminution (fragments < 2 mm) was measured, and analyzed using ANOVA and Bonferroni corrected t-tests. For each coupling method, 14 trials were performed. Unlike the spiral method, the bolus method produced minimal air defects while wet coupling ensured a perfect acoustic interface. Comminution (mean ± SD) was 30 ± 11% for the spiral method, 65 ± 20% for the bolus method, and 66 ± 15% for the wet coupling. The spiral method was significantly less effective than the bolus and wet coupling (p < 0.001). No statistical difference was observed between the bolus and wet coupling methods (p = 0.82). The performance of contemporary lithotripters depends critically on the quality of shockwave source-patient coupling interface. A novel wet coupling design is developed to overcome the vulnerability and inconsistency of gel coupling, ensuring an effective shockwave transmission through the coupling interface with improved lithotripsy efficacy.
