 The chloride medium was already used in the sixteenth century on amalgamation of silver but cuprous chloride was used for direct precipitation of silver sulphide only in 1860 [  in reality it is a complicated multistage process controlled by the heterogeneous kinetics of interaction of the solid phase with a leaching medium containing a combination of different ions in different and dynamically changing concentration ratios. In addition, as shown in many experimental studies, the addition of further chlorides results in a change in the activity of the ions present there as a result of the formation of chloride complexes [ Solubility of CuCl in cold water is very low, only around 60 The increase of the NaCl concentration results in an almost linear increase of the solubility of CuCl. On the other hand, in more complex systems, the effect of the presence of other chlorides may differ – for example, the addition of FeCl Similarly, the solubility of CuCl Another factor affecting the solubility of individual chlorides is temperature. Its effect is stronger in the case of CuCl From the viewpoint of the leaching process, the oxidation potential of the leaching agent is an important parameter. One of the factors which make the chloride method attractive is that the oxidation potential of the bivalent copper ion in the chloride medium (4 It is also important to note that the oxidation potential of other ions in the chloride medium differs from their standard potential. For example, the reversible potential of the Cu On the other hand, the reversible potentials of the ions in the chloride medium are strongly affected by the formation of complexes. However, this means that all essential conditions for the reactions are formed in the leaching process: a relatively dramatic change of the concentration of the individual ions in different leaching stages and large changes of their reversible potentials. In addition to the fact that the formation of chlorine complexes has a strong effect on the solubility of chlorides of the individual ions, the redox potential of the leaching solution also changes greatly. Winand [ According to Muir [ This means that the calculated value of the potential for a solution consisting of 4.5 The above mentioned facts – the formation of chlorocomplexes and the variation of the oxidation potentials – may also be described by the potential–pH diagrams. Thermodynamic studies show that the precipitation of CuCl Another result is the one which shows that whilst the potential of the trivalent iron ion gradually decreases with increasing Cl The process of leaching of copper sulphides in a chloride medium takes place by the electrochemical mechanism. In a strong oxidising medium part of sulphur oxidises to sulphate according to the equation: However, the majority of chalcopyrite sulphur transfers to the elemental form In a less oxidation medium CuS may precipitate according to the equation Using the Fe and cathodic reactions The rate-controlling step of these reactions are surface phenomena, and the rate also depends on the overall concentration If the redox pair is formed by Cu However, this reaction may not take place to the end because it may not take place in the reverse direction, as indicated, but the resultant elemental sulphur may be reduced in accordance with the reaction: The high value of the Cu If the oxidation conditions in the solution are stronger than those ensured by the redox pair Fe and The disadvantages which must be taken into account in this case are:  The rate of the reaction on the fresh surface is high but greatly reduces after the formation of a thin chalcocite or bornite layer. It was found [ The probable reaction is Another method of ‘activation’ consists of heating chalcopyrite together with elemental sulphur [ However, it has been proven unambiguously that the rate of the process greatly increases if the process takes place simultaneously with dissolution of iron [ Electrochemical studies of anodic leaching of sulphides of copper chalcocite and digenite [ The leaching agent may be regenerated after extracting a metal by oxidation of Fe The ions Cu Hydrochloric acid may also be regenerated by spraying roasted chlorides in accordance with the reaction: By comparing the method of chloride leaching with conventional sulphate leaching we can define certain potential advantages of the chloride methods: easier leaching of complex chloride concentrations; transfer of sulphur to elemental form; obtaining of concentrated chloride solutions; the metal can be extracted from the solution by liquid extraction; regeneration of the solution is simple by oxidation with oxygen or chlorine; iron can be precipitated from the solution. However, the main problems associated with chloride processes were defined especially on the basis of pilot plant experience [ leaching in a chloride medium is not sufficiently selective and at mixtures or conventional impurities are highly soluble in the leaching medium so that recirculation and cleaning of the leaching agent (bleed stream) should be included in the technological cycle; final process produce copper in the form of granules or powder copper with a large specific surface increasing the risk of contamination; in addition, to improve the saleability of the product it is often necessary to remelt or compact the copper; high current density is essential in electrolysis – on the one hand, this results in a decrease of capital expenditure but on the other hand increases production costs because the saving of energy in comparison with sulphate electrolyte is not as large as expected; solutions of copper chlorides may contain larger fractions of selenium, tellurium and in particular silver because cleaning of the solutions to remove these mixtures is associated with design of electrolytes for electrolysis from a chloride medium is complicated and expensive; in contrast to sulphate solutions, chlorine may precipitate on the anode instead of oxygen – because of its toxicity and corrosivity chlorine must be permanently and efficiently removed; relatively high vapour tension of chlorides from acid chloride solutions requires a large and efficient extraction system trapping the resultant chlorides followed by their processing; in comparison with the sulphate solution, the corrosion strength of chloride solutions is considerably higher and these solutions require special materials for apparatus and support or transport systems, of course this has a detrimental affect on capital expenditure; leaching residue from the chloride processes represent a potential environmental risk and require additional processing thus increasing the total production costs. However, in any case the processes of chloride hydrometallurgy represent at present time the latest trend in the processing of chalcopyrite concentrates. The main representatives of these advanced procedures are the processes Outokumpu HydroCopper and Intec.
