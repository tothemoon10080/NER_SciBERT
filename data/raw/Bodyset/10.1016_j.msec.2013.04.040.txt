Magnetic poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)/Fe3O4 composite nanofibers were prepared with the purpose to develop a substrate for bone regeneration. To increase the dispersibility of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the PLLA matrix, a modified chemical co-precipitation method was applied to synthesize Fe3O4 NPs in the presence of PLLA. Trifluoroethanol (TFE) was used as the co-solvent for all the reagents, including Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts, sodium hydroxide, and PLLA. The co-precipitated Fe3O4 NPs were surface-coated with PLLA and demonstrated good dispersibility in a PLLA/TFE solution. The composite nanofiber electrospun from the solution displayed a homogeneous distribution of Fe3O4 NPs along the fibers using various contents of Fe3O4 NPs. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and vibration sample magnetization (VSM) analysis confirmed that the co-precipitation process had minor adverse effects on the crystal structure and saturation magnetization (Ms) of Fe3O4 NPs. The resulting PLLA/Fe3O4 composite nanofibers showed paramagnetic properties with Ms directly related to the Fe3O4 NP concentration. The cytotoxicity of the magnetic composite nanofibers was determined using in vitro culture of osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) in extracts and co-culture on nanofibrous matrixes. The PLLA/Fe3O4 composite nanofibers did not show significant cytotoxicity in comparison with pure PLLA nanofibers. On the contrary, they demonstrated enhanced effects on cell attachment and proliferation with Fe3O4 NP incorporation. The results suggested that this modified chemical co-precipitation method might be a universal way to produce magnetic biodegradable polyester substrates containing well-dispersed Fe3O4 NPs. This new strategy opens an opportunity to fabricate various kinds of magnetic polymeric substrates for bone tissue regeneration.Bone injuries and defects remain a significant problem in clinical therapy. Compared to conventional therapies, bone tissue engineering offers a new and promising approach for bone repair and regeneration, and has developed rapidly in recent years Concerning the collagen nanofibrous networks in the native ECM, a strategy to design biomimetic nanofibrous scaffolds has attracted considerable attention in recent years Studies have shown that static magnetic fields can alter cell proliferation, migration, and orientation In view of the advantageous features of both the nanofibrous networks and the magnetic fields, researchers have begun to combine magnetic components into biodegradable nanofibers to produce paramagnetic nanofibrous composite scaffolds Among all polymeric materials, biodegradable lactide-based polyesters are the most extensively used biomaterials in tissue engineering Poly( A modified chemical co-precipitation method was proposed to form Fe Fe Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were recorded using a FTIR spectroscope (Nicolet 6700, USA) with the wavenumber ranging from 4000 to 400 MC3T3-E1, a mouse calvaria-derived cell line, was purchased from Cell Culture Center, Peking Union Medical College (China).
