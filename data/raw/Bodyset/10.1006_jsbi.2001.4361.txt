Properties of the echinoderm skeleton are under biological control, which is exerted in part by the organic matrix embedded in the mineralized part of the skeleton. This organic matrix consists of proteins and glycoproteins whose carbohydrate component is specifically involved in the control mechanisms. The saccharide moiety of the organic matrix of the spines of the echinoid Paracentrotus lividus was characterized using enzyme-linked lectin assays (ELLAs). O-glycoproteins, different types of complex N-glycoproteins, and terminal sialic acids were detected. Sialic acids are known to interact with Ca ions and could play an important role in the mineralization process. Some of the carbohydrate components detected by ELLAs as well as two organic matrix proteins (SM30 and SM50) were localized within different subregions of the spine skeleton using field-emission scanning electron microscopy. The mappings show that some of these components are not homogeneously distributed in the different skeletal subregions. For example, some N-glycoproteins were preferentially located in the putative amorphous subregion of the skeleton, whereas some O-glycoproteins were localized in the subregion where skeletal growth is inhibited. These results suggest that the biological control exerted on the skeletal properties can be partly modulated by local differences in the organic matrix composition.
