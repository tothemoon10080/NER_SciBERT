Rock magnetic and mineralogical analyses were performed on fragments and matrix of six fault breccias from the Zhaojiagou outcrop of Yingxiu–Beichuan Fault, which was the main fault ruptured during the 2008 Wenchuan Mw7.9 earthquake, at Leigu Town, Beichuan County, Sichuan Province (China). The matrix, which is generally enriched in dolomite, feldspar and clay minerals, but depleted in calcite, has much higher low-field magnetic susceptibility and magnetization, and lower coercivity in comparison with fragments and bulk samples. Magnetic behavior of the bulk samples and fragments is dominated by dia-/paramagnetic components, in contrast, small amounts of partially oxidized magnetite and lepidocrocite are present in the matrix. A simple conceptual model associating faulting-related effects was proposed to explain these significant differences in magnetic properties of fragments and matrix. During coseismic slip, intense shear may crush the pre-existing magnetic grains in fault rocks into finer ones; while stress and frictional heating, to a little extent, induce magnetic changes and thermochemical alterations of magnetic mineralogy in fault breccias, respectively. During interseismic periods, meteoric fluids would infiltrate and percolate into fault zone, and cause dissolution, precipitation and recrystallization of Fe-bearing minerals. As the diverse permeability structure and grain size of fragments and matrix, these effects would modify their magnetic mineralogy at various levels. Consequently, faulting-related effects, especially the fluid movements, taking place over many previous earthquake cycles, would be the most likely reasons for the observed different magnetic properties in fragments and matrix. It further proposes that magnetic studies of fault breccias would provide clues to help understand seismic faulting and history of fault activity.The fault core, which is considered to represent fault zone in the seismogenic regime ( Despite the wealth of data about fault cores and related rocks, to date, magnetic properties of fault rocks are still scarce ( In a previous paper, The Longmenshan (LMS) thrust belt, about 500 At the Zhaojiagou village (31.81°N, 104.43°E), Leigu Town, Beichuan County, the fracture zone of YBF extends laterally about 8 Microstructure of fault rocks is shown in Fifteen hand samples, including host rock, fault breccias and gouge, collected crossing the fault zone at this site, were magnetically studied by The diagnostic character of fault breccias is the fragments-embedded-in-matrix texture ( In the laboratory, fragments and matrix of these breccias were separated following the procedure of The low-field (200 Low-temperature magnetic measurements were performed using a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS XL-7, Quantum Design), to help for discriminating magnetic minerals. A low-temperature saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (LT-SIRM) was acquired in a 2.5 Mineralogical composition of samples, including host rock, fault gouge, bulk breccia, fragments and matrix, was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Unoriented, hand-powdered sample was scanned over a 2θ range of 3–70° with CuKα radiation (0.15418 XRD analysis identifies quartz, dolomite, calcite, feldspar and clay minerals as major minerals in samples ( Magnetic properties of the host rock, gouge, and six pairs of fragments and matrix are compiled in Bulk samples and fragments from the footwall exhibit dominantly paramagnetic behavior as indicated by χ Generally, the matrix samples show the most enhanced M Upon heating, magnetic susceptibility of bulk samples and fragments starts to increase above 400 LT-SIRM demagnetization curves are shown in As evident from the above magnetic measurements, bulk samples and fragments from the footwall damaged zone are dominated by paramagnetic components, and those in hanging-wall damaged zone have a strong diamagnetic contribution. In contrary, clear hysteresis closed below 0.1 Temperature-dependent (high- and low-temperature) magnetic measurements would provide further clues of magnetic mineralogy. Thermomagnetic analysis showed that magnetic susceptibility peaks between 420–450 In contrast to bulk samples and fragments, matrix samples show significant rise and drop in magnetic susceptibility between 250 and 350 Taken together, iron-bearing silicates and carbonates would be major magnetic carriers for the bulk breccias and fragments, while only very small amounts of ferrimagnetic minerals are present in the matrix. The latter is confirmed by hysteresis loops ( As mentioned above, magnetic measurements have revealed significant differences in magnetic properties between breccia matrix and fragments, which are essentially indicative of the different forming mechanisms and/or sources of magnetic minerals, and further linked to faulting-related effects. At present, mechanisms of magnetic changes during fault rock formation are not yet fully understood; however, candidate faulting-related mechanisms which might cause such differences and their possibilities are discussed below. Stress-induced magnetic changes. The available studies have proved that the stress/strain could significantly affect rock magnetic properties in a variety of ways (e.g., Crush of pre-existing magnetic grains into finer grains. It is believed that the fault core evolves by grain comminution mostly consisting of early bulk fragmentation and late abrasion of grains ( Frictional heating induced thermochemical reactions. Frictional heating, which constitutes the largest part of the total seismic energy budget, is frequently generated by shear friction with a high slip rate during a large earthquake ( Chemical alteration and neomineralization due to fluid movement within the fault zone. Breccia zone is generally considered to be highly permeable because of fracturing and subsidiary faulting, and to serve as conduits for fluid flow ( In summary, it is possible to propose a simple conceptual model associating the significant magnetic differences in the fragments and matrix of breccias. During coseismic slip events, intense shear may crush the pre-existing magnetic grains in fault rocks into finer grains, meanwhile, stress/strain and frictional heating may affect magnetic properties of fault breccias to a little extent. During inter-seismic periods, meteoric fluids infiltrate and percolate into fault zone and would cause dissolution, precipitation and recrystallization of Fe-bearing minerals. Due to the different permeability structure and grain size of breccia fragments and matrix, these alteration effects would significantly modify magnetic mineralogy in matrix, to a much lesser extent in fragments. Consequently, here the magnetic differences in the fragments and matrix may reflect a cumulative nature taking place over many previous earthquake cycles that occurred along the LMS thrust belt zone ( Rock magnetic and mineralogical analyses were conducted on pairs of fragments and matrix of fault breccias from the Zhaojiagou outcrop on the Yingxiu–Beichuan Fault, ruptured during the 2008 Wenchuan Mw This study was supported by the
