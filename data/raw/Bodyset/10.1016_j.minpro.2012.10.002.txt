The Bond work index, W
                     i, is defined in a Bond ball mill on the samples of standard size −3.327+0mm. In practice, it is possible to find materials of non-standard size that are finer than 3.327mm.
                  In this work, a procedure for the calculation of the Bond work index is suggested for cases when the Bond grindability test is conducted on samples of non-standard size.The Bond grindability test for determining the Bond work index, This test simulates a closed circuit of dry grinding of samples of standard size at − F.C. Bond suggested that a comparative screen should be chosen which, in the standard test, gives a grinding product of approximately the same size as the industrial mill ( Previous test results showed that the Bond work index changed with changing the size of the grinding material Our examinations showed that In the practice of comminution, materials that are finer than 3.327 In order to obtain the correct answer to this question, the In Based on data taken from a large number of experiments conducted on various materials and ores, it was found that: The value of the coefficient The test results given in The product Therefore, for a sample of non-standard size (a sample finer size than − As an example, the test on the sample of quartzite at size − The calculated value for Comparable values of The results presented in It is possible that by using the procedure relating to defining the Bond work index Some of the results used in this work were obtained during work on the projects: TR 33023 — Development of the Technology for the Copper Ore and Precious Metals Flotation Processing for the Sake of Achieving better Technological Results and TR 33007 — Implementation of Advanced Technological and Ecological Solutions in Existing Product Systems of Copper Mine Bor and Copper Mine Majdanpek.
