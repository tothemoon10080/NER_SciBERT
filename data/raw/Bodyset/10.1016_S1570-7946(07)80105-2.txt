In this study models were developed based on population balances which included the effects of redistribution of material of different composition classes and particle sizes with four configuration alternatives of grinding and classification circuits (grinding, grinding-classification, classification-grinding, classification-grinding-classification). The models for all these configurations were linear in character, and applicable in design or retrofit strategies in which there is an influence of particle size and composition in the recovery of materials such as in separation of plastics from metals and the recovery of ferromagnetic materials in the recycling industry, as well as in the separation of materials in treatments of urban solid wastes, refining of pharmaceutical products, and in the mineral industry. As an example of application, one of the models is incorporated into a strategy for the design of flotation circuits.
