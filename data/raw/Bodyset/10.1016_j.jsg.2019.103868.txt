Structural, mineralogical and geochronological data were collected from two brittle fault zones (Fault I and II) deforming the Ordovician Rolvsnes granodiorite in SW Norway. Microstructurally-constrained K–Ar data from cohesive damage zone samples are compared to bulk K–Ar data from fault gouges from the adjacent fault cores. In Fault I, fluid ingress along the fault core caused pervasive alteration of the host granodiorite. Plagioclase and biotite are almost completely altered to kaolinite, quartz, illite and smectite. In Fault II, a complex deformation history is recorded by multiple fault rock microdomains, including an ultracataclasite with >50% authigenic illite and an illite/jarosite-bearing pseudotachylyte. Microdomains hosting authigenic illite (±jarosite) from both studied faults were separated, characterized mineralogically and dated by K–Ar. Results confirm that each domain contains only one generation of authigenic illite (±jarosite), and provide robust time constraints on fault initiation in the Carboniferous (339 ± 8 Ma) and reactivation in the Permian (289 ± 6 Ma). K–Ar geochronology of the adjacent fault gouges yields inclined age-versus-grain-size relationships. The ages of the coarsest grain size fractions are similar to the age range of the damage zone data, whereas the ages of the finer fractions are significantly younger. Our study provides new and important insights into the dynamics of long-lived fault zones: Isotopic signatures and structural features representative of fault initiation are preserved in the damage zones, while they are progressively overprinted due to cumulative strain localization in the fault cores. Finally, our study further clarifies the significance of ‘age plateaus’ in age-versus-grain-size plots, which allows for a robust and geologically meaningful interpretation of K–Ar data.Brittle fault zones are the expression of localized slip in response to the accommodation of tectonic stresses in the lithosphere. Such fault zones are generally composed of a fault core, which accommodates most of the displacement and hosts brittle fault rocks, and an associated damage zone, where the density of brittle deformation features decreases away from the fault core ( Studies aiming at constraining the age of movement in brittle fault zones generally concentrate on fault rocks from the fault core, where the K-bearing phyllosilicate illite, which is amenable to K–Ar dating (e.g., If a fault rock solely contains one generation of authigenic illite, the age-versus-grain-size spectrum derived from the dating of multiple grain size fractions is a flat ‘age plateau’ whereby the ages of all dated grain size fractions are identical and the dated authigenic K-bearing mineral phases formed during one single phase of deformation. Age plateaus in K–Ar grain-size spectra are, however, rarely obtained, especially when dealing with faults in geologically old basement terranes, which are prone to multiple episodes of deformation (e.g., All the aspects above, however, may be effectively tackled, and a solid background to a reliable interpretation of K–Ar fault rock data provided, if K–Ar geochronology is performed on K-bearing phases that are extracted from well-constrained microstructural domains containing clear textural relationships between the authigenic and the pre-faulting phases (cf. Here, we present a case study from two fault zones located in SW Norway (Bømlo archipelago), which highlights the usefulness of linking microstructural investigations of fault rock with spatially-controlled dating of carefully separated authigenic mineral phases to improve the understanding of K–Ar fault rock data and the reliability of their interpretation. Our study of the two faults demonstrates that K–Ar age plateaus, constraining only the earliest increments of fault evolution, are preserved in cohesive rock specimens from the fault damage zones, whereas incohesive fault rocks from the fault cores contain age components tracking the entire fault history, from initiation to reactivation, and the effects of rock interaction with infiltrating reactive fluids. Our study area lies within a recently investigated c. 50 km The studied faults are located in coastal SW Norway ( By the Mid-Late Ordovician (c. 460 Ma), the granodiorite had cooled to below 300–400 °C and, since then, resided at high structural levels ( The two studied fault zones outcrop in well-exposed road sections located along the eastern and western coastline of the Rubbestadneset peninsula ( Fault I is characterized by a gently curved fault plane, which changes orientation from steeply E-dipping in the west to steeply SSE-dipping in the east and is associated with strike-slip lineations ( Fault II is a moderately NE-dipping normal fault whose core hosts an up to 60 cm thick, dark-green to black lens of clay-rich fault gouge ( Under the microscope, seven different fault rock domains and seven different types of calcite mineralizations could be recognized and mapped ( The modal composition of each fault rock domain ( All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) mineralogical quantification and dated by K–Ar at the NGU (Geological Survey of Norway), except FC-2 which was analyzed at CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia). The detailed description of the analytical approach used at the NGU and the analytical details of the CSIRO laboratory are provided as supporting material to this paper ( A total of six samples were chosen for K–Ar geochronology ( The two gouge samples from the fault cores yielded five grain size fractions (<0.1, 0.1–0.4, 0.4–2, 2–6, 6–10 μm; except the largest fraction of FC-2), while the four samples from the damage zones contained enough material only for the three coarsest grain size fractions ( XRD analysis of each dated fraction (except the <0.1 μm fraction of FC-1) shows that illite is the dominant K-bearing phase in all samples ( K–Ar ages from the damage zone of Fault I (DZ-1a/b, All six K–Ar ages constraining cogenetic growth of illite and jarosite in the two micro-domains of site II (DZ-2a/b, The microstructurally-constrained dating of cohesive rock specimens from the damage zones yields a generally small spread in K–Ar ages for each sample compared to the large age spreads obtained from the adjacent fault core gouges ( The weighted mean age from Fault I (339 ± 10 Ma, The numerous fault rock domains identified in sample DZ-2 ( The youngest age obtained from DZ-1a (282 ± 7 Ma, K–Ar geochronology of the incohesive gouge from the fault cores (FC-1, FC-2) resulted in inclined age spectra, where ages decrease with decreasing grain size ( The permeability of clay-bearing fault gouges is generally very low ( The preserved architecture of a fault zone represents the finite strain state resulting from strain accumulation during the fault zone's entire deformation history ( The preservation of the first increment of deformation in the damage zone samples of this study thus indicates that post-fault nucleation deformation localized in the fault cores only and did not affect the mineralogy and isotopic signature of the surrounding damage zone. Consequently, these results permit the discussion of the growth, strength and thickness evolution of the investigated fault zones: Fractures that formed during fault initiation were subsequently flushed by reactive fluids which led to calcite precipitation and associated rock alteration ( The interpretation of clay K–Ar data can be challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets (e.g., Both the Carboniferous and Permian episodes of illite (±jarosite) growth documented in this study are also well-represented as peaks in the probability density plot of all grain size fractions of the existing data ( The ages of the medium grain sizes are generally mixed ages (e.g., Considering the complexities and uncertainties involved when interpreting large clay K–Ar datasets, the first order approach based on plotting all the ages obtained within a certain area can provide reliable, i.e. geologically meaningful, results, at least for the most pervasive phases of illite authigenesis ( The presented K–Ar data reveal two Paleozoic episodes of crustal extension affecting coastal SW Norway, which can be discussed within the framework of the post-Caledonian evolution of southern Scandinavia and of the North Sea realm. In Scandinavia, the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous is generally considered as a time period of crustal relaxation after extensive collapse of the Caledonian orogenic belt, with the development of a broad clastic and carbonate shelf in the southern and central North Sea ( In the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian extensive magmatic provinces developed within northern Europe, with the Oslo Rift being one of the major features onshore ( Our outcrop- to micro-scale study from two fault zones in an Ordovician granodiorite in SW Norway shows that samples from cohesive damage zones offer the potential to preserve structural, mineralogical and isotopic characteristics from the earliest increments of a fault zone's evolution, even if the fault core was repeatedly active throughout the fault's later history. Strain during fault reactivation is confined to the fault core due to strain localization leading to fault narrowing. The fault core is, at present, characterized by incohesive fault rocks, large amount of secondary clay mineral assemblages, and large age spreads in K–Ar age-versus-grain-size spectra. Therefore, it is generally a difficult task to constrain the timing of fault initiation and to decipher the complex reactivation history of long-lived brittle fault cores. Microstructurally-constrained K–Ar geochronology applied to the damage zone samples, however, resulted in narrow K–Ar age ranges and even age plateaus, which can be interpreted as recording fault initiation. These ages invariably constrain proto-(North Sea)-rift veining and associated fluid alteration in the Carboniferous (339 ± 8 Ma) and Early Permian rifting (289 ± 5 Ma) accommodated by pseudotachylyte-bearing top-to-the-NE normal faults. The ages of the coarsest grain sizes of fault gouge from the corresponding adjacent fault cores yield similar ages, indicating that the Paleozoic deformation episodes were the most pervasive and associated with higher temperatures, and that subsequent Mesozoic fault reactivation and/or fluid flow caused authigenic mineral growth up to only small grain sizes within the fault core. This age distribution matches the high density of Carboniferous and Permian clay K–Ar ages in the existing dataset from the area.
