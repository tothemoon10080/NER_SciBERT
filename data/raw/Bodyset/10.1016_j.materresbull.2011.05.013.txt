Preparation of titanium diboride (TiB2) nanoparticles was carried out by volume combustion synthesis. TiO2, B2O3 and elemental Mg were mixed with 0â€“60% salt mixture of KCl, NaCl and CaCl2 with increment of 15% as a low melting temperature diluent. Compressed samples were synthesized in a tubular furnace at a constant heating rate under argon atmosphere. Thermal analysis of the process showed that the addition of the low melting temperature salts mixture led to a significant decrease in ignition and combustion temperatures. Synthesized samples were then leached by nitric and hydrochloric acids to remove impurities. The samples were examined by XRD, SEM and DLS analysis. The results showed the formation of fine deagglomerated particles with the addition of the salts mixture. The results revealed that 45% salts mixture had the smallest average particle size of about 90nm.Titanium diboride is characterized by a high melting point, hardness, and strength to density ratio, low specific weight, good wear resistance, excellent thermal and chemical stability, and high electrical conductivity There are a number of methods for the synthesis of titanium diboride particles such as carbothermic reduction of titanium and boron oxides The properties of synthesized titanium diboride depend on reactants particle size, green density Several researches have studied the effect of NaCl diluent, which has a relatively high melting temperature (800 Titanium diboride was prepared from the mixtures of TiO Excess amount of magnesium from the stoichiometric proportion required for Reaction The precursor powders were dry mixed for 1 The synthesized samples were washed with distilled water to remove the salts from the mixture. The phase composition and morphology of the product were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Thereafter, the synthesised samples were ball milled in a planetary ball mill for 1 The XRD patterns of the unleached and leached samples with 0, 30 and 45% added salts mixture are shown in XRD results of the leached samples ( Formation of the MgO, TiB Differential thermal (DT) results of the synthesis process are shown in The effect of the added salts mixture on the ignition temperature, maximum measured combustion temperature, difference between these two, and adiabatic combustion temperature is shown in The results showed that the addition of the salts mixture decreased the adiabatic temperature of the synthesis from 2827 The addition of the salts mixture increases the heat capacity of the reacting mixture and since an equal amount of heat is released for all samples during the combustion synthesis, a lower temperature increase is expected. This corresponds well with the reported difference between the maximum combustion temperature and the ignition temperature in Volume combustion synthesis is a reactive diffusion process, where the ignition temperature is controlled by the rate limiting step In this study, one smaller exothermic peak was observed before the ignition in the samples with 0 and 15% salts mixture ( The significant change in the ignition temperature of the samples with the addition of salt was not in agreement with the results from Khandra et al.  Grain refinement and deagglomeration is partly due to the formation of a protective shell around the particles by the molten salt mixture that prevented the particle growth during the synthesis The SEM micrographs of the leached samples with 0, 30 and 45% salt mixture are presented in TiB Mg The addition of the salt mixture resulted in the formation of deagglomerated particles, which could be beneficial for the purification of the products by leaching. Also, addition of the salt mixture resulted in a small decrease in the particle average size from about 100
