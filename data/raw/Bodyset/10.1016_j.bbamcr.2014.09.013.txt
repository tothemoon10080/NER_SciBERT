The A2B adenosine receptor (A2B AR), activated in response to high levels of endogenous adenosine, is the major AR subtype involved in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation to osteoblasts and bone formation. For this reason, targeting of A2B AR with selective allosteric modulators may represent a promising pharmacological approach to the treatment of bone diseases.
                  Herein, we report the characterization of a 3-keto-indole derivative, 2-(1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxo-N-phenylacetamide (KI-7), as A2B AR positive allosteric modulator in MSCs, demonstrating that this compound is able to potentiate the effects of either adenosine and synthetic orthosteric A2B AR agonists in mediating osteoblast differentiation in vitro. In detail, we observed that MSC treatment with KI-7 determined an increase in the expression of osteoblast-related genes (Runx2 and osterix) and osteoblast marker proteins (phosphatase alkaline and osteocalcin), associated with a stimulation of osteoblast mineralization.
                  In the early phase of differentiation programme, KI-7 significantly potentiated physiological and A2B AR agonist-mediated down-regulation of IL-6 release. Conversely, during the late stage of differentiation, when most of the cells have an osteoblast phenotype, KI-7 caused a sustained raise in IL-6 levels and an improvement in osteoblast viability. These data suggest that a positive allosteric modulation of A2B AR not only favours MSC commitment to osteoblasts, but also ensures a greater survival of mature osteoblasts. Our study paves the way for a therapeutic use of selective positive allosteric modulators of A2B AR in the control of osteoblast differentiation, bone formation and fracture repair.Bone health is a chief medical concern for the ageing population, because deterioration of the bone is significantly correlated with fracture, disease, and a diminished quality of life Recently, an emerging role for purine receptors, and in particular for the A Therapies using receptor agonists are often prone to side effects, owing to the widespread distribution of the target receptor in the body. Allosteric modulation of membrane receptors has been intensively studied in the past three decades and is now considered an important mechanism for the control of receptor functions. A significant advantage of a therapy based on a positive allosteric modulator of a membrane receptor over its native, orthosteric activator is that, in principle, a greater tolerability can be achieved Recently, we have developed and characterized a new series of 1-benzyl-3-ketoindoles as the first class of positive/negative allosteric modulators of the human A Subsequently, we investigated whether one of these positive A Human bone marrow MSCs and cell culture medium were purchased by Lonza (Milan, Italy). Adenosine receptor ligands, 5′- MSCs were cultured in normal growth medium (MSCGM, Lonza), plated (5 For osteoblast differentiation studies, cells were seeded (3 MSCs were plated in 24-well plates in 0.5 MSCs were cultured in normal growth medium and, 24 Gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR, as previously described MSCs were seeded (3 Qualitative measure of the mineralization was also obtained by alizarin red staining MSCs were seeded in 96-well microplates (5000 cells/well) and cultured in osteogenic medium for 21 MSCs were cultured in osteogenic medium for 5–21 A non-linear multipurpose curve-fitting programme, Graph-Pad Prism (Version 5.00), was used for data analysis and graphic presentation.

Indeed, a trend towards a reduction in cAMP production was observed in the late phase of differentiation, but the second messenger's levels still remained high all the time. These results suggest that the positive allosteric modulation of A It is well known that the nature of the agonist can make a huge difference in the response to an allosteric compound. Each combination of orthosteric probe and allosteric ligand could be characterized by unique properties. Thus, the “probe-dependence” effects of KI-7 were evaluated during the MSC differentiation. As shown in However, in the early phase of differentiation (up to 5 KI-7 caused a significant increase in NECA and adenosine mediated cAMP production at all the differentiation stages ( In summary, these results demonstrate that KI-7 allosterically modulates, in a probe-independent manner, the effects elicited by different classes of A The effects of the A During MSC differentiation in osteogenic medium, the expression of the transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 followed the typical time course of these gene targets.

A deeper knowledge of such phenomena may be also helpful in the search for therapeutic treatments of bone diseases, such as osteoporosis.
