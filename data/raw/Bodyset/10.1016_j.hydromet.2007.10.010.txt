Results of solubility measurements of nickel chloride, manganese chloride, iron(II) chloride, hematite and akaganeite in aqueous solutions of MgCl2 (0.5–3.5 mol L−1) at temperatures of 60 and 90 °C are reported. Solubilities of metal(II) chlorides decrease almost linearly with MgCl2 concentration due to the common ion effect. Nickel chloride and iron(II) chloride solubilities are very similar, while manganese chloride is about 30% more soluble.
                  Hematite is more stable (i.e. less soluble) than akaganeite under all conditions investigated in this study, while ferrihydrite is considerably less stable. In other words, there is no change in the relative stabilities of these phases effected by the presence of high magnesium chloride concentrations. The solubility of all of these phases decreases with temperature and, for each temperature, the solubility constants increase linearly with the MgCl2 concentration. The present results allow the prediction of the iron concentration as a function of the H+ and MgCl2 molality at equilibrium with hematite or akaganeite.
                  The Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox behaviour has been characterized in concentrated aqueous solutions of MgCl2 (1.5–3.5 mol L−1) at a temperature of 25 °C. Standard redox potentials are ca. 100 mV lower than at infinite dilution and change linearly by only 13 mV in the range 2–4 mol L−1 MgCl2.This paper continues our series concerned with aqueous solutions of magnesium and other chlorides relevant to the development of atmospheric chloride leach processes ( Solubilities of the relevant solid phases are highly important process parameters for optimizing yields and controlling impurities, particularly iron ( the solubilities of nickel chloride, manganese chloride and iron(II) chloride in magnesium chloride solutions; the solubilities of hematite and akaganeite in concentrated, acidic magnesium chloride solutions; and the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox behaviour in concentrated magnesium chloride solutions.

The solid compound is reacted with The pH is determined from the emf of the following galvanic cell (A) Constant emfs indicate that equilibrium had been attained. The electrode system was then calibrated using acidic MgCl After equilibration, samples were taken and iron was determined complexometrically with Variamine Blue as indicator ( Hematite and akaganeite solubilities in acidic 1–4 mol kg After a few test measurements at 3 mol kg The experimental protocol developed for the measurement of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potentials in concentrated MgCl The Fe(III)/Fe(II) concentration ratio should be varied over a wide range by employing a titration technique; the total chloride molarity (and thus the ionic strength) should be kept constant so that variation of activity coefficients is minimized during the titration; the H Accordingly, solutions of the following general compositions were prepared. 0.050 M FeCl 0.100 M FeCl The solutions were prepared from metallic iron which was reacted with an appropriate amount of excess HCl, taking into account that 2 and 3 mol H To measure the redox potentials, 50.00 mL of Fe The reference electrodes were homemade from Ag wire in contact with solid AgCl and 5.00 mol L The Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potential Thus, at constant temperature and ionic strength, the redox potential is only a function of the [Fe In From Eq.  Nevertheless, since we used in the present study the same type of reference electrode as The resulting It should be stressed that our  The most significant conclusion from the present measurements in concentrated magnesium chloride solutions is that (i) the solubilities of metal(II) chlorides, (ii) the solubility constants of iron(III) oxides and hydroxides and (iii) the redox potentials of Fe(III)/Fe(II) depend on the MgCl Important process parameters for improving yields or controlling iron and other impurities in high concentration chloride leach processes can now be predicted with confidence.
