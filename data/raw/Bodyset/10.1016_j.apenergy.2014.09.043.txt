The K2CO3-based sorbent is promising for CO2 capture from the flue gas of fossil-fuel-fired power plant. In this work, various support/binder materials were utilized to prepare K2CO3-based sorbent pellets by an extrusion method, and their mechanical strength and CO2 capture performance were studied with different techniques. Results show that both the type of support/binder used and the content of K2CO3 have significant impact on the performance of the sorbents for CO2 capture. Among the sorbents prepared, K2CO3/Al2O3 exhibited the highest CO2 capture capacity of 71mg-CO2/g-sorbent, while K2CO3/clay demonstrated a much better compressive strength (25.2MPa), resistance to attrition and an interesting phenomenon of increased CO2 capture capacity with the number of cycles. It was also found that the support/binder material affects the physical properties of the pellets significantly.In order to limit the atmospheric CO Recently, utilization of dry alkali-metal carbonate sorbents, especially K Deliquescent potassium carbonate needs to be supported on a porous structure with an optimal loading amount to achieve high surface area and high carbon capture capacity Due to good mass and heat transfer This work intends to study the potential of utilizing some commercially available and low-cost materials as support and binder in K The K Procedure for the pellet preparation is as follows. Firstly, weighted amount of support material was added to an aqueous solution of K Mechanical strength of a single pellet was expressed in the form of compressive strength, which was determined using an Instron Universal Tester (type 4505). The cut pellet (with a length of 3 Attrition resistance of the particles/pellets was tested using a Friability Tester from Vanderkamp equipped with a vankel-type USP drum (I.D.28.5 Cyclic absorption/desorption of sorbents were tested in an apparatus consisting of two quartz tubes, which were maintained at different temperatures for the proceeding of carbonation and regeneration, respectively. Flue gas generated in fossil fuel combustion typically contains 10â€“15% CO The cyclic reactions were also conducted in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor. As shown in The BJH pore size distribution was determined with N The influence of the K Though the K Practical application of alkali metal-based sorbents in a fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reactor requires that the material must have sufficient physical strength and resistance to attrition and abrasion. However, it is challenging to find out the exact cause of attrition of fluidized solid, as attrition is affected by a number of factors, such as the mechanical strength and the property of the material The mechanical strength of sorbent pellets was tested and expressed as the compressive strength in the work. As shown in It is necessary to have a support material in K Firstly, mechanical strength of the cylindrical pellets containing different support/binder materials but with the same K CO Following preliminary screening of various supports/binders, a test of 30 carbonation-regeneration cycles was carried out on K The different behavior in CO As a large amount of sorbent would be required in the scaled-up reactor for practical application, the cyclic performance of selected sorbents was also evaluated in a lab-scale fixed-bed reactor. During experiment, around 1 Repeated cycles of carbonation and regeneration could affect the physical property of K Additionally, the attrition propensity of the pellets was studied using the weight percentage of fine particles as the indicator K This research was supported by the
