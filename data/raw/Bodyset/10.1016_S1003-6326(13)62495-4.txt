Viscose activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were modified with chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The samples were characterized using specific surface area, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pore size distribution and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to investigate the adsorption behavior of modified ACFs for methyl orange(MO) from its aqueous solutions. The results show that the adsorption isotherms of MO onto modified ACFs well follows the Langmuir isotherm equation. The adsorption kinetics of MO can be well described by the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The adsorption process involves the intra-particle diffusion, but is not the only rate-controlling step. Thermodynamic parameters including ΔG, ΔH and ΔS were calculated, suggesting that the adsorption of MO onto modified ACFs is a spontaneous, exothermic and physisorption process. FTIR result indicates that the major adsorption mechanism of modified ACFs for MO is hydrogen bond.
