Shrinkage induced by suction is one of the key characteristics that need to be assessed for the analysis and design of various engineered geotechnical systems made of fine-grained materials, such as layered soil covers and paste tailings disposal facilities. Obtaining representative experimental results on such deformable materials can be quite a challenge (e.g., The authors proposed a testing set up and procedure to determine the shrinkage curves (separately from the water retention tests that give the SWCC). With the proposed representation, the measured shrinkage curves are expressed using the relationship between void ratio The approach used by the authors to obtain the To obtain It is possible to measure changes in both soil volume and water content for different suctions with the classical Pressure plate apparatus by removing the soil specimen during testing and determining its weight and volume (e.g. It can be recalled here that when the volume change is not monitored during a water retention test conducted on a shrinking material, only the gravimetric water content As is stated in the paper, the shrinkage curve It can also be noted here that based on the data given in Figs. 9â€“11, the value of the commonly used shrinkage limit The approaches suggested in the paper to obtain both AEV and shrinkage limit may not really apply when the shrinkage curve starts from samples that are not fully saturated. Furthermore, the procedure adopted by the authors to obtain the AEV may not be appropriate when the shrinkage curve shows a so-called structural shrinkage phase (
