The effects of nanosized reinforcement particles on precipitation reactions in age-hardenable Al alloy matrix composites have been largely unknown. In this work, an Al–Zn–Mg–Cu matrix composite reinforced with uniformly distributed TiB2 nanoparticles was successfully produced. The solid-soluted, peak-aged and overaged materials were then characterized, at the atomic scale using (high-resolution) scanning transmission electron microscopy, to provide a fundamental insight into the interface precipitation. Our results demonstrated that the facetted TiB2 nanoparticles have a significant impact on the precipitation in matrix areas adjacent to the TiB2/Al interfaces. The interfaces after solid-solution treatment are tightly-bonded and oxide-free. The TiB2 particles and Al matrix display two orientation relationships (ORs): the well-reported [2

                     )Al (OR2). The interface precipitates (i.e., interphase) having the size of several tens of nanometers were formed after ageing and were determined to be (Zn1.5Cu0.5)Mg phase. Their formations were only related to the initial OR1 and OR2 where the mutual ORs between the TiB2, interphase and Al matrix were further developed. Periodically spaced misfit dislocations were revealed at the semi-coherent TiB2/Al interfaces, which are generally considered beneficial to the heterogeneous precipitation. They not only reduced nucleation energy barrier, but also acted as short-circuit diffusion paths for transporting solute atoms and vacancies, accelerating growth rate. However, the growth of interphase at the interface parallel to close-packed {111} Al planes was suppressed by the ultra-low accommodation factor. In addition, such an interface precipitation reduced the mismatch of the TiB2/Al interface, increasing the overall coherency and being potential for effective interface strengthening.Age-hardenable Al alloys (e.g., 2xxx, 6xxx and 7xxx series) have been widely applied as structural materials in aerospace and automobile industries, due mainly to their high specific strength and excellent processability It has been well established that the CPZ is caused by thermoelastic stress induced dislocations (TSIDs) near the MRP/Al interface In addition to the two well-documented CPZ and PFZ mentioned above, Strangwood et al In parallel with the developments in nanotechnology, the dimensions of reinforcement particles have decreased from micron/submicron scale to nanoscale (≤ 100 nm) over the last decades In spite of this, some hypotheses based on the pioneer works can be proposed. Firstly, Kim et al In view of the discussions above, the present work aims to provide a fundamental insight into the influences of NRPs on the precipitation reactions in Al-based MMCs. With high melting point (3173 K), high modulus (565 GPa), high hardness (2500 HV) and good thermal stability An STEM specimens with 3 mm in diameter were prepared through mechanical polishing and final ion milling in a GATAN precision ion polishing system, operated at –150 °C. A state-of-the-art FEI Titan Themis 300 microscope equipped with a probe aberration corrector, operated at 200 kV, was used to acquire (HR)STEM images. The probe size was set to 0.1 nm with a convergence semi-angle of 22.5 mrad. Collection angle of the HAADF detector was in the range 80–150 mrad. Contrasts in an HAADF image is proportional to Z Our previous studies of the TiB  OR1: [2 OR2: [2 After peak ageing, interphase precipitates were largely observed in between the TiB Similar to the peak-aged sample, neither obvious CPZ nor PFZ were observed in the over-aged sample, but interphase precipitates formed at the TiB Results in Using STEM/EDS elemental mapping, it was identified that the interphase precipitates in both the peak-aged and over-aged samples were enriched with Zn, Mg, Cu and Al as exemplified in As shown in The OR3: [1 The OR4: [2 At the overaged/OR2 condition ( The OR5: [1 The OR6: [2 It should be noted, in terms of extensive STEM examinations, that the ORs related to the interphase are only associated with the initial OR1 and OR2 between the TiB At the interphase/Al interfaces (i.e. the OR3, At the overaged/OR2 condition ( In the TiB For the homogenous precipitation in the Al alloy matrix, the minimum activation energy barrier Consequently, the relationship between Thus, as long as the contact angle between the interphase and TiB In addition, from As proposed by the previous studies, the lattice distortion near dislocation cores effectively lower the activation energy for solute atoms diffusion As a diffusion-controlled phase transformation, the precipitation in Al–Zn–Mg(–Cu) alloys depends on the diffusion of solute atoms, i.e., Mg, Zn (Cu) in the Al matrix For the homogenous precipitations in Al–Zn–Mg(–Cu) alloys, the radius of the initially nucleated embryo can be illustrated by Zener-Hillert model When dislocations are involved, the growth rate of the precipitate is accelerated by an enhancement factor expressed as The integral in As shown in It has been well established that the precipitation in the Al–Zn–Mg(–Cu) alloys is caused by diffusional nucleation followed by effective growth In order to further understand the experimentally determined ORs, the edge-to-edge matching (E2EM) model is used to predict/calculate the possible ORs between the phases based on the basic crystallographic data, including lattice parameters and actual atomic positions, of the phases The predicted ORs between the Al matrix and the TiB The OR-A: [2 The OR-B: [1 The OR-C: [2 Considering the inherent error in FFT, the OR-A can be regarded as the OR1 and the OR-C as the OR2. The predicted OR-B was not experimentally observed in the present work. Four ORs between the interphase and Al were calculated. They are: The OR-D: [0001] The OR-E: [1 The OR-F: [1 The OR-G: [1 Although the OR-D and the OR-E were not experimentally observed in the present work, one can see that the OR-F consists with the OR3 and the OR-G agrees well with the OR5. From the OR-A and the OR-F, following OR can be deduced. The OR-H: [2 This OR-H actually is consistent with the OR4. Similarly, the OR6 can also be deduced from the OR-C and the OR-G. The above crystallographic analysis indicates that the interfaces in between the TiB It was reported that the precipitation of T phase requires a high vacancy boundary diffusivity, i.e., at high-angle GBs or MRP/Al interface In this work, the TiB The majority of TiB Preferential heterogeneous interface precipitates are closely related to the OR1 or OR2 conditions between the TiB At the peak-aged and overaged states, the mismatch of the Al/(Zn The energy barrier for the heterogeneous precipitations at the TiB No transformation of the interphase from The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
