The acquisition of Viaton Industries by the Sibelco group was completed in mid-January 2013. The value of the transaction was not disclosed. Viaton had an annual turnover of around £9 M and employed 40 people at its site in Brassington (15 km southwest of Matlock in the Peak District of Derbyshire). In fact, the current mineral processing facilities were built on the site of the old Golconda lead/baryte mine, which had been worked from the mid-1700s until its closure in 1953. Viaton specialises in supplying baryte and talc pigments and fillers, marketing its products under the brandnames Sibelco (headquartered in Antwerp) is one of the world's largest privately owned industrial mineral companies, with 228 production sites in 41 countries. The group traces its history back to 1872 when Mr Stanislas Emsens founded Sablières & Carrières Réunies (SCR), a forerunner of Sibelco, in which the Emsens family retain ownership control. Sibelco's past growth has involved a number of important acquisitions, including the acquisition of: Unimin Ltd (of the US) in 1973; Watts, Blake, Bearne & Co (of the UK) in 1993; Commercial Minerals (of Australia) in 2000; and Consolidated Rutile (of Australia) in 2009.
