This work proposes a flowsheet based on the combination of membrane processes for the effective recovery of value-added components contained in mining effluents with high concentration of hydrochloric acid and metal anionic and cationic chloro-complexes. A representative case of study has been selected consisting of a solution of zinc and iron that under the studied conditions were solubilized forming anionic and cationic chloro-complexes. The high complexity of the system requires of a selective membrane-based solvent extraction step to successfully achieve the separation of cationic iron from a solution containing the acid together with anionic species of zinc followed by a diffusion process through ion conductive membranes for acid recovery; in this step electrodialysis was selected searching for the optimum trade-off between process kinetics and separation selectivity. Although the quantitative results are case-dependent, the methodology can be well extended to any mining leaching effluent coming from the use of HCl as leaching agent and containing metal chloro-complexes.membrane area, [m solute concentration, [kmol m solute diffusion coefficient, [m diffusivity constant, [m Faraday constant, [C mol electrical current, [A] molar flux, [kmol m lost ions molar flux, [kmol m constant, [m thickness, [m] number of moles, [mol] number of cell pairs, [---] universal gas constant, [J mol resistance, [Ω] selectivity of HCl towards Zn, [---] time, [h] temperature, [K] volume, [m coordinate, [m] charge number of the ion i, [---] constant, [m resistance parameter, [---] electric current efficiency, [---] species velocity, [m h electrical potential, [V] total amount membrane tank concentrated solution diluted solution specie “i”, (HCl, Zn) inlet initial amount final amount oulet Hydrometallurgical beneficiation of mining ores involves different operations such as leaching, solvent extraction, ion exchange and precipitation, whose selection depends on the metal to be recovered [ During the past decades the use of chloride hydrometallurgy has increased due to several reasons such as, i) the feasibility and success of the already existing operations, ii) new and more resistant construction materials and improved engineering know-how, iii) the extraordinary solution power of HCl for many minerals including oxides, hydroxides and carbonates, and iv) ease of separation of many chlorides through processes such as ion exchange, solvent extraction, valence changes, precipitation and crystallization. Thus, the potential of the chloride systems to operate over a wide range of oxidizing conditions and acidity has triggered its use in hydrometallurgical operations [ In chloride solution, metal ions react with Cl Application of membrane technology to the separation of metal ions in solution requires the use of selective and ion conductive membranes. Here, two groups of selective membranes that have reported excellent results so far, i) membrane-based solvent extraction, that combines the advantages of selective solvents to solubilize the target solute together with the use of membrane contactors to provide efficient equipment and process operation, and ii) electrodialysis (ED) with ion conductive membranes, that enhances the transport kinetics of the target species through charged membranes by means of electric current. Among the membrane-based solvent extraction configurations, non-dispersive solvent extraction (NDSX) using microporous hollow-fiber (HF) contactors has received considerable attention and has been proved to be very effective in the removal of solutes from aqueous solutions. Membrane-based non-dispersive extraction is characterized by the stabilization of the organic–aqueous interface at a porous material, avoiding the dispersion of the organic phase into the aqueous phase or vice versa and, thus, eliminating emulsion formation and phase entrainment. Additional advantages of non-dispersive solvent extraction have been widely mentioned in the literature. A number of successful applications has been reported so far with NDSX technology: (i) removal of Cr(VI) from groundwaters [ ED is a technology in which, ion-exchange membranes in combination with an electrical potential difference are used to remove ionic species from aqueous solution [ The development of new ion-exchange membranes improves the performance of electrodialysis technology (ED) and offers an attractive alternative to the treatment of industrial effluents such as waste acids and salts solutions [ The main novelty of this work is the recovery of three valuable compounds namely Zn, Fe and HCl from acidic effluents using a combination of best available technologies (BAT) such as solvent extraction and electrodialysis [ The separation of the multicomponent mixture containing iron, hydrochloric acid and zinc is carried out in two steps. The first step, based on the application of NDSX technology, provides two streams: an iron enriched raffinate for further reuse and a stripping phase containing HCl and ZnCl  In the experiments carried out for the technical assessment, the aqueous phases were pumped at 30.0 × 10 Samples were taken out at different times from the aqueous reservoirs and, the iron and zinc concentrations were analyzed, after sample preparation, in a Perkin Elmer 3110 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The concentration of free acid (H The ED experimental set up that was employed in the experiments is illustrated in The flow rates of the liquid phases were controlled by flowmeters. A variable power source (0–70 V; 0–20 A) supplied a desired fixed electrical current to the stack. Experiments were performed in batch mode working with a volume of 2.0 × 10 The concentration of zinc and hydrochloric acid was determined by titration with 0.01 kmol m This section aims at reporting the technical assessment of iron separation from the multicomponent mixtures by means of NDSX technology. With this purpose experiments were carried out working with solutions containing av. 1.7 kmol Fe After 1 h of experimental running, the concentrations of zinc and HCl in the feed solution decrease around 70% and 60% of the initial value, respectively. On the other hand, the removal of iron is lower than 10%. Under the selected operation conditions, the molar ratios Fe/Zn and Fe/HCl increase from 1.4 ( The simulated values of the initial molar fluxes for all the species involved in the separation process were: J On the contrary, the extraction rate of iron is three times slower (J The recovery stage has two main objectives, i.e., regeneration of the organic phase for further reuse and recovery of an acidic phase with the maximum possible concentration of zinc and HCl for further separation ( The selectivity values (S) of zinc and HCl over iron in the stripping phase were calculated in the constant range of the back-extraction fluxes according to the following equation: The values of S According to the literature, These results confirm the technical viability of the NDSX technology to i) selectively separate iron cations from multicomponent hydrochloric acid solutions containing metals likely to form chloro-complexes, and ii) generate concentrated solutions containing HCl together with zinc chloro-complexes. Therefore, the next step aims at the separation and recovery of hydrochloric acid from the solution containing high concentration of zinc chlorocomplexes. According to the literature, the use of ion conductive membranes (anionic and cationic/neutral) could provide an efficient separation of both compounds [ The stripping phase coming from the NDSX stage with a molar ratio HCl/Zn = 1.0 is used in the ED analysis. According to a previous work [ The current efficiency for each ion “i” was determined experimentally. As observed in the experimental data the increase in the current density leads to an increase in the HCl and Zn concentrations in the concentrated phase; 99% of the initial HCl in the diluted phase disappeared after 9 h (membrane area of 0.1 m In order to quantify the influence of the process variables on the recovery HCl, the selectivity of the separation defined according to Eq. The calculated values of selectivity and initial flux are shown in The current efficiency, Finally, Membrane technology has known an increasing number of applications related to the recovery of valuable compounds from wastewaters and industrial effluents due to their potential to replace conventional processes by accomplishing selective and efficient transport of specific components and providing reliable options for a sustainable growth. However, the stand-alone application of individual membrane processes often fails to recover all the possible valuable materials present in complex wastewaters. Therefore, the development of flowsheet adequately combining single membrane separation stages is a promising strategy to design processes following circular economy principles. This work reports the methodology to define hybrid membrane-based processes to perform the selective separation and recovery of Zn, Fe and HCl contained in complex solutions; these mixtures aim to cover a broad range of leaching effluents generated during chloride metallurgy processes. The selected case of study consisted of anionic and cationic chloro-complexes of zinc and iron. Membrane-based solvent extraction technology was selected to carry out the selective recovery of iron and concentration of zinc and HCl in a solution, which was further treated by electrodialysis in order to perform the selective permeation of hydrochloric acid. According to the previous explanations and promising results, the proposed technologies are prepared to be managed as more common chemical engineering processes allowing their application to new scenarios where valuable compounds are possible to be recovered. However, application to real problems should also face the problematic originated by the presence of low concentration impurities in the feed solution. The conceptual process flow sheet representing the hybrid membrane process consisting of membrane-based solvent extraction and electrodialysis stages is summarized in Financial support from the Project A simplified approach to describe the mass transport in electrolytic solutions is provided by the so-called Nernst-Planck equation, which can be derived from the Stefan-Maxwell equation. In this study, in order to simplify the procedure, some hypothesis have been taken into account: (1) The contribution of the convective transport flux can be neglected since ion exchange membranes are non-porous and (2) The boundary layer thickness is assumed to be negligible. (3) The electrical potential across each membrane in the system can be calculated by applying the Ohm's law: Diffusivities of solutes in solid polymers are usually related to the solute concentration through an exponential function of the concentration; a simple representation is given by Eq. ( As the parameters of Eq. (AI-2) are unknown and considering that the concentration change in both sides of the membrane corresponds to the concentration difference between the dilute (D) compartment, Perfect mixing in each compartment of the membrane stack and in the tanks of the ED unit has been considered ( The left-hand side of Eqs. ( In ED the water volume in the tanks changed with time according to the following equation: The description of the transport phenomena in multi-component electrolyte solutions is based on the Nernst-Planck equation. The mathematical model employed to describe the behavior HCl and Zn in the ED experiments is developed by Eqs.
