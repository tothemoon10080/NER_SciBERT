Due to the nature of high stability and eco-friendliness, layered n-type Bi2O2Se-based thermoelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest. In order to reduce lattice thermal conductivity and enhance thermoelectric performance of Bi2O2Se-based thermoelectric materials, here, we introduced Te substitution at O site into Bi2O2-2xTe2xSe prepared by a shear exfoliation method. The induced high-density nanosized Bi2O2Se grains and point defects can effectively scatter both mid and short-wavelength phonons, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of ~0.57 W m−1 K−1 at ~773 K. Furthermore, Se vacancies generated by the shear exfoliation induced a high carrier concentration approaching the optimized level, and in turn lead to relatively high electrical performance. The synergistic high electrical performance and low lattice thermal conductivity secured a record-high dimensionless figure of merit, zT, of ~0.69 at ~773 K. This study indicates that shear exfoliation method and Te substitution are promising methods to optimize the thermoelectric properties of Bi2O2Se-based thermoelectric materials.With the capacity of direct energy conversion between heat and electricity, thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing research interest [ Comparing with traditional PbTe and Bi In this study, we substitute O with Te to introduce additional point defects to reduce To understand the doping behavior of Te at O site of the shear-exfoliation prepared Bi To understand the crystal structure of as-prepared Bi To investigate their transport properties, we measured the electrical performance of the as-sintered Bi To understand the thermal transportation and overall thermoelectric performance of as-prepared Bi In this work, via introducing Te substitution at O site in the shear exfoliation prepared Bi The authors declare no competing financial interest.
