Automotive suspension control arm is used to join the steering knuckle to the vehicle frame. Its main function is to provide stability under fatigue stresses of loading and unloading in accelerating and braking. Conventionally, these parts were made of steel; however, fuel consumption and emission of polluting gases are strongly dependent on car weight. Recently, there is a try to develop and design much lighter and better fatigue resistant metal of semisolid A357 aluminum alloys. This work aims at a better understanding of identifying the fatigue strain-hardening parameters used for determining fatigue characteristics of aluminum suspension control arm using analytical and mathematical modeling. The most judicious method is to perform the fatigue tests on standardized test pieces and then plot two Wohler curves, mainly number of cycles as a function of the stress and as a function of the deformation. From these curves and following a certain mathematical and analytical methods, certain curves are plotted and then all of these coefficients are drawn. The new calculated parameters showed a clear improvement of the fatigue curve towards the experimental curve performed on the samples of aluminum alloy A357 compared with the same analytical curve for the same alloy.
