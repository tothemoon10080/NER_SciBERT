Management of coronal shear fractures of the distal humerus has evolved considerably over the past 3 decades, with an increased appreciation of the complexity of these fractures, improvements in internal fixation techniques, and the use of more extensile exposures. Nearly all of these fractures are displaced, given the paucity of soft tissue attachments and correspondingly, nonsurgical management is fraught with complications including chronic pain, mechanical symptoms, and instability and is not recommended. Good to excellent outcomes can be achieved in the majority of patients with open reduction internal fixation, particularly when the fracture is limited to the radiocapitellar joint. Outcomes are worst for those with considerable medial extension or comminution. Computed tomography is highly recommended to guide surgical planning. The presence of posterior comminution or extension to the medial column might require more extensile exposures and supplemental fixation for adequate stability. Arthroscopic reduction and fixation techniques have been described for the simple fracture. Those not amenable to fixation might do better with total elbow arthroplasty in a select population. Long-term data demonstrate the durability of these elbows following open reduction internal fixation. Complications other than stiffness are rare. Radiographic avascular necrosis does not appear to affect outcome. Radiographic mild to moderate arthritis was observed in half of patients at 17-year follow-up.
