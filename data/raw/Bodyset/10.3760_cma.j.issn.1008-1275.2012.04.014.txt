We present the technical report for treatment of comminuted fracture of the capitate with ligamentotaxis. The base of third metacarpal was found to be fractured with comminution of the capitate. The decrease in carpal height index and comminution of the third metacar-pal base lead to dilemma between conservative treatment and surgical management of this particular injury. The surgical management was chosen to maintain the carpal height index of the wrist to prevent the late degenerative changes. The patient was applied with external fixator in distraction mode expanning the wrist joint for six weeks, and the wrist was mobilised after removal of the fixator. Itis shown that the external fixator in distraction mode expanning the wrist joint is a good alternative method for treatment of capitate fracture.
