Fractures of the foot and ankle are common in all age groups. Soft tissue swelling, diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease should be considered when forming a management plan.
                  Open fractures should be treated urgently. Temporary external fixation may be required to stabilize the fracture prior to definitive fixation and subsequent soft tissue cover.
                  Compartment syndrome (see McGrath/Royston, page 231) of the foot occurs following major fractures or crush injuries. Hence, elevation of the foot is essential. Mild forms of compartment syndrome are easily missed and result in clawing of the toes.
                  For these reasons, as part of the routine examination, the foot pulses and peripheral nerves must be assessed and documented.
