Dear Editor, I have recently published in the journal (A preliminary research on acid pressure leaching of pyritic copper ore in Kure Copper Mine, Turkey, Nevertheless, most hydrometallurgists, mineral processing and chemical engineers have been nearly following the Habashi’s serial books on the extractive metallurgy during their research. Naturally, I have also been reading these until my undergraduate and graduate educations. And I believe that the books have been helping for the best understanding of the metallurgical and chemical processes. I have been honoured to know Fathi Habashi. Therefore, once more thank you Professor Habashi… I appreciate seeing these additions correcting for typographical errors in a future issue. Kind regards
