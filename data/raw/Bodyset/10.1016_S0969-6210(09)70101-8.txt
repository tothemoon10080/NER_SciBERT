Tangshan Madison, a wholly-owned subsidiary within the China Mineral Processing Ltd (CMP) group, recently brought on-stream a calcined kaolin plant at its complex on the Konling Industrial Estate at Tangshan (Hebei province). The plant cost â‚¬150 M to build, but its capacity has not yet been revealed. CMP's CMP is a European company formed in the early 1990s by a group of independent investors to develop the processing of Chinese minerals (fluorspar, bauxite, kaolin and refractories) for export.
