This is a very focused book useful to those working in this area. However, title should have been preceded by the word dry. It presents methods for calculation of flow in natural gas transmission pipelines looking at both the flow side as well as the mechanical aspects of the pipe. It also addresses the associated area of compressor used in boosting the flow and other ancillary equipment such as valves and flow meters. The possible equations to be used are very clearly set out and readers should have no difficulty in using them. The book is well laid out with chapters following logically from Gas Properties to Pressure Drop due to Friction to Pressure Required to Transport. The chapters on Compressor Stations and Pipe Loops (versus Compression) give the full picture. It is good to see that the area of transient is treated with case studies being included. Given that the book is US-based, it is not surprising that the units are all in the Imperial system. Some use of SI in the text and examples would have been welcome. My thinking that the book should be entitled Dry Gas Pipeline Hydraulics arises from the fact that no mention is made of liquid phase material. Given that Table 1.1 goes up the hydrocarbon chain to C10, one might not expect that there might be some condensate in the colder part of the year. I am aware that gas is treated to remove these elements. If they are never present why have them in the table?
