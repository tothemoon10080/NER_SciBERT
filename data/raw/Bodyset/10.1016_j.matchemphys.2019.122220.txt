The structures, electronic and magnetic properties of a transition metal (TM) atom encapsulated in a Mg12O12 cage have been investigated by the PBE functional. The results show that majority of TM atoms are encapsulated in the Mg12O12 cage except for Sc, Ti, Zr and Hf atoms. The structural stability of Mg12O12 clusters is higher than that of TM@Mg12O12 clusters by average binding energies. Furthermore, Sc, Co, Zr, Rh, Hf, W and Pt atoms are more suitable for the Mg12O12 cage than their neighbors. All the TM atoms can improve the kinetic activity of Mg12O12 cages. For the subgroup IIIB and IVB atoms, the electrons are transferred from the TM atoms to the Mg12O12 cages, while for the subgroup VB-IIB atoms, the opposite situation appears. The maximum values of spin for a TM atom encapsulated in Mg12O12 cages are occurred at the subgroup number VIB (Cr@Mg12O12, Mo@Mg12O12 and W@Mg12O12), respectively.Magnesium oxide is an important functional material which can be adopted in diverse applications such as paint, catalysts, chemical sensors, superconductors and spintronics materials [ In this study, structures, electronic and magnetic properties of TM atoms encapsulated in Mg The structures of the Mg The relative stabilities of the different-size clusters can be predicted by calculating the average binding energy The core-shell interaction between TM atoms and Mg To confirm the appropriateness of the selected functional, we have calculated the bond length (r = 1.759 Å) and binding energy (E Once the hypothetical TM@Mg To clarify the meaning of the abscissa of The embedding energies The kinetic stabilities of the TM encapsulated in Mg To explore the effect of the TM atoms on the Mg To expound the feature of chemical bonds of a TM atom encapsulated in Mg Spin of electrons is a vital parameter to the magnetic properties of materials [ The structures, stability, electronic and magnetic properties of a 3 The authors declare no conflict of interest.
