A novel multi-domain method based on an analytical control surface is proposed by combining the use of free-surface Green function and Rankine source function. A cylindrical control surface is introduced to subdivide the fluid domain into external and internal domains. Unlike the traditional domain decomposition strategy or multi-block method, the control surface here is not panelized, on which the velocity potential and normal velocity components are analytically expressed as a series of base functions composed of Laguerre function in vertical coordinate and Fourier series in the circumference. Free-surface Green function is applied in the external domain, and the boundary integral equation is constructed on the control surface in the sense of Galerkin collocation via integrating test functions orthogonal to base functions over the control surface. The external solution gives rise to the so-called Dirichlet-to-Neumann

Irregular frequencies, which are only dependent on the radius of the control surface, are present in the external solution, and they are removed by extending the boundary integral equation to the interior free surface (circular disc) on which the null normal derivative of potential is imposed, and the dipole distribution is expressed as Fourier–Bessel expansion on the disc. In the internal domain, where the Rankine source function is adopted, new boundary integral equations are formulated. The point collocation is imposed over the body surface and free surface, while the collocation of the Galerkin type is applied on the control surface. The present method is valid in the computation of both linear and second-order mean drift wave loads. Furthermore, the second-order mean drift force based on the middle-field formulation can be calculated analytically by using the coefficients of the Fourier–Laguerre expansion.Predictions of the wave loads acting on floating bodies and induced motion, of which the scientific problem is the interaction between water waves and floating structures, are of theoretical and practical importance in marine and offshore hydrodynamics For the Rankine panel method, the fundamental solution to the governing equation is in the form of Besides the boundary solvers based on the Green's identity, the field solvers, which yield sparse coefficient matrix, also gain some interests in the wave–body interaction problems within the potential-flow theory. One is the variational principle based Finite Element Method (FEM) which has been applied in the analysis of linear and fully-nonlinear wave–body interaction problems For the problem of the wave radiation and diffraction with forward speed, the implementation of the translating and pulsating Green function arises a couple of problems. In particular, the free-surface Green function features highly-oscillatory and peculiar singularities when both source point and field point are close to the free surface In light of drawbacks of the methods mentioned above, authors It should be pointed out that the combination of different methods is not new, and there is an amount of relevant work on the domain decomposition strategy and multi-block method In the present study, the control surface is in a cylindrical form, so that the horizontal and vertical variables are kept independent. The base functions are composed of Laguerre functions in vertical coordinate and Fourier series in polar angle. Applying the Green's theorem in the external domain results in a boundary integral equation on the control surface. Furthermore, the collocation of Galerkin type is performed by integrating both sides of the integral equation by test functions orthogonal to the base functions. The external solution provides the relationship between the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the control surface which is referred to as the The Rankine source function is applied in the internal domain limited by the hull surface, the control surface and the part of free surface in between. The usual point collocation is applied to impose the boundary integral equation on the body surface and free surface while the Galerkin collocation is adopted on the control surface in the internal domain. In addition, the The present article is organized as follows. In section A three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system We consider a fluid domain with infinite water depth, and the fluid domain is subdivided by a cylindrical surface into two domains: the external domain and internal domain where floating bodies are present. In the external domain, the boundary surfaces include the control surface In the external domain, the free-surface Green function satisfying the linearized free-surface boundary condition and radiation condition is adopted to be the fundamental solution. Therefore, application of the Green's identity in the external domain yields: In the present study, the velocity potential In When the scaling factor Substituting the Fourier–Laguerre expansions given by In the sense of Galerkin collocation, the boundary integral equation The strategy to evaluate the multi-fold integrals is presented in The For the verification purpose, the proposed method can be used to study the wave diffraction problem due to a vertical circular cylinder with infinite depth by regarding the control surface as a fixed body. In this problem, the total velocity potential in the flow field can be decomposed into two components: the incident wave potential By expanding the diffraction potential Then, we can obtain the vector Given the velocity potential distributed over the cylinder surface, we can obtain the linear wave exciting force acting on the cylinder:  It is well-known that the velocity potential decays with a factor In The occurrence of irregular frequencies ties up with the condition number of the coefficient matrix. For this reason, we measure the condition numbers of matrices  Irregular frequencies correspond to the eigen-value problem of Dirichlet type in the domain complement to the external domain, and could produce detrimental effects on the prediction of wave loads, especially second-order wave loads. At these frequencies, the boundary integral equation either possesses no solutions, or non-unique solutions if they exist. Therefore, the resultant equation system is ill-conditioned, and the results are erroneous. The uniqueness theorem suggests that if the potential in the interior domain is zero on a part of boundary surfaces and its normal derivative vanishes on the rest, the potential in the interior domain is null The extended boundary integral equations imposed on the control surface This subsection introduces an analytical method to remove irregular frequencies by expanding the dipole distribution over the circular lid into Fourier–Bessel series which is expressed as: In this method, boundary integral equations are established over both control surface and interior free surface in the sense of Galerkin collocation. By integrating test functions in the form of Then, multiplying the test function In this subsection, we are concerned with deriving the new formulations of Combining formulations Equation In this subsection, we re-examine the wave diffraction problem of a vertical circular cylinder as discussed in subsection   In this section, we consider a problem of a floating body with a general geometry. The fluid domain is bounded by the control surface Application of the Green's second identity on the surfaces covering the internal domain yields In the internal domain, the body surface and free surface are panelized and divided into Accounting for the linear free-surface boundary condition given by On the control surface Equation Due to the fact that the internal domain consists of three boundary surfaces including: the hull surface We firstly establish the boundary integral equation given by When the boundary integral equation is imposed on the body surface When the field point is on the body surface, the panel with the field point is numbered by In the same manner, when the field point locates on the free surface which is numbered by In representations By combining representations We firstly apply the Then, the boundary integral equations imposed on the body surface and free surface can also be obtained by introducing formulation By combining expressions In this subsection, the Then, by inserting formulation Combination of expressions In this section, a floating hemisphere is studied, and the corresponding mesh over the body surface and free surface is depicted in  In this subsection, the mean drift force exerting on a stationary hemisphere is calculated using the middle-field formulation Based on the middle-field formulation, the pressure integrated over the body surface can be completely converted to the integral over the control surface, and then, the second-order force acting on a body in the Formulation By substituting the Fourier–Laguerre expansions of the velocity potential and radial derivative into representation Besides the horizontal mean drift force, the vertical mean drift force can also be calculated using the middle-field formulation The last term in In expression  Unlike the conventional method to calculate the mean drift force by discretizing the control surface and free surface, in the present multi-domain method, the free surface and control surface are already there. The physical quantities over the free surface and control surface are directly obtained from solving the equation system. Furthermore, the velocity potential and its radial derivative are represented by a series of base functions which makes the computation of mean drift loads in both horizontal and vertical directions efficient and accurate. In the present work, a new multi-domain method without panelizing the control surface is proposed to study the computation of linear and second-order mean drift wave forces in deepwater. An analytical control surface in the cylindrical form is introduced to divide the fluid domain into internal and external domains. The free-surface Green function is applied in the external domain. The velocity potential and radial derivative on the control surface are expressed as a series of base functions composed of Laguerre function in the vertical direction and Fourier series in the circumference, and the boundary integral equation is constructed on the control surface in the sense of Galerkin collocation through integrating test functions orthogonal to base functions over the control surface. The external solution provides the To remove irregular frequencies, the method of extended boundary integral equations In the internal domain, the Rankine source function is adopted. The boundary integral equation is formulated in the internal domain surrounded by the body surface, control surface and free surface in between. The body surface and free surface are discretized into panels, while the control surface is not. To be consistent with the external solution, the velocity potential and radial derivative are also expanded into Fourier–Laguerre series. The usual point collocation is applied on the body surface and free surface, while the Galerkin collocation by integrating test functions is adopted on the control surface. Then, the To validate the present method, the linear and second-order mean drift wave loads exerting on a hemisphere are calculated, and comparisons are made with the analytical and numerical results documented in the literature. Due to the features that the control surface is meshfree and the free surface in the internal domain is already meshed, the horizontal and vertical mean wave drift forces can be directly efficiently computed, and the control surface integral can be analytically calculated by the use of the coefficients of Fourier–Laguerre expansion. To summarize, the advantageous features of the present multi-domain method are following: The free-surface Green function in a complicated form is integrated over an analytical surface instead of discretized panels. The difficulty in the numerical integration of the free-surface Green function on panels is circumvented by analytical integrations associated with Laguerre function in vertical coordinate and Fourier series in circumference. The resultant singular integral in wavenumber can be evaluated efficiently. Irregular frequencies appear in the external solution and are dependent on the radius of the control surface. Hence, an analytical method is developed to remove irregular frequencies by expressing the dipole distribution over the interior free surface as Fourier–Bessel series. In contrast to the method relying on the spatial discretization, the present analytical method requires less computational efforts to remove high irregular frequencies inasmuch as high irregular frequencies corresponding to small wave lengths require fairly fine mesh to capture. Unlike the traditional method which requires the increment of panels to eliminate irregular frequencies, the present multi-domain method does not increase the number of unknowns. Irregular frequencies are removed in the external solution, which provides the The It is efficient to compute the second-order wave loads by means of the middle-field formulation in the present multi-domain method. Inasmuch as the velocity potential and normal derivative on the control surface are analytically expressed as Fourier–Laguerre series and the free surface in the internal domain is already meshed, the horizontal and vertical mean drift forces can be straightforwardly calculated by the use of potential distribution over the free surface and coefficients of Fourier–Laguerre series on the control surface. The present method will be extended to investigate the wave radiation and diffraction problems of a translating body like a ship operating in a seaway.

Here, we first consider the influence of the control surface on the body surface By using the expansion given by Similar as The integral on the right-hand side can be analytically expressed as Due to the fact that the control surface is alway away from the body at some distance, the parameter When In summary, the expression Other influence coefficients including In The first method follows from the one introduced in For the second method, we start from equation By using the representation Similarly, other influence coefficients between free surface and control surface including
