Literature data is re-interpreted to show that the anodic oxidation of gold in ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions is dependent upon the concentration product [M2S2O3][NH3] to the order 0.8 (M=Na or NH4). Analysis of chemical speciation in solution shows that the concentration of NH4S2O3
                     − ion-pair is equal or larger than that of the unassociated S2O3

                     3− is the predominant complex (>99%), a small fraction of Au(S2O3)(NH3)− is present. It is proposed that ammonia facilitates gold dissolution via oxidation of the surface adsorbed species Au(S2O3)(NH3)2−

                     3−.The thiosulfate system has been widely studied as an alternative lixiviant to cyanide for the leaching of gold from ores using aerated/oxygenated ammoniacal copper(II) thiosulfate systems ( Fundamental studies have shown that ammonia catalyses the chemical oxidation of gold by oxygen and copper(II) as well as the anodic oxidation of gold in thiosulfate media (   A previous communication (  The anodic oxidation of gold in a thiosulfate solution can also lead to the oxidation of thiosulfate depending on the potential applied. For example, it has been reported that in the absence of ammonia, thiosulfate ions decompose when in contact with gold at an open circuit, leaving a film of several sulfur-containing species that do not block the electrode surface ( Adsorption Oxidation Desorption/stabilisation Assuming a surface coverage of θ, the adsorption equilibrium constant for Eq.
