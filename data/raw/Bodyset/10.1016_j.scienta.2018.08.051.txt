The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of various combinations of organic and/or mineral fertilizers on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) to identify the best treatment for balancing yield, seed quality and composition and soil fertility maintenance over time. Wet olive pomace, an olive-mill by-product very abundant in olive oil producing countries, was used for fertilization trials. The use of wet olive pomace at 140 Mg ha−1, combined with half of the conventional N, P, and K dose of mineral fertilization, allowed to achieve the same faba bean productivity of full mineral fertilization. Higher levels of wet olive pomace did not induce further productivity increase. The highest protein content in dry faba bean seeds (276.05 g kg−1) was detected at full mineral fertilization. Phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity showed an opposite trend and tended to be lower in case of full mineral fertilization alone, whereas were higher in unfertilized control and in the trials fertilized with combinations of half mineral fertilization and olive pomace. The latter fertilizing condition also allowed to suppress the infesting flora. The use of wet olive pomace for agricultural purposes could therefore represent an environmentally friendly support to mineral fertilization, adding value to a by-product.Legumes and legume based foods are an important and sustainable source of nutrients for human diet, particularly carbohydrates and proteins ( Among legumes, faba bean ( Faba bean plays also an important agronomical role being able to fix atmospheric nitrogen and to act positively as a break crop in intensive cereal-dominated crop rotations, also preventing soil erosion ( In legume crops, important factors influencing yield are seeding density ( Mineral fertilization of soil, therefore, is certainly useful for improving yield. However, this type of fertilization could not be the most effective and balanced treatment in view of maintaining soil fertility over time ( Both mineral and organic methods of fertilization are characterized by advantages and disadvantages, on which a lively debate has been going on for a long time. Currently, organic fertilization with low chemical input is preferred. Wet olive pomace, either composted or as such, has been proposed as fertilizer in combination with mineral elements (N, P In this frame, the aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of various combinations of organic and/or mineral fertilizers on faba beanto identify a treatment able to balance yield, seed quality and composition and soil fertility maintenance over time. Faba bean ( Sowing was carried out on November 19, 2015, at a density of 12 plants m Seed harvesting, as well as the determination of the main morpho-physiological and quality parameters, was carried out on 3 plants per pot at the stage of fresh pods (starting from April 14 - when the The presence of bean broomrape ( The chlorophyll index was determined when plants were close to flowering by means of Chlorophyll Meter SPAD-502 (Spectrum Technologies Inc., Aurora, IL, USA) to characterize the crop nitrogen status. Plant height, number of shoots, shoot dry biomass, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, yield of fresh and dry seeds were also determined. Dry faba bean seeds were milled to whole meal flour by means of a laboratory mill equipped with a 1-mm sieve (Cyclotec Sample Mill, Tecator Foss, Hillerød, Denmark). Moisture content was determined at 105 °C by means of an automatic moisture analyzer (Radwag Wagi Elektroniczne, Radom, Poland). Total nitrogen was determined by the Kjeldhal method and results were converted to the crude protein by 5.7 conversion factor ( Total phenolic compounds were extracted from whole meal flour with methanol and were subsequently subjected to Folin-Ciocalteu reaction and spectrophotometric measure at 765 nm in the conditions reported by The antioxidant activity was assessed in whole meal flour by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity assay in the conditions reported in previous works ( Data were submitted to statistical analysis by using MSTAT-C software (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test for multiple comparisons. The fertilization conditions significantly influenced the weed biomass, which was represented by Broomrapes appeared at the end of April, when faba bean cycle was almost completed, irrespective of the treatment. The mean number of broomrape shoots and their dry biomass accounted for 16.94 and 151.69 g per m Overall, no significant effect of fertilization type was observed on the duration of phenological phases of faba bean plants as well as on the entire crop cycle, whereas a significant influence was detected on some morpho-physiological parameters and grain yield. Compared to all the fertilized trials, the unfertilized (control) recorded lower plants, less vigorous, with lower chlorophyll index, fewer shoots per plant, lower shoot dry biomass ( As far as yield of fresh and dry seeds were concerned ( No differences were observed among the treatments with wet olive pomace at 140 and 210 Mg ha The level of antioxidant activity of dry faba beans, expressed as scavenging capacity towards the DPPH radical, ranged from 41.07% to 46.09% ( The content of phenolic compounds ranged from 5.24 to 5.75 mg g The protein content of dry faba beans increased with the increase of fertilizer dose. A protein content of 256.72 g kg The observed significant influence of fertilization conditions on weed biomass was in agreement with other authors. In particular, the mineral fertilization caused an increase of weed biomass than in non-fertilized control, in agreement with the findings of other authors ( As far as the morpho-physiological parameters and grain yield is concerned, the absence of significant differences among the treatments with wet olive pomace at 140 and 210 Mg ha Furthermore, other authors reported that no significant differences were caused by the application of diverse phosphorous-based fertilizers on cereal crops, also highlighting the scarce efficacy of Top-Phos in calcareous soils ( These findings confirm that the use of compost or other organic fertilizers determine the release of N, P, and K, as well as other elements that improve the physical characteristics of soil with consequent increase of faba bean growth and yield, as observed by Faba bean has a good potential as natural source of antioxidants. Levels of DPPH radical-scavenging capacity of about 43.49% have been previously reported in a survey on thirteen faba bean genotypes cultivated in Tunisia ( Phenolic compounds are antioxidants which have been already reported in faba beans by numerous authors ( The observed increase of protein content of dry faba beans, as the fertilizer dose increased, was expected and agreed with In conclusion, this research allowed to point out that increasing doses of wet olive pomace (up to 210 Mg ha The highest protein content in dry faba bean seeds was detected at full mineral fertilization, then lowered by substituting half mineral fertilization dose with wet olive pomace at decreasing levels, and was the lowest in unfertilized control. An opposite trend was observed for phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, which reached the lowest levels in case of full mineral fertilization. Therefore, in the pedoclimatic conditions of the trials (Mediterranean climate, sandy-loam soil) a good balance between yield and seed quality (in terms of protein content, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity) was achieved with 140 Mg ha The Authors are indebted to
