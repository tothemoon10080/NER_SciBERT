An equilibrium model is proposed for the reactive system ZnSO4/di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA)/diluent being considered by the European Federation of Chemical Engineering as a test system, valid over a wide concentration range of extraction and stripping conditions. The model is supported by the statistical analysis of estimated parameters. Two simple consecutive reactions are assumed to give two zinc complexes with relative proportions changing as conditions change from extraction to stripping. The model was solved by Newton's method, and all parameters were estimated by data fitting using the direct search method of Hooke and Jeaves. The model predicts aqueous concentrations with an average relative error lower than 11% by assuming activity coefficients of 1.0. The incorporation of the activity coefficients may improve the model accuracy but cannot validate other simpler extraction mechanisms.In recent years, there has been renewed interest concerning the extraction of zinc from sulphuric acidic media using di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) as extractant. This system, ZnSO Considerable experimental and theoretical effort has been made in the last two decades to characterise the ZnSO A problem requiring further consideration is that the mechanism of zinc extraction seems to change according to the degree of loading of D2EHPA. Depending on the diluent, a change in the value of the stoichiometric coefficient A review presented by An equilibrium model based on the chemical potential theory of Lewis considering fixed stoichiometry ( The van Laar, Wilson, NRTL and UNIQUAC semi-empirical models have been investigated by A possible explanation for the phenomenon of apparently changing stoichiometry suggested by many workers and recently supported by The scope of this work is to investigate the ZnSO  The direct search method of Hooke and Jeaves has been used to estimate the parameters in the optimization procedure The Hooke and Jeaves algorithm consists of two major steps: (1) an “exploratory search” around the base point that uses prior knowledge and rejects obsolete information concerning the nature of the topology of The general chemical reaction equation for the extraction of metallic cations by phosphoric acid extractants, as is the case of the ZnSO If the splitting of the free D2EHPA molecules from dimeric ( The stoichiometric constants The model consists of a set of non-linear algebraic equations with five parameters to be estimated by data fitting ( (i) initial guesses were made for the parameters; (ii) initial concentrations of the species in the organic phase were calculated (Newton's method); (iii) the equilibrium model was solved (Newton's method); (iv) calculated and experimental values of the zinc concentration in the aqueous phase were compared and (v) parameter values were modified (Hooke–Jeaves).
