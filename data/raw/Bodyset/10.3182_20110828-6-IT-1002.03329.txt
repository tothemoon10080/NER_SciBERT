Abstract
                  Structural and parametric identification of the nonlinear systems with a closed cycle on the set of continuous block-oriented models with feedback is considered. The method of the structural identification in the steady state based on the observation of the system's input and output variables at the input periodic influences is proposed. The solution of the parameter identification problems, which can be immediately connected with the structural identification problem, is carried out in the steady and transient states by the method of least squares. The structural and parametric identification algorithms are investigated by means of both the theoretical analysis and the computer modeling.
