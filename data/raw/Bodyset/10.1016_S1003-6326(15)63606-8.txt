                     ) on flotation of carbonaceous copper shale mixed with quartz as a gangue mineral was investigated. The results show that all of the ethers C4E1, C4E2, C4E3, C2E2, C6E2 investigated can be used for the flotation of carbonaceous copper shale. The best selectivity of separation in the flotation of the carbonaceous copper shale and quartz mixture is obtained with the C4E2 and C2E2 ethers. The obtained data can be used for developing separation of organic carbon present in carbonaceous shale at a rougher flotation stage on an industrial scale.
