Abstract
                  Oxygen volume control is very important in BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) steelmaking production. In this study, a case-based reasoning (CBR) model with mixed case retrieve and case reuse steps is adopted to calculate the oxygen volume. Two case retrieve methods are used here: KNN (k nearest neighborhood) and geometrical similarity. The geometrical similarity is proposed to make up the lack of KNN method when no case is retrieved by KNN. Correspondingly, two case reuse solutions are employed. Tests are implemented on a practical 180t converter and results show that this CBR system for BOF oxygen volume control is effective.
