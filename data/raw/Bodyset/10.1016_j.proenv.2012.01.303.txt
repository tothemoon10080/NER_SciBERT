The comprehensive utilization of tailings is one important topic for the sustainable development of mining industry in China. The paper does the experiment in the laboratory by the way of magnetic separation to reclaim the iron mineral in the tailings from a certain concentrating mill for molybdenum minerals. Finally, the result of this experiment indicates that through the open process of rough and fine separation at first---grinding rough and finely once again to reclaim the iron mineral in the tailings, we can get the iron concentrate with the yield of 0.39%, the grade of 63.27% and the recovery of 10.57%.
