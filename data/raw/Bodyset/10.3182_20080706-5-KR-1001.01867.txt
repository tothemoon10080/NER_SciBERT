The main reason of milling and flotation process fluctuations is a mixing of ores in various proportions from various sections of a deposit. According to estimates, instability and non-optimized parameters of flotation take 3% to 6% of losses of valuable component. Without ore averaging systems, milling and flotation process are characterized by considerable fluctuations of all input, output and intermediate parameters. In these conditions, applying various mathematic models does not allow controlling the process by action on input parameters with further precise reaching required values of output parameters of the process.
                  Criteria of milling process control are formed to provide required productivity at keeping preset quality. Solution of a task of improving effectiveness of flotation process control requires application of multi-level schemes, providing for regulation of both physico-chemical and technological parameters of the process. Stabilizing and optimizing the main technological parameters allows increasing effectiveness of milling and flotation process.
