This study investigated the thermal decomposition process of kaolinite mixed with different Er(NO3)3 contents by means of a comprehensive thermal analysis (TG-DTG). HTXRD, SEM-EDS, TEM, AFM and 27Al MAS NMR analyses were used; the activation energy, controlling mechanism function and pre-exponential factor of the thermal decomposition kinetics for kaolinite were obtained through the Coats-Redfern integral and Achar differential methods; and the Ozawa method was used to verify the activation energy. The results showed that as the Er(NO3)3 content increased, the controlling mechanism function of the thermal decomposition kinetics of kaolinite transformed from chemical reaction model F3 to F2, whereas the activation energy and pre-exponential factors decreased rapidly before stabilizing. The corresponding temperature at the maximum reaction rate decreased significantly as the Er(NO3)3 content increased for higher heating rates (≥25 °C·min−1), promoting the thermal decomposition reaction of kaolinite. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra indicated that increasing the Er(NO3)3 content accelerated the transformation of A1VI to AlV as part of the thermal decomposition reaction of kaolinite. Er(NO3)3 in the sample was first converted to ErONO3 and was then dispersed evenly as Er2O3 nanoparticles.Kaolinite is a layered aluminosilicate clay mineral that is contained in abundant natural reserves. The thermal decomposition products of kaolinite have attracted extensive attention due to their high degree of pozzolanic activity ( As highly active catalytic materials, rare earth compounds play a significant catalytic role in the thermal decomposition of materials. The addition of rare earth compounds significantly decreases the thermal decomposition temperature of ammonium perchlorate, increases its heat of decomposition, and promotes its thermal decomposition process ( The raw kaolinite used in this study was provided by Kaolin Co., LTD in China (Suzhou). The chemical compositions of kaolinite are shown in Comprehensive thermal analysis experiments were conducted using a Diamond TG/DTA 6300 integrated thermal analyzer from the PE company in the United States.
