The high-level expression of suspensions up to 50 bar is concerned with the recovery of finest particles, e.g. submicron particles. A so-called Press-Shear-Cell was designed, constructed and tested to measure the most important filtration process parameters. In a first filtration stage, a compressible filter cake builds up from a fine particle suspension. The following cake consolidation is applied to reduce the liquid amount in the small pores of the particle packing. To describe the two-stage expression process of fine sludge, a new dynamic model is introduced. In contrast to the common Tiller–Shirato model, which assumes constant average material properties of particle pressure p

                     s and permeability k inside the cake during constant pressure expression, the new dynamic expression model considers the time and local variation of these material properties. Furthermore, the wall friction resistance is taken into account with the wall friction angle ϕ
                     W and the lateral pressure ratio λ of the cake. The pressure-dependent constitutive functions of kaolin and titanium dioxide filter cakes are shown. Yield loci in a water saturated particle packing were in situ measured with comparatively high normal loads of 100–1000 kPa.The increasing amounts of submicron particles from crystallisation processes and fine sludge in wastewater treatment and mineral processing lead to problems in dewatering processes. The capillary pore pressure of these finest particle packings can only be compensated by a large overpressure to drain it. In these filtration processes, the suspensions are forming very compressible cakes with extreme low permeability. The high-level expression of compressible cakes is an efficient mechanical dewatering process. The filtrate related specific energy consumption amounts only to The expression process can be distinguished into the so-called filtration sub-process and the consolidation sub-process Both filtration and consolidation are considered here as a one-dimensional dynamic problem in a reducing process chamber. The chamber coordinate Shirato and Tiller One-dimensional slice element in process chamber; Neglecting the radial stress distribution of material properties of particle pressure Neglecting classification effects by particle sedimentation; Stochastic homogeneity in the particle packing; Using average values for packing density and permeability which are assumed to be constant during the constant pressure expressing; Neglecting relative motion between particles and liquid phase during the cake formation; Filter medium resistance is obtained from dynamic filtration experiments; Neglecting wall friction. Concerning  (a) Considering dynamic values for the packing density; (b) Validity of Darcy's law, laminar pore flow and constant slice-element permeability; (c) Considering relative motion between particles and liquid phase; (d) Considering lateral pressure and wall friction resistance of particle packing; (e) Filter medium resistance Solving this equation numerically On the top of the cake ( At the bottom boundary a particle pressure With respect to the If the piston reaches the top of the cake, the liquid and particle velocity are identically at this boundary. Therefore, the relative liquid velocity is zero. To evaluate the models described before, the measurement of material properties as packing density A sensor built in the piston surface obtains this pressure. Filtrate flows through the supported filter medium whereas the piston velocity equals the filtrate volume flow rate per unit filter area. To prevent suspension losses, Teflon double lip seals are fixed at the inner and outer circumference of the ring piston. If the filtrate runs dry, the cake is consolidated. The packing density To measure the flow behaviour of the cake, the ring cell rotates driven by a motor with variable revolutions. If the lever arms are touching load cells a relative motion between the ring chamber and the ring piston is generated. To measure the internal friction of the cake the bottom of piston and ring chamber are furnished with small flight plates. Applying additionally a pre-shear stress Generally, considering the essential Considering the steady-state flow as stressing pre-history  In contrast to the packing density, the permeability decreases with increasing pressure because the cake is more and more consolidated, see In situ wall yield loci were measured for steady-state condition against a smooth stainless steel plate Now, the accuracy of simulation results and the analytical Tiller–Shirato model should be compared with expression tests applied in the Press-Shear-Cell. Therefore, the dynamic process model was solved numerically, neglecting here for comparison the wall friction term in An expression model describing the expression dynamics of fine particle suspensions with nanoparticle sizes Filter area [m Filter cross-section occupied by particles [m Particle diffusion coefficient [m Median particle size [m] Equivalent diameter [m] Cake height [m] Piston height [m] Permeability [m Cake permeability at Cake permeability at filter medium [m Cake solid mass per unit filter area Piston pressure [Pa] Compressive modulus [Pa] Horizontal particle pressure [Pa] Liquid pressure [Pa] Axial particle pressure [Pa] Axial particle pressure at filter medium [Pa] Axial particle pressure at cake top [Pa] Horizontal particle pressure at the wall [Pa] Axial particle pressure at the wall [Pa] Filter medium resistance [m Filter medium resistance of pure medium [m Filter medium resistance from Tiller–Shirato model [m Time [s] Process time of consolidating the cake [s] Process time of filtering [s] Liquid velocity [m/s] Circumference [m] Particle velocity [m/s] Shear velocity [m/s] Filtrate mass related energy consumption [MJ/t] Normalized spatial coordinate Coordinate [m] Moisture content in cake [kg liquid/kg solid] Particle volume flow rate per unit filter area [m Liquid volume flow rate [m Filtrate volume flow rate per unit filter area [m Filtrate volume flow rate per unit filter area at filter medium surface [m Relative liquid volume flow rate per unit Filter area [m Compressibility index Fitting constant Porosity Packing density, solidosity Packing density, solidosity at Packing density at filter medium Viscosity [Pa s] Solid concentration of suspension Wall friction angle [°] Wall friction angle at filter medium [°] Wall friction angle at cake top [°] Cake pressure ratio Lateral pressure ratio Lateral pressure ratio at the filter medium Lateral pressure ratio at filter medium Pressure ratio at upper cake surface Liquid density [kg/m Solid density [kg/m Normal stress [Pa] Major principle stress [Pa] Minor principle stress [Pa] Wall normal stress [Pa] Shear stress [Pa] Wall shear stress [Pa] The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in Germany.
