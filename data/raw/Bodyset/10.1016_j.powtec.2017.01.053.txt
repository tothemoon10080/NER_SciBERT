An investigation on the behavior of SnO2 in the tin-bearing iron concentrates during the reduction sintering process (RSP) has been conducted by the authors' group. It was found that only about 30wt.% of tin was removed under the optimal conditions. However, the underlying reason why it was so difficult to remove tin by the RSP was not understood. In this study, the phase evolution of tin oxide, iron oxide and calcium oxide under simulative sintering conditions was investigated by varying the gas compositions, sintering temperature and basicity (CaO/SiO2). The results indicated that the Ca-Sn oxides were prior formed at 900°C–1000°C in the reduction atmosphere with CO/(CO+CO2)=10–40vol.%, while the phases of Fe-Sn spinel (Fe3−xSnxO4) and Ca-Fe-Sn oxides were easily generated as the temperature increased to 1100°C–1200°C. The phases of Fe2−4x/3SnxO3 and Ca-Fe-Sn-Si oxides began to generate at 1100°C in an oxidative atmosphere with O2/(O2
                     +CO2)=25–100vol.%. In addition, increasing alkalinity accelerated the formation of Ca-Sn oxides under reduction atmosphere, which brought about an adverse effect on the tin removal in the sintering process.Tin-bearing iron ore, with the reserve more than 0.5 It is known that iron ore sintering and pelletizing are the predominant processes in the iron-making industry An investigation on the removal behavior of tin in the RSP of the tin-bearing iron concentrates has been performed by the authors' group. Tin-bearing iron concentrates with iron grade of 64.48 Previous researchers have reported the main phase compositions in the slag by reduction smelting processes The testing samples were analytical reagents including Fe All of the reagents were pre-ground until the particle size passed through a 0.074 The purity of gases (CO, CO The roasting parameters were determined based upon the results of previous sintering pot tests. In the sintering process, the flue gas components in the sinter layers with different coke dosages (5 Changing curves of the flue gas and temperature in the sinter layer with 5.0 The sintering time increased obviously when the coke dosage increased from 5.0 The CO/(CO From the above analysis, the parameters of the simulation roasting tests are summarized in All the simulative tests were conducted in a horizontal resistance furnace, and the schematic of the experimental equipment is shown in The mixed materials were first dried in an oven at 105 With the ratio 2:1:2:1 ( As shown in Compared to The XRD patterns shown in As shown in From Fixing the molar ratio as 2:1:2:1 ( As shown in The results indicated that Ca-Sn oxide was much easier to be generated under reduction atmosphere rather than oxidative atmosphere. In addition, previous investigations indicated that Fe The main phases of the samples roasted under different oxidative atmospheres were hematite, lime, quartz and cassiterite as presented in Samples with various basicity of As presented in The basicity, however, has a little effect on the phase transformation in oxidative atmosphere. The main phases of the roasted products with different basicity were hematite, lime, quartz and cassiterite as shown in Based on the above analyses, the phase transformation of Sn-bearing compounds in the mixture roasted under simulative sintering atmosphere is shown in In SnO  The sintering process was divided into two typical stages according to the changing rule of the flue gas compositions in the sinter bed. In In The reduction volatilization of SnO only happened at The authors would express their heartfelt thanks to the
