Cross-linked pectin/high amylose mixtures were evaluated as a new excipient for matrix tablets formulations, since the mixing of polymers and cross-linking reaction represent rational tools to reach materials with modulated and specific properties that meet specific therapeutic needs. Objective: In this work the influence of polymer ratio and cross-linking process on the swelling and the mechanism driving the drug release from swellable matrix tablets prepared with this excipient was investigated. Methods: Cross-linked samples were characterized by their micromeritic properties (size and shape, density, angle of repose and flow rate) and liquid uptake ability. Matrix tablets were evaluated according their physical properties and the drug release rates and mechanisms were also investigated. Results: Cross-linked samples demonstrated size homogeneity and irregular shape, with liquid uptake ability insensible to pH. Cross-linking process of samples allowed the control of drug release rates and the drug release mechanism was influenced by both polymer ratio and cross-linking process. The drug release of samples with minor proportion of pectin was driven by an anomalous transport and the increase of the pectin proportion contributed to the erosion of the matrix. Conclusion: The cross-linked mixtures of high amylose and pectin showed a suitable excipient for slowing the drug release rates.The preparation of new materials for development of drug delivery systems that allow the control of drug release rates according to the specific therapeutic needs represents an important subject of research in the pharmaceutical sciences field. The use of blends of already known polymers represents a rational strategy to reach new materials with distinct properties that can be modulated according to specific uses Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymers that absorb high amounts of water and its increased use in the drug delivery systems formulations is based on its ability to origin a gel network in the swollen state which entraps the drug and acts as a barrier to its release to the medium. In this way, the swelling ability of hydrogels is a fundamental property that should influence the drug release rates, by controlling both the diffusion rate of the penetrant into the matrix and the drug dissolution and diffusion throughout the gel layer of the swollen matrix Starch is a natural polysaccharide composed by amylose, representing the linear fraction of this macromolecule, while amylopectin is highly branched fraction. High amylose, a modified starch containing 70% of amylose, has been used successfully in the research and development of swellable hydrophilic matrices and many studies report their improved properties for controlled drug delivery purposes in relation to conventional starch Moreover, some properties of high amylose starch, such as solubility, swelling, rheological behavior, gel and film formation, and biodegradation rate can be modified via esterification, etherification and oxidation of its hydroxyl groups The successful use of high amylose starch cross-linked by different chemicals, such as epichlorohydrin and sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP), for control of drug release rates in the development of different controlled drug delivery systems have been demonstrated Pectin is a polysaccharide that has been currently used, modified or not, in the composition of hydrophilic matrices and other drug delivery systems, since it is able to form matrix or reservoir systems and exhibits promising mucoadhesive and swelling properties that may lead to an effective control over drug delivery rate Blends of pectin and chitosan were used in preparation of zinc–pectin–chitosan composites intended to colon-specific drug delivery of resveratrol and the colon-specific drug release was reached In other work, blends of high amylose and pectin were exploited for preparing microparticles that exhibited increased encapsulation efficiency and decreased drug dissolution in the simulated gastric condition (pH 1.2) in relation to pectin-based microparticles The improvement of mechanical properties of dispersions of blends of the conventional starch and pectin cross-linked by STMP in relation to isolated polymer was also demonstrated Blends of pectin–high amylose starch cross-linked with STMP in alkaline medium were early synthesized and characterized by Carbinatto et al. (2012) The drug release throughout the swellable polymer matrices can be very complex and the understanding of the different mechanisms involved in this process is fundamental for the rational design of drug delivery systems that can fulfill the different therapeutic needs, by fitting the desired spatial and time drug release schedules. In this work, blends of high amylose and pectin cross-linked with STPM at different degrees were evaluated as excipient of hydrophilic matrix tablets and the influence of cross-linking degree and polymers ratio on the drug release patterns and mechanisms was evaluated. Pectin (type LM-56CS) was provided from CP Kelco (Brazil), high amylose (Hylon VII, 70% amylose, 30% amylopectin) was obtained from National Starch & Chemical (New Jersey, USA), STMP was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Co., (St. Louis, USA), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was supplied by Grupo Química (Brazil), hydrochloric acid was provided by Quimis (Brazil), and nimesulide and sodium lauryl sulfate were from Henrifarma (São Paulo, Brazil). Cross-linking of polymers was performed according to procedure described in our previous paper Pectin and high amylose starch mixed at different mass ratios (1:4, 1:1 and 4:1) were cross-linked with STMP (30% of the polymer mass) at room temperature. Different degrees of cross-linking were achieved by varying the base (NaOH) concentration (2% and 4%) and the pectin/high amylose starch/NaOH/STMP contact time (1, 2 and 4 h). After the reaction time, all samples were treated with the adequate amount of 1 mol/l HCl in order to set the pH at 6. The solids were separated by vacuum filtration and washed repeatedly with ethanol of different concentrations (85°GL, 65°GL and 96°GL). The final product was dried at room temperature for 24 h, pulverized and sieved (sieve opening 0.97 mm). The samples were labeled according to the polymer mixture ratio (pectin:high amylose)–base strength–cross-linking reaction time; samples without cross-linker received a W suffix as presented in Size distribution analysis was performed by using a The dynamics of media uptake was determined on an Enslin's device The bulk apparent density ( The angle of repose was determined according to the free base cone technique The 11-4-2 and 14-4-2 samples were selected as carrier polymer for tablets preparation, since according to rheological data Physical properties of tablets were determined based on pharmacopeial specifications The Drug dissolution data were fitted with different mathematical models ( For all reaction conditions, the 4:1 and 1:1 samples presented the narrowest size distribution (200–700 μm) while 1:4 samples reached 800 μm. However, the major size frequency of all samples was observed in the 300–500 μm range. These similar particle size features can be related to some homogeneity of structures, so that when the stress is applied in comminution process, the fissures are distributed in a somewhat homogeneous manner throughout the fragile points of polymer network, avoiding the occurrence of particles with extreme sizes The swelling degree is an important property to be evaluated in hydrophilic polymers used in controlled drug delivery systems because it is correlated with the diffusion rates of both the penetrant into the matrix and the drug throughout the gel layer of the matrix The values of liquid uptake (%) in media with different pH values (0.1 N HCl, phosphate buffer pH 7.4) are showed in The samples prepared with 2% NaOH at 4:1 polymer proportion exhibited the highest swelling degree, since the most hydrophilic polymer (pectin) is in greater proportion, favoring the swelling The density of a powdered solid influences the flow, so that denser powders present better flow properties The angle of repose and the flow rate are parameters that describe the flow ability of materials The values of flow rate of pectin and high amylose were 2.542 and 0.491, respectively, while the cross-linked samples values were 13.95 g/s (11-4-2) and 11.068 g/s (14-4-2). The higher flow rate values of cross-linked samples confirm that their higher densities favored the flow ability. The values of weight variation, hardness and friability of tablets were 2.57% and 1.66%, 118.7 N and 159.9 N and 0.12% and 0.13% for samples 11-4-2 and 14-4-2, respectively. The results of all physical parameters of tables are in agreement with pharmacopeial specifications The drug release from swellable hydrophilic matrices can be controlled by physical and chemical process, involving the liquid penetration within the polymer network, the swelling of hydrated polymer, drug diffusion throughout swollen matrix and, sometimes, its erosion The The lowest drug release rates exhibited by cross-linked samples (11-4-2 and 14-4-2) demonstrate that the inter-chains ester linkages introduced to the polymer structure by cross-linking reaction should result in a more rigid structure, which originates a more elastic and denser swollen matrix, restricting the motion of chains In the acidic media, the lowest drug release (%) of 11-4-2 sample indicates that due to the higher pectin proportion present in this sample, a more viscous and thicker gel layer can be built, which represents a more resistant barrier against drug diffusion However, in simulated enteric medium (pH 7.4), this sample exhibited the highest drug release rates, which can be attributed to the increased solubility of pectin at this higher pH value, making the drug release faster Besides, in increased pH, the deprotonation and ionization of sulfonanilide group of nimesulide enhance its solubility The fitting of drug release data by appropriate mathematical models that support the interpretation and comprehension of the mechanisms involved in the control of drug release process is a powerful tool to modulate the release features according to specific therapeutic needs. Different mathematical models ( According to The samples 14-4-2 and 11-4-2W fitted better with Peppas model that is based on the Power Law, which establish an exponential correlation between drug release and time; and it must be fitted only to the first 60% of drug release For Peppas model, the value of release exponent ( The The samples 14-4-2 and 11-4-2W fitted better with Peppas model and their respective release exponents ( On the other hand, the release data of the samples 11-4-2 and 14-4-2W presented better correlation with the Weibull model and their respective The change of drug release behavior of sample 11-4-2 in relation to sample 14-4-2 can be attributed to the highest pectin proportion in the former sample, since the more hydrophilic nature of this polymer must have contributed to an effective dissolution of swollen polymer matrix, making the erosion takes place in drug release process, accelerating the drug release rates in the simulated enteric medium. Moreover, the change of release mechanisms between 14-4-2 and 14-4-2W samples also indicated that for samples containing the lowest pectin proportion, the cross-linking reaction allow the building of a more cohesive matrix, preventing the erosion of the system. The blends of high amylose and pectin cross-linked with sodium trimetaphosphate shown to be a promising excipient for swellable matrix tablets intended to controlled drug delivery systems. Samples prepared with 2% of base, containing higher proportion of pectin, showed higher swelling ability, while for samples prepared with 4% NaOH this property was limited by the high cross-linking degree that restricts the motion of polymer chains and decrease the size of polymer mesh. The cross-linking reaction was an effective tool to control the drug release rates and the mathematical models indicated that increase of pectin proportion change the mechanism that drive the drug release process, allowing the erosion of the system.
