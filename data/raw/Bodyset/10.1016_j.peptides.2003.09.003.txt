The interaction of bone cells and their underlying extracellular matrix impacts biological processes such as maintenance of tissue integrity. The biological recognition of the extracellular matrix by attached cells is mediated by the activity of integrins that recognize adhesive-specific domains. The most widely recognized adhesive motif is the RGD sequence, common to many of the adhesive matrix molecules. Here, we show that cyclo DFKRG which was previously selected to increase cell adhesion of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC), increases both cell differentiation and mineralization through activation of tyrosine kinases, focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) and Mitogen Activated Protein (MAP) kinases.The interaction of bone cells and their underlying extracellular matrix impacts biological processes such as bone remodeling, wound healing, maintenance of tissue integrity and also cancer metastasis The biological recognition of the extracellular matrix by attached cells is mediated by the activity of cell-surface receptors such as integrins that recognize adhesive-specific domains on extracellular matrix proteins In our previous study Integrin-mediated adhesion is a complex cascade of biochemical and biomechanical events including recruitment and reorganization of cytoskeletal components (vinculin, talin) and signaling molecules like focal adhesion kinase (p In the present paper, we show that the cyclo peptide stimulates protein tyrosine kinases, increases the phosphorylation of p Cyclo DFKRG and RAFK were from Biomet—Merck Biomaterials R&D Osteoprogenitor cells were isolated from human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) according to Vilamitjana-Amédée et al. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy total RNA kit (QIAGEN) and 2 A mutated osteocalcin (OC) cDNA was made using restriction site directed mutagenesis (Transformer Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Clonech Laboratories Promega). This mutagenesis introduces an Microtiter plates were incubated for 24 HBMSC (10 HBMSC were cultured onto different coatings (10 Thirty micrograms of total proteins extracted from HMBSC were subjected to SDS–PAGE according to Laemmli Protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activities contained in 10–25 Incorporation of As previously demonstrated, HBMSC expressed a broad range of adhesion proteins including α3, α5, αv, β1 and β3 subunits Surfaces coated with cyclo RGD peptide produced a different time course of tyrosine phosphorylation in the p Then, we have investigated the well known kinase activities involved in this process, including PTKs and serine threonine kinases (i.e. MAPK). PTKs play a critical role in the modulation of a wide variety of cellular events, including differentiation growth and metabolism. PTKs activities of HBMSC cultured for 15–60 The level of expression of MAPK proteins (Erk 1 and Erk 2 isoforms) and activated MAPK were determined at 15, 30 and 60 Finally, p38 MAPK phosphorylation was in addition stimulated on cyclo DFKRG peptide at 30 Changes of OC mRNA level in cells cultured for 24 HBMSC were plated on cyclo DFKRG or on uncoated dishes for 3 days in serum-free medium supplemented Our previous studies have analyzed the function of several RGD-containing peptides. Among the different RGD-containing peptides, we have previously selected one cyclo peptide which promotes cell adhesion at very low concentration (10 This hypothesis is strengthened by the data reported in the literature A method for sensitive quantitation of OC mRNA has been evaluated using competitive RT-PCR Early studies on integrin-dependant cell adhesion and signaling demonstrated that cell ligation to the ECM was accompanied by integrin aggregation and that this clustering could trigger increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins Concerning the function of MAP kinases in osteoblast cell differentiation, Lai et al. have demonstrated that Erks members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily play an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation and particularly Erk 1 In conclusion, we have selected a cyclo RGD peptide, specific to αvβ3 and αvβ5 This work was supported by CNRS, INSERM, Pole Aquitaine Santé, by an European Grant No QLK3-1999-00559, ANRT and the Association “Vaincre les Maladies Lysosomiales”.
