In this paper, the problem of Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) is addressed in a particular setting. Autonomous Control Systems (ACS) sharing a single communication channel (Wireless network for example) is considered. The objective is to optimize the sampling rate for the exchange of information between the ACS and the FDI system in order to improve the efficient of fault diagnosis algorithm. In this setting, reducing the number of times that the FDI system is activated implies an optimization of transmission rate in order to reduce energy consumption.
