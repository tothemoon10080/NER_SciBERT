Liquid phase selective homogeneous catalytic oxidation of stearic acid (SA) was carried out to obtain industrially important carbon neutral high-added value octadecanedioic acid (ODDA). The oxidation was carried using air, cobalt(II)-acetate, manganese(II)-acetate and HBr catalyst in acetic acid (AcOH) solvent at an elevated temperature and pressure. SA oxidation products were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), gas chromatography (GC) and CO2 analyzer, and SA was oxidized selectively to ODDA without producing CO2 and intermediates like alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The effect of SA loading (5–20%), pressure (2.8–5.8 barg) and temperature (353–383 K) on ODDA yield was studied by varying one variable at a time. Central composite design assisted response surface methodology was employed to find (i) the optimal design of experiments involving several combination of cobalt(II)-acetate (Co: 0–700 ppm), manganese(II)-acetate (Mn: 0–700 ppm) and HBr (Br–: 0–1144 ppm) and (ii) the most influencing variable and interaction among the variables. The synergistic effect of cobalt(II)-acetate in presence of HBr was observed and suggested that SA oxidation proceeds via bromine-bromide cycle. The elevated temperature and pressure along with reduced SA loading enhanced the yield of ODDA. The maximum ODDA yield was found to be 90.5% and corresponding optimum cobalt (II), manganese (II) and bromide concentration were 600.4, 452.2 and 1016.6 ppm, respectively, at fixed SA:AcOH-10:90, pressure-2.8 barg and temperature-383 K. Finally, SA oxidation kinetic analysis was determined based on the pseudo-first order homogeneous catalysis and found to be kinetically controlled with an average activation energy 34.55 kJ mol−1. The proposed kinetic model fitted well with the time-variant experimental SA and ODDA concentration under varying operating condition with percent average absolute deviation less than 5.0%.Octadecanedioic acid (ODDA: called C18 dicarboxylic acid) is a commercially important monomer with sixteen aliphatic hydrocarbon spacer and used for the production of biodegradable engineering polymers with high crystallinity, excellent solvent resistance power and extraordinary water repellant properties ( Commercially, ODDA was synthesized via microbial fermentation of C18 alkanes or bio-resourced stearic acid using In this study, SA was oxidized using air, cobalt(II) acetate [Co(OAc) Liquid-phase air-oxidation of SA (purity > 98.5%) at a specified temperature (363–383 K) and pressure (2.8–5.8 barg) was performed using Co(OAc) SA oxidation products (at 20 and 50 h) as well as initial feed involving SA, AcOH and catalysts were esterified using a methanolic solution of TMSH, whereas, the vacuum evaporated esterified products were analyzed using GC–MS. The GC–MS analysis was performed using a capillary column DB-5MS (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and high purity Helium carrier gas at 1.0 mL min The base peak in To monitor the oxidation reaction, SA and ODDA were identified and quantified using GC analyzer. Flame ionization detector and capillary column TR-FAME (50 m × 0.22 mm × 0.25 µm) was used for analysis and identical GC operating conditions were employed as described by The effects of SA loading, temperature and pressure on ODDA yield were determined as per the DOEs in Using twenty response values in The GC–MS ( Above SA oxidation is similar to the conversion of the pelargonic acid to azelaic acid and the catalytic activity was explained by the bromine-bromide cycle ( Pressure, temperature and SA loading have the significant influence on oxygen solubility in AcOH that affect the conversion of SA. In this study, the solubility of oxygen was determined under fixed catalyst concentration assuming that no oxidation reaction is taking place during the measurement of solubility. The solubility of oxygen (i.e., [S] in mmol L Oxidation of SA was carried out in the autoclave as per DOEs in The effect of pressure and temperature on the conversion of SA to ODDA was established at temperature and pressure as per DOEs in SA oxidation was performed as per DOEs in In above equation, the positive and negative coefficients indicate the synergistic and antagonistic effect of catalysts on ODDA yield, respectively. The detailed ANOVA results are also given in The order of influence of the individual and interacting effects of [Co(II)], [Mn(II)] and [Br Design-Expert software was used to find the maximum yield of ODDA and corresponding optimum values of the catalyst concentration. Among the optimal solutions, ODDA yield with 81.74% was the most desirable solution and corresponding concentrations of cobalt (II), manganese (II) and bromide were found to be 600.4, 455.2 and 1016.6 ppm, respectively ( Elementary liquid phase pseudo-homogeneous SA oxidation kinetics was determined on the basis of the proposed oxidation pathway ( Defining the conversion of SA Hence, k Under varying catalyst loading for the yield of ODDA ≥ 71.53% (i.e., Run Nos. 3, 4, 8 and 20 in The temperature dependent k The energy of activation for k The ability of Co(OAc) Partial financial support of the project grant from Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at
