The traditional structural analysis of the containment building subjected to aircraft impact forces is often performed using the uncoupled calculation method, which directly applies the reaction force versus time curve to the containment building. The difference between the displacement of containment building calculated with the uncoupled method and that calculated using the coupled method is of significant. In order to explain the cause of this problem, the theoretical analysis of the simplified model are presented. The aircraft is simplified as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model. Three containment building models with different degree of simplification are analyzed, including the elastic free model, elastic clamped model and elastoplastic model with fixed support. The surfaces of these models are perpendicular to the direction of impact. The results indicate that due to Riera assumes the target to be rigid with fixed support, the impact force equation will lead to the calculation time difference between uncoupled method and coupled method. And the difference of time will cause the different displacement of the containment building by order of magnitude. Rieraâ€™s impact force equation is widely used in the uncoupled method, so its rationality has great significance. This work points out the shortcoming of this equation, and provides a theoretical support for the improvement of the containment structural performance analysis method due to aircraft strike, also for the subsequent improvement of the impact force equations.
