Purpose:
                  At a single center we compared the efficacy of 3 generations of lithotriptors using identical protocol inclusion and followup criteria but with different modes of anesthesia.
               
                  Materials and Methods:
                  We compared stone disintegration and dilatation of the pyelocaliceal system achieved in a prospective, randomized trial comparing the original HM3 (Dornier Medtech, Kennesaw, Georgia) and Lithostar® Plus (LSP) lithotriptors, and a matched, consecutive series of 107 treatments with the Modulith® SLX. Stone disintegration and dilatation of the pyelocaliceal system were evaluated by abdominal plain x-ray and renal ultrasonography 1 day and 3 months after treatment.
               
                  Results:
                  A total of 82 treatments with the HM3, 75 with the LSP and 107 with the SLX were analyzed, matched for stone burden and location within the pyelocaliceal system. On postoperative day 1, 91%, 65% and 48% patients treated with the HM3, LSP and SLX, respectively, were stone-free or had fragments that were 2 mm or less (HM3 vs LSP p <0.001, HM3 vs SLX p <0.001 and LSP vs SLX p = 0.015). Three to 5 mm fragments were found in 7%, 21% and 35% of patients (p = 0.006, <0.001 and 0.06), and fragments 6 mm or greater were found in 1%, 14% and 15% (p = 0.002, <0.001 and 0.1, respectively). The re-treatment rate was 4% in the HM3 group, 13% in the LSP group and 38% in the SLX group (HM3 vs LSP p = 0.05, HM3 vs SLX p <0.001 and LSP vs SLX p <0.001). Obstructive pyelonephritis occurred in 1% of the HM3 group, 8% of the LSP group and 5% of the SLX group (HM3 vs LSP p = 0.02, HM3 vs SLX p = 0.12 and LSP vs SLX p = 0.4). All re-treatments except those in 5 patients were performed with the HM3. Therefore, the 3-month stone-free rate was comparable in all 3 groups (HM3 87%, LSP 80% and SLX 81%).
               
                  Conclusions:
                  This study indicates that the HM3 lithotriptor disintegrates caliceal and renal pelvic stones better than the LSP and SLX machines, resulting in fewer complications and re-treatments. Disintegration with the LSP machine was also superior to that of the SLX with a need for fewer re-treatments.The introduction of the first lithotriptor for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), that is the original HM3 in the 1980s, revolutionized renal stone treatment. High success rates with up to 90% or more primary stone disintegration were achieved worldwide and open surgery was replaced by ESWL for almost any stone location in the upper urinary tract. In the following years new lithotriptors were developed to increase patient comfort using dry systems and intravenous sedoanalgesia instead of general or epidural anesthesia, although sedoanalgesia is also used with the HM3 lithotriptor at several institutions. This higher treatment comfort was paid for with less effective stone disintegration and a higher re-treatment rate. In an earlier, prospective, randomized trial at our institution we compared the efficacy of the unmodified HM3 and the LSP lithotriptors on caliceal stones and stones in the renal pelvis. Of 89 patients 83 were treated with sedoanalgesia using 0.04 μg/kg remifentanil per minute. Six patients were given epidural anesthesia because of pain experienced during treatment under sedoanalgesia. The lithotriptors were operated by the same technician at our institution with longtime experience under the supervision of a urologist. Treatment time, defined as time from the first to the final shock wave, as well as fluoroscopy time and the number of applied shock waves were documented in each patient. Stone volume was calculated from abdominal plain x-rays using the computerized stone volumetry system PICA 88. Stone disintegration was classified as stone-free status or fragments 2 mm or less, fragments 3 to 5 mm or fragments 6 mm or greater. Dilatation of the collecting system was classified as grade I—calices not or barely visible, grade II—prominent dilatation of calices with direct extension into the renal pelvis and grade III—an infundibulum of 5 mm or greater. Statistical analysis was performed using the unpaired t, chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. A total of 82 stones in 76 patients in the HM3 group and 75 stones in 69 patients in the LSP group were compared with 107 stones in 89 patients treated with the SLX. In the HM3 group 75 of 76 treatments (99%) were done using epidural anesthesia and 1 of 76 (1%) used general anesthesia. In the LSP group 66 of 69 (96%) treatments were done using epidural anesthesia and 3 of 69 (4%) used general anesthesia. In the SLX group 83 of 107 treatments (94%) were done using sedoanalgesia and 6 of 107 (6%) used epidural anesthesia. Stone burden and stone distribution in the pyelocaliceal systems were comparable among the 3 groups (see Three months after treatment 66 of 76 patients (87%) in the HM3 group, 57 of 69 (82%) in the LSP group and 82 of 89 (92%) in the SLX group were available for evaluation. Of the 66 patients in the HM3 group 58 (89%) were radiologically stone-free, as were 47 of 57 (83%) in the LSP group and 66 of 82 (81%) in the SLX group (no significant differences). Residual fragments 2 mm or less were found in 10%, 10% and 9% of patients in the HM3, LSP and SLX groups, respectively (no significant differences). Three to 5 mm fragments were found in 1%, 5% and 9% of the groups (HM3 vs LSP p = 0.52, HM3 vs SLX p = 0.005 and LSP vs SLX p = 0.02) and 6 mm or greater fragments were found in 0%, 2% and 1%, respectively (no significant differences). No sonographic dilatation of the upper urinary tract was seen in any patient after 3 months. Since the first clinical study of the SLX system in the early 1990s, which showed sufficient disintegration at hospital discharge in 93% or patients In an in vitro study Teichman et al noted that the best fragmentation was achieved with the SLX, followed by the Lithostar® C and HM3 lithotriptors. This was comparable to the results of the SLX predecessor, the Modulith® SL20, with a stone-free rate of 65% to 92%. Due to the smaller focal zone of the SLX precise stone focusing during treatment seems to be mandatory. The need for repeat refocusing during treatment leads to longer fluoroscopy time and overall treatment time for the SLX (see Comparing posttreatment dilatation of the upper urinary tract 1 day after ESWL showed significantly less dilatation in the HM3 group than in the other groups, probably resulting from the high stone fragmentation rate with the HM3. Because early re-treatment in the SLX group was done with the HM3, results in the groups regarding posttreatment complications such as obstructive, febrile pyelonephritis as well as stone disintegration after 3 months were comparable, as expected. What may be the reasons for the less favorable results with the newer lithotriptors? Direct positive pressure resulting in direct action on the stone does not seem to be the only mechanism of stone fragmentation. It has been shown that the portion of the pressure wave traveling outside of the stone surface exerts circular pressure, resulting in a squeezing mechanism with cleavage perpendicular to the wave vector and a compression zone inside the stone. Furthermore, the focal positive pressure peak can be decreased to the lower range of 10 to 30 mPa (40 mPa for the HM3) because this seems to be sufficient to overcome the breaking threshold of calcium containing concrements and artificial stones. The mode of coupling may be another important source of energy transmission loss. Anesthesia should also be considered, in that general or epidural anesthesia keeps the patient quiet without being influenced by discomfort or pain and it maintains a regular respiration rhythm. These are important factors that also influence stone fragmentation results. Briefly, we noted that the best stone disintegration can be achieved with the oldest lithotriptor, namely the original HM3, followed by the LSP and SLX. The newest lithotriptor generation, that is the SLX, also caused the largest residual fragments after 1 day with the highest re-treatment rates, and the longest fluoroscopy and treatment times. Therefore, we conclude that newer is not always better.
