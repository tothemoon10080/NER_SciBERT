In this paper, the preparation of nanosized synthetic rutile by reductive hydrochloric acid leaching of mechanically activated ilmenite concentrate (FeTiO3) is discussed. X-ray fluorescence analysis of the nanosized rutile which forms by rapid hydrolysis of dissolved titanium indicates that the powder contains 91.1% TiO2, 1.3% Fe2O3, 6.3% SiO2. The presence of the rutile phase is confirmed by X-ray diffractometry and the sizes of particles are measured by transmission electron microscopy to be less than 100nm. The photocatalytic activity of nanosized rutile is observed by the decomposition of methylene blue.Although TiO The ilmenite concentrate was screened and the −75 Leaching experiments were carried out under optimized conditions as determined from previous investigations ( The milled powder was added to the reactor such that the ilmenite to hydrochloric acid mass ratio was 1:9.55. After 20 The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by decomposition of an aqueous 0.03 The chemical composition of the ilmenite concentrate and the product was studied by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry (ARL 8410 SEQUENTIAL). Measurement of the surface area was carried out with a standard BET surface area analyzer (Micrometrics Gimini ΙΙΙ 2375, USA). X-ray diffractograms (XRD) of the products were obtained using a Philips DW3710 instrument applying Cu Kα radiation at 50 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out using a Zeiss Em 10c and Stereoscan 5390 Cambridge 1990 instrument, respectively. The ilmenite concentrate BET surface area increased from 0.66 The X-ray diffraction pattern of calcined product showed sharp bands, which confirmed the formation of the highly crystalline rutile phase (  More than 30% of the ilmenite concentrate was converted to nanosized rutile. The nanosized rutile contained 91.1% TiO
