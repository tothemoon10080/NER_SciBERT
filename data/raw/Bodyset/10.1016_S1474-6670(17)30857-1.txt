In the sintering process fine iron ore is agglomerated into porous pieces that are subsequently charged into the blast furnace. This paper sheds light on how neural networks were used to model and optimize the reduction degradation index (RDI), which is an essential sinter quality indicator. Parameters such as the chemical composition of the sinter, the physical conditions of sintering mix and the sintering parameters were used as inputs of a feed-forward neural network in Rautaruukki's case. The outside-air temperature, fuel rate, basicity, titanium content and hematite/magnetite ratio were found to be the most significant variables.
