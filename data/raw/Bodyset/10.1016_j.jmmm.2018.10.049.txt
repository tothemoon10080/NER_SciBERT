The expensive rare earth elements Nd, Pr, Dy and Tb have been extensively used for making NdFeB-based magnets, but the less expensive and high abundant rare earth (HARE) elements such as La and Ce have been over stocked. The marketing expansion of the HARE elements is of much interest in academia and industry to achieve effective and efficient utilization of HARE elements. In this paper, nanocrystalline (Nd1−

                     r value and improved thermal stability of the alloy ribbons are observed for 40 at.% La substituted alloy while the reduction in magnetic properties is only nominal up to 30 at.%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature decreases from 588 K to 561 K with 50 at.% La substitution, which is higher than the equal amount of Ce substitution in Nd-Fe-B. It is shown by the Henkel curves that the alloy with 40 at.% La has the biggest value of positive peak which demonstrates the strongest exchange coupling in the 40 at.% La substituted alloy. The TEM micrographs indicate that the alloy containing 40 at.% La has more uniform and refined microstructure resulted in the enhanced properties.Nd The Ce substitution for Nd has been investigated widely, but Ce It is of high significance to synthesize RE The ingots of the alloys, with nominal compositions of (Nd  The demagnetization curves with different La substitutions in the (Nd Different characterizations were performed to understand the reasons for improved and somewhat abnormal behavior (especially for La-0.4 sample) of nanocrystalline Nd-La-Fe-B alloys.    Exchange-coupling effect plays an important role in the hard magnetic properties since the magnetization reversal is strongly dependent on the inter-granular exchange coupling. The exchange coupling between grains is usually analyzed by using Henkel plots (   The EDS results of (Nd In conclusion, the (Nd This paper was supported by the
