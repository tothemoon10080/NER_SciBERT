This paper evaluates mass-flow estimation capabilities of four online mass-flow sensors: Power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor, and strain gauge. Mass-flow estimates are generated with two methods, linear-regression and non-linear physical mass-flow estimation models. The results of this work indicate very good mass-flow estimation capabilities for all of the sensor types. These accurate and cost-effective mass-flow sensors increase online monitoring capabilities in the mineral-processing plants significantly, also allowing more effective manual process control, as well as the development and implementation of more advanced automatic process control and optimisation systems. However, a reference mass-flow measurement needs to be available for the calibration of the sensors.
