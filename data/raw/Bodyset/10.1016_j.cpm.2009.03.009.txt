Lapidus Arthrodesis is probably the most versatile procedure of the foot and ankle surgeon. The procedure was conceived initially for the surgical treatment of met primus adductus associated with hallux valgus, but has also been used for the treatment of a variety of other conditions including hallux limitus, revision bunion surgery, medial column stabilization, and others. Although the use of the Lapidus in bunion surgery is well supported in the literature, surgeons have been expanding its indications to manage a variety of disorders affecting the foot. As more surgeons continue to gain experience with the procedure, additional studies will emerge, further supporting its versatility in the realm of foot surgery.
