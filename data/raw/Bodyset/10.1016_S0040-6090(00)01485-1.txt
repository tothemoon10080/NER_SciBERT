Formation of epitaxial cobalt silicide film on (100)Si using Co/Ti, Co/Hf, and Co/Nb bilayers has been investigated. The degree of easiness in the epitaxial growth of CoSi2 by annealing the metal bilayers on (100)Si at 800°C was found to strongly depend upon what thin metal layer was used as an epitaxy promoter. Perfect epitaxy of CoSi2 was obtained using Co/Ti/(100)Si. Local epitaxy of CoSi2 was obtained using Co/Ti/(100)Si, while epitaxy of CoSi2 was not obtained for the Co/Nb/(100)Si system. Epitaxial growth of CoSi2 in these Co/metal/Si systems seems to be related to the formation and decomposition of stable reaction barriers like Co–Ti–O and Hf–Si–O compounds at high temperatures. These stable reaction barriers formed at high temperatures make uniform diffusion of Co atoms possible, resulting in the growth of epitaxial CoSi2.Titanium silicide and cobalt silicide are the two most widely used silicides for the self-aligned silicide (salicide) technology In this work formation of cobalt silicide by annealing Co/Ti, Co/Nb, and Co/Hf bilayers on (100)Si has been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). P-type Si wafers with (100) orientation were cleaned in a 10% HF solution and rinsing in diluted water. Then Co/Ti, Co/Nb and Co/Hf layers were deposited on the substrates by dual target sputtering to form a Co(15 nm)/metal(10 nm)/(100)Si structure. The base pressure of the deposition system was 5×10 The epitaxial growth of CoSi After annealing at 500°C, an intensity peak corresponding to a ternary compound of Co–Ti–O is also detected in the glancing angle XRD spectra shown in The XRD spectra of Co(15 nm)/Hf(10 nm)/(100)Si and Co(15 nm)/Nb(10 nm)/(100)Si after rapid thermal annealing for 30 s at various temperatures are shown in For Co/Nb/(100)Si, CoSi
