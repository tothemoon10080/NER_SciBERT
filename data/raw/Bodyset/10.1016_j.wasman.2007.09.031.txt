The effects of amendment with municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) and anaerobically digested sewage sludge (SS) on the compositional and structural features of soil humic acids (HAs) were investigated. For this purpose, HAs were isolated from MSWC, SS, and two different Portuguese soils, a sandy Haplic Podzol and a clay loam Calcic Vertisol, which were either unamended or amended with MSWC or SS at a rate of 60tha−1. The isolated HAs were analyzed for elemental and acidic functional group composition, and by ultraviolet/visible, Fourier transform infrared (FT IR), and fluorescence spectroscopies. The application of MSWC and especially SS to soils determined an increase of C, N, H, and S contents and E

The FT IR and fluorescence results showed that the organic amendments, especially SS, caused an increase of the aliphatic character and a decrease of the degrees of aromatic polycondensation, polymerization, and humification of amended soil HAs. Both MSWC and SS affected more markedly the clayey soil HAs than the sandy soil HAs, possibly due to less extended mineralization processes and the protective action of clay minerals on amended soil HAs.Soil organic matter (OM) is vital to sustain many soil functions (e.g., The application of organic amendments, such as municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) and sewage sludge (SS), to soils is a current environmental and agricultural practice for restoring soil OM content, reclaiming degraded soils, and supplying plant nutrients ( Municipal solid waste compost and especially SS, however, are often regarded as major sources of potential metal pollutants, organic xenobiotics, and infectious disease-causing organisms ( The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of MSWC and SS amendment on the compositional, structural, and functional properties of the HA fractions from two different Portuguese soils, one sandy and the other clay loam. For this purpose, chemical methods and spectroscopic techniques, including elemental and functional group analyses, Two soil samples (approximately 250 Two organic amendments were used: urban sewage sludge (SS) and municipal solid waste compost (MSWC). The MSWC was produced at Amarsul MSW Composting Plant (Setúbal, Portugal), where OM bio-oxidation was carried out during approximately eight weeks. This process was conducted in an enclosure kept under controlled aerobic conditions with forced aeration. The SS was sampled after anaerobic digestion for 24 The principal chemical properties of MSWC, SS, and soil samples were determined by conventional methods ( A greenhouse experiment under semi-controlled conditions was conducted using Kick-Brauckmann’s pots (white inert polyethylene material, with a double wall and a capacity of 7 The HAs were isolated from the organic amendments and composite soil samples by a conventional procedure ( Moisture and ash contents were measured by heating the HAs for one night at 105 and 550 The elemental compositions of the HAs isolated from the unamended soils and organic amendments examined in this work were in general agreement with those reported in other works on similar systems ( With respect to PZha-HA, VRcc-HA was characterized by higher C, N, and S contents and C/H ratio. On the other hand, PZha-HA soil had larger O content and C/N and O/C ratios. The H contents of both soil HAs were similar to each other. The higher O content of the HA fraction form PZha, being sandier than VRcc, could be related to more aerated conditions of the former, which favor oxidation reactions. The application of both organic amendments determined an increase of C, H, N, and S contents, and a decrease of O content of soil HAs, which results in a diminution of the C/N, C/H, and O/C ratios ( With respect to SS-HA, MSWC-HA showed higher total acidity, carboxyl, and phenolic OH group contents ( In agreement with the results obtained by  The results provided by FT IR spectroscopy supported and complemented those of elemental and functional group analyses discussed previously, confirming the much higher aliphatic character and the larger presence of N-containing groups, most probably polypeptidic chains, of MSWC-HA and especially SS-HA as compared to soil HAs. In general, the MSWC and SS application to the soils resulted in a slight increase of relative intensities at about 2930–2920 In general agreement with data reported by The fluorescence EEM spectra of MSWC-HA and SS-HA were characterized by a unique fluorophore centered at an excitation/emission wavelength pair (EEWP) of 340/440 According to The application of MSWC and SS to the soils caused a slight increase of the relative intensity of the shoulders and bands at short wavelength in the excitation spectra, and a slight decrease of the excitation and emission wavelengths of the main fluorophore and of its fluorescence intensity in the fluorescence EEM spectra of soil HAs ( The application of MSWC and especially SS to soils induced an increase of C, N, H, and S contents and
