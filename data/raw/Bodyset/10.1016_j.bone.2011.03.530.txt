 OC precursors (RAW 264.7) were co-cultured in Transwells for 7 During co-culture at different stages of OB differentiation SrRan (10 Interestingly, CaSR gene expression in OB was significantly increased at the late mineralization stage in the 10 In conclusion, SrRan stimulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation while at the same time inhibits osteoclast differentiation. These results show for the first time the beneficial effect of SrRan in a co-culture system of OB and OC and are additional evidence supporting the dual mode of action of this anti-osteoporotic treatment.
