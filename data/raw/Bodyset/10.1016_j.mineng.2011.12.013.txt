Acid mine drainage (AMD) is recognized as one of the major sources of environmental damage in the coal mining industry. The active treatment of AMD involves the addition of alkaline neutralization reagents to raise the pH and precipitate dissolved metals as oxides/hydroxides. This treatment generates large volumes of sludge, which requires further treatment and final disposal. This study is aimed at analyzing the production of magnetite from the iron present in AMD using a selective precipitation/photoreduction combined process. The methods involved include the selective precipitation of iron as a ferric hydroxide, the dissolution of iron with sulfuric acid, the photoreduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, and the conversion of ferric/ferrous hydroxides to magnetite. The magnetite particles were characterized and applied for paint production. The process can be adopted at AMD treatment plants, thereby reducing sludge waste issues and producing a valuable mineral.Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to be an important water pollution problem in coal production. The active treatment of AMD involves the addition of alkaline reagents to increase the pH and precipitate dissolved metals as hydroxides. In this way, active treatment can provide effective remediation; however, it has the disadvantages of high operational costs and problems related to the disposal of the bulky sludge that is produced ( The AMD treatment plants in Brazil mainly use sodium hydroxide or lime for neutralization. The metal precipitates are removed in settling ponds, conventional settling tanks, lamellar tanks, and dissolved air flotation units ( One potential method for increasing the use of natural resources involves recovering potentially valuable products, such as some of the precipitated metals from the AMD. AMD sludge has been considered for the production of coagulants ( The “ferrite process” refers to a high temperature process (65 Magnetite material has been widely used in several industries owing to its chemical composition, structure, and magnetic properties. It can be used as a raw material for the production of metallic iron as well as in the production of paints ( This study is aimed at developing a selective precipitation/UV route for producing magnetite particles from the iron present in AMD. The process involved the precipitation of iron as Fe The conventional synthesis of magnetite by means of chemical precipitation includes the coprecipitation of Fe        AMD was collected from a drainage channel near a tailings deposit in Santa Catarina State (Brazil) and sealed in high-density polyethylene bottles. At the laboratory, the solids and debris in the water samples were removed by settling. The remaining suspended solids were removed by filtration through a 0.45 Iron recovery was achieved by the selective precipitation of 1 The conversion of Fe Magnetite crystallization was carried out by heating the iron solution to 65 Water based black paints were produced with the magnetite prepared as a paste and with the magnetite prepared as a powder. Both types of paints were produced with magnetite particles in a concentration of 2% solids. The color measurements of the paints were recorded by reflectance spectra obtained using a MINOLTA CM-2600D spectrophotometer with an integration sphere associated with an ultraviolet filter. As defined by the CIE-1964, the illuminant D The dissolved metal concentrations in AMD obtained by the iron recovery process are presented in The iron hydroxide/oxyhydroxide precipitate from AMD at pH 3.6 was resolubilized with sulphuric acid to obtain a ferric sulphate solution. The pH of the ferric/ferrous solution was increased to 12.0, allowing the formation of a thin black precipitate which settled in the bottom of the beaker. This precipitate interacted with a magnetic field, thereby indicating the presence of magnetic particles (magnetite or ferrite particles).   The magnetite particles prepared as a paste as well as those prepared as a powder were used for producing a black paint. It was observed that the paint prepared with the magnetite as a paste showed satisfactory results whereas the paint prepared with the magnetite as powder showed problems related to the dispersion of the magnetite particles (  The selective precipitation and UV radiation techniques applied in this study allowed production of magnetite particles from the iron present in acidic coal mine drainage. Precipitating the iron at pH 3.6 allowed the recovery of 96% of the iron in acidic coal mine drainage, which would reduce the overall volume of sludge by 70%. The ferric sludge can be dissolved in a sulphuric acid water solution and processed in a UV/pyrite bed reactor to reach the stoichiometric proportion Fe The authors are also grateful for the financial support extended by FAPERGS, CAPES, CNPq, and the Brazilian Coal Net for this research.
