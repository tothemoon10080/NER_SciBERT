Safety issues have never been so much to the fore as they are today. This proposed text is consequently a most opportune contribution which should be well received by both the students and professional safety officers at whom it is directed. The book is very well written in a commendably easy style which should ensure wide and thorough readership. This text does not attempt to be a comprehensive treatise; that has already been accomplished by my former and highly respected colleague, the late Frank Lees. On the other hand, it is to be regarded as a complement to that book, providing an introduction to the problems and hazards associated with the handling and processing of hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, the book is complete in itself with the twelve chapters providing the reader with a thorough course in the various aspects of safety for the hydrocarbon industry in general. The book reflects the undoubted expertise of the author as a teacher of this subject and it is well thought out with a good selection of numerical problems and with adequate referencing. I am confident the book could become a standard text for many courses in process safety at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.
