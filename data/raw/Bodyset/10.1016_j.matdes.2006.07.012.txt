An experimental investigation on the cold forging of aluminium–3.5% alumina powder metallurgy composite under triaxial stress state condition has been studied in the present work. Sintered aluminium–alumina composite with three different height to diameter ratios, namely, 0.35, 0.56 and 0.72 with three different initial preform relative densities, namely, 0.72, 0.80 and 0.88 were prepared, sintered, furnace cooled and cold upset forged. A new expression for the determination of the radius of curvature of the barrel radius has been proposed based on the dimensional output and density measurement. This calculated barrel radius has been compared with the experimentally measured barrel radius. Various stress ratio parameters, namely, (σ

A straight-line relationship was observed for the measured and the calculated radius of curvature of barrel and an exponential relationship was found between the stress ratio parameters and the relative density.initial diameter of the preform (before deformation) bulged diameter of the preform (during deformation) average contact diameter of the preform (during deformation) initial height of the preform (before deformation) height of the deformed preform (during deformation) initial preform density (before deformation) density of the preform during deformation theoretical density of fully dense material relative density (or) fractional theoretical density ( radius of curvature of the barrel (during deformation) calculated radius of curvature of the barrel (during deformation) measured radius of curvature of the barrel axial stress applied during deformation hoop stress developed during deformation radial stress developed during deformation effective stress developed during deformation mean or hydrostatic stress developed during deformation Poisson’s ratio axial strain during deformation hoop strain during deformation The powder metallurgy has a wide application in various industries and the analysis of metal powder behaviour under various forming processes is of great interest for researchers. Generally each process includes the compaction of metal powders, sintering of green compacts and hot or cold deformation of preforms for the manufacturing of complex parts used for various applications. In the above regard, the deformation characteristics of sintered powder metallurgy preforms are to be carefully studied for powder metallurgy processing. This deformation behaviour has first been studied by Kuhn and Downey The influence of powder particle size, the compacting pressure, the sintering temperature and the forging relative density of the preform billets forged at room temperature have been studied and discussed as described elsewhere Schey et al. At the present work, an attempt is made to relate the various stress ratio parameters determined using the measured values of dimensional output and density measured during cold upsetting of aluminium–alumina composite. The mathematical expressions used and proposed for the determination of various upsetting parameters under triaxial stress state condition using dimensional output and density measured data are discussed in this work. According to Narayanasamy and Pandey According to mass constancy principle, which states that, the mass before deformation is equal to the mass after deformation The above Eq. According to Narayanasamy and Pandey According to Narayanasamy and Ponalagusamy The mean or the hydrostatic stress component can be determined as follows: Dividing Eq. Atomized aluminium powder was procured from M/s. The Metal Powder Company Ltd., Madurai, Tamilnadu, India and analysed for its purity and was found to be 99.7%. The alumina powder was produced as explained elsewhere   The measured barrel radius is plotted against the new parameter according to the theoretically derived equation     Straight-line relationship is established between the fractional theoretical density ( Greater densification is found for the higher initial preform density compared to the lower initial preform density. A straight-line relationship is found between the fractional theoretical density and the new geometrical shape factor. A straight-line relationship is established between the measured and the calculated barrel radius with slope 1.0. The relationship between the stress ratio parameter and the barrel radius is following the empirical expression, The rate of change of barrel ratio with respect to the stress ratio parameter is very high for higher initial preform density and lower for lower initial preform density. A straight-line relationship with different slope value has been established between the two parameters; namely, the various stress ratios and the barrel radius for each aspect ratios and initial preform density tested.
