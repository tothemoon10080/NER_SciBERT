Clavicular fractures are common injuries that traditionally are managed nonsurgically without clinically significant sequelae. However, they may develop hypertrophic callus formation that compresses the brachial plexus. These cases may present months to years after initial injury with varying degrees of pain, paresthesia, and weakness on the affected side and usually are treated by surgical resection of the hypertrophic callus. We present a case of brachial plexopathy due to hypertrophic clavicular callus causing weakness and paresthesia. The plexopathy was confirmed with imaging and electrodiagnostic studies. This case was unusual in that resolution of symptoms was achieved nonsurgically.
