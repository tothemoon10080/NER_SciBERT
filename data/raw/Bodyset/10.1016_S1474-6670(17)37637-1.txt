Artificial intelligence methods such as expert systems, fuzzy systems, neural networks and combinations of these, have become invaluable tools in helping operators to monitor and control processes. These methods can also be used to run processes in a more economically effective way and, in the case of equipment malfunction, they can propose appropriate corrective measures. In this paper an operator support system for the Larox pressure filter is presented.
