In two-dimensional van der Waals crystals, the interlayer stacking sequence often leads to a change in crystal symmetry and, thus, new polymorphs, leading to an abundant array of physical properties. In this paper, we report the polymorphic form of 2H–3R–NbSe2 that exhibits a substantial difference in terms of the gate dependence of semimetallic behavior and Seebeck coefficient, compared to the well-known 2H–NbSe2 with metallic transport behavior. The semimetallic features of 2H–3R–NbSe2 indicate the presence of minor carriers, confirmed through theoretical calculations, which is in good agreement with the transport behavior. Our results reveal perspectives for understanding the metastable 2H–3R phase NbSe2, which is not far from equilibrium, and for engineering the materials necessary for efficient energy harvesting.Two-dimensional (2D)-layered materials provide opportunities to explore largely unreached areas of the materials space. Generally, the physical properties of layered materials are considerably different from those of bulk materials, providing a greater degree of freedom for potential applications. This difference, compared to bulk materials, is primarily caused by the weak van der Waals (vdW) bonds that hold two adjacent layers together. Consequently, the search for new 2D material candidates has been accelerated to expand the array of prospective vdW-bonded materials [ Owing to the insufficient strength in vdW bonds, various interlayer stacking sequences can exist, and, consequently, modulating the stacking order is another pathway to customize the physical properties of 2D materials [ In this paper, we report the first polymorphic form of 2D NbSe 2H–3R–NbSe X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV/ME 200DX, Rigaku) was used for the phase analysis of each crystal powder. The layered crystal structures of the exfoliated 2H- and 2H–3R-layered NbSe Layered NbSe The transport properties of layered NbSe First-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perder–Burke–Ernzerhof functional and the projector augmented plane-wave method implemented in the Vienna The three polymorphs of NbSe To evaluate the thermodynamic stabilities of the NbSe To confirm the stacking pattern of the atomic layers, the atomic structure of the 2H–NbSe Conversely, the 2H–3R phase has quadruple layers of NbSe The crystal structures of the 2H–NbSe We performed Raman spectroscopy of few-layered 2H–NbSe The chemical states of layered 2H–NbSe To verify the change in transport phenomena caused by the different stacking patterns between 2H–NbSe Based on our DFT calculations and previous studies on transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets, mechanically exfoliated NbSe The temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity in 2H–NbSe Conversely, our 2H–3R–NbSe These changes in transport properties can be quantitatively evaluated through a comparison of normalized data using zero-gate values ( Finally, to evaluate the change of electronic band structure caused by the difference in the stacking pattern and to verify the observed transport properties, we have conducted first-principle calculations with DFT based on the structural parameters obtained from the TEM analysis ( In this study, we systematically investigated the crystal structure and electrical transport properties of the two polymorphs of NbSe  The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
