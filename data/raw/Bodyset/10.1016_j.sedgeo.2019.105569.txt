This paper presents macro and microsedimentological data recording subglacial deformation of a sediment succession at Przeszkoda in north-central Poland under the Vistula Ice Stream at the southern fringe of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet during the Weichselian glaciation. The sediment succession consists of (i) undeformed outwash sand, (ii) deformed outwash sand, (iii) bedded till, and (iv) massive till. These deposits were examined in a closely sampled vertical profile for kinematic structures, macrofabrics, grain shape characteristics, and micromorphology (detrital components, microstructures, clast microfabrics). The analyzed parameters suggest that the deposits were generated by a progressive homogenization and mixing of local material with far-travelled detritus successively released from the active ice sole. Grain crushing and abrasion characteristics lack any obvious trends in the vertical profile, indicating that the deformation was focused in a thin (cm-scale) layer which progressively migrated upwards parallel with sediment accretion. The closely spaced thin sections were collected in the deformed outwash sand, bedded till and massive till units. These revealed formation and evolution of stress-induced foliation in the glacier bed whereby three microfabric generations including S1 (earliest), S2 and S3 (latest) foliation were recognized. The geometry of these microfabrics is consistent with their formation in response to the development of subhorizontal Y-type shears, and up-ice dipping P-type and down-ice dipping R-type Riedel shears within the subglacial shear zone. The geometry and cross-cutting relationships between the microfabrics throughout the succession reflects changing deformation styles within a thin deforming bed that migrated time-transgressively up the profile during till accretion. Strain magnitude accumulated in the whole sediment succession was low, in the range of 101 to 102, suggesting that enhanced basal sliding was an important component contributing to fast flow of the ice stream.One prominent challenge in glaciology is the understanding of ice sheet dynamics which depends largely on basal conditions and the strength of coupling at the ice-bed interface ( A large portion of the forward motion of warm-based glaciers is considered to be accommodated by bed deformation and/or basal sliding over the substrate due to elevated subglacial water pressures ( Some modern ice streams flow with high velocities over soft, deformable sediments at low basal shear stresses of <15 kPa (  Specifically, the aim of this study is to present geological and micro-morphological data recording subglacial deformation of a sedimentary succession generated by the VIS that operated at the southern fringe of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) during the Poznań (=Frankfurt) phase of the late Weichselian glaciation ( The study site at Przeszkoda is located within the Dobrzyń Plateau in a former gravel pit near Rypin in north-central Poland about 50 km east of Toruń ( The topography of the area is dominated by gently undulating hummocky terrain, which reaches a maximum height of 135 m (a.s.l.). This terrain is locally incised by numerous narrow (up to 4 km wide, 35 m deep) NW-SE orientated tunnel valleys ( At Przeszkoda, the NW-SE orientated pit section is 20 m long and up to 10 m high, and aligned parallel to the ice flow direction. The succession comprises a Weichselian till resting on Saalian sand and gravel outwash ( The glacial outwash and the overlying till were examined using a range of field and laboratory macro- and microscale techniques. Prior to sampling, the macroscale textural and structural characteristics (geometry of the units, Munsell colour of sediment, lithology, macroscopic deformation structures, etc.) were photographed and described ( Clast macrofabric data from the till are based on the orientation of 90 elongated gravels and cobble sized clasts with a-axes lengths in the range between 1 and 10 cm ( Bulk samples for the grain-size analysis in the <2 mm fraction were collected from the sand (9 samples) and diamicton units (9 samples). The samples were analyzed in laboratory using sieve and laser methods displayed as weight percentage distributions ( In total 15 sand and till samples were collected to examine the shape characteristics of sand fraction grains (0.063–2.000 mm) to determine possible grain modifications by subglacial shearing. This was performed in the QicPic dynamic image analysis apparatus with the accompanying particle image analyzing software WINDOX (Sympatec, 2008). Recorded were sphericity, aspect ratios and convexity of two-dimensional grain projections generated by a laser beam and expressed by dimensionless values ranging between 0 and 1. Sphericity is equivalent to angularity in the sedimentological terminology whereby value of 1 denotes a spherical grain. Aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the minimum to maximum grain dimension (Feret diameter). Convexity describes the compactness of a particle ( Undisturbed samples for microstructural analysis were collected in four standard (8 × 6 × 4 cm) Kubiëna tins oriented in landscape mode, inserted into the face of the sediment section, and carefully extracted. The geographical position, orientation relative to magnetic north, depth and way-up of the samples were marked on the tins during collection. The samples were collected so that kinematic indicators ( Thin sections were produced at Royal Holloway University of London after Mineral composition of the sand fraction in thin sections was determined under a petrographic microscope Nikon Eclipse E600 Pol along four transects perpendicular to stratification in each thin section. All samples examined in thin sections had similar area ~35 cm Based on the lithological and structural characteristics of the sediments, the succession is divided into four horizontal, laterally extensive sediment units ( The undeformed outwash sand is the oldest/lowest unit. It comprises a ~7 m-thick, well-bedded succession of poorly sorted fine- to coarse-grained sands with common interbeds of gravel and cobble gravel ( The undeformed sands grades upward into a 20 cm-thick unit of variably deformed sand. The colour (pale yellow 2.5Y 8/2 to olive yellow 2.5Y 6/6) and lithological properties (e.g., poorly sorted and fine- to coarse-grained sands) of this unit are similar to the underlying undeformed sand, indicating that it represents a tectonised equivalent of the later. The unit is characterized by attenuated bedding and boudinage of thin sand layers ( The deformed sand unit grades upward into the bedded diamicton (till A) through a thin (up to 5 cm) transitional zone of sandy diamicton recording partial mixing of the two lithologies ( The bedded diamicton is overlain by a massive, matrix supported, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) diamicton forming a surficial deposit below the modern soil ( Clast macrofabrics in the massive diamicton indicate local ice flow direction from NNE/NW to SSE/SE ( Within the sedimentary succession, both outwash sand units show similar grain-size distribution with the same weighted peaks in the fine-sand fraction ( The majority of sand-size particles from all units within the succession show similar smooth outline shapes with a low-relief features represented by fine asperities ( The shape values are high in all units whereby aspect ratios are above 0.63, and sphericity and convexity values are above 0.83 ( The sand fraction in all samples shows a fairly similar composition ( Lithic fragments are more abundant in till unit B (up to 12% in the uppermost thin section) than in till unit A (2%) and in the deformed sand (1%). All samples throughout the succession contain polycrystalline quartz. Till unit B (samples PRZ-04 and PRZ-03) shows greater variety of lithic fragments than the underlying units. It contains bioclastic limestones whereas other lithic fragments are granites, gneisses, amphibolites and basalts ( Accessory minerals are mainly glauconite, chlorite and zircon ( In thin section the sand is fine- to medium-grained and moderately sorted. The sand is largely massive, except for localized subhorizontal to very gently NW-dipping faults in the lower part of the thin section ( In thin section the till is composed of alternating thin (1–30 mm) layers of diamicton and sand ( Deformation microstructures present throughout the sample are linear grain alignments and rare crushed grains ( The layering within the unit is occasionally faulted by sub-horizontal to gently inclined (10°-20°) thrusts dipping up-ice to the NW ( Both thin sections from till B reveal that this unit is an apparently massive matrix-supported diamicton ( Plasmic fabric is in general well (sample PRZ-04) to moderately (sample PRZ-03) developed and is of skelsepic type ( Clast microfabrics in all thin sections from the deformed sand and till units A and B reveal two prominent generations of fabrics defined by the preferred shape alignment of sand to coarse-silt detrital grains: (i) gently to moderately inclined foliation (dark green domains in All microfabrics are defined by the discontinuous short to elongated and relatively planar domains. Foliations in massive diamicton (samples PRZ-04 and PRZ-03) are better developed and define a more complex pattern than in the underlying units (samples PRZ-06 and PRZ-05) ( However, the up-glacier dipping foliation in till unit B reflects local domains with S-shaped, sigmoidal geometries characteristic of asymmetrical fabrics (ECC) ( The sub-horizontal domains within the succession appear to occur in discrete bands separated by microlithons that lack any obvious clast microfabric development ( Based on the cross-cutting relationships between clast microfabrics in the deformed sand (sample PRZ-06) and till unit A (sample PRZ-05) the up-glacier dipping foliation is the earliest (S1) fabric, whereas the sub-horizontal foliation cross-cut S1 is therefore younger (S2) ( Micromorphological mapping revealed the presence of the S-matrix brittle microstructures (crushed grains and linear grain alignments) ( The circular alignments of grains originated during deformation of diamicton under a higher subglacial water pressure and indicate material rotation ( Till pellets found in till B are interpreted as fine-grained intraclasts reworked by sediment rotation during shearing in a deforming layer (cf., Skelsepic plasmic fabric in the both till units containing clay minerals indicates material rotation during shearing ( Although crushed grains occur in all units, their proportions are rather low and, importantly, stable in the vertical profile. This may suggest that the sediment succession has not been deformed pervasively across its entire thickness at the same time but rather that the deformation occurred in a thin subglacial shear zone migrating time-transgressively upwards as the till was accreting (cf., The closely spaced thin sections reveal formation and evolution of stress-induced foliation in the bed whereby three microfabric generations including S1, S2 and S3 foliation are recognized ( Further progressive mixing and homogenization of sand and diamicton generated massive till unit B with similar sub-horizontal (S1) and up-ice dipping (S2) microfabrics reflecting development of Y-type and compressional P-type Riedel shears, respectively ( The changing style of deformation in the VIS bed is reflected by micro- and macroscale structures indicating rotation, compression and extension representative of a ductile-brittle shear zone (cf., A combination of structural and textural data from the Przeszkoda records a complexity of subglacial processes there. Consistent with As the ice sheet overrode the outwash sediments, a zone of shearing formed at the ice-bed interface. Deformation of the top part of the outwash was followed by glacitectonite formation ( Till A consists of local substrate and far-travelled material. We suggest that this complex provenance resulted from glacitectonic deformation of the local sand material and its progressive mixing with the Scandinavian and Baltic basin material successively released from the overriding ice, leading to the production of a subglacial traction till ( The structure, composition and grain morphology in till B suggests that this unit originated by a combination of material released from the active ice base, entrainment of substrate sediments, deformation and ploughing. The gradual transition from till A to till B reflects continued mixing of sand and diamicton during shearing (cf., The presence of VIS controlled the ice discharge pattern along aa large portion of the southern Scandinavian Ice Sheet ( Sedimentological studies of tills in numerous field sites within the Vistula ice lobe indicate a high subglacial water pressure and fast ice flow ( The model of a deforming bed where the shear strain increases towards the glacier base ( Laboratory experiments on till microfabric evolution during progressive deformation conducted by This macro- and microscale study of structurally and texturally diversified sediment succession at Przeszkoda reveals a hybrid of deformation and deposition processes related to a thin, transient ductile-brittle shear zone beneath the Vistula Ice Stream. The main findings are: Ductile (folds, turbate structures) and brittle (faults, thrusts, linear grain alignments, crushed grains) deformation structures occurring throughout the succession suggests that subglacial water pressure fluctuated in the vicinity of ice floatation pressure affecting the strength of basal coupling during shearing. Three successive generations of foliation (S1 to S3) developed during bed deformation in the subglacial shearing zone. The geometry of microfabrics across the sediment succession indicates that the foliations originated under a stable stress regime. Cross-cutting relationships between the microfabrics reflect changing deformation style within a thin deforming layer that migrated time-transgressively upwards parallel with till accretion. The till micro- and macrofabrics are strong and stable (E1 > 0.76). Grain crushing and abrasion characteristics lack any obvious trends in the vertical profile suggesting a low degree of particle shape modification, possibly due to a relatively low stress concentration at grain edges and low shear strain. Deformation was focused in a thin (cm-scale) layer that progressively shifting upwards rather than embracing the whole sediment succession at the same time in one thick, pervasively deforming layer. The rounded till pellets and mud clasts show no evidence of flattening or attenuation, and crushed grains are rare; both suggest that the till experienced a low strain. The combination of macro- and micro-sedimentological features listed above may be indicative for fast ice flow (streaming) at very low basal shear stresses which corresponds very well to the flow stress regime conditions reported from beneath the modern ice streams. This research provides complex qualitative and quantitative characteristics which can be useful in recognizing past beds of ice streams from geological record elsewhere. A complex set of processes of till formation and deformation is documented, which produced a macroscopically massive diamicton due to the progressive homogenization and mixing of local material with far-travelled material successively released from the ice sheet base at low cumulative shear strains. These findings question that the common notion that subglacial deformation produces massive tills as a result of high shear strains. A complex cross-cutting pattern of variably oriented P-, Y- and R-type Riedel shears contributed to sediment mixing and homogenization. Strain magnitude accumulated in the whole sediment succession and estimated from the deformation structures and micro- and macrofabric data was low, in the range of 10 The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
