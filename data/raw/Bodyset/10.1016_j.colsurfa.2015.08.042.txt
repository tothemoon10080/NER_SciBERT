Silicic acid polymerization on metal oxide surfaces depends upon the orientation of sorbed monomers. This work explores how H4SiO4 polymerization at the water–iron oxide interface is influenced by the presence of arsenate (AsV), a sorbing ligand that does not participate in the polymerization. In situ infrared spectroscopy showed that the presence of a high surface coverage of AsV on the iron oxide surface inhibited H4SiO4 polymerization as expected from first principles. However, the presence of a low AsV surface coverage on the iron oxide surface actually promoted H4SiO4 polymerization which was unexpected. The mechanism by which AsV could promote H4SiO4 polymerization is not immediately obvious and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to explore possible explanations for this observation. These simulations indicate that the most probable explanation involves both AsV and H4SiO4 preferentially sorbing on sites that are further away from sites already occupied by AsV. This is expected due to localized electrostatic repulsion. In this way the presence of AsV on the surface will increase the probability of sorbed H4SiO4 monomers being on adjacent sites at low AsV surface coverage but will have the opposite effect at high AsV surface coverage.Silicic acid (H Previous work in our group has determined how the arrangement of sorption sites on an oxide surface influences H In this work we use in situ Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared (ATRIR) Spectroscopy to follow the reaction of an iron oxide with mixtures of H All solutions were made from 18 One microliter of a 10 The IR spectra are reported as recorded apart from correcting for baseline drift by taking a linear baseline from 1250 to The IR spectra recorded over time as H The trimeric species forms by the insertion of an H A quantitative analysis of the spectra involved Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR–ALS) using Matlab The ATRIR spectra recorded over time as As The number of components necessary to describe the matrix of IR spectra of sorbed As In situ ATRIR experiments with 2 sorbents were conducted under 3 scenarios; As In the system where As To estimate the relative concentrations of the sorbed species in each system the spectra were fitted using MCR–ALS and the components determined from the single sorbate systems (Section To explain the mechanisms by which the presence of As Monte Carlo simulations can provide insights into the approach of a complex system to equilibrium Surface heterogeneity was introduced by scaling the probability of polymerization with a (sin Initial simulations were for the simplest system in which all sites are equal and there was just a monomeric sorbed H The probability of H Initially the reactions described above were simply combined.
