A step-wise treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incinerator fly ash including washing, milling and sintering was investigated in order to manufacture ceramic materials with improved physical, mechanical and environmental properties and, possibly, to reduce the power input of the sintering process. An interpretation of the test results based on the microstructure of sintered products and sintering kinetic modeling was also attempted to identify the densification mechanisms. It was found that milling of washed fly ash represents a basic step for manufacturing high-density ceramic materials with very high compressive strengths (up to 500N/mm2). A significant reduction in the power input of the sintering process (reduction of firing temperature from 1210°C for washed fly ash to 1140°C for milled-washed fly ash) is also achieved. A dense, well-sintered microstructure is formed through an intermediate-stage, liquid-phase sintering mechanism controlled by liquid-phase diffusion and grain shape accommodation. Such a microstructure is able to strongly immobilise heavy metals, thus giving good environmental properties to sintered product.Among the solid residues generated from incineration of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), fly ash is regarded as a very toxic material owing to its high content of leachable heavy metals and, in some cases, to the presence of chlorinated organic compounds. In Italy, the amount of MSW produced is about 29 At present, landfilling is a common practice for the disposal of fly ash from MSW incineration, although a preliminary treatment of this material is needed to reduce its hazardous characteristics ( In recent years, thermal treatment such as melting and sintering have been proposed to convert MSW incinerator fly ash into glass- and ceramic-type materials, respectively ( The melting technology generally involves the heating of fly ash at high temperatures (>1300 Sintering is certainly a less expensive technology than melting. However, the performance of the sintering process is strongly related to the chemical composition of raw fly ash and, in many cases, this process proves to be ineffective for the conversion of raw fly ash into ceramic materials with good mechanical characteristics. It was also found ( In the present study, a step-wise treatment of raw MSW incinerator fly ash including washing, milling and sintering was investigated in order to manufacture ceramic materials with improved physical, mechanical and environmental properties and, possibly, to reduce the power input of the sintering process, in view of the possible utilisation of such materials as artificial aggregates for high-strength concrete formulations. The effects of particle size, powder compaction pressure, and firing time and temperature on the physical properties, mechanical properties, and leaching behaviour of the sintered products were studied. An interpretation of the test results based on the microstructure of sintered products and sintering kinetic modelling ( The MSW incinerator fly ash used in this study came from an Italian MSW incineration plant equipped with an electrostatic precipitator and a wet treatment unit for acid gas removal. Grab samples of raw fly ash (RFA) were collected from the electrostatic precipitator at three time intervals on a daily basis over a one-week period, in order to obtain a representative ash sample to be used for all experiments. An aliquot of this sample was subject to a four-stage washing treatment with deionised water (liquid-to-solid weight ratio Raw and washed (WFA) fly ash were dried at 105 The thermal behaviour of RFA and WFA was evaluated by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) over a temperature range of 25–1300 The chemical composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (major elements), TGA/DSC analysis (coal, carbonates, and loss on ignition), and HNO Particle size analysis was carried out using a laser particle size analyser and dodecane as a non-reactive suspending medium. The main crystalline phases were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis using 50 Samples of washed fly ash were dry-milled for 5 Dried powder of RFA, WFA, or MWFA was uni-axially pressed in a stainless steel die, to form 15 The sintered products were tested for their density (fired density) and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) using five replicate specimens and standard test procedures. Some products were also characterised for their loss on ignition (LOI), shrinkage, water absorption, microstructure, and formation of new crystalline phases. The percentage shrinkage was determined from the reduction in sample diameter and height. The water absorption capacity was evaluated by measuring the weight increase of surface dry samples after their 24 The sintered product with the best physical and mechanical properties (sintered MWFA) was also characterised for its environmental properties. First, the retention capacity of heavy metals during sintering was evaluated through HNO This leaching test was performed on three replicate monolithic specimens that were placed in a prismatic container and contacted with 22 Finally, crushed samples of sintered product were used for determining the acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) and the heavy metal leachability at different pH values ( The ANC test, coupled with leachate analysis, was performed on 5-g crushed samples of sintered product (particle sizes <2.0  The major elements of the raw fly ash were Ca, Cl, and Si accompanied by lesser amounts of K, Na, Al, S, Mg, and Fe. The main heavy metals of environmental concern were zinc and lead accompanied by lesser amounts of Cu, Cd, Cr, and Ni. The raw fly ash was also characterised by a very high content of water-soluble compounds such as alkali metal (Na, K) chlorides and sulphates and calcium sulphate (LOS The main crystalline phases of RFA identified by XRPD (see The composition of the RFA investigated was consistent with those reported in the literature for other raw fly ashes ( Due to a high release of water-soluble compounds and a low release of heavy metals from the raw fly ash during washing steps, the washed fly ash was found to be richer in heavy metals and much less rich in chlorides and sulphates than raw fly ash ( Due to solubilisation of alkali metal chlorides and sulphates during washing steps, the washed fly ash was also characterised by a much lower loss on ignition (13.0% at 1300 The TGA/DSC thermograms of WFA ( The XRPD pattern of WFA (see The washed fly ash exhibited a lower particle density as compared to RFA (2.33 against 2.53  As a result of the milling step, the milled-washed fly ash was virtually free of porosity (particle density  Increasing compact pressure ( The compressive strength and fired density of the sintered products were primarily affected by the type of powder and, to a minor extent, by the compact pressure. The sintered RFA specimens were always characterised by very low UCS values (1.3–7.4 Irrespective of the compact pressure used, the highest values of UCS and fired density were always measured on sintered MWFA samples. A compact pressure of 14  Over the whole range of temperatures investigated, poor consolidation was always achieved for RFA samples (highest UCS value of 6.8 On the contrary, both WFA and MWFA samples showed progressive and remarkable consolidation with increasing temperature. In particular, over the range of temperatures from 950 to 1140  In the case of WFA samples, no significant change in UCS and fired density with sintering time was observed over the whole range of The practical inference of these results is that ceramic materials with UCS values above 275 On the other hand, in case of manufacturing ceramic materials with UCS below 275 In spite of the much lower UCS values exhibited by sintered WFA ( On the other hand, RFA specimens sintered at 1210 With reference to the fired density and UCS characteristics, both the WFA and MWFA specimens sintered at their optimal firing temperatures were able to meet the requirements for normal-weight aggregates for use in concrete (density of 2.0–3.0  These patterns revealed that fired RFA, WFA and MWFA specimens were all characterised by the same crystalline phases, in spite of their different sintering temperatures. The main crystalline phase was always gehlenite (Ca  The WFA products showed a highly porous fracture surface with a significant amount of isolated, approx. spherical, closed pores ( Although the MWFA products showed a comparable percentage weight loss (LOI Based on the fired densities of the products after 60 The higher amount and larger sizes of closed pores present in the sintered WFA specimens may explain their reduced UCS and fired density as compared to sintered MWFA ( The fracture surface morphology of both types of products suggested that their densification occurred via a liquid-phase sintering mechanism.  According to As shown in Although the shrinkage data for sintered WFA specimens fitted Eq. The shrinkage kinetics observed for WFA specimens differed from those previously found for other types of washed fly ash when they were sintered at 1140 As anticipated, the sintered product with the best physical and mechanical characteristics (sintered MWFA; compact pressure Chemical analysis showed that the contents of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the sintered MWFA specimens were 360, 274, 2350, 120, 11,400, and 18,200 Although these retention levels were much higher than those reported by other authors (  As can be noted from  The raw fly ash showed a remarkable acid neutralisation capacity (10.5 As a result of the washing step, the washed fly ash was found to have a slightly higher ANC value (12.0 The titration curve of sintered MWFA showed a much lower ANC (1.0  These results indicated that the leachate pH was the major parameter controlling the release of heavy metals from both sintered and not sintered samples. However, differently from what was found for leaching of heavy metals from not sintered RFA and WFA samples (typical changes in metal release with leachate pH), sintered MWFA showed an abrupt change in the leaching behaviour with leachate pH in correspondence of a narrow pH range. At pH values above 6.8, very low releases of heavy metals were always measured irrespective of the leachate pH. Releases of 0.1 These results indicated that: (1) the great reduction in metal release caused by sintering was attributable to encapsulation and incorporation of metallic species into new glassy and crystalline phases formed during thermal processing and (2) the chemical resistance of such solid phases was greatly reduced under acid pH conditions. However, this deficiency should not reduce the possibility of using sintered MWFA products as artificial aggregates in concrete formulations, taking in mind the very high pH values (13.0–13.5) exhibited by the pore solutions within cementitious matrices. A step-wise treatment of raw MSW incinerator fly ash including washing, milling and sintering proves to be effective for manufacturing ceramic materials with improved physical and mechanical characteristics (compressive strength A much more dense, well-sintered microstructure with a reduced amount of rounded, closed pores and an insignificant amount of open, water-accessible pores is formed through an intermediate-stage, liquid phase sintering mechanism, with densification being controlled by liquid phase diffusion and grain shape accommodation. Such a microstructure is able to encapsulate and incorporate the heavy metals into the glassy and crystalline (mainly, gehlenite) phases formed during thermal processing, thus greatly reducing the heavy metals leachability from the sintered products. With respect to not sintered raw and washed fly ash, the sintered products show lower acid neutralisation capacity as a result of the binding of the metal oxides responsible for buffer capacity (mainly, CaO and Al Although a reduced volatilisation of heavy metals is attained during sintering of milled-washed fly ash, this phenomenon remains a problem to be solved prior to possible industrial application of such a method of ceramic processing.
