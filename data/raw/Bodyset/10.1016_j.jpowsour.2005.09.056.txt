The oxidation behavior of a Fe–16Cr alloy containing a small amount of Mn oxidized in air for up to 500h within the temperature range of 650–850°C was examined. Two consecutive oxidation stages were found and these obeyed the parabolic rate law with various rate constants. Formation and growth of Cr2O3, MnCr2O4, surface nodules and oxide spallation were found to be responsible in the oxidation stages accordingly to various situations. The thin film X-ray diffraction, SEM and EDX confirmed the duplex oxide microstructure with MnCr2O4 on top of Cr2O3, Cr and Mn diffusion in Cr2O3 is considered to be responsible for the formation of each layer, respectively. The estimated area specific resistance (ASR) suggests the possibility of using this alloy as the interconnect material in reduced temperature SOFCs, however, surface modification to enhance its oxidation and spallation resistances is desired.Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are high-energy power generation systems, directly converting the chemical energy of fossil fuels into electricity without combustion and mechanical processes Several kinds of Cr The present work examines the oxidation kinetics and corresponding phase evolution of a commercial Fe–16Cr alloy oxidized in air (simulating the SOFC cathode atmosphere) from 650 to 850 The Fe–16Cr alloy was provided by Yuhang Stainless Steels Ltd., containing 82.12 The cleaned specimens were weighed, heated in a furnace to 650, 750 and 850    As mentioned above, the main reaction products in the oxide scale are Cr In the present alloy, the content of Mn is around 0.26 The present Fe–16Cr alloy exhibited two-stage oxidation kinetics at the various temperatures studied, represented by Two-stage oxidation was reported in Fe–Cr–Mn alloys At 850 For SOFC interconnect application, the ASR is required to be smaller than 0.1 Cross section observation ( The Fe–16Cr alloy demonstrated two-stage oxidation kinetics when oxidized at 650, 750 and 850 This research was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China under the project contract 50471063, the “863” high-tech project under contract 204AA32G070.
