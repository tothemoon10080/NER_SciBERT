Previous studies have related the low recovery of nickel and cobalt in the Caron roast-leach process to the formation of less reactive sulfides during roasting and/or the passivation or surface blockage of ferronickel by oxides and/or sulfides. This study examines the different types of reactions and background reagents which may affect the dissolution of nickel and ferronickel alloy in oxygenated NH3/NH4

                     − solutions at 45°C based on equilibrium constants and measured leach results at a low solid/liquid ratio of 1g/dm3. Some of the additives tested in the present study represent interim leach products. Initial leaching rates of nickel during oxygenation of presoaked Fe–Ni alloys decreases with increasing iron mole fraction. The Fe–Ni(45%) alloy continues to react and dissolve about 90% Ni over the first 15–40min, depending upon the additives. In contrast, iron leaching reaches a broad maximum of ~10% over 20–35min, or a sharp maximum of 6% after 5min in the absence or presence of additives, respectively. This is followed by a decrease in iron extraction to ≤2% after 45–60min due to the precipitation of red/black oxides and sulfides. Direct involvement of S2O3
                     2− and redox mediation by Cu(II) or Co(III) is evident from the enhanced initial rates of nickel leaching from Fe–Ni(45%) alloy in the order: O2/HS−
                     ≪O2
                     <O2/S2O3
                     2−
                     <O2/Co(III)/S2O3
                     2−
                     <O2/Cu(II)/S2O3
                     2−. While the added S2O3
                     2− has a detrimental effect on iron leaching, HS− retards the leaching of both iron and nickel from Fe-Ni(45%) alloy to <1%. The final leaching of 95% Ni from Fe–Ni(45%) alloy after 3h is unaffected by Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, but FeOOH causes about 5% decrease in nickel leaching. Thermodynamics predict the passivation of nickel and ferronickel by M(OH)3–MOOH as well as the formation of MFe2O4.In the Caron roast-leach process practised in Australia (Greenvale-Yabulu), Brazil (Niquelandia) and Cuba (Nicaro, Punta Gorda), the nickel laterite ores undergo reduction roasting at ~ The transformation of serpentine to olivine and the reduction of goethite to magnetite and ferronickel alloy at a very low pO The reduced ore of mean particle size ~ The Fe–Ni–Co alloy in the calcine is leached using NH The unreduced Ni–Co-oxides entrapped in Fe Further downstream processing involves separation of metal ions via solvent extraction, precipitation of mixed sulfides or cobalt oxide/carbonate and nickel carbonate, calcination of nickel carbonate to nickel oxide, and hydrogen reduction of nickel oxide to yield nickel metal. The tailings from final thickener underflow are discarded after steam stripping to recover NH Notable advantages and issues of concern in the Caron roast-leach process are: high energy consumption in the drying and roasting processes, compared to the direct atmospheric or high pressure leaching of nickel laterites ( removal of iron as Fe recovery of the two main reagents (NH slow kinetics, where up to 8 high nickel and cobalt contents in the Caron tailings ( Different reasons have been proposed to explain the low metal recovery in the Caron process, typically 80% Ni and 60% Co in the Yabulu plant ( Despite evidence of the formation of ferronickel during roasting, limited studies have been reported on the leaching of ferronickel particles under Caron conditions and on the effect of various reagents on the leaching behaviour of nickel and iron from alloy ( This study extends a previous investigation on nickel and nickel sulfides leaching in NH compare and contrast the leaching behaviour of roasted calcines of laterite ores reported in the literature with that of pure nickel and ferronickel from this study at different alloy compositions, compare and contrast the leaching behaviour of an alloy sample of given composition Fe–Ni(45%) in the absence or presence of Cu(II), Co(III), S examine the effect of FeOOH, Fe Nickel, ferronickel and iron oxides were commercial products: Ni, Fe Deionized or Millipore water and analytical grade reagents were used in a reactor using the procedure described by Results from the present study with pure nickel under standard conditions without additives represented by curve A in Reasons for incomplete dissolution of pure nickel even in the absence of thiosulfate can be further examined by reviewing the results from electrochemical investigation ( Results from previous studies on the effect of metal composition on dissolution rates of flat alloy surfaces based on electrochemical studies plotted in The reported peak potentials of potentiodynamic polarisation curves or cyclic voltammograms of Fe, Co and Ni in NH The peak potentials also match with the reduction potentials of some oxides, di/trihydroxides, oxyhydroxides (MOOH) and mixed valent oxides (M However, the rates of oxidation of pure (> In the case of the Fe–Ni alloy, the decrease in rate occurs until N As for the reaction mechanism, the Ni(OH) The measured dissolution rates of the binary or ternary alloys Fe(99.5%)–Cu(0.5%), Fe(99%)–Co(1%) and Fe(69.5%)–Ni(30%)–Co(0.5%) lie on the curve for ferronickel in However, the presence of copper in the quaternary alloy Fe(78.5%)–Ni(20%)–Co(1%)–Cu(0.5%) has a significant effect, as the rate becomes equal to that of pure nickel even at a low N The dissolution of nickel from Fe–Ni(45%) alloy particles without pre-soaking as tested in this study and conditions listed in In addition to the mole fraction of nickel, the concentration of dissolved oxygen also affects the rate of leaching. Nickel dissolution is a first order reaction with respect to dissolved oxygen concentration and O In the case of the Fe–Ni(45%) alloy tested in the present study the leaching rate remains constant during the first hour, as shown by the linear increase in %Ni extraction with time in Cyclic voltammetry and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements in the presence of Co(III)/(II), Ni(II) and S A similar effect observed on iron leaching by S In S  Nickel dissolution from ferronickel is initially faster with Co(III)/O Regions I and II in Despite the faster initial rate, nickel leaching from pre-soaked Fe–Ni(45%) alloy after 2 The reductive acid leaching of limonitic laterites also follows a shrinking core model and the formation of Fe The iron dissolution peaks around 8–15% after 20 Although goethite and magnetite show a negative and retarding effect on nickel leaching from Fe–Ni(45%) in Either the passivation of Fe–Co–Ni alloys during roasting, or the adsorption of cobalt onto Fe(OH) The rates of leaching of pure nickel, ferronickel alloys and roasted calcines in typical Caron lixiviant system show similar behaviour with 70–90% Ni extracted depending on the nickel mole fraction of the feed. Measured rates of nickel dissolution from particles and from electrochemical tests are of the same order (~ Financial assistance and support from the
