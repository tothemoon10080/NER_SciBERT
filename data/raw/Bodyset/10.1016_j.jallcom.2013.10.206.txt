Spherical assemblies of Co doped ZnO comprised of numerous nanocrystals of size 10–15nm were prepared by refluxing their acetate precursors in diethylene glycol medium. The detailed structural analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal that Co ions are successfully incorporated into the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanostructure and do not appear as precipitates or secondary phases. These Co ions are uniformly distributed in the ZnO host lattice and exist in +2 oxidation state. Further, HRTEM analysis also confirmed the oriented attachment of nanocrystals as well as their defects structure. Raman spectra clearly indicate the incorporation of Co2+ ions into ZnO nanostructures at Zn2+ site (appearance of an additional Raman mode at 527cm−1) and the resulted defects and lattice disorder in host lattice (shifting, broadening and weakening of 2E2 (low) and E2 (high) phonon modes). These Co doped ZnO samples exhibit ferromagnetic like behavior at room temperature, presumably due to the presence of defects in host ZnO lattice.Diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) with Curie temperature above room temperature have been the subject of intense research due to their expected potential applications in future spintronic devices Herein, we report a novel process to fabricate impurity-free highly oriented Co doped ZnO three-dimensional spherical clustered assemblies with uniform distribution of Co Co doped ZnO clustered assemblies were prepared by refluxing of zinc acetate and cobalt acetate in diethylene glycol (DEG) medium as discussed elsewhere X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Philips powder diffractometer PW3040/60 with Cu Kα radiation. The crystallite size is estimated from the X-ray line broadening using the Scherrer calculator of X’Pert High Score Plus software. The actual percentage of cobalt present in the Co doped ZnO sample was estimated using the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) facility of Hitachi S-3400   To further understand the electronic structure of Co doped ZnO, XPS analysis was carried out. The evidence of dopant incorporation, induced defects and disorder in the ZnO host lattice can be inferred from Raman spectra. Wurtzite hexagonal-shaped ZnO belongs to the P6  Co doped ZnO spherical assemblies comprised of numerous nanocrystals of size 10–15
