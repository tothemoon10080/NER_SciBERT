Fault-seal analysis in sand-shale multilayers emphasises the role of shale smear without explicitly accounting for cataclasis. These processes produce low-permeability fault rock and are examined here for small displacement (0.001–70 m) normal faults displacing weakly lithified turbidites comprising ∼55–80% lithic grains. Late Miocene Mount Messenger Formation (MMF) turbidites from the North Island of New Zealand provide fault rock data over a range of scales from individual grains (∼0.1–350 μm) to the height of coastal cliffs (∼10–20 m). Fault rock and unfaulted source beds has been analysed using thin sections, SEM images, particle-size distribution (PSD) measurements and outcrops of faults mainly in cross section. Cataclasis associated with particle size and macroscopic porosity reduction of protolith sandstones commences at low fault shear strains (<1) and continues as fault displacement accrues. The relationship between particle-size reduction and displacement is non-linear with initial rapid cataclasis facilitated by disaggregation of weak lithic and altered feldspar grains along pre-existing grain defects (e.g., grain boundaries, fractures and altered cleavage planes). Silt smear, by contrast, is not accompanied by significant particle-size reduction and appears to have been achieved by intergrain slip and micro-faulting. Despite the occurrence of silt smear, cataclasis can produce a significant proportion (>50%) of the total fault-rock in sand-silt multilayers. The resulting fault-rock thickness varies by up to three orders of magnitude for a given fault displacement and at short distances (2–10 m) along individual faults. Variations in fault-rock thickness and associated cataclasis have the potential to modify the hydraulic properties of faults and may need to be accounted for in fault-seal analysis.The grain sizes and permeabilities of fault rocks within siliciclastic sequences are generally lower than sandstones in the adjacent wall rock. The study of these fine-grained fault rocks is typically motivated by a desire to understand better fault evolution ( In the brittle upper crust cataclasis has long been considered critical for the generation of silt- and clay-size particles in fault rock (e.g., Smearing typically forms where mudstones are sheared into fault zones in a ductile fashion producing a range of smear geometries from classical tapering shear-zone forms to highly irregular thicknesses independent of distance to the source bed (e.g., Nevertheless, in mixed clastic sequences the porosity and permeability properties of faults with displacements greater than bed thicknesses are likely to be determined by the properties of fault rock generated by both cataclasic and smearing mechanisms. The relative contributions of cataclasis and smear for the generation of fine-grained fault rock is extremely difficult to evaluate. Similarly, how the importance of these processes varies over fault surfaces and with increasing displacement, and to what extent this variability results in changes of fault-rock thickness and hydraulic properties remains unresolved. In this paper we attempt to evaluate the relative contributions of cataclastic and smearing processes to the reduction in grain size in a mixed sequence of siltstones and sandstones. Grain-size distributions within cataclastic fault rocks and the factors that control them have been extensively studied for granitic rocks and sandstones (e.g., In this paper we investigate the relative importance of cataclasis and smearing in the production of low-permeability fault-rock along small normal faults with 0.001–70 m vertical displacements in weakly lithified Late Miocene turbidites of the Mount Messenger Formation (MMF) in New Zealand ( Fault-rocks and their distribution have been examined for small normal faults (0.001–70 m vertical displacement; e.g., The importance of cataclasis for fault rock generation and the mechanics of grain destruction are dependent on the texture and composition of the protolith (e.g., Faults typically comprise zones that accommodate heterogeneous shear strains ( The dimensions, evolution and mechanical processes underlying fault-rock formation have been studied here using a combination of techniques including; field mapping, analysis of thin sections (e.g., PSD measurements have been widely used in the literature to estimate the contribution of cataclastic processes to the production of fault rock ( Laser particle size analysers employ the laser diffraction method and for this study generate PSD measurements for grain diameters from 0.063 to 840 μm. Each sample was analysed at least three times with the average presented here ( Fault rock in the MMF is primarily generated by cataclasis and silt smear (ductile flow) of sandstone and siltstone protoliths, respectively ( Cataclasis has been widely observed within fault zones of the MMF ( PSD measurements for fault rock demonstrate decreases in particle size compared to known ( PSD data support the suggestion that some fault gouges which, in hand specimen do not appear to contain deformation bands and are superficially similar in colour and texture to siltstone beds, may also have formed by cataclasis of sandstone protoliths. For the fault gouges in The observed changes in PSD between protolith and sheared sandstones are consistent with cataclasis seen in SEM and thin section ( Smear of fine-grained beds reflects ductile deformation (at outcrop scale) of silt- and clay-rich beds and may be achieved by intergranular sliding and/or micro-faulting without significant cataclasis ( Globally previous studies have shown that shale smears can be thicker closer to the source bed, increase in thickness with source-bed thickness and decrease in thickness with rising total displacement ( The PSD of siltstone source beds and associated silt smears indicate that significant grain-size reduction and cataclasis does not occur within silt smears in the MMF. Comparison of the grain sizes for silt smears and their undeformed protolith beds in the MMF suggests that, where the source beds and smears can be unambiguously correlated, the two populations are similar (e.g., compare samples 2, 3, 5 & 13 in PSD data also indicate that some fault gouges derived from an undetermined protolith may have formed by silt smearing. In the brittle crust fault zones are typically inferred to form as part of a strain weakening and slip localisation process ( Global data suggest that fault-rock thickness and fault-zone complexity are strongly controlled by the locations of irregularities on a fault surface. From the onset of slip, strains are more distributed at irregularities than on the intervening relatively straight segments and, as a result, fault rock development (i.e. thickness and PSD) is likely to vary over an individual fault surface ( Shearing and breakup of irregularities may in part account for the thickening of fault rock with increasing displacement which can be observed in displacement-fault rock thickness plots ( The mechanism by which protolith material is converted to fault rock in the MMF is strongly dependent on its original grain size. Sandstones initially deform mainly by cataclasis with intergranular sliding inferred to become increasingly important as the clay- and silt-sized fraction rises, while siltstones mainly accommodate shear by intergranular sliding from the onset of faulting ( A transition from cataclasis to intergranular sliding is indicated by the stability of PSDs for finer grain size fault rocks produced by silt smear. As cataclasis is in large part achieved by fragmentation of sand-sized particles, the transition can be related to the proportion of sand-sized particles in the fault rock. Sheared siltstone beds that are inferred to have primarily deformed by intergranular sliding contain ∼10–30% sand-sized particles (average ∼15%), which is similar to undeformed siltstones ( Techniques for estimating fault-seal potential, including juxtaposition analysis ( This view is supported by existing permeability data for cataclastic fault rocks and sandstones in the MMF which show permeability reductions that can exceed 4 orders of magnitude (e.g., cataclastic fault rocks ≤0.03 mD versus mainly ≥30 mD for sandstones: Cataclasis and silt smear are both observed on small normal faults along the eastern margin of the Taranaki Basin. Cataclasis primarily occurs in sandstone protoliths resulting in disaggregation of sand-sized grains (mode ∼90–115 μm) and production of silt (mode ∼5–25 μm) without changes in the total spread of the grain size population. Intense cataclasis starts at very low shear strains of <2 (fault displacements ∼1.5 mm) and is facilitated by the presence of weak lithics and altered feldspar grains which break up easily. By contrast, the presence of clay and silt-sized particles inhibits fragmentation. Therefore, smear of siltstone beds does not produce significant grain-size reduction and is primarily achieved by intergrain slip and micro-faulting. Despite the occurrence of silt smear, cataclasis can account for >50% of the total fault-rock thickness in sand-silt multilayers. Cataclasis, which is often not explicitly accounted for in fault-seal analysis, has the potential to modify fluid flow near and across faults and may need to be accounted for in fault seal analysis.
