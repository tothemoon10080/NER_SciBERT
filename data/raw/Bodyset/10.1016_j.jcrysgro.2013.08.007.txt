Ultrafine theta-Al2O3 (θ-Al2O3) nanowires with average diameters of sub-10nm and lengths up to several micrometers have been successfully synthesized via a novel two-stage method. With temperature gradually elevated, θ-Al2O3 was generated from the slow transformation of gamma-phase Al2O3 (γ-Al2O3), and its ultrafine nanowire structure was formed from the recrystallization of γ-Al2O3 nanowire. By means of nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77K and the multipoint Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, the specific surface area of the ultrafine θ-Al2O3 nanowires is found to be up to~120m2/g. With the high surface area, the material displays excellent gas absorption ability. Hydrogen absorption capacities could be measured to be~5.57wt% at 77K (liquid nitrogen), 1.51wt% at 298K (room temperature) and 0.81wt% at 557K, when a pressure of 30atm (~3MPa) is applied. The crystal or chemical nature of metastable θ-Al2O3 phase may play a vital role in the observed excellent gas storage capacity.Theoretical and experimental interests in Currently, Herein, we report on the first synthesis of high specific surface ultrafine The The size and morphology of the as-synthesized product were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips Tecnai F20). The pre-treatment of TEM samples included an alcohol-dispersed ultrasonic process by using a relatively small fraction of sample. The crystal structure of the products was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Thermal gravimetric analysis-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) of the precursor was carried out using a SDT-Q600. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm at 77  The DTA and TG curves of the precursor are shown in Further SEM and TEM measurements reveal the morphologic details of the as-prepared samples ( Based upon DTA/TG and XRD analyses, the formation process of The BET of the Hydrogen absorption isotherms of the In summary, ultrafine This work was supported by the
