Titanaugite particles are detrimental to the flotation of fine ilmenite. In this work, the surface adsorption thermodynamic, kinetic properties and the adsorption mechanism of sodium oleate on ilmenite and titanaugite surfaces were investigated by measuring surface wettability, lipophilic hydrophilic ratio, surface free energy, adsorption rate, adsorption density and adsorption thickness. The hydrophilicity of the minerals were determined by the contact angle, lipophilic hydrophilic ratio,

                      value. The surface wettability results showed that the hydrophilicity of the minerals decreased following: −20 μm titanaugite >−20 μm ilmenite >−38 + 20 μm ilmenite >− 74 + 38 μm ilmenite. The adsorption process can be represented with Langmuir isotherm and a pseudo second-order kinetic model. Calculation of the adsorption thermodynamic parameters confirmed that the adsorption of sodium oleate on ilmenite surfaces is spontaneous, feasible, and endothermic. And it was alsoconfirmed that sodium oleate was adsorbed onto ilmenite due to both physical and chemical adsorption. In situ AFM imaging visually demonstrated that the adsorption density and thickness of the sodium oleate adsorbed onto titanaugite were lower than those of sodium oleate on ilmenite, which was consistent with the adsorption thermodynamic parameters. It was further confirmed that the electrostatic interaction, chemisorption, hydrogen-bonding adsorption and specific hydrogen-bonding adsorption were the main mechanisms for the sodium oleate adsorbed onto ilmenite, as the zeta potential and XPS spectra analyses.Flotation is a separation technique that has been widely employed in the mineral industry to recover valuable fine mineral particles Surface wettability is a critical thermodynamic parameter for understanding the interactions that occur during mineral flotation Adsorption is one of the most important interfacial phenomena In this work, the surface wettability, adsorption thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the sodium oleate surfactant adsorbed onto ilmenite and titanaugite were investigated. The contact angle, lipophilic hydrophilic ratio, surface free energy, adsorption thermodynamics, adsorption morphology, and adsorption mechanism were revealed using WCR method, zeta potential measurements, in situ atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results of the research are expected to provide the detailed description of the adsorption of sodium oleate onto ilmenite and titanaugite surfaces. Single mineral samples of ilmenite and titanaugite were obtained from Panzhihua, Sichuan Province. The mineral samples were ground with a ball mill and then screened into three size particles fractions using a Tyler standard screen and cyclone particle size analyzer, Deionized water (pH: 5.6 ± 0.1, resistivity: 18.2 MΩ·cm, surface tension: 72.8 mN·m All WCR measurements were carried out in a clean room at a strictly maintained temperature of 293 ± 0.5 K using the contact angle module of a Kruss Tensiometer K100. A fixed quality of the mineral powder was weighed and packed into a Washburn tube. A filter paper was placed between the bottom of the tube and the mineral powder to support the sealed powder sample. The Washburn tube was then securely fixed on the Tensiometer K100. The Tensiometer K100 automatically started to detect the weight of liquid taken up by the capillarity of the powder as a function of time after 250 s, and the linear part of the Washburn’s equation is based on the principle of capillary rise, and has been widely employed to ascertain the relative contact angle and surface free energy of powdered minerals. Washburn’s equation is based on Poiseuille’s law as follows The lipophilic hydrophilic ratio ( Young's equation gives the following relationship: According to VCG theory, The total surface free energy of liquids is calculated as follows: The interfacial free energy between solid and liquid is presented in the following expression: By substituting Eqs. The surface properties of the minerals are characterized by contact angle measurements using three probe liquids, two of which have different acid and base parameters, to determine the surface tension. The zeta potential values of the sample at different pH (NaOH/H The adsorption processes and the distribution of adsorption molecules between the liquid phase and the solid phase could be obtained from equilibrium studies In mineral processing, XPS is often conducted to confirm the chemical elemental composition and the relative content of mineral surfaces. The XPS spectra of the mineral samples were recorded using an AXIS Supra (Shimadzu, Japan) instrument. The samples were prepared for XPS measurements using a procedure consistent with the adsorption process. 30 mg/L of sodium oleate solution with pH value 5.5 was added to modify the ilmenite suspension liquid, and the conditioned ilmenite particles were then separated from the suspension liquid via centrifugation. The obtained solid samples were rinsed three times using ultrapure water with the same pH value, and the solid samples were dried under a vacuum for 48 h. All binding energies were calibrated against the neutral C 1s peak of adventitious carbon (284.8 eV). A single crystal silicon probe with an imaging piezoceramic was used at a resonance frequency of 330 KHz. The elastic coefficient of the probe was 42 N/m. The AFM images were acquired over a scanning range of 2 μm × 2 μm and analyzed by the JPK data processing program. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) was adopted to analyze the −20 µm ilmenite and −20 µm titanaugite particles, to reveal the adsorption morphology. The experiment was proceeded in two steps. Firstly, bare mineral samples with flat surfaces were prepared. Epoxy resin and curing agent were added to the samples in an 8:1 ratio. After the epoxy resin had fully cured, a polishing and burnishing machine was used to polish the mineral surfaces to smoothness, and diamond suspensions with different particle sizes (6 μm, 3 μm, 1 μm, and 0.05 μm) were applied to glaze the surface. Finally, anhydrous ethanol and acetone were used to clean the mineral surfaces. In the second step, the fresh ilmenite and titanaugite samples were fixed in a watch-glass using double-faced adhesive tape, and AFM was used to scan their morphology. Subsequently, 30 mg/L of sodium oleate solution with a pH value of 5.5 was added to the watch-glass for 5 min, ensuring that the solution completely covered the mineral samples. The sodium oleate solution was then gently removed by suction with a syringe. Deionized water was added to the watch-glass to remove residual reagents on the sample surface, and then removed by syringe. Three cycles of rinsing with deionized water and the drying of the mineral samples with high-purity nitrogen were necessary. Finally, the adsorption features of sodium oleate on minerals were measured in situ. As is reported The The surface free energy of solid is related to the contact angles of the solid and the surface tension of liquids. By substituting the data from Mineral surfaces were considered as low energy surfaces because the For the four mineral samples, the base (electron donor) term of In order to investigate the adsorption kinetic of sodium oleate onto ilmenite and titanaugite, the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order were applied for fitting the obtained experimental data Adsorption equilibrium were investigated to evaluate the best-fitting isotherm models for explaining the adsorption of sodium oleate onto the ilmenite and titanaugite. The values and constants of Henry The adsorption thermodynamics reflect the effects of energy in the adsorption process, and can be used to predict whether an adsorption process will take place under certain conditions  where R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), The AFM imaging technology can be applied to explore the changes in the morphology caused by adsorption visually. The adsorption of sodium oleate (30 mg/L, pH 5.5) onto the surface of ilmenite and titanaugite was observed using the quantitative imaging mode of AFM imaging. The 2D and 3D height images of pure ilmenite and titanaugite (scan range: 2.0 μm × 2.0 μm) are presented in As As is stated in the above section, both physical adsorption and chemical adsorption existed in the adsorption process of sodium oleate on ilmenite surface, based on which the probable adsorption mechanisms of electrostatic adsorption, chemisorption, hydrogen-bonding adsorption and specific hydrogen-bonding adsorption are put forward. As shown in In ilmenite/sodium oleate solution, Fe–OL (or Ti–OL) could generate via the interaction between Fe/Ti ions and sodium oleate. In order to determine the chemisorption mechanism of sodium oleate onto the ilmenite surface, the XPS spectra of ilmenite before and after treated by sodium oleate were acquired, and the results are summarized in The hydrogen-bond is one of the most common adsorption phenomena in nature With the pH decreases, the fraction of deprotonated −COO Both of the hydroxyl complexes ( The surface wettability of ilmenite and titanaugite was explored using the WCR method. The hydrophilicity of the minerals decreased following: −20 μm titanaugite >− 20 μm ilmenite >− 38 + 20 μm ilmenite >− 74 + 38 μm ilmenite with respect to the contact angle, lipophilic hydrophilic ratio, In situ AFM imaging visually demonstrated that the adsorption thickness of sodium oleate on ilmenite and titanaugite increased after adsorption. 3D images showed that the adsorption thicknesses increased from 25 nm to 200 nm for ilmenite and from 30 nm to 80 nm for titanaugite. The adsorption density and thickness of sodium oleate on ilmenite were higher than those on titanaugite, which indicates that selective adsorption of sodium oleate on the ilmenite is stronger than that of titanaugite. Conventional kinetic models were applied and it was seen that pseudo-second-order equation is suitable to fit the experimental data. Analysis of experimental equilibrium data shows that Langmuir is the best model for adsorption process of sodium oleate adsorbed onto the ilmenite and titanaugite respectively. The adsorption thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption of sodium oleate on ilmenite was endothermic and spontaneous, and occurred via both physical and chemical adsorption processes. The adsorption of sodium oleate on ilmenite was stronger than that on titanaugite. The main adsorption mechanisms of sodium oleate on ilmenite were electrostatic interaction, chemisorption, hydrogen-bonding adsorption and specific hydrogen-bonding adsorption. The results are useful to enhance the fundamental understanding of the adsorption details of sodium oleate on ilmenite, and can provide practical recommendations for selecting and compounding ilmenite collectors.
