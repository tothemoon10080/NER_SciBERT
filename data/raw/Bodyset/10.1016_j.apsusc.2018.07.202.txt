We propose a new, simple and effective strategy to enhance the electro-catalytic activity by regulating the valence states of the electro-catalyst. The proportion of Ni3+/Ni2+ on the ammonium nickel phosphate/nickel foam electrode surface was increased after H2O2 solution treatment. The kinetic analysis results showed catalytic rate constants (Kcat) of Ni3+-rich surface electrode (4.028 × 106 cm3·mol−1·s−1) is bigger than the original electrode (4.928 × 105 cm3·mol−1·s−1), suggesting higher electro-catalytic activity of Ni3+-rich surface electrode. Ni3+-rich surface electrode shows an ultra high sensitivity (11,361 µA·mM−1·cm−2) in the range of 0.001–1 mM, which is much higher than the original electrode in the same linear range. And the sensitivity of 3579.9 µA·mM−1·cm−2 of Ni3+-rich surface electrode in the range of 2–4 mM is also enhanced compared with the original electrode.In recent years, glucose sensors with non-enzymatic electrodes have attracted grown considerably interest due to the increase of diabetes and growing demand for food industry Valence states regulation is an important strategy to enhance electrical properties In this work, we propose a new, simple and effective strategy to enhance the electro-catalytic activity by regulating the valence states of the electro-catalytic cycle. Based on our previous work Ammonium nickel phosphate/nickel foam electrodes were synthesized according to our previous work For the next step, the electrodes were put into a beaker with 20 mL of 5% H The crystal phase of the as-prepared products was characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (DX-2700 diffractometer) using a Cu K The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes was evaluated on a Gamry Interface 1000T electrochemical work station. A conventional three electrode configuration was used with a counter electrode of Pt foil and the reference electrode of Ag/AgCl.
