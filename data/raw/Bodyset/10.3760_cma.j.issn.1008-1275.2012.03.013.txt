Simultaneous isolated bilateral patellar fractures are very rare injuries and most often associated with systemic disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, stress fracture and kidney failure. Isolated bilateral traumatic fracture of patella following an unusual mode of injury is seldomly reported in the literature. We reported such a case following a road traffic accident without any associated injuries or co-morbid condition. The patella on the right side had transverse open fracture which was fixed with two Kirschner wires following tension band principle, and that on the left side sustained upper pole comminution which was treated by partial patellectomy. The patient achieved good outcome: at 6 months he was able to squat and sit cross legged; at one year he obtained nearly normal muscle strength and full range of motion. We discussed the injury mechanism, management and rehabilitation in such a case and reviewed the available literature regarding such a presentation.
