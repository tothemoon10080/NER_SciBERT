Electric arc furnace steel slag (EAF-slag) and basic oxygen furnace steel slag (BOF-slag) were used as filter substrate in horizontal subsurface flow laboratory-scale filters designed to remove phosphorus (P) from a synthetic solution (∼10mg P/L). The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of various parameters, including slag type, slag size, and slag composition, on P removal performance. Also, a series of chemical and mineralogical analyses was performed to determine the mechanisms of P removal achieved by steel slag in the filters. Over a period of 52 weeks of filter operation, small-size EAF-slag (5–16mm) and small-size BOF-slag (6–12mm) removed 98% and >99% of the inlet total phosphorus (TP), whereas big-size EAF-slag (20–40mm) and big-size BOF-slag (20–50mm) removed 88% and 95% of the influent TP, respectively. The main mechanism of P removal was related to CaO dissolution from slag followed by Ca phosphate precipitation and accumulation of the precipitates into the filters. P removal performance improved with increasing the CaO-slag content and with decreasing slag size, most probably because the specific surface available for CaO dissolution was increased. Also, the experimental results suggested that small-size slag was more efficient than big-size slag for the self-filtration of P precipitates. Chemical and mineralogical analyses indicated that, after precipitation, Ca phosphates may crystallise into the most stable form of hydroxyapatite.Although phosphorus (P) represents an essential nutrient for biomass growth in several ecosystems, an excessive intake of P in water bodies such as rivers, lakes or lagoons, causes an abnormal growth of algae and aquatic plants resulting in the degradation of the water quality. Consequently, legislation on P rejects for municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is becoming stricter in Europe (European Union Directives 91/271/EEC and 2000/60/EC), and research on low cost techniques to upgrade P removal in WWTPs has gained a growing attention. Several international studies have demonstrated that the addition of separate filter units containing reactive materials with high affinities for P binding is a suitable technique to upgrade P removal in small WWTPs such as stabilisation ponds and constructed wetlands ( Among the materials tested, steel slag has shown a high affinity for P binding. This suggested an interesting potential market for its use as filter substrate to treat wastewater ( Many laboratory-scale studies have demonstrated that steel slag is a suitable reactive material for efficient P removal from wastewater (e.g. Within the framework of the European research project “SLASORB” (Slag as sorbent for P removal from wastewater, Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS)), our study aimed to evaluate the P removal performances of EAF-slag and BOF-slag produced in Europe and to determine their P removal mechanisms. A set of six laboratory-scale filters (42 or 84 The originality and importance of this paper are highlighted by the following two points: A comparative study on P removal performance. All the filters were operated according to the same experimental condition: room temperature, influent synthetic P solution of about 10 An in-depth critical investigation of the P removal mechanisms. Various chemical and mineralogical analyses, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and wet chemical extractions were employed to investigate the mechanisms of P removal achieved by steel slag in the filters. Indeed, the knowledge and understanding of the reactions leading to P removal on steel slag is of great importance in order to determine the environmental impact and improve the filter system design. Two types of steel slag were tested in this study: (i) EAF-slag from the production site of Esch Belval (Luxemburg) and (ii) BOF-slag from the production site of Fos-sur-Mer (France). These slag samples were selected by comparative batch experiments which were performed to determine the P retention capacities of several samples of slag produced in Europe ( Six filters were designed in two different sizes: (i) four small-size filters (about 42 The design of the filters was adapted from a previous study that investigated the effect of different sizes of slag on the hydraulic performances ( Also, the ratio of width of the filter to size of slag was always >10, in order to improve hydraulic performances and limit wall effects ( During the full period of operation, the filters were continuously fed with a synthetic P solution of about 10 Water samples (about 100 A series of chemical and mineralogical analyses was carried out to investigate the changes in composition of slag before and after 52 weeks of filter operation. The slag of the filters “EAF-small XRF analyses were performed to determine the semi-quantitative chemical composition, whereas SEM observations and EDX analyses were performed to examine the chemical surface of slag before and after 52 weeks of filter operation. The grains of slag (size <10 XRD analyses were performed to investigate the mineralogical composition of the precipitates covering the surface of slag after 52 weeks of filter operation. The samples of slag were shaken manually on a grinder and the fraction <1 Leaching experiments ( The sequential extraction procedure of Bicarbonate extractable P fraction was extracted in 200 Hydroxide extractable P fraction was extracted in 200 Diluted HCl extractable P fraction was extracted in 200 Highly concentrated HCl extractable P fraction was extracted in 50 The extractions (i), (ii) and (iii) were conducted with a ratio of extracting solution to slag of 10 L/kg (adapted from The pH values and conductivity of the water samples were measured using a model C5010 conductivimeter (Consort bvba, Turnhout, Belgium). TP and PO The pH values and the TP, PO The experimental results indicated that steel slag has a clear tendency to produce high pH and Ca  The experimental results of filters EAF-small The results of this study were compared to those of previous laboratory-scale experiments that tested P removal performances of steel slag under controlled operating conditions ( As shown in According to the studies published in the literature, the saturated flow seemed to be the best condition to reduce the dissolution of atmospheric CO However, as shown in It is known from the literature that several Ca phosphates may be formed depending on the pH values, Ca The chemical composition of slag before and after 52 weeks of operation of the filters (EAF-small The results of SEM observations and EDX analyses of the surfaces of slag before and after 52 weeks of operation of the filters (EAF-small  Leaching experiments confirmed that steel slag has a strong tendency to produce high pH, conductivity and Ca leachates as the results of CaO dissolution from slag (  As shown in The TP retention capacity of the filter material is usually considered as a parameter to estimate the longevity of an active filter system ( The TP retention levels reported in this study were compared to those of previous laboratory-scale experiments (  This study showed that EAF and BOF steel slag produced in Europe are suitable materials to be used as substrate in filters designed to remove P from the effluent of small WWTPs, such as stabilisation ponds and constructed wetlands. The influence of slag type, slag size and slag composition on P removal performance was studied in a set of six laboratory-scale filters operated according to the same experimental conditions. This enabled the results of the different filters to be compared each other. P removal predominantly occurred via three consecutive reactive phases: first, CaO dissolution from slag, providing Ca then, Ca phosphate precipitation under basic aqueous conditions; finally, filtration and accumulation of the Ca phosphate precipitates into the filters. Over a period of 52 weeks of operation, small-size EAF-slag (5–16 The results indicated that P removal performance improved with increasing the content of CaO in slag and with decreasing the slag size, most probably because the specific surface available for CaO dissolution was increased. Also, small-size slag was more efficient than big-size slag for the self-filtration and accumulation of P precipitates into the filters. However, the use of slag-size larger than 5 This research was funded by the
