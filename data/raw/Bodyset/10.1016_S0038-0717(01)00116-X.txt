Plant response to water deficit when grown in a mixed-culture may differ markedly from that observed when the same plant is studied individually or in a monoculture. This study was conducted to determine the combined effects of soil water deficit and above and below ground plant competition on 14C assimilate partitioning in the plant-soil system of white clover and rye-grass. Plants were grown: (1) individually; (2) in shoot competition); or (3) in shoot+root competition and either well-watered (0.0MPa) or at a moderate (−0.5MPa) soil water deficit in specially designed crates and pulse-labelled in an assimilation chamber with 14CO2. At a moderate soil water deficit in the shoot+root competition treatment compared to the shoot competition treatment: (1) a significant increase was observed in the shoot dry matter yields of both white clover (1.80 vs. 1.47g plant−1) and rye-grass (4.96 vs. 2.71g plant−1); (2) one-third more radioactive 14C was recovered in the plant-soil system (704 vs. 528kBq); and (3) a three times higher percent of net assimilated radioactive 14C was recovered in the soil compartment. At a moderate soil water deficit one-fourth (24.7%) of the total radioactive 14C in the plant-soil system of white clover and ryegrass plants grown in the shoot+root competition was recovered in the soil compartment. Increased total N recovered in harvested tissue of both white clover and ryegrass plants grown in shoot+root competition at a moderate soil water deficit indicated that N uptake by plants increased due to either: (1) increases in white clover atmospheric N fixation (due to the removal of soil N by the ryegrass root system in direct contact with the white clover root system which stimulated atmospheric N fixation by white clover); or (2) the indirect effects of elevated soil C on mineralization processes (due to stimulation of soil microbia).White clover is the most important forage legume in temperate climate zones and it grows naturally in many different plant communities ranging from extensively grazed pastures in the alpine zone to intensively managed meadows in lower altitudes ( Water is essential for plant life and metabolism, and any limitation in its availability affects almost all plant functions, including the assimilation and partitioning of carbon ( Therefore, the majority of pasture plant studies looking at plant response to stress, have considered a group of plants as one unit. It is known that the responses of plants (or for that matter, a group of plants) to stresses such as those experienced under field conditions, may differ markedly from those observed as a result of a single-factor stress on a plant grown individually or in monoculture ( In this study, an experimental design was developed to determine the combined effects of a moderate soil water deficit and below and above ground interspecific plant competition on the A greenhouse experiment was conducted with white clover ( The experimental design has previously been described by For the shoot competition treatment, 20 PVC tubes (10 white clover and 10 ryegrass plants) identical in nature to those containing plants grown individually, were placed in a 5 by 4 grid in an alternating pattern in crates (30×24×30 In the shoot+root competition treatment, white clover and ryegrass were grown in two rectangular plastic PVC boxes constructed so as to fit one within the other ( Soil of all plants was maintained at field capacity until day 50 (July 9) at which time the moderate soil water deficit treatment was allowed to develop gradually by the progressive withdrawal of water. For well-watered plants, the soil was maintained at field capacity throughout the experiment. Previous experiments ( At day 19 post-seeding a hollow plastic tube (1.8 Two experimental replications (due to space limitations in the labelling chamber) were prepared, labelled and harvested between 3 and 5 September and two experimental replications between 6 and 8 September. In total 112 plants (56 white clover and 56 ryegrass) which consisted of four replicates of each treatment, were placed in an assimilation chamber for labelling where temperature (27/17°C day/night), light (330 PAR; 15 Labelling was performed as described by At harvest, all plant samples were separated into above and below ground material, immediately dipped in liquid N, stored at −30°C until freeze drying, weighing and further analysis. The harvest of the shoot and shoot+root competition treatments necessitated the careful separation of the above ground canopy, while the shoot+root competition treatment further required the careful manual separation of the below ground plant parts. The above ground plant of white clover was separated into leaf lamina, petiole, stolon and flower, and that of ryegrass into leaf and sheath. Below ground plant parts of both white clover and ryegrass were carefully hand-separated from the soil. Soil still adhering to the roots after careful separation from the soil was removed with distilled water. This wash water was collected, freeze-dried and added to the soil compartment for determination of Soil was dried for 48 To determine rhizosphere CO Net fixed The effects of treatment were obtained from analysis of variance. Mean separations, and interaction effects were performed by a LSD procedure where the Plant competition and soil water deficit decreased the shoot dry matter yields of both white clover and ryegrass ( For both the total amount of radioactivity recovered (kBq) (%TRR) in the plant-soil system and the percent of net assimilated The N concentration in plant tissue was not affected by soil water deficit or plant competition treatment ( The decreased dry matter yield due to an increase in soil water deficit observed in this study for both white clover and ryegrass has been well documented ( Our findings that between 17.3 and 43.8% of recent assimilate in the plant-soil system was partitioned below ground are similar to ranges that report between 20 and 50% ( In our experimental conditions, at a moderate soil water deficit one-fourth of net assimilated The release of large amounts of Our results indicate that the combination of root competition between white clover and ryegrass combined with a moderate soil water deficit influenced the large release of recently assimilated Organic C release from roots is also influenced by plant species and developmental stage ( The activity of the microbial biomass influences nutrient cycling and soil organic matter decomposition. The results of this study are in line with the assumption that soil-N mineralization in the root zone is influenced by the amount of C available for microorganisms below ground ( In our study the %TRR lost to rhizosphere respiration (roots+soil) ranged from 6.1 to 18.2% and was lowest in plants grown in shoot competition and highest in plants grown in shoot+root competition. Our results clearly show a larger quantity of N harvested in the plant tissue of ryegrass in the shoot+root competition compared to the shoot competition treatment when well-watered or at a moderate soil water deficit (33 and 91%, respectively) ( The increased N uptake by ryegrass in shoot+root competition compared to the shoot competition treatment could be explained by observations that clover is a weak competitor for soil N when grown in clover–ryegrass mixtures ( The more extensive root system for ryegrass, which helps explain the observed increases in N absorption by ryegrass, may also help to explain the benefit of the shoot+root competition treatment on white clover dry matter yield. White clover, as with all legumes is known to preferentially use soil N before fixing N atmospherically but is able to rapidly switch (within a few days) between using inorganic N when available to atmospherically fixing its own N when inorganic sources are depleted ( To our knowledge this is one of the first studies to provide quantitative information on the allocation patterns of recently assimilated C in a plant-soil system involving white clover and ryegrass grown in association. The underlying reasons for the positive effect of the addition of root competition to shoot competition on dry matter yields herein observed are most probably due to changes in soil availability and quantity of N and perhaps other minerals. In shoot+root competition, white clover either increased its atmospheric N fixation capacity and/or the increased C allocated to the soil increased the soil available N as well as other minerals which positively affected the dry matter growth of both ryegrass and white clover. Under similar conditions, further studies are needed to clarify N fixation, soil mineralization rates and most importantly the possible transfer of minerals and nutrients between plants grown in association.
