Nanometre sized metals and metal oxides have evoked a lot of interest due to their unusual physical characteristics which differ strongly from their conventional coarser counterparts in several aspects. Great attention has been devoted till now to the preparation and characterisation of ferromagnetic metallic Fe, Co, Ni and ferrimagnetic γ-Fe An intermediate ferric oxide hydroxide (FeOOH) was initially prepared by melting 12 g of stearic acid in a beaker with addition of 20 g ferric nitrate [Fe(NO The chemical and compositional characteristics of the composite powder precipitates were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. The peaks at 2850 and 2919.6 cm  The XRD pattern of the original as-prepared composite powder sample along with the powder samples heat treated isothermally at 300°C, 400°C and 500°C for 1h are shown in A pattern decomposition procedure using a pseudo-Voigt profile shape function  The magnetic hysteresis loop for the samples heat treated at 300°C, 400°C and 500°C are nearly identical and overlapping. The representative hysteresis loop for the sample heat treated at 300°C is shown in The conclusions drawn from the present investigation are summarised below. Feasibility of preparing α-Fe
