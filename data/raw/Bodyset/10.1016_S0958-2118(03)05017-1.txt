The extraction and separation of nickel and cobalt using electrostatic pseudo liquid membrane technology is the subject of this article. An electrostatic pseudo liquid membrane reactor was constructed and extraction tests were undertaken to determine the effects of various experimental variables on the extraction and separation of nickel and cobalt. At optimum conditions, devised as a result of this investigation, a nickel/cobalt ratio of 1000 in the raffinate from a synthetic feed solution containing 10â€ˆ000 ppm nickel and 1000 ppm cobalt was achieved. Separation of nickel and cobalt from a pregnant leach solution was achieved in two stages.
