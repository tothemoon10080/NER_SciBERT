Abstract
                  The structure of living bone changes continuously due to the processes of bone remodeling and mineralization. This paper describes computational work, which addresses structural changes on two different length scales: on the millimeter length scale changes in the network-like architecture of so-called trabecular bone, and on the submillimeter scale changes in the heterogeneity of the bone material. The mathematical background of the models is described in detail, highlighting the model assumptions. A central question of the presented simulations is how the processes are controlled, e.g., by mechanical strains. The models are designed in such a way that the control part is not experimentally accessible, but the result of the simulations can be compared with experimental data.
