This chapter presents a Simulink model for metal web. This model may be found on the provided CD ROM under the directory “SIMULINK.” Copy the files into the mentioned directory in the “Readme.doc” file. This document also provides hints how to run some of the pre-defined scenarios as do various text boxes on the different interfaces of the software. The model describes and simulates an extremely complex system and therefore inaccuracies could occur. The software can be installed and first simulations can be run by the following procedure, which can also be found in the latest Readme.doc file in the MATLAB directory of the CD ROM. The step involves installing Matlab and Simulink (Matlab Version 6.1) and copying the model files into the “work” sub-directory of the “MATLAB6pl” directory. If another directory is used, users should use the menu item “File/ Set Path” to include the directory in the Matlab search path.
