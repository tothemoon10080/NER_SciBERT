Osteomalacia is a disorder of decreased mineralization of newly formed osteoid at sites of bone turnover, whereas rickets is a disorder of defective mineralization of cartilage in the epiphyseal growth plates of children. Several different disorders cause osteomalacia via mechanisms that result in hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or direct inhibition of the mineralization process. It may be asymptomatic and present radiologically as osteopenia or produce characteristic symptoms (diffuse bone and joint pain, muscle weakness, and difficulty walking) and present radiologically as pseudofractures. Laboratory abnormalities are largely dependent upon the cause of the osteomalacia.
